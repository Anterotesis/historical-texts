            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KING.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not my practice to plead any thing for your Majesty with zeal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I find it a matter of some importance; and my self likewise convinced that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer my own Arguments: By this rule, when I first saw the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s Book, I took some pains to persuade my self, that it contain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prejudicial to that right of precedency, which is due to your Royal Race, as the most
<pb facs="tcp:97803:3"/>
Ancient Monarchy which we know. But finding that there was no way to secure this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the Royal Family, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those consequences which necessarily arose from his Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I thought it my duty, at that time, to answer his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Book, as I do now Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s: especially, since they, in overturning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient settlement of the Royal Line in <hi>Scotland,</hi> destroy one of the great Foundations, whereby your Majesty's Grandfather, your Father, and your Last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have farther engag'd, and encourag'd the Loyalty of this your. Ancient Kingdom: Wherefore, Sir, these Reverend Divines will now, I hope, hold me excus'd, in regard that I pleaded first for them, with my
<pb facs="tcp:97803:3"/>
self, before I pleaded against them, for your Majesty: And if I could have found any man to have satisfied me, as to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences arising to the Crown in these Points, I had never prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Book in defence of the Royal Family, and of my Native Country. But, now humbly to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy your Majesty as to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousness of these Positions (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven supposing the Authours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of any ill design, as I am apt to think they are) and to convince them, how impartial I am upon any National Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; I beg leave to mind your Sacred Majesty, that some of our Own Historians having erred with as little ill design as they, touching the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of King <hi>Robert the Second;</hi> An Argument was
<pb facs="tcp:97803:4"/>
drawn from it, in favour of Bastards, and was much boasted of by the Enemies of the true Royal Line, and thereupon, I did, to the satisfaction of all indifferent men, refute our own Historians in that Point, as, I hope, I do now these Gentlemen in the Points controverted. Scarce any thing, Sir, can be thought inconsiderable, wherein a Crown is concern'd; or any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence so remote, but should be adverted to, in a Season when a long Rebellion has so far debaucht the Inclinations of too many of your Majesty's Subjects: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, nothing can be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, which Kings and Parliaments have judg'd so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for establishing the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Sovereign, and for confirming the Affection and
<pb facs="tcp:97803:4"/>
Loyalty of the Subject. And the Doctor's way of telling us, (in place of all other defence) that the <hi>Irish</hi> carry up the Royal Line <note place="margin">Praef. pag. 5.</note> within six degrees of <hi>Japhet,</hi> and so we shorten it, is not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enough in a Subject we ought to treat of with venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; since the Doctor, in the <note place="margin">Chap. 5. pag. 267. &amp; passim.</note> same Book, does but make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self merry with <hi>Offlahertie,</hi> the Assertor of this pretended Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>Sir, the agreement of Men of different Professions, almost at the same time, against the Royal Line, is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; some endeavouring by their Swords to cut it short at that end which lay next to them; Whilst others, by their Pens, have undertaken what dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from its glory, by lopping
<pb facs="tcp:97803:5"/>
off its remoter end; which I'm sure lay far out of their way: And I wish, that as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty has most successfully defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the one, by your Victorious Arms; so I may be so happy, in your prudent Reign, as to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute somewhat to disappoint the other, by what I have said in vindication of its Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Sir, The dutifull inclination I have to serve your Majesty, is, I confess, much heightned, by the Royal Obligations you have been pleased to lay upon our Nation; not onely in your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious protection of it, but in the glory you have added to that Royal Family, under which we have been so long happy. Your Majesty owes your success (next to that mercifull and miraculous providence which still attends

<pb facs="tcp:97803:6"/>
your Sacred Person and Family to your own wise Conduct, and to the great Iustice of your Cause; and not to your Councils or Servants, though it is your Majesty's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be as kind to them as if you did. And therefore, Sir, I am so far from valuing my self, upon any success I may, or can pretend to have, in pleading for your Majesty, either in Print, or at the Bar; that I shall still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe whatever advantages I may gain that way, to the Ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your Majesty's Cause, without arrogating any part of it to my own Skill or Eloquence.</p>
            <p>And now your Majesty having by your own Royal Influence, and the Prudence of your proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, overturn'd in so short a time all the Designs of a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, so deeply rooted; And by

<pb facs="tcp:97803:7"/>
your gentleness and clemency o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the obstinacy of your most inveterate Enemies, which is by far the more wonderfull Victory, thereby contracting into one year the glories of a long Reign: I can never have the vanity to imagine, your Majesty should yet any way need the mean assistence of,</p>

            <p>KING <hi>Iames,</hi> having in his <hi>Basilicon Doron, p.</hi> 201. foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Royal Prerogative upon King <hi>Fergus</hi>'s having made himself King and Lord, as well of the whole Lands, as of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and King <hi>Charles the First,</hi> having in a Letter to his Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 1641. founded that kindness, which he expected from the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon this; that they and

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97803:10"/>
their Predecessours were Sworn to maintain that Race of their Kings which he now represented, after 108 Descents: I leave it to all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men, if I, as King's <hi>Advocate,</hi> was not in duty oblig'd to answer a Book written by the Reverend and Learned Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> to prove that King <hi>Fergus,</hi> and 44 posteriour Kings were merely fabulous and idle inventions, since that assertion did not onely give the lye flatly to two of our most just and learned Kings, but overturned the foundations on which they had built the duty and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Subjects: And since pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency is one of the chief glories of the Crown, and that for this, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings, but Subjects fight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; how could I suffer this right and privilege of our Crown to be stoln from it by this Assertion; which did expresly subtract about 830 years from their antiquity; and, in consequence, lessen'd it by other 500? for we can produce no eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for these also, which may not be quarrel'd, if our Adversaries be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to reject what is here contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97803:10"/>
consequentially to which, <hi>Ubbo Emmius,</hi> magnified by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, has brought down their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third: and since nothing can be answered to these grounds, which I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, because Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has answered nothing to them, nor to the many reasons whereby I prov'd that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was no otherways concerned in this debate, than in as far as it was made a pretext for the more secure opposing our <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:</hi> I admire how Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> could adventure to continue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, especially after a whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of zealous <hi>Episcopal</hi> members, (and wherein there did sit 14 <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops)</hi> had unanimously, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them had read, and all had heard of the Bishop's Book, thought of new again, this Antiquity a solid and necessary <hi>Basis</hi> for their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
            <p>All that the Doctor answers, is, That our Kings are still ancient by the <hi>Irish</hi> Race, and so were Kings in another place: But he should have consider'd, that the Conquest of an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97803:11"/>
ancient Kingdom brings not to the Conquerour the antiquity of those he conquers; and our Kings succeed onely to the <hi>Irish</hi> by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings now controverted; and if he rejects ours for want of sufficient proofs, he must by a stronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence reject the proofs<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that can be produced for them, and he does so indeed with much scorn and gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; nor can he prove our Kings to be descended from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, if he allow not my proofs for <hi>Fergus</hi> the First; nay, which is more, I have proved the descent of <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, from the <hi>Irish,</hi> in their way, to be impossible, and all the Authours for this opinion to have contradicted one another: so that these two Loyal Divines toil much to prove their King to be, not onely not the most ancient, but one of the last Kings in Christendom; and are angry at me, though the King's <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> for daring to say, that this was a king of <hi>lese Majesty:</hi> by which I meant onely then, a lessening and wronging of the Majesty of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Kings, though I qualified this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97803:11"/>
Rhetorical expression, by adding, that I was sure the learned Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> had written this with a design rather to gratifie his Order, and Countrey, than Industriously to injure our Kings or us; and thus, in that matter, I have been gentler than my employment could well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or my present treatment does require. The Doctor being resolv'd to found every thing upon his own authority, knowing of little other help, tells us, That such as are to write in matters of Antiquity, should be extraordinarily vers'd in the best Authours, and should have a deep judgment, able to compare them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and this being the Preface of his own <hi>Origines Britannicae,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Praef.</hi> p. 3d.</note> may be, I am afraid, so constru'd, as if he would have us take his own word for his being a most learned and judicious Antiquary and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, for else he would not have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken this sublime and hard task; as also he tells us by the same art, that it was not <hi>every Advocate</hi> us'd to plead eloquently at the Bar, and who took citations at second-hand,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97803:12"/>
who could manage so weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; making it thus great Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in me to grapple with him in our own History, which, a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> and in the <hi>Latin</hi> Authours, which a <hi>Civilian</hi> should understand best of all others; for this debate requires little other learning beside these, and the reading of some few passages in others, which I have read in the Authours themselves with as great attention as the Doctor, without taking any of my Citations at second-hand, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them without considering first their full import, and remotest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, as several learned men here can prove, and will better and more convincingly appear from this debate it self; in which, beside the main positions, I hope to prove that either the Doctor has not understood so well, or at least has not used them so ingenuously as I have done.</p>
            <p>To reflect somewhat on me, and much on our Historians, without contributing any thing else to the present debate, save what may arise from the weakning our credibility, the Doctor asserts that I should have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97803:12"/>
in my answer to <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s <hi>Ius Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> deny'd that any respect was due to arguments brought from our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, to prove his <hi>Republican</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and I should have decry'd our Histories as fabulous, and invented merely to sustain those Principles.</p>
            <p>To which my Answer is, that I should be glad to find Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> as firm a friend to the power and interest of <hi>Kings,</hi> as I have been, though I think he gives no great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of it, in urging unnecessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s <hi>popular arguments,</hi> with the same exactness that those do who wish them to prevail; but none can-lessen the esteem of the Book here in question, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the famous University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> whose testimony I have subjoyn'd to this, and which I think the next to that of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>But to the point: I must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Readers, that <hi>Buchanan</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving urged against the absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Kings, that they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by a contract betwixt King <hi>Fergus</hi> and the <hi>People;</hi> my Answers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97803:13"/>
were, that first this Contract was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, and a History may be true, though some points be foisted in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on design, else few Histories are true; and this is Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as well as mine. (2.) That <hi>Fordon,</hi> whom they call our first Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, now extant, did expresly say, that <hi>Fergus constituit se regem;</hi> and this is clear also by the Book of <hi>Pasley,</hi> and I have clear'd that it could not be otherways; and if <hi>Boethius,</hi> has onely copied <hi>Fordon,</hi> and <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, Boethius</hi> (as our adversaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) they must be all regulated by <hi>Fordon</hi>'s Loyalty. (3.) That if <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> be urg'd against us; we must consider all he says, and if so, we will find that he derives the Monarchy from <hi>Gathelus,</hi> and he was King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contract, before <hi>Fergus,</hi> whose reign I assert not there, though I use it justly against such as object that Tradition as <hi>Argumentum ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem.</hi> (4.) These limitations being found inconsistent with the safety of King and People (as indeed all limitations are) they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd by express Laws in the Reign
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97803:13"/>
of King <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third, and by many and clear posteriour Statutes, founded upon sad<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>experience: And if such Limitations could be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, they could be abrogated, by express consent, and so our Kings are now freed from them. (5.) I clear that these expressions crept into our Histories by the humour which most Churchmen were in at that time, of having Kings depend on the Church, and so not <hi>absolute;</hi> in which our Historians are less guilty than those of other Nations, whom in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship I will not now name. And as to the instance brought from our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, to prove that the People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Kings; That concluded onely that the <hi>People</hi> were <hi>Rebels,</hi> but not that our <hi>Kings</hi> were <hi>Limited;</hi> but to have deny'd our Histories, in as far as they prov'd this, it concerned me to have denyed them till <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third's time, which had been very ridiculous, according to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s own opinion, and had justly defamed my Book amongst my own Countreymen. And how should we acknowledge this to be a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97803:14"/>
peculiar guilt in our Historians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we deny the truth of all <hi>English</hi> Histories since <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi>'s time: Because they mention Limitations extorted from their Kings; murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon many of them; and the right of Election to be stated in the people, as I have prov'd in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> unfit to be exposed to publick view for the same Reasons, that I think the Doctor should have supprest that undutifull dis-respectfull part of his debate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Historians who deserve much less to be taxt than his own Friends, for their ill founded concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the rights of Monarchs in those days; and to reform which, I have been somewhat more instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental than the Doctor. But such injurious and national Excursions as this, seem to prove to Conviction, more partiality than consideration in the Doctor, though otherways an honest and learned man in cold bloud. But to shew that he is not a dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed Critick, I must observe, that he ingenuously confesses that he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97803:14"/>
ow'd so much service to so worthy <note place="margin">Praef. <hi>pag.</hi> 72.</note> and excellent a Friend as the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph;</hi> for though he adds, that if my Arguments would hold good, they would also overthrow several things in his late Book, yet this is but a mere Pretext, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my Book relates any way to any part of that Subject which he treats upon, except in the second and fifth Chapters wherein he takes also my Book expressly to task in the same Points. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that if he, though a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thought himself concerned in honour to own his Friend, albeit an Aggressour; I as a King's Advocate may be more justly allow'd to own our Kings when attacked unjustly, and unnecessarily, by their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Beneficiaries; And though it may be instanced, that the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Royal-line has been controverted in other Nations, yet it cannot be instanced that this has been done by Subjects, after their Kings and Parliaments have seriously founded the Loyalty of the Nation upon that antiquity, and the Kings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97803:15"/>
have asserted that antiquity under their own hands, upon so solemn occasions, which is our case, and where the antiquity it self is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely fabulous; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is in it self so reasonable, and is warranted by the Testimonies of contemporary Historians, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the most judicious Criticks.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That the <hi>Scots</hi> were placed here before the Year 503.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOW without either vanity or levity, or any distracting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, I must put the Reader in mind that in my Book I did onely <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> undertake to prove against the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> did set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in <hi>Britain</hi> before the Year 503. And after I had prov'd this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, by the clear and positive Testimonies which I adduced, and had made it appear by some of the same Testimonies, that we settled here before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time; and particularly that <hi>Reuda,</hi> one of our Kings, was expressly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Beda,</hi> one of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours I cite; I proceeded to prove that our Historians are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as to King <hi>Fergus,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely a hundred and thirty years betwixt these two Kings. As to which, our Historians being many,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97803:16"/>
and men of Reputation, they ought to be believed, they having narrated nothing that is improbable, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared that they were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warranted so to write, by the Records delivered to them by Authority out of our ancient <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries</hi> then extant; and that <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> universally received of a whole Nation, is a great Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so short a step as a hundred and thirty years. And in the last part of my Book, I clear against Archbishop <hi>Usher,</hi> and the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> That this Countrey was called <hi>Scotland,</hi> and We <hi>Scots,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Year 1000, a position they were driven to maintain in defence of their former Paradox.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> without taking notice of these Points which I treated separately in the method now mentioned, would more cunningly than ingenuously, make his Reader believe that I have undertaken by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Citation and Reason to prove the truth of all the parts of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story from <hi>Fergus</hi> downward: and therefore when I adduce a Citation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97803:16"/>
for proving that we were settled here before the Year 503; or that this Countrey was called <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Year 1000: He asks, Where is there mention in these Citations, of <hi>Fergus?</hi> And takes no care to consider my Citations, with relation to the particular Points for which they are produced, as in my <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stillingfl.</hi> praef. pag. 23.</note> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> concerning the <hi>Scotobrigantes,</hi> and in my <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. p. 285.</note> Citation of <hi>Claudian,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To return then to my first Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, for the Readers fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, I must put him in mind that I did prove the first of these positions, <hi>viz.</hi> That we were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Year 503. (1.) By the Authority of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Historians within the Isle, (2.) By the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians, who could not but know us well, because that Nation fought long with us, (3.) By <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Writers and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who prove that the <hi>Scots</hi> were acknowledged to have been a <hi>Christian</hi> Nation here before that time, and therefore behov'd to have been setled here, (4.) I fortifie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97803:17"/>
these Citations by most clear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (5.) Because the import of some of these Authorities is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, I appeal to the best Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Criticks, as the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges betwixt the reverend Prelate and my self; and these I hope will be found to have asserted the truth of this my Position, and the justness of my Citations.</p>
            <p>The first Citations I used were from <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and esteemed of all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Writers: And I did begin with <hi>Beda,</hi> because he transcribes and explains <hi>Gildas;</hi> and I shall repeat the Argument as I stated it in my first Book.</p>
            <p>The venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> though a <hi>Saxon</hi> himself, and so an Enemy to us, having written an exact Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology according to the periods of time, does in his <hi>first chap. de priscis Incolis,</hi> tell us, that God was praised in five Languages in this Isle; that of the <hi>English, Britons, Scots, Picts</hi> and <hi>Latines;</hi> and then proceeds to tell that the <hi>Britons</hi> were the first Possessours, and possest the <hi>South</hi>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97803:18"/>
parts; After which, came the <hi>Picts</hi> to the <hi>Northern</hi> parts, and the <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>Reuda</hi> thereafter made a third Nation in that part belonging to the <hi>Picts,</hi> getting the <hi>Western</hi> part of <hi>Scotland, North</hi> from the <hi>Picts</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dumbriton</hi> or <hi>Alcluith,</hi> and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates their fixing here by three several, but concurring Expressions. 1. <hi>Progressi ex Hiberni√¢,</hi> they left <hi>Ireland. 2. Sedes vindic√¢runt in Britanni√¢,</hi> they setled in <hi>Britain. 3. In Britanni√¢, Britonibus &amp; Pictis gentem tertiam addiderunt;</hi> they added a third Nation to the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and that this was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, is clear; for he fixes them in <hi>Britain</hi> in that Chapter, wherein he treats <hi>de priscis Incolis:</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus setled the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> in his <hi>first Chapter</hi> with the <hi>Britons,</hi> he proceeds in the second Chapter, to setle the fourth Nation, <hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>Latines</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> beginning with these words: <hi>But this</hi> Britain <hi>was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and not entred upon by the</hi> Romans, <hi>till</hi> Julius Caesar's <hi>time.</hi> And having described the Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these three Nations and the

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97803:19"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, in a due Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion marking every period of time, through the Reign of their consecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Emperours: and how at last the <hi>Romans</hi> had abandoned the Island, and <hi>Aetius</hi> the <hi>Roman Consul</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the Petition of the miserable <hi>Britons,</hi> so often defeated by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts:</hi> He in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter relates, how the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> upon deep Consultation brought in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the <hi>Saxon</hi> History. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument I brought from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> was from the <hi>5th. cap. l. 1. Eccl. Hist.</hi> where he says, that <hi>Severus</hi> built a Wall to defend against the other unconquer'd Nations, and in the 12. <hi>cap.</hi> he tells that <hi>Britain</hi> was vexed by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> two <hi>Over-Sea</hi> or <hi>Transmarine Nations:</hi> And thereafter, as if he had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that this word <hi>Transmarine</hi> might have been mistaken, he adds, That they were not called <hi>Transma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> because they lived and were setled out of <hi>Britain,</hi> but because they were separated from that part of <hi>Britain</hi> by the two Seas which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97803:19"/>
did almost meet. And in this he agrees exactly with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who in the life of <hi>Agricola</hi> says, that there being a Wall built betwixt these two Seas, the <hi>Roman</hi> Enemies were closed up as in an Isle.</p>
            <p>To these Arguments the learned <note place="margin">C. 5. p. 285.</note> Doctor answers first that <hi>Beda,</hi> in the beginning of his History, doth set down the five Nations that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>Britain,</hi> and so if the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> be ancient, the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> must be ancient Inhabitants too in his Sense: for they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reckoned before the War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> his business being to give an account of the present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and not merely of the ancient.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, that this is a mere imposing upon the Reader: for <hi>Beda,</hi> when he names the five Nations, speaks of them in relation to the present Languages wherein God was praised within the Isle, but when he speaks of the old Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, he speaks onely of the <hi>Britons, Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> and the reason why he sets not down the particular time
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97803:20"/>
wherein these fixed in the Isles, as he does when he speaks of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> is because he knew the one but the other was so anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the exact time of their first settlement was not known; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Chronologue would not have omitted that if he had known it. For speaking of the <hi>Romans</hi> settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he condescends upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Year: But when he speaks of the settlement of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> he onely saith <hi>[Ut fertur] as they say,</hi> a word which he could not have used here, had it not been in matters of the remotest antiquity. And if so, certainly they must be much more ancient than the 503. And the inquisitive <hi>Beda</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reach so far back in the Year 700. wanting the helps of the old Manuscripts in our Monasteries, which onely could tell him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act time, and so he was forced to rest in the general remark of our being fixed here time out of mind even before his own age which was so near to the 503. that his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have told him precisely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97803:20"/>
when we setled, if we had not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here till then.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's second answer is, that <hi>Beda</hi> does not at all intimate that the <hi>Scots</hi> were in <hi>Britain</hi> before the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Saxons.</hi> To which it is replyed, that <hi>Beda</hi> is a Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and is carefull of the Notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time where he knows it: And therefore it seems still to me and has done so to such as understand well Chronology, as sure a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration as that Science can allow, that the <hi>Scots</hi> being named as one of the three ancient Nations inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting this Isle, and their actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrated before the <hi>Saxons</hi> are said to have entred, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their settlement must be the elder, though it be not said in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms, and if any account of Kings, or memorable actions, were set down by a Chronologue, without adding the years, these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd to be considered ancient, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order wherein they are exprest; especially in this case, since the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bed.</hi> L. c. 14.</note> defeat of the <hi>Britons</hi> by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97803:21"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> is made the cause of bringing in the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and the cause must necessarily precede the effect. In fortification of all which, we must mind, that this will agree better with the following Citations, which clear, that the <hi>Scots</hi> settled here before the year 404; at which time the <hi>Saxons</hi> entred, and that they were here before the <hi>Romans,</hi> is likewise clear: for after they are marked to be setled in this Isle, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Verum eadem</hi> Britannia Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis <hi>usque ad</hi> Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Julium Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarem <hi>incognita suit.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Britain</hi> is said to be unknown to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And as the <hi>Romans</hi> are acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been here before the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and so to be set down by <hi>Beda</hi> before them; Why should not the <hi>Scots</hi> be likewise acknowledged to have been setled here before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> since their settlement is first mentioned?</p>
            <p>The Doctor's third Answer is, <note n="*" place="margin">L. 1. c. 5.</note> That though <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall was acknowledged to be built against the unconquer'd Nations beyond it; yet it is not said, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were these unconquer'd Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, else the controversie had been ended: But on the contrary, <hi>Dion,</hi>

by whom we may understand <hi>Beda</hi>'s meaning, tells us, that these Nations were the <hi>Maeatae</hi> and <hi>Caledonii:</hi> To which it is reply'd, that <hi>Beda,</hi> in his first Chapter, mentions onely the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> as setled here with the <hi>Britons:</hi> in the second he brings in the <hi>Romans,</hi> and gives an account of their progress under <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar:</hi> in the third under <hi>Claudius:</hi> in the fourth under <hi>Marcus Antoninus:</hi> in the fifth, under <hi>Severus,</hi> he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the building of the Wall to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest against the unconquer'd Nations. After which, in the 12th, he recapitulates the War betwixt the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> against these unconquer'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whom afterwards he still calls <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi> And again, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaders of this Wall, built against those Nations whom he called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd, without speaking of the <hi>Maeatae</hi> or <hi>Caledonii:</hi> So that from <hi>Beda</hi> it is clear, that these uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Nations were the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> and therefore, by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s own confession, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97803:22"/>
controversie is at an end. And these <hi>Moeatoe</hi> and <hi>Caledonii</hi> were in effect the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> considered as <hi>Highlanders</hi> and <hi>Lowlanders:</hi> for <hi>Bochart Canaan, l.</hi> 1. 42. tells us, that <hi>Camdenus rect√® deducit Galedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios √† Britannico Caled, quod durum sonat; duri enim &amp; asperi erant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colae, &amp; terra etiam tota horridis &amp; confragosis montibus attollitur.

And this farther appears by comparing <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> cited by the Doctor, with <hi>Claudian;</hi> for <hi>Dion</hi> onely says, <hi>Britannorum duo sunt proesertim genera, Caledonii &amp; Maeatoe: nam coeterorum nomina ad hos fer√® referuntur. Incolunt Moea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae juxta eum murum, qui Insulam in duas partes dividit; Caledonii post illos sunt.</hi> And <hi>Claudian</hi> tells us who were these against whom the Wall was built.

            <p>From which I observe, that the <hi>Moeatoe</hi> were in effect the <hi>Picts,</hi> who dwelt in the Low Countrey nearest the Wall, and that the <hi>Caledonii</hi> were the <hi>Scots</hi> who then lived in the Hills. So that <hi>Dion</hi> is so far from proving that the Wall was not built against the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> that he agreeth with the other Authours cited here and elsewhere, who all concur to prove, that the Wall was built against the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi> And the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor might as well conclude, that our actions done here this day, are not done by the <hi>Scots,</hi> because our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories speak oft-times of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> and <hi>Lowlanders,</hi> which are the <hi>Maeatoe</hi> and <hi>Caledonii.</hi> And I do conclude, that either the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is not a man to parallel Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours with Authours, or else he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97803:23"/>
is not of that candour I did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's Fourth Answer is, That when <hi>Beda</hi> makes the <hi>Scots</hi> a transmarine Nation, as dwelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Friths,</hi> and not out of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> this is onely said in his own defence; because in his first Chapter he had setled them in <hi>Britain:</hi> and no more respect should be had to this, than if a <hi>Scotish</hi> Writer in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s time had spoken of the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Saxons,</hi> using the words of an Authour who lived before their coming into <hi>Britain,</hi> and then should explain himself that he does not mean the <hi>German Saxons,</hi> but these who lived in <hi>Britain</hi> beyond the two <hi>Friths:</hi> Would this prove that the <hi>Saxons</hi> lived here before <hi>Iulius Coesar</hi>'s time? all this I confess is a piece of odd reasoning: for certainly we must either deny all Authority and reason, or confess that <hi>Beda,</hi> who was so ancient an Authour, and liv'd so near to <hi>Gildas</hi>'s time, and to our Countrey, behoved to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Scots</hi> liv'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> or not: And it is not to be thought, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:97803:23"/>
would have written so distinctly and positively such a great and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Lye, merely to maintain his own Assertion: and therefore his acknowledgment, that we were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here beyond the <hi>Friths,</hi> and not in <hi>Ireland,</hi> proves sufficiently <hi>quod erat probandum;</hi> and it seems to me a descension below the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of so great a Doctor, to sport himself over and over upon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty criticism of my calling this a demonstration; neither is it any wonder, that the Doctor is angry at me when I cite <hi>Beda:</hi> for both the Bishop of <note n="*" place="margin">Page 18.</note> St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">C. 5. p. 285.</note> he, treat <hi>Beda</hi> so, because what he writes makes for us.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Authority it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by the <note n="‚Äñ" place="margin">Pref. p. 60.</note> Doctor, that by these Seas must not be understood the Friths of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Clyde,</hi> but the Sea betwixt <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> because that <hi>Gildas</hi> speaks still of them as carrying away their prey beyond Seas; and the passage over the <hi>Frith</hi> behoved to be as large as that over the Seas, being 40 miles in some places; whereas the passage
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97803:24"/>
betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is, in some places, but 13 miles. To this it is Reply'd, that the Friths are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mare Scoticum,</hi> both by our Laws and the English Writers: And to these I now add their own <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Brit.</hi> Descript. p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> His words are, <hi>Bernicia ver√≤ √† Tissa ad mare Scoticum, quod nunc Frith vocant.</hi> To which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor neither has, nor can make any answer. And so the word <hi>Trans Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> is not impropriated when it is applyed to our <hi>mare Scoticum:</hi> and though in some places the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Clyde</hi> be so broad at the very entry to the Ocean, where it is rather Sea than River, yet many parts betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are much broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the broadest part of the Friths. And the <hi>Scots</hi> in their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs did not pass at the broadest part, but near the Wall at <hi>Dunbrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where they were nearest the <hi>Picts,</hi> and it is not a Mile broad there, and is little broader for a long tract of the River under it; and the broadest part of it is exceedingly more calm and passable than the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> Sea; the one being but a River
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97803:24"/>
and within Land, and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a strait of the wide and open Northern Ocean, where the Sea, by how much it is straitned, becomes the more turbulent. And therefore when <hi>Claudian</hi> expresses our Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Flights, he does it by Oars.
<q>
                  <l>Fregit Hyperboreas remis audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus undas.</l>
               </q>
But that of the <hi>Saxons</hi> by Sails.
<q>
                  <l>‚ÄîVenturum Saxona Ventis.</l>
               </q>
Which presupposes Sails. Nor were the Corroughs mention'd by <hi>Coesar (l.</hi> 1. <hi>de bello Civili)</hi> cited by the Doctor, made for Seas, but Rivers, as is clear by the words, <hi>Nec pontes perfici possent;</hi> and these <hi>Milit√©sque his navibus flumen transportat. Edit. Variorum</hi> 1670. <hi>&amp;</hi> 492. It does not therefore appear probable, or reasonable, that a whole Fleet should be made by poor Pilferers of such stuff fit to carry an Army, with its prey, over so turbulent a Sea, and in the Winter time, they having fought
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97803:25"/>
and pillaged all the Summer, and the prey being then ordinarily either Cows or Horses, there being little else to be plundered; and if they had passed at <hi>Cantyre,</hi> which is that narrow place, they behov'd to have travell'd likewise over a whole tract of ground, and two other Seas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had come to the Frith of <hi>Clyde,</hi> and the <hi>Britons</hi> Countrey. And <hi>Beda</hi> explaining <hi>Gildas</hi>'s own words, tells us, that they ceas'd not to drive preys from the <hi>Britons;</hi> And <hi>agere praedam,</hi> to drive a prey, is what can onely be done by Land, and so could not have been done in Corroughs. Nor is that driving by Corroughs ever called a Piracy, as it would have, if it had been from one Island to another. But the carrying of Beasts over a River is consistent enough with the driving a prey, though that this, in the Doctor's sense, infers an impropriety in the words, as well as a contradiction to common sense.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is in the last place, urg'd, that a Wall against the <hi>Scots</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97803:25"/>
and <hi>Picts</hi> had been ridiculous, if the <hi>Scots</hi> could have come against the <hi>Britons</hi> by Sea. It is replyed, that the Doctor (not knowing the Geography of the place so well as we, who have seen it) does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that this Argument proves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against himself; for if the <hi>Scots</hi> had dwelt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the South from <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> It had been ridiculous to have built a Wall against them from East to West: for against these incursions from <hi>Ireland</hi> by Sea in Corroughs, it should have been built along the mouth and coast of <hi>Clyde,</hi> from South to North, and the Doctor will allow me at least to call this a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; it being a thing that may be seen. But the true reason why the Wall was built, is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, <hi>viz.</hi> because the incursions were made by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> who were not formidable except when u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and they had no passage for an Army when united, but over the Wall: whereas any injury they could doe in their Corroughs over the <hi>Frith</hi> was very inconsiderable, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97803:26"/>
could have been easily stopt; and so the Wall was still usefull against Conquest, thoughnot against Piracy. And to conclude; all this is most consistent with <hi>Beda</hi>'s Sense of <hi>Transmarine,</hi> but not with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's: And therefore we should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe the venerable <hi>Beda</hi> speaking of things very near his own time, when they are very probable, than a Paradox, broacht lately, far distant from these times, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now by our too partial Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: especially since <hi>Beda</hi> shall be prov'd to agree thus, not onely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with common Sense, but with all the Authorities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authours and Criticks. And I must still mind my Readers, that received Histories are not to be overturned without infallible Proofs brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But who can be a more favourable Judge for the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, than the <hi>Saxon</hi> and so his own Countrey-man, <hi>Albertus Crantzius?</hi> Or who can better understand the Time of the <hi>Saxons</hi> descent, and the History of <hi>Beda,</hi> than he who is himself the famous <hi>Saxon Historian?</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97803:26"/>
He <note n="*" place="margin">C. 18.</note> then tells us, that in the Year 449 the <hi>Saxons</hi> were first invited here, but he says, Let us write from a higher Rise. And so he proceeds to tell how the <hi>Picts</hi> setled here, and he adds, that within a very little after them, the <hi>Scots,</hi> resolving not to stay in <hi>Ireland,</hi> sailed sometime into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and being for a little time resisted by the <hi>Picts,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Utraque gens eam inseder at provinciam quae jam diu Scotia est appellata.</note> both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions setled in that part, which is of very old called <hi>Scotland.</hi> After which, he proceeds to <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">C. 19.</note> settle the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to relate our Wars with them, and he gives an account that the Wall built by <hi>Severus,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> without mentioning, either the <hi>Maeatae</hi> or the <hi>Caledonii.</hi> From which it is clear, that <hi>Crantzius</hi> not onely makes our settlement much elder, than that of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and that we were here before them by way of settlement; and not by way of Incursion; but also expressly acknowledges, that our settlement was very near as old as the <hi>Picts,</hi> who are beyond all dispute own'd to have been here long before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time. And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97803:27"/>
(which is very remarkable) he cites none of our Historians for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his opinion, and cites onely <hi>Beda,</hi> whom he interprets, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands as we do, and as indeed all th World does, except our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Adversaries.</p>
            <p>It is also objected by the Doctor, that <hi>Gildas</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 13. Edit. Iocelia.</note> tells us, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> two <hi>Transmarine</hi> Nations, did first invade the <hi>Britons,</hi> under <hi>Maximus,</hi> which was long after <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s time. To which it is answered, that <hi>Gildas</hi> there designs not to speak of the first Invasion of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> upon the <hi>Britons,</hi> but onely of the first of the three Vastations made by them: for the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> did often invade the <hi>Britons</hi> formerly, as is clear by <hi>Eumenius</hi> and others, yet they were never able to waste their Lands, untill that <hi>Maximus</hi> disarm'd the <hi>Britons</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as <hi>Gildas</hi> relates. And after this, <hi>Gildas</hi> sets down the other two Vastations, and names them all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the express numbers of <hi>First, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> and <hi>Third Vastations.</hi> (1.) It is most clear by this passage, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97803:27"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> who made this Vastation, liv'd not in <hi>Ireland</hi> but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> beyond the <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Friths;</hi> for <hi>Gildas</hi> calls both the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts, Transmarine,</hi> without distinction. And certainly the <hi>Picts</hi> lived not in <hi>Ireland</hi> at that time, and therefore neither did the <hi>Scots:</hi> And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Beda</hi> did most justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word <hi>Transmarine</hi> to be; not because they liv'd <hi>without Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> but beyond the <hi>Friths,</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> intimates that that was the common acceptation of the Word <hi>Transmarine,</hi> which is imported in the Phrase, <hi>Transmarinas autem non dicimus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Because it's <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> by the Bishop and the Doctor, that <hi>Gildas</hi> can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean in all these passages, the <hi>Irish</hi> residing in <hi>Ireland;</hi> since he says <note n="*" place="margin">Hiberni re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertuntur do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</note> the <hi>Irish</hi> returned <hi>Home;</hi> and where could the <hi>Home</hi> of the <hi>Irish</hi> be, but in <hi>Ireland?</hi> I think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to the <hi>Seventh Section</hi> of my former Book; where I have fully prov'd, that by the <hi>Irish,</hi> in these <hi>Citations,</hi> is meant the <hi>Irish</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which I shall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97803:28"/>
again more fully vindicate in the <hi>fourth Chapter</hi> of this Book, from the objections urged in this <hi>New An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> I urged also in my Book, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authorities to prove, that it was the general opinion, even of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Historians, that we were setled here, even before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time, to which the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns no Answer. And this having proved my position by Authorities within the Isle, I'll now pass to the foreign Authours.</p>
            <p>Against the Citation urged from <hi>Eumenius</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrick</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi> the Doctor does very little else but repeat what the Bishop had said, and I had <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>ly refuted; and seeing he can make none but such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable additions, I wonder to find that Argument renewed, unless the Doctor thinks that his Authority is greater than the Bishop of St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph</hi>'s, for I have already observed, that the Comparison is strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in <hi>Buchanan's</hi> Sense, which is all that is requisite. And I wonder to hear him say, that it was not a greater advantage, and more for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97803:28"/>
               <hi>Constantius</hi>'s honour, that he did beat the <hi>Britons</hi> after they had been long trained up to fight, even by the <hi>Romans,</hi> than when they were altogether rude, and had never seen any enemies but <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time: For as common reason teacheth us, that they could not but considerably improve, in near four hundred years time of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Wars; So the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 21.</note> that, to the end they might more easily resist the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> taught them the Art of War, and furnisht them with Arms; which is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to sustain the strength of the Oratour's comparison, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, that <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Victory over the <hi>Britons</hi> was greater than that of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s: And albeit the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph mentioneth other advantages, yet it does not follow, that these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were not very considerable, and these advantages are no part of the former Comparison, but make a new Paragraph, and are a new heightning of <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Victory, from other grounds, (2.) I could
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97803:29"/>
never see how it could be truly said by the Oratour, that the <hi>Britons</hi> were used to fight against the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> if by the <hi>Irish</hi> be not meant there, the <hi>Scots:</hi> for as I have prov'd that we were called <hi>Irish</hi> in those Ages, so I desire to know where the <hi>Britons</hi> were used to fight against any <hi>Other Irish</hi> save those, who inhabited <hi>Britain?</hi> Nor do the <hi>Irish</hi> pretend that ever there were any Wars between the <hi>Britons</hi> and them, save onely in <hi>Egbert</hi>'s time, which was many years after <hi>Caesar;</hi> and even this is but a Conjecture of a late Authour, <hi>Usher</hi> and <hi>Flahartie</hi> do adduce no more ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour for it. And so that cannot verifie the Oratour's saying, that they were accustomed to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s time. It is also very considerable, that the <hi>Picts</hi> here are joyned, as used to fight joyntly against the <hi>Britons,</hi> for it can never be instanced that the <hi>Picts</hi> joyned with any against the <hi>Britons,</hi> save with us. And it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed incredible, that the <hi>Scots</hi> should be accustomed to fight from <hi>Caesar</hi>'s

time to <hi>Constantius</hi>'s, and to the Year 503, (which must at least include about six hundred years, allowing onely one hundred years to verifie that word) and yet never settle where they fought, venturing their lives for the defence of other Mens Lands for a prey, which could be of very little use to be plundered in those days, there being little to be taken save Cattel, which could have been hardly transported in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs over such boisterous Seas, (3.) The Doctor tells us, that <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicum,</hi> and not <hi>Britannum</hi> is the <hi>Adjective,</hi> or at least that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour useth onely <hi>Britannicum</hi> for the <hi>Adjective;</hi> and so <hi>soli Britanni</hi> were not good Grammar, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the <hi>Genitive.</hi> But to this I reply, that the Doctor adverts not that I have prov'd by Citations, which he Answers not, that <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> is an <hi>Adjective</hi> and so <hi>soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni,</hi> good Grammar in the <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and there is nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for Oratours than to vary their Phrase, using sometime one way of expressing, and sometime
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97803:30"/>
another, variety in such Cases giving both delight and Ornament: Nor can I see why, if this had been ill Grammar, <hi>Cambden</hi> would not have carped at it, as he did not; or how <hi>Scaliger</hi> would not have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, he having decided for us, after <hi>Buchanan</hi> had put this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction on this expression: for though <hi>Scaliger</hi> doth not expressly take notice of the Construction, yet after he had fully considered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Luddus</hi> (wherein this was one chief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he decides for <hi>Buchanan,</hi> which upon the matter is a clear approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Construction. This is all I contended for, by citing <hi>Scaliger;</hi> onely the Citation of him on <hi>Tibul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> is wrong printed, for that of his on <hi>Eusebius.</hi> And that this is a clear Consequence drawn from <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Eusebius,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable. And if so, then certainly the opinion of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> with <hi>Cambden</hi>'s acquiescence, is much to be preferred to our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Enemies, whose Learning does not lye so much that way. The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97803:30"/>
Argument from the pointing addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Doctor, in <hi>Puteanus</hi>'s Edition of <hi>Eumenius</hi> is not onely contrary to that of <hi>Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Plantin,</hi> which I have cited; but even from that way of pointing, there is no advantage to the Doctor. For to sustain the words <hi>soli Britanni</hi> to be <hi>Nominative,</hi> there should have been a <hi>Comma</hi> after <hi>soli Britanni:</hi> For as they now run, <hi>Et soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni Pictis modo, &amp; Hibernis assue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta hostibus,</hi> they cannot be Construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted otherwise than thus, <hi>Natio rudis &amp; assueta hostibus, Pictis &amp; Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, soli Britanni:</hi> And if <hi>soli Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanni</hi> likewise had been <hi>Nominative,</hi> the Oratour to make good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, should rather have said <hi>Natio rudis, &amp; soli Britanni assueti,</hi> (and not <hi>assueta) Pictis &amp; Hibernis.</hi> But abstracting from both the pointing and the Grammar, it is undeniable from this place, that this ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Oratour did in the days of <hi>Constantius</hi> before the Year 503. consider our Colony as accustomed to fight against the <hi>Britons,</hi> and as a distinct people joyned in this War
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97803:31"/>
with the <hi>Picts,</hi> which cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to any other Nation but to us. And therefore <hi>Cambden</hi> and <hi>Usher,</hi> more reasonably fly to another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Eumenius</hi> spoke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conception of that Age, wherein he lived; and it is undeniable, that that Age considered onely us, and the <hi>Picts,</hi> as fighting against the <hi>Britons,</hi> and as two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fixt here. But this Answer is also very ridiculous; for if our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity had not been very considerable in <hi>Eumenius</hi>'s days, the Oratour would not have exposed himself so far, as to found the Comparison upon a palpable lye, where he might have been traced; and so I confess if such kind of Answers as these be allowed, no Nation can prove its Antiquity. But agreeably to all these objections, this Citation proves at least, that the <note n="*" place="margin">C. 1. Parag. 5.</note> Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s position, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were not at all in <hi>Britain,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Incursion, nor by any other way, till the Year 300. is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with this <hi>Roman</hi> Authour, as well as our Story, and the general belief of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:97803:31"/>
The next Authour whom I did cite, was <hi>Latinus Pacatius,</hi> who, in his Panegyrick to <hi>Theodosius</hi> upon his Victory in <hi>Britain,</hi> complements him for having reduc'd the <hi>Scots</hi> to their own Marishes; which shews, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in <hi>Britain</hi> before the year 503. To which the Doctor answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing. And from the same Authours calling (in another place) the same <hi>Marishes,</hi> the <hi>Marishes</hi> of the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> I infer, that these <hi>Marishes</hi> were in <hi>Britain,</hi> and not in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the <hi>Scots</hi> were called <hi>Caledonians.</hi> And thereafter I adduce <hi>Valerius Flaccus</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> to prove our Antiquity. To all which, the Doctor answers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that the <hi>Caledonians</hi> were <hi>Britons,</hi> without answering my ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which I have adduc'd to prove this. And as to the Criticks whom I cite for us, <note n="*" place="margin">C. 5. P. 283.</note> he says very wisely and profoundly, that we are not to follow Modern Writers in their Improprieties. This Answer, so injurious to all the learned world, he also returns to my proving from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97803:32"/>
               <hi>Lipsius, Bergier</hi> and others, that <hi>Galgacus</hi> was a <hi>Scot.</hi> And when from <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself I prove, that he must necessarily have been a <hi>Scot,</hi> for the <hi>Irish</hi> Kings never came to fight in <hi>Britain.</hi> He could not be a <hi>Briton,</hi> because he was speaking to those who had never been under the <hi>Roman</hi> slavery. And <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells that he was a King of a Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and but newly discovered, whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> formerly knew the <hi>Britons.</hi> Neither was he ever pretended to be a <hi>Pict,</hi> nor is he in the Genealogy of their Kings. To all this the Doctor answers nothing.</p>
            <p>All then that is answer'd to my testimony from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> is, That those who fought under <hi>Galgacus,</hi> were <hi>Britons,</hi> and not <hi>Scots,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Galgacus</hi>'s Speech to them, wherein he says, that they are the noblest of the <hi>Britons,</hi> and fight to recover the Liberty of the <hi>Britons:</hi> And if <hi>Tacitus</hi> had known that they came out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he had told it; nor could that <hi>Irish</hi> King who was with <hi>Agricola,</hi> have omitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of this. To which I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97803:32"/>
That <hi>Agricola</hi> wrote not this relation himself, but it is written by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who had it from <hi>Agricola,</hi> and so cannot be exact, being but the relation of a relation; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably <hi>Agricola</hi> knew more of it from that <hi>Irish</hi> King. But there is enough in <hi>Tacitus</hi> to prove, that we were setled in <hi>Britain</hi> at that time, and were of <hi>Spanish</hi> extraction from <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was all that <hi>Irish</hi> King could inform. For it is clear, (1.) That those who fought under <hi>Galgacus</hi> were <hi>Caledonians,</hi> and past not under the general name of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons;</hi> for <hi>Galgacus</hi> exhorts them, to shew by their valour, <note n="*" place="margin">Quos sibi Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia viros sepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerat.</note> what brave Men <hi>Caledonia</hi> had separated from the rest; and though they were <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> yet that proves not that they were not <hi>Caledonian Britons,</hi> (2.) <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacus</hi> tells, that they were yet <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Integri &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domiti.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd and untoucht, which is not applicable to the <hi>old Britons,</hi> for they were conquer'd before that time; but is so far peculiar to the <hi>Picts</hi> and us, that we are still called <hi>Indomitae gentes.</hi> (3.) <hi>Tacitus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes two different People in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:97803:33"/>
one big and white, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of a <hi>German</hi> extraction; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother black in hair and face, said to be of a <hi>Spanish</hi> extraction. And can any thing agree better with our Histories, and the description of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who are said to have come from <hi>Germany,</hi> and of us who are said to be a Colony of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for some time in <hi>Ireland?</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s saying, that it could hardly be known then, whether these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were <note n="*" place="margin">Indigenae an advecti.</note> 
               <hi>Originally Britons,</hi> or <hi>Strangers,</hi> shews, that we were there very anciently; which is also clear'd by <hi>Beda,</hi> and confirms what he and <hi>Eumenius</hi> say. And immediately after <hi>Tacitus,</hi> we are known under the names of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> and the ablest Criticks, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Histories, call <hi>Galgacus</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>King of the Scots;</hi> whose Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, because that is their trade, and they are disinterested, must be prefer'd to the Doctor's; and I add now to <hi>Lipsius, Bergier</hi> and others, whom the Doctor acknowledges to prove that <hi>Galgacus</hi> was a <hi>Scot, Keppingius,</hi> who, though he doubts
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97803:33"/>
of some of our Antiquities, places amongst these things, which are <note place="margin">Hist. Univers. de reb. gest. reg.

this period with <hi>Gretius,</hi> who, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Barclay,</hi> calls him <hi>Gente Caledonius,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>By the same Magisterialness, with which he contemn'd <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and the other Criticks, in the former ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he does also condemn the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Salmasius,</hi> in my urging the Citations of <hi>Scoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigantes,</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> and of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticae primae,</hi> in <hi>Spartian.</hi> But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I must beg leave, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, to consider, those two anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authours, <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Spartian,</hi> to be sufficient proofs of our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, till the Doctor's friends can prove to me that he is a greater <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> and as impartial in this case as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> are. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Doctor answers not the reasons I adduced, for proving these
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97803:34"/>
their Criticisms to be most just: and these are abstract from all authority, and I recommend the reading of them to any impartial Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claudian</hi> may be justly called by us, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Poet, as <hi>Beda</hi> is the <hi>Scotish</hi> Antiquary: for <hi>Claudian</hi>'s whole Poem is, in effect, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued confirmation of our History. For he having written a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> to <hi>Honorius,</hi> and in it magnifying <hi>Theodosius</hi> his Grandfather, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes all along his fighting with the <hi>Scots,</hi> which <hi>Sigonius</hi> calculates to be in the year 367. as <hi>Isackson</hi> on this year observes. And I refer my Reader to my former Book, as to these passages cited by me, none of which passages can be applied to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with whom <hi>Theodosius</hi> never fought, but onely to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> with whom it is certain he did fight, many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents whereof are extant in that part of our Countrey called <hi>Ierna.</hi> But the Doctor says, though this were granted, yet it would fall much short of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time: And what then? for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97803:35"/>
I never intended that this should prove either, but onely that we were elder than the 503. But (says he) there appears no <hi>Demonstration.</hi> More wonderfull still! for I called it no <hi>Demonstration,</hi> though I think it weighs as much as any thing in the Doctor's Book. And I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice onely of this Raillery, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical way of answering, to detect the two great Engines which the Reverend Doctor useth all along in his Book.</p>
            <p>That which he answers here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously is, that by <hi>Ierna,</hi> is meant <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Poet, and does he not mention the <hi>Scots</hi> moving all <hi>Ierne?</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>‚ÄîTotam cum <hi>Scotus</hi> Iernen</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And is it not Poetical (says the Doctor) to say he mov'd all a little part of <hi>Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which my Replies are, that first <hi>Scotland</hi> was called <hi>Ireland</hi> in these days, as I have prov'd in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Section of my former Book,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97803:35"/>
and shall prove more fully in the fourth Chapter of this. Onely at present I shall add, the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. 1. c.</hi> 37. Many evidences we have that <hi>Scotland</hi> is oft call'd and hecht <hi>Hibernia,</hi> as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth.</note>

            <p n="2">(2.) Did <hi>Theodosius</hi> conquer <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or persue them over to <hi>Ireland?</hi> and does any Authour call <hi>Ireland, [glacialis Ierne?]</hi> So then when a name is proper to two places, which of the two is meant, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the action which is said to be done in the place. And how agrees this with <hi>Beda</hi>'s telling, that we were setled here long before that time, and were not <hi>Transma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine?</hi> Or with <hi>Latinus Pacatius,</hi> who says, that <hi>Claudius,</hi> before that time, triumph'd over <hi>Britain,</hi> and reduc'd the <hi>Scots ad suas paludes?</hi> And where have the <hi>Irish</hi> any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and Histories of these Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, as <hi>we</hi> have?</p>

            <p n="4">(4.) The name of <hi>Ierna</hi> was not confin'd to the little Conntrey of <hi>Stratherne,</hi> but was extended to all the <hi>Northern Highlands,</hi> as far as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerness,</hi> and so the Raillery of <hi>[mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all a certain little part]</hi> is insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid: nor is there any thing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary than to give the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a part of a Countrey to the whole; and thus, when it is said, <hi>the King beat the</hi> Hollanders; By this, is meant, the <hi>whole Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> though <hi>Holland</hi> be onely a part: and this figure is so frequent in all the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, that it were a mark of ones ignorance either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97803:36"/>
it, or insist on it. Thus <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Arbiter</hi> expresses the defeat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Caesar</hi> to <hi>Aphranius</hi> in <hi>Spain, per funer a gentis Iberae,</hi> though <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> be but a little part of <hi>Spain,</hi> so called from the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Battel was fought there; which holds in every circumstance with our case, wherein the Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the trouble of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> by <hi>Ierna,</hi> because the Battel was fought there, though <hi>Ierna</hi> be onely a part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> called from a River of that name. And all <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the same Poet, and to this day, is called <hi>Caledonia,</hi> though <hi>Caledonia</hi> be but a small part of it about <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld.</hi> And though I should grant that by <hi>Ierne</hi> here was meant <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet that cannot make against our being setled here before that time; For it is very reasonable to think, that the <hi>Irish,</hi> hearing that the <hi>Romans</hi> had penetrated so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to have defeated so many of these as came originally from <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would have sent over men to assist us; especially knowing that it might be their lot,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97803:37"/>
next: even as if the <hi>French</hi> should beat and ruine the <hi>Scots</hi> now setled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> our whole Countrey would certainly be in a commotion, and we would send over men to their assistence, as we did in the late Wars. I confirm'd this citation of <hi>Claudian,</hi> by that of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> which is likewise an original proof of our Antiquity. To which the Doctor answers, that <hi>Sidonius</hi> distinguishes the <hi>Caledonian Britons</hi> from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> This is, indeed, just such another, as if, because I call my self, in <hi>Latin, Scoto-Britannus,</hi> I should distinguish my self from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Britons.</hi> But I would fain know who were these <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Britons,</hi> who were different both from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> for after he has named the <hi>Caledonian Britons,</hi> in general, he specifies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards both the <hi>Sc ts</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi> There is no answer made to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies from <hi>Hegesippus, Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Marcellinus,</hi> nor <hi>Orosius:</hi> and therefore I now proceed to the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick</hi> Writers cited.</p>

After I had made it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that this Nation received, very early, the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, because the <hi>Christians,</hi> who were persecuted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> would fly hither to us who had never submitted to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Tyranny:</hi> I cited, in general, for our Nations being converted under the Reign of King <hi>Donald, Baronius,</hi> as the standard of <hi>Ecclesiastick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> amongst the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgick Centuries</hi> among the <hi>Protestants.</hi> And it is strange, if they, being disinterested, and having the help of their respective parties, should fail in so remarkable a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as that of the conversion of a whole Nation. Nor can <hi>Baronius</hi> be thought interested, because he would design to make our <hi>first Mission</hi> flow from <hi>Pope Victor,</hi> and our <hi>first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> to be sent from <hi>Pope Celestine:</hi> for it was all one to <hi>Baronius,</hi> as making as much for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that our <hi>first Bishop</hi> came from any <hi>Posteriour Pope.</hi> And if our single and interested ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries (though so mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled by one another,) should
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97803:38"/>
be preferred to these Authours, and as infallible as they would fain be thought, there is indeed an end of all Controversie. But I am sure the rejecting of all Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I have cited, and which are not so much as controverted, will not take with the indifferent World, and that satisfies me. But however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Authorities of these great Men, let us consider the Grounds upon which they are founded, and which I have considered as well in all the Editions of <hi>Baronius</hi> I could find, as the Doctor could have done, though the Doctor in his wonted way Magisterially says, that it seems I never looked into him. I am used in my Employment to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, which makes me look ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to my Citations. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Doctor tells, that what <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> says, relates to the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and not to their Antiquity, This is very ill reasoned: for it <hi>Baronius</hi> concludes, that we were a distinct <hi>Christian</hi> Nation from the <hi>Irish;</hi> and had a Church distinct from theirs long before the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97803:38"/>
Year 503. it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that in <hi>Baronius</hi> sense, we were a Nation settled here long before the Year 503.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prosper</hi> does expresly say, that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to the <hi>Scots</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in <hi>Christ,</hi> to be their <hi>First Bishop,</hi> ordain'd by <hi>Pope Celestine.</hi> This <hi>Mission</hi> is acknowledged to be in the Year 431. and consequently there were <hi>Scots</hi> before that time, believing in <hi>Christ,</hi> so nationally, as to need a <hi>Bishop.</hi> The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie then is, whether these <hi>Scots,</hi> to whom <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent, were the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> for these Reasons. (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Beda</hi> says so in those Chapters, wherein he speaks onely of us, and not of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> onely repeats here what I have formerly refuted. And <hi>Beda</hi> could not but understand best of any man the Conversion of a Nation, to which he was so near a Neighbour, to a Church, in which he is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so eminent an Historian and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. (2.) The universal Tradition of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, and of ours
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97803:39"/>
in particular, makes <hi>Palladius</hi> our <hi>First Bishop,</hi> and our <hi>Monasteries</hi> and <hi>Church-men</hi> could not but carefully transmit such a point as that to us; especially in an age wherein Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Letters were freqeent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be usefull, in remembring so extraordinary a point. And St. <hi>Patrick</hi> is acknowledged by the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> themselves, to be their <hi>First Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> which could not be if <hi>Palladius</hi> had been before him so that the Doctor here is forced to ove<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap> all History and Tradition, to establish his own. (3.) The same <hi>Prosper</hi> does elsewhere say, that <hi>Palladius</hi> being ordain'd Bishop for the <hi>Scots,</hi> whilst he studied to preserve the <hi>Roman</hi> isle, <hi>Catholick,</hi> he made the <hi>Barbarous, Christian.</hi> And that our Countrey was called an <hi>Isle,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all Writers, after the building of the Wall. But I now farther evince this point by <hi>Hadria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Valesius,</hi> an Authour much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Doctor himself, who, <hi>lib. 3. Rer.

The learned Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stilling sleet,</hi> to overturn this undeniable point, have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a New <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Palladius,</hi> having been first sent to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but that his Mission being unsuccessfull, he came back and died in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the <hi>Picts,</hi> and then the same Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> sent St. <hi>Patrick;</hi> which <hi>Hypothesis</hi> I may now think is fully overturned, since Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fleet</hi> answers nothing to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny absurdities and inconsistencies which I urged against it; and to which I onely now add that since the Bishop confesses that he dares not deny, that there were several Conversions made before <hi>Palladius</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> about the Year 400, It is strange that <hi>Palladius</hi> should have met with so much opposition, as to make him so soon despair, that he returned notwithstanding his Zeal, and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> posted from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ireland</hi> within less than a Year: and so <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi> is onely called the first Bishop in <hi>Nomination,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> the first in <hi>Success.</hi> Rare reasoning, rare
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97803:40"/>
despairing, rare posting, and rare distinctions to over-turn the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Traditions and Histories of all the Nations concerned! Upon which account the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 59.</note> doth very ingenuously confess, that this doth not consist well with our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> nor with <hi>Prosper</hi>'s own words. And all this is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Nennius,</hi> as the Doctor <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">C. 2. P. 53.</note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and the <note n="‚Äñ" place="margin">P. 56.</note> Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and yet they confess that he is but a fabulous Authour, and cites <hi>Prosper</hi> most falsly, saying that <hi>Palladius Missus est ad Scotos in Christum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertendos,</hi> and upon a Notation of time falsly imputed to <hi>Baloeus,</hi> which I formerly urged, and is not answer'd. And the Doctor in the forecited <hi>2d.</hi> Chapter, <hi>p.</hi> 53. would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Prosper</hi> contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in making the <hi>Scots</hi> to be converted by <hi>Palladius,</hi> and yet to have been <hi>Christians</hi> before his time, which are inconsistent. But he knows better things, for there were <hi>Christians</hi> here before <hi>Palladius:</hi> for he was sent to be the first Bishop
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97803:41"/>
which presupposes <hi>Christians</hi> already converted, and a Church ready to be established; and he being sent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to convert us from the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie, as <hi>Baronius Petavius</hi> and others observe, it must necessarily follow that we were a Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, and remarkable too, for having a Heresie (which is an Errour long, and obstinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd) spread amongst us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently we must necessarily have been a Nation long before that time. But all men must be ignorant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent, when they make against the Doctor, and he cannot answer them. And why doth the Doctor lay the stress of this <note n="*" place="margin">P. 68.</note> objection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Prosper:</hi> if he be such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour as is not consistent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as the <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">P. 53.</note> Doctor says? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may be allowed to say that <hi>Prosper</hi>'s Testimony is for us.</p>
            <p>I must beg the Doctor's leave to say, That the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> differs not from me in the Point here controverted; for I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved clearly from him, That we were <hi>Christians</hi> long before the Year
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97803:41"/>
503. by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <hi>pag. 63. praef.</hi> For if we were converted before the Year 503, We were setled before that Year. But so it is, That Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> confesses, we were converted before <hi>Celestine</hi>'s time, and that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to our <hi>Scotia,</hi> and not to <hi>Ireland;</hi> To which Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> makes no solid Answer at all. And where the Doctor says, That I concealed Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s asserting that we received the first Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Christian Faith from the <hi>Britains,</hi> in <hi>rejecting</hi> the <hi>Roman Customs;</hi> It is answered, That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we received <hi>Christianity</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Romish</hi> Church, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Conversion was rude or perfect, is not here controverted; But whether we received it before <hi>Palladius</hi>'s <hi>Mission:</hi> And that we were <hi>Christians</hi> before his time, is clear from Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s own express Words. And though I relate our Conversion by Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> as the common opinion, yet I am so little tyed to that opinion, That I also, from <hi>Beda,</hi> relate our Agreement
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97803:42"/>
as to <hi>Easter</hi> and other Points, with the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> in contradiction to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and from which, Archbishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> did, before Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> think that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>To conclude this whole Point, concerning <hi>Palladius,</hi> I am sure its very Irreconcileable, that Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> should acknowledge that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> mis-cited <hi>Baloeus,</hi> for proving that <hi>Palladius</hi> dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 431. (upon which, his whole <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> depends) and yet that he should positively assert, That the Bishop's onely fault was, that he was too exact in that <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Ecclesiastick Authour</hi> I did cite was <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who about the Year 202. says <note n="*" place="margin">C. 7. contr. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos <hi>as it is translated</hi> by <hi>St.</hi> Asaph, praef. p. 8.</note> that the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Nations that could not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet willingly yielded their Necks to the Yoke of <hi>Christ.</hi> To this the Doctor onely answers, that this must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the <hi>Moeatoe</hi> and <hi>Caledonii.</hi> But this is inconsistent with <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s applying that passage to us: and that Sense is not so much for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97803:42"/>
of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, these being but sub-divisions of a Nation. But since this passage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Nations in <hi>Britain,</hi> and that I have proved unanswerably by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> that the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>We</hi> were these unconquered Nations, it necessarily follows, that this passage is onely applicable to us.</p>
            <p>The Doctor answers St. <hi>Ierome</hi> transiently, applying likewise what is said there of the <hi>Scots,</hi> to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without giving any special answers to the Citations. But I have so fully refuted this in my Book, that it needs no reply. But if the Reader please, he may likewise consider St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> where, speaking of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> he says, <note n="*" place="margin">Habet enim progeniem Scoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae gentis de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannorum vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> His extraction was from the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Britain.</hi> And though some contend that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was a <hi>Briton,</hi> none ever contended that he was an <hi>Irish</hi> man, and the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Britons</hi> cannot be extended so properly to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as to us. But whether <hi>Briton</hi> or <hi>Scot,</hi> yet it is clear from this Citation, as well as from the former, that in <hi>Ierome</hi>'s opinion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97803:43"/>
there was a <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation living then in <hi>Britain,</hi> and that this was the common opinion of the Age, else so good an Authour would not have written so.</p>
            <p>To the Citation from <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nothing is answered.</p>
            <p>I confirmed all these Citations by several reasons, which are not so subject to quibbling as Citations are; for these are founded on common Sense, and therefore the Doctor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers little or nothing unto them. But I hope the Reader will duly weigh them. But how can it be imagined that the <hi>Irish</hi> would have sent no Colonies to settle, till after the 500. Year of God, they having been time out of mind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been setled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being a very broody People, and having no Wars (whereas the design of Colonies is to dis-burthen the Nation by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Settlements) or that they would not have assumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Glory and advantage of these Wars? or that the <hi>Scots</hi> here would have fought for the <hi>Picts</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97803:43"/>
above six hundred years together, without setling in the Countrey, which they conquered, contrary to the Custome of all other Nations, who made Incursions? Or how can it be imagined that the <hi>Romans</hi> would not have resented against the <hi>Irish,</hi> all their Inrodes, if they had been made from <hi>Ireland?</hi> Or that the <hi>Picts</hi> could have subsisted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> staying all the year within the Isle, and the <hi>Scots</hi> going home al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Winter? Or if they had not been setled among the <hi>Picts,</hi> till the <hi>Saxons</hi> were setled among the <hi>Britons,</hi> how is it imaginable, that the <hi>Picts</hi> would have invited them to setle then, when they had seen how the <hi>Britons</hi> were ruined by their <hi>Auxiliaries?</hi> Or why would the <hi>Picts</hi> have invited them to setle among them, when the <hi>Picts</hi> were become more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, by the Generations of six hundred years, and after that they themselves were straitned in their Possessions by the Irruptions of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> a new Nation who had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97803:44"/>
gained all betwixt the two Walls, which was, in effect, the far better half of what they possest? And since the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were still joyned in all the Actions that were performed, and are spoken of still in the same way, and Phrase, how should we think the one was setled, and the other not? And that no mortal Historian, or other, should have observed this, till <hi>Luddu</hi>'s time? All these reasons supporting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and joyned to our Citations, should be at least allowed to maintain the Authority of so many Historians and Histories, in possession of belief.</p>
            <p>Having thus established my own position, by Authorities and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I appealed in this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt interested Countries, to the dis-interested Judgment of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Criticks and Historians, and all whom I have cited are acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be on our side, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cleared in the respective Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <p>From which I argue thus, <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> there concludes, that we were one of the Nations against whom <hi>Claudius</hi> fought, and that we were never subdu'd till then. for <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> never fought against the <hi>Irish;</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> here spoken of by <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> must be those whose antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Scaliger</hi> did formerly prove out of <hi>Seneca:</hi> for he says, <note n="*" place="margin">Et Scoti hanc genti suae antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem mihi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent.</note> the <hi>Scots</hi> owe to him the Antiquity of their Nation. But so it is, that the <hi>Irish</hi> living in <hi>Ireland,</hi> do not owe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of their Nation to him: for it is not deny'd on either side, that they were much more ancient; and I am sure the <hi>Irish</hi> were not called <hi>Scots,</hi> in <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s time. And both this passage of <hi>Tibullus,</hi> and that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> joining the <hi>Scots</hi> to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> must certainly be interpreted onely of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Usber</hi>'s own rule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97803:46"/>
The passage likewise cited by me out of <hi>Eusebius, ad M. M. L. X.</hi> does also prove, that <hi>Scaliger</hi> thought us elder than the declension of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> as is now alledged, for he speaks there of that Nation, of whom he had formerly spoken out of <hi>Seneca.</hi> But so it is, we were these <hi>Scots,</hi> and not the <hi>Irish:</hi> And it was never controverted; but the <hi>Irish</hi> was a Nation long before that time, as I said formerly: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, <hi>Scaliger</hi> contemns very justly those Authours, who deny, that we were a Nation before <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s time, because no Authours spoke of us till then: For, says he, the <hi>Longobards</hi> and <hi>Burgundians</hi> were established Nations long before they were known by these names. And the Nation of which <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks, is that Nation <hi>Quae trajecit ex</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berni√¢ <hi>in</hi> Britanniam: And it were ridiculous to apply this to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or deny that <hi>Scaliger</hi> thought we setled here while the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> flourished. <hi>Scaliger</hi> also there says, that after we had troubled <hi>Britain</hi> by Incursions, we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97803:46"/>
were at last forc'd to contain our selves within our own bounds. Which shews, (1.) That we had made Incursions long before <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s time, which was about 100 years after <hi>Christ,</hi> contrary to what the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> saith. (2.) <hi>Antoninus</hi> forced us to contain our selves within our own bounds, and therefore we had bounds and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our own, before that time, and so we were setled long before 503. And all this agrees with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi> and <hi>Pacatius,</hi> and proves that what they write relates to us. (3.) <hi>Pausanias,</hi> (whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> there cites) tells us, that <hi>Antoninus</hi> took much Land from them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they had Land before that time, for that Land could not be in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for <hi>Antoninus</hi> never took Land from the <hi>Irish.</hi> And whoever these <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes</hi> were, yet <hi>Scaliger</hi> there makes us the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> and the question there is onely concerning <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s opinion of us. Nor am I concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at his calling us <hi>Brigantes:</hi> for I can prove that <hi>Brigantes</hi> signifies not <hi>Robbers,</hi> but <hi>Highlanders,</hi> from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97803:47"/>
the word <hi>Briga,</hi> which signifies an <hi>Hill.</hi> And I receive kindly the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology made by the Doctor for the Bishop, that his Lordship called us not Robbers, but onely produced a Testimony from <hi>Gildas,</hi> whom I excuse for abusing us, he being of that Nation which was over-run by us; and probably our spoiling of them might be the Ground of his Quarrel.</p>
            <p>The Doctor likewise argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Citations from <hi>Favin</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> as speaking onely of an alliance betwixt <hi>Achaius</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and nothing as to <hi>Fergus,</hi> nor the Succession of Kings for 330. years before <hi>Christ</hi>'s Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: But, alas! How trivial is this Reflexion! For I never adduced these Authours for proving directly, that part of our History relating to <hi>Fergus;</hi> but did justly argue, that we must have been setled here much earlier than the Year 503. because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 790. we were a very considerable Nation, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a League with <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> which these Authours do fully
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97803:47"/>
prove. And I likewise produced this Citation, to shew how unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> confined us to some few Countries now erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Earldom of <hi>Argyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Sigonius,</hi> I shall set down some Citations which formerly I forgot to place on the Margin. But it is strange that the Doctor could not find them, though he uses not to search much for what makes against him, His words are, <note n="*" place="margin">De Occident: Imp. l. 6. p. 141.</note> 
               <hi>Eodem anno (qui fuit 360 post Christum)</hi> Julianus <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud</hi> Parisios <hi>hibernans,</hi> Scotos, <hi>Pict√≥s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> Britannos <hi>incursantes audiens,</hi> Lupicinum <hi>magistrum armorum in</hi> Britanniam <hi>destinavit.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he says, <hi>Anno ver√≤ Christi</hi> 449.

            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:97803:48"/>
I cited also <hi>Selden</hi>'s clear Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which nothing is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
            <p>And when I said in the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of my Book, that all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians had own'd our History; I meant all who wrote before <hi>Luddus,</hi> and <hi>Camden,</hi> which I still believe to be true. And yet to prevent quibbling, I ordered the expunging of the word <hi>[All,]</hi> in the second Impression, before I knew of any censures but my own. And now the Doctor produceth onely two, who wrote since their time, and are not of such weight as these cited by me. And if <hi>Ubbo Emmius</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered what I now produce, he had at least acknowledged our History before the Year 503, whereas he does not so much as allow our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story till after the Year 829, which, even the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> will think ridiculous, and which being after the <hi>French League</hi> is redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by unquestionable Proofs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Boxhornius</hi> special, and has been misled by <hi>Usher.</hi>

Thus, I hope, I have again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s two chief Positions relating to us, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were no <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> at all, before the Year 300, which is expresly contrary to what is said by <hi>Eumenius, Tertullian, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Pacatius, Seneca, Spartan</hi> and <hi>Beda;</hi> and that other Position, <hi>viz.</hi> That we were onely here by way of Incursion, from the Year 300. till the Year 503. which was all that I did chiefly undertake, and for which, though I needed not to have produced Arguments, but onely answered his Citations, (for according to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s own Position, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived History is not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but by very convincing Proofs) yet because I found that neither the Bishop nor the Doctor could bring any Proofs to overturn our History, I have likewise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the truth of it as to these Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time, by Authorities which I may modestly say very learned men have thought unanswerable, and which the Doctor's answers (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so insufficient after the assistance he has got) shew to be so.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>What the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> say against our Histories, from <hi>Fergus</hi> the first, examined.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough I was not obliged to maintain our History be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Year 503. that being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to overturn the two Positions laid down by the Bishop, yet I think it fit and reasonable for me to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine also, what our two learned Adversaries say against our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in general, even as to these dark times, in which, neither our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours nor we can get such a sequel and chain of Authours, as these I have produced to prove our being here before the Year 503.</p>
            <p>Let us then remember (1.) that we are onely obliged to produce Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical, not Mathematical, nor Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal proofs. (2.) That we are onely maintaining our <hi>Origine</hi> to be from a Neighbour Nation, and very near
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97803:49"/>
to the Age of Letters, and that there is nothing in this our <hi>Origine,</hi> either vain or fabulous, we neither deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our selves from <hi>Aegyptians, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> nor <hi>Trojans,</hi> nor contradicting even in these first dawnings of our History, the uncontroverted Tract of foreign Historians: And so all these long digressions, which the Doctor, to shew his own learning, produces, concerning <hi>Berosus, Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, Suffridus</hi> and others, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of their rejecting their own fabulous descent from <hi>Brutus,</hi> is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impertinent; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be alledged in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story to contradict foreign Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, which I have not taken off in my first Book, without any answer made to it. And though there should be some Errours in the Tract of a History, yet the whole Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for that must not be rejected, else no <hi>English</hi> Historian should be believed more than ours, we seeing in our own Age, matters of Fact, especially relating to our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, very much mis-represented, to say no worse at this time; And I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97803:50"/>
desire to know what Warrant <hi>Luddus,</hi> ou first Adversary, had for assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the descent from <hi>Brutus,</hi> and for his promising to prove it; and yet this Authour passes for a great Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and <hi>Camden</hi> states the debate betwixt <hi>Buchanan</hi> and him, as the debate betwixt a great Antiquary and a great Poet: Well decided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and this is a great proof of <hi>Camden</hi>'s being an impartial Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary, and since most of the old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Historians who wrote their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral History, tell of this descent from <hi>Brutus,</hi> we may controvert in the same way the truth, even of their latter Histories; because they are founded on their old Histories which assert <hi>Brutus,</hi> and so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the whole Tract of the <hi>Roman</hi> story as ours do not. (3.) The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and the Doctor do both wrong us, very much, in observing, that all our Neighbour Nations have thrown out the old and fabulous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of their History, but that we still retain our ancient Fables, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that reads our History will see that most of our Historians have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97803:50"/>
omitted the old <hi>Irish</hi> Fables of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus</hi> and <hi>Scota,</hi> and all that long line from <hi>Iaphet</hi> to <hi>Fergus</hi> the first, narrated lately again by <hi>Ogygia,</hi> and much used by our reverend Critick Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in this answer against us. It is acknowledged by the Doctor himself, that <hi>Boethius</hi> and <hi>Ioannes Major</hi> do very ingenuously pass from many later things, because they smell of that fabulous age, but the Doctor does charitably make these to be the effects, not of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but of Craft: so nothing can stand in Judgment before such Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>The first thing I say then for our Historians, is, that what they say from <hi>Rheuda</hi>'s time, is not onely made probable, but is undeniably proved by <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Eumenius,</hi> who do clear that we were here before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time; and if we were, certainly we had Kings, nor did the Genius of our Nation ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to a Common-wealth as others have done: <hi>Rheuda</hi> is made a <hi>Scotish</hi> King by <hi>Beda, Galgacus</hi> by <hi>Tacitus, Donald</hi> by <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97803:51"/>
Historians, and all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Year 300. From <hi>Rheuda</hi> then to <hi>Fergus</hi> the first, are but by our Computation 130 years, and to what purpose should so many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men have conspired, and a whole Nation have concurred so zealously, to maintain a Lye; so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle usefull, as the lengthning our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, for so short a time as 130 years? And though there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for it but Oral Tradition, why might it not be received for so short a Period? and since a Father might have told this to his Son, in an age wherein men lived so long, and especially as to the descent of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the race of Kings, of which men are very carefull: to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie which, I adduced <hi>Livius</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Per ea tempora rarae literae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, una custodia fldelis memoriae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum gestarum, &amp; quod etiamsi quae in commentariis Pontificum aliis<expan>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97803:51"/>
I urge from common Sense, that <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> was to be <hi>Livius</hi>'s best Authority, in the beginning of his History, and in many things after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for though, after several years, the <hi>Romans</hi> were exact in preserving their History by keeping publick and distinct Records, which the Doctor does needlesly prove, since it was never controverted; yet certainly in those things which he narrated before the building of <hi>Rome</hi> he could have no Warrant but <hi>Tradition.</hi> (2.) After the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> it's not to be imagin'd, that a Nation onely given to Wars, would for many years fall upon the exact keeping of Records. (3.) These Records might possibly bear the names of Magistrates, which is all that is proved, and in a Monarchy could have been preserved without these, as to their <hi>Kings:</hi> For I will undertake there are few here but know who reigned these 130 years by-past among us, though they can neither read nor write: And though private Magistrates might be forgot, yet hardly Kings, and very memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97803:52"/>
actions could be so: and I dare say, that in our own, and in most of the considerable Families like ours, not onely the Succession, but the chief Accidents which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the Family are remembred for two or three hundred years by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds in the Family, though there be no written History of such Families; so far does interest and affection prompt and help Memory and Tradition to supply Letters. (4.) Though these Records might have preserved names of Magistrates and Treaties, with the conditions thereof, yet what were the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of War, the considerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits and Strategemes done in them, and many other such matters of Fact, could onely be preserved by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for these were never Recorded in any Nation, and could have no Warrant save <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning the <hi>Harangues,</hi> and such like Historical matters: so that <hi>Livie,</hi> as well as <hi>Boethius</hi> must have wanted flesh to fill Nerves to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, and colour to adorn this History. (5.) Since the City, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97803:52"/>
most of these Records were burnt, we have as great reason to doubt of their History as of Ours; for albeit we cannot now produce the warrants of them after Vastations as remarkable as their burning was, yet we have others who say they saw such Books, even as <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassius</hi> cites <hi>Antiochus Syracusanus,</hi> for whose Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story no more is said by the said <hi>Dionysius,</hi> but that he took his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story out of ancient and undoubted words, and he is but one Authour who says so of himself; whereas we have many Historians, who say that they with their own eyes saw the Records, out of which they took the things they have.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, I renew the Argument which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in my first Book for proving the truth of our Histories. Thus,</p>
            <p>These Histories must be believed, and are sufficiently instructed, in which the Historians who writ them had sufficient Warrants, for what they wrote, and we have fiv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> or six Historians, men of untainted Reputation, who when they wrote
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97803:53"/>
their Histories, declare that they wrote the same from <hi>Authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> and <hi>Warrants,</hi> which, being a matter of Fact, is sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Testimony of so many honest Witnesses, who declared they saw good Warrants for what they wrote: and if this be controverted, what can be true in humane Affairs; or why should we believe <hi>Livius, Iosephus</hi> or others, since the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours which they cite are not now extant? This is all the subject can allow, and what the learned Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> and <hi>Heylin</hi> think not onely sufficient, but all that is possible to be done in such Cases, the one, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by my Method and Arguments, that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles are Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, and the other, that there was such a King in <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Lucius;</hi> and that he introduced into it the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> in which the Doctor agrees with him, against the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and I hope our Authours will at least give a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the opinion of two such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnent English Divines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:97803:53"/>
The Laws also of all Nations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that when Papers are lost, the tenour of them may be proved, providing a probable way of losing of them to be instructed, which the Lawyers of all Nations call <hi>Casus amissionis.</hi> But so it is, we assign two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occasions and sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to instruct this <hi>Casus amissionis.</hi> The first in the Reign of <hi>Edward the first,</hi> who industriously did take away our Records. Which in the process before the Pope, we offered to prove by most famous Witnesses in presence also of the said King, who, by his not contradicting, did acknowledge this matter of Fact. The second in the time of our Reformation, in which, the blind Zeal of some, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested Avarice of others, prevailed with them to destroy the Records of our Monasteries. And so far are these accidents true, not onely in <hi>History,</hi> but in our sad <hi>Experience,</hi> that we want in matter of private right, what might have been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht us both from our <hi>Records,</hi> and <hi>Monasteries:</hi> And so it were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to think, that we abstracted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97803:54"/>
those vouchers upon design; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seeing long after that, and till <hi>Luddus</hi> time, no Nation, nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, ever controverted our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and I Challenge the Doctor to produce any such Authour, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they would have done, if the matters of Fact had been either ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in themselves, or inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the tract of other Histories.</p>
            <p>Of this fundamental Argument the Doctor takes no notice, and makes no answer to it; but I, to fortifie this Argument, having insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the probability of what our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians relate, and the Reputation of the relaters, he runs out in an answer to both these, to which I shall make a Reply: But I conceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can take off the strength of my Argument, except he either prove, that there could have been no such Warrants, and that what is related is in it self inconsistent with the History of other Nations, or that he had produced to us good Authours contemporary with these things which he denies, and we assert, and had shewed that these Authours
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97803:54"/>
deny these Transactions, or deliver things inconsistent with them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which he has done, nor can doe.</p>
            <p>The first general Ground insisted on by the Doctor, is, that we have no Historians who wrote in the time in which the things related were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been acted; to which it is answered, as formerly, that an Authour writing from sufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, is as much to be believed as if he had lived in the time; and that is our Case: And I again renew my Query, if the Doctor thinks that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Book of <hi>the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Reformation,</hi> should not be believed in the next Age though the Warrants of it were burnt, which is very possible; and had it not been great folly, and impudence, in five or six honest men to have separately written, that they and each of them had the said Records, when they wrote from them? And though the Doctor insinuates that this has been formerly done by one or two which he cites, yet there were not many concurring there, as here; and it is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97803:55"/>
a very different thing, for one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to say that he wrote from such a Record, a particular passage, in which none was concerned, and for many worthy Men to say in their Epistles to their Kings and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what they wrote was true from the Records which they had given them from Monasteries and other publick Records, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to them as then extant: and certainly many would be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to see these Records in the time of the writing these Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, especially seeing the first Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians who appear in Print have both Rivals, and Enemies, as well as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Criticks, and the Monasteries themselves, and the Keepers of the pretended Records, could not but have known the Forgery, if any such had been. Or durst so many ingenious Men, though they had been careless of their Conscience, have trusted their Reputation in so nice and quick-sighted an Age, as that, wherein all of them wrote, to the discretion of so many who could have discover'd the Cheat? Nor do we
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97803:55"/>
find, even from what the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self writes, that the single Testimony of these who pretend to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from Records, is rejected, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where what they say is redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, as inconsistent with other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted Histories, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; or narrate things, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves incredible, as is evident from the instances of <hi>Humbald, Geoffery, Annius</hi> and others: so that to reject our Histories, lest the World should be obliged to believe these, is no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, nor just way of reasoning. But the Bishop himself, to shun this, did with a greater shew of reason urge that our Historians were but to be accounted as one, since they followed one another in a File: But I did fully take off this, by proving that each of them saw some few of these Records, and Warrants, a part; and that they differed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to shew that they were in no Conspiracy: and this I hold as acknowledged, since the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns no answer to it.</p>
            <p>That there could be no sufficient Warrants for our History, from the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97803:56"/>
               <hi>Annals</hi> of our <hi>Monasteries,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, because the Monasteries themselves are much later than <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus the First,</hi> who is to be proved by these <hi>Annals.</hi> But to this it is answered, that <hi>Iona</hi> and <hi>Abercorn,</hi> are Monasteries acknowledged by <hi>Beda,</hi> as long <hi>prior</hi> to <hi>Beda</hi>'s time; and though the Monasteries were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet they might have Records as old as <hi>Fergus,</hi> for this is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in it self, and consequently ought to be believed, since it is proved by famous Witnesses. And whereas it is answered, that <hi>bare Probability</hi> is not sufficient to sustain a History, but the <hi>Annals</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of which it is taken must be produced: My return to this is, that if <hi>bare Probability</hi> were onely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proposed, the answer is good, but it is not so when I say the thing is probable of it self, and is actually proved by Witnesses beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And whereas, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this, it is contended from the <hi>Irish Annals,</hi> that <hi>Fergus,</hi> whom we call the second, was our first King. To this I need say no more, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97803:56"/>
that I proved in my former Book, that all the accounts which the <hi>Irish</hi> gave of our entry into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are inconsistent, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory one to another, and to which the Doctor has made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and therefore they are not to be believed in themselves; but much less are they to be believed when contrary to the <hi>Annals</hi> of all our Monasteries, attested by famous Witnesses who saw them, and in a matter in which we were more concerned than they: and so it is probable we would have been more carefull to preserve it's Memory, (2.) I have proved in the first Chapter, not onely by the assertions of our own Historians, but by all the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians who speak of us, both without, and within the Isle; that we had Kings long before <hi>Fergus the second,</hi> and that we had even <hi>Christian</hi> Kings; and it is almost impossible, that our Monasteries could have been mistaken in that, or at least that they would not have condescended, who was the <hi>other Christian King,</hi> if <hi>Donald</hi> was not:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97803:57"/>
And at least, our Adversaries should be put to prove who was our <hi>First Christian King,</hi> or acquiesce in him whom we assign. And it is also very strange, that not onely we, but the <hi>Romish</hi> Church it self should be mistaken; they being very positive in concurring with us, whereas no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation nor Church condescends, as I have said, upon any other <hi>First Christian King,</hi> or Authours to prove it. And to conclude this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, I must say that it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that positive Witnesses, that say they saw old <hi>Annals,</hi> fortified by their Histories both at home and abroad, <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> should be less believed than the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads and Traditions of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have none of these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: That <hi>Beda</hi> should be of less credit than <hi>Iocelin,</hi> and <hi>Legends,</hi> in which I dare say the Bishop and Doctor believe but very little, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing at all, save this; and why are not the <hi>Legends</hi> of St. <hi>Congall</hi> and St. <hi>Brendan,</hi> who mention the settlement of St. <hi>Fergus the first,</hi> as good as <hi>Iocelin,</hi> and others, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97803:57"/>
to prove that <hi>Fergus the second</hi> was our first King; especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they likewise concur with <hi>Beda</hi> in his <hi>Rheuda?</hi> Whereas the other contradict him, and that our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which have rejected <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Simon Brek,</hi> because that too great Antiquity is improbable, should be overturned by those who positively own a Lineal, well proved descent from <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and condescend upon days, and months, and that our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians which are many, and very much esteemed over all <hi>Europe,</hi> should be overturned by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Rhimes, and rags of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which no Man adventured to form into any Body whatsoever, till of late some <hi>Specimen</hi> is given, in which, amongst other rare Marks of veracity, our League with <hi>France</hi> was alledged to have been made with their Kings; as if <hi>France</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as little their own Leagues, as they would have <hi>Rome</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their own Conversion; or that all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> should have been mistaken, as to this pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97803:58"/>
I reflect not on the Publishers of the Manuscript of the Abbacy of <hi>Melros,</hi> printed at <hi>Oxford;</hi> for I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour every thing that comes from that learn'd Society, in a special manner; but it is no reflexion on them, to say that we have another, much fuller, in what makes for <hi>Scotland,</hi> though it could not be so exact as the other Monasteries, since it was ofttimes of old, under the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who would certainly lessen what relates to us; and thus the fault lay in the Copy, and not in the Publishers, for the Authour of that Manuscript calls <hi>Beda our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman,</hi> so he must have been then our enemy; but however it begins not with <hi>Alpin,</hi> as the Doctor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, though I mention that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not mentioned in the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Edition: for it declares, that it is to continue where the Reverend <hi>Beda</hi> left, and so is a proof of our Nation, and History, from that time, and the differences of that from ours shall be printed, and I have at present printed these few. And though <hi>Buchanan</hi> had the Books
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97803:58"/>
of <hi>Pluscardin</hi> and <hi>Pasley,</hi> yet it does not follow that therefore the best and most part of the Books of our Monasteries were not carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> or destroyed, and so cannot be recovered from <hi>Rome;</hi> and how can it be imagin'd, that those who burnt all our Magnificent Churches, would have spar'd a few Books, written by Monks, and which were so little esteem'd in those times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Zealots?</p>
            <p>The Doctor, in proving there was no such Authour as <hi>Veremund,</hi> forgets that I have prov'd by two famous Witnesses, a Lord of the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and a Principal of a College, (both learned, and devout men, much esteem'd abroad where they travell'd) that they had seen the Book; and here is no <hi>bare probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> And I hope it is uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the depositions of two Witnesses cannot be taken away by probabilities; nor can it be alledged that <hi>Chambres</hi> followed <hi>Boethius</hi>'s faith in this, for he says he had it, and he cites many things material out of <hi>Veremund,</hi> nor does the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97803:59"/>
Doctor <hi>Pearson</hi> prove any other way the truth of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, than by producing the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Origin</hi> and others, who have cited passages out of those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as Letters written by St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> though none of these Authours liv'd in the age with St. <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and so they did not legally prove that these Letters were written by him which are not in <hi>Boethius.</hi> But however, let us a little examine the Doctor's probabilities.</p>
            <p>The first is, that many have forg'd Authours, as <hi>Annius:</hi> good! <hi>Ergo,</hi> these two learned Men did it; <hi>√† posse ad esse non valet consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> (2.) We have nam'd other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, who are not now extant: <hi>Ergo, Veremund</hi> never was: good again! and if <hi>Fordon</hi> had been lost, or <hi>Elphinstoun,</hi> whom we have not yet seen, such Authours had been both denied, and so had that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Manuscript written by <hi>Craig,</hi> which we have but lately recovered. (3.) <hi>Fordon</hi> cites not <hi>Veremund,</hi> though he cites many others; This is such another consequence, as if I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97803:59"/>
should argue against the Doctor, that <hi>Boethius</hi> cites not <hi>Fordon; ergo, Fordon</hi> never was. But I chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to argue thus; the Bishop and Doctor both think that <hi>Boethius</hi> did onely transcribe <hi>Fordon,</hi> and yet he never cited him, which they think he did, that he might have the honour of being thought our first general Historian himself: And yet it is prov'd, there was such a Book as <hi>Fordon,</hi> then extant; and therefore I conclude, by the same reason, that <hi>Fordon</hi> transcribed much of <hi>Veremund,</hi> and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd his Authour. (4.) Bishop <hi>Elphinstoun</hi> mentions him not; but to this I answer, that the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script is not ours, and so may be gelt; but I conceive, by the Doctor's <hi>Epitome</hi> of it, that it is it self but an abridgment of <hi>Fordon,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he mentions not <hi>Veremund,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Fordon</hi> had not mentioned him, and it was very ordinary in those days, to write <hi>Epitomes</hi> of <hi>Fordon,</hi> some whereof are extant with us, and <hi>Boethius</hi> tells us that <hi>Elphinstoun</hi> never wrote an History,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97803:60"/>
but onely prepar'd some materials for one; and if he wrote a History, here is again another Historian, who being a devout and learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, must be thought not to have written without sufficient warrants. Though then probabilities could overturn the deposition of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, yet these have no weight, but what the Doctor's Authority gives them. And though it were prov'd, that <hi>Baker, Baloeus,</hi> and the other <hi>English Historians</hi> whom I cite, had not seen <hi>Veremund,</hi> yet surely they thought it not onely probable, but certain, that there was such an Authour.</p>
            <p>Against <hi>Fordon</hi> it is urg'd, that he mentions not our first Kings from <hi>Fergus the First;</hi> to <hi>Fergus the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;</hi> and that he confesses he knew not how long any of these Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Fergus</hi> reign'd; and from this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is concluded that we have no <hi>Manuscripts</hi> to instruct the same. <hi>Nam,</hi> says he, <hi>ad plenum scripta non reperimus,</hi> To which it is answered, that this is a great argument of his ingenuity, for if he could have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97803:60"/>
without sufficient warrants, why could he not have made up this, as well as the rest? But the true reason is; that the Warrants did then lie in the Monastery, especially at <hi>Icolme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill,</hi> where <hi>Veremund</hi>'s History was likewise kept. And it is clear, by <hi>Boethius</hi>'s dedication to the King, that he thanked his Majesty for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that these should be delivered to him: and if the Doctor should at present write such another Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, thanking him for letting him have the use of the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian MSS.</hi> of the Bible out of his <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> could any man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards think that there were no such <hi>MSS?</hi> and that the Warrants of the Histories us'd so to be kept, as not to be got without publick Authority, is clear by the custome of Nations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by the Doctor out of <hi>Livy,</hi> and asserted by me in my First Book. As to our Nation, from <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Iovius,</hi> who was not interested in us, and consequently, it was no wonder that <hi>Fordon,</hi> who was but a mean Priest, could not have <hi>Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> and the other Warrants which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97803:61"/>
were necessary for filling up the History of our Kings, between the <hi>two Fergusses,</hi> which <hi>Boethius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self could not recover without the King's command, the Treasurer's assistance, and his own great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and labour: and I know not whether it would not have been a greater villany and folly in him, to have asserted all this, if it had not been true, himself and all Persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested being alive, or a proof of <hi>Fordon</hi>'s ingenuity, in not filling up what was deficient through want of the Warrants.</p>
            <p>Against <hi>Boethius,</hi> it is urg'd by the Doctor, that he could not have had <hi>Veremund,</hi> and other sufficient Warrants from <hi>Icolmekill,</hi> as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, because his History is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Year 1526. and he had not these Records from <hi>Icolmekill,</hi> till the Year 25. so that the History could not be compil'd, printed and revis'd in a year. To which it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to have had a better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, than to have forg'd so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable a falsity, especially in a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97803:61"/>
thing he might have contriv'd as he pleas'd, and in which the honour of the Nation was not concern'd, and as to which, the King, Treasurer and Monks of <hi>Icolmekill</hi> could have controll'd him; but this is easily reconcil'd, without a miracle, for certainly <hi>Boethius</hi> was writing his History long before he got these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and doing what he could, as <hi>Fordon</hi> had done, without them before; and having at last got them, after the third message, <hi>Tertio Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> which shews he was writing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he might have easily added from the beginning through the whole Book, what was to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Veremund,</hi> and others, and which, I dare say, the laborious Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> could have done in a month, and there was time enough from the beginning of 25. to the end of 26. (as we may well enough suppose) being near two years to have done all this; and this was a far less miracle than for the Bishop and Doctor to have sent <hi>Palladius</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to preach there long enough to have a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97803:62"/>
proof of the <hi>Irish</hi> being obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and to despair of success, to return, and to die in a Countrey of the <hi>Picts</hi> all in one year: and St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> who was not then present, but was in <hi>France,</hi> to have got the news of this death, to have formed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and to have gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> and prevail'd with the Pope to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain him, and all this in the small space betwixt the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> following: at which time the Pope died; whose preceding sickness could not but have retarded that Affair.</p>
            <p>I admire the Doctor, for insisting on the Printer's mistake, not mine, in calling <hi>Turgot, Archbishop</hi> of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> for I call him, <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the first, Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and so the calling him <hi>Archbishop</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards could not have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in me, and the Printers thought all <hi>Bishops</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> must be <hi>Archbishops;</hi> and by the mistake of the same kind, without any observation, <hi>Martial</hi> is made to have liv'd in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I plac'd him in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97803:62"/>
sent a Copy so corrected, in print, to the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and the half of our own printed Copies are right in this, but in the <hi>Second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I expung'd these, and some other literal faults, before I knew that the Doctor or any else was to write an answer: and, I am glad the Doctor is so fashionable a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as to understand <hi>Martial</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I do: nor would I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on the mistakes about <hi>Fordon,</hi> and <hi>Dempster,</hi> if these had not been material to my purpose, whereof the one is not yet answered, and the other not at all notic'd by the Doctor.</p>
            <p>I urg'd upon this head also, that the Sacred History was for many hundreds of years preserv'd by <hi>Oral Tradition:</hi> for though the <hi>Iews</hi> and we acknowledge, that the Scripture was penn'd by Divine Inspiration, yet in arguing against <hi>Pagans,</hi> we must make this probable by other Arguments. And the Doctor, in his <hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> (which Book I esteem very much) uses the same Common Places with me, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97803:63"/>
other things tells us, that men lived so long in those days that they were able to transmit Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Relations with much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty than now. And <hi>Iosephus,</hi> for proving the Sacred History against <hi>Appion,</hi> cites Foreign Authours that are all lost now, and yet we believe there were such Historians. And albeit afterwards the Priests did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Histories with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, yet that way of preserving History by Records, took not place for many ages. And though our Monasteries are not to be compared with their Priesthood, yet they were sufficient, especially in these sincerer times, to preserve our His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. And though what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd is not to be believ'd with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine belief, yet they ought to have an Historical one allowed them, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially since they are fortified by the probability of what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, and the concurrence of as much <hi>Roman</hi> History, as <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> can pretend to. Nor are the Citations from our old Laws to be contemn'd: for these at least might
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97803:63"/>
have been preserved by practice, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws. And it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable that <hi>Skene,</hi> our famous Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Antiquary, did within these 100 years declare, He had old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts bearing these our old Laws, though they are now lost, without weakning our esteem or observance of them, and he has printed many of them. And though Historians might have adventur'd to print some Historical Passages without sufficient warrant, yet neither they, nor our Register, durst have adventur'd to print Laws, nor would our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours have suffered this, without sufficient warrants. And we must be believ'd in what concerns us, and us onely. Nor does it follow that because the Laws of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third were lost; therefore the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calpin</hi> Laws might not have been preserv'd, they being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Rights and Successions of our Kings. And therefore, as they were preserv'd with more care by us, they should have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd with less zeal by the Doctor, for his Monarch's sake, whose par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97803:64"/>
I tax in this, and not his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty. And to conclude this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, in opposition to the Doctor, I do think that the most fundamental of all Laws were in all Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by mere Tradition, and are not written to this very day, save when some accident forces it, as in our late Statute for the Succession. Which Position, since able Lawyers must acknowledge, I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it with a Divine, who seems here to be out of his sphere, and more dogmatical than his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession will well allow. But why may not our Laws be as old as about 800 years; since <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> tells us, that there are Laws yet extant in <hi>London,</hi> older than any the <hi>Romans</hi> had? And the Doctor's Raillery, that <hi>probably these Laws were in another Chest</hi> at <hi>Icolmekill</hi> with the <hi>MSS.</hi> which <hi>Boeth</hi> says <hi>Fergus</hi> brought from the sacking of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Alaric,</hi> to be contemn'd: for as great Criticks, as the Doctor, believe this to be true, as one may see by <hi>Morhosius</hi>'s learn'd Book <hi>de Patavinitate Livian√¢.</hi> From
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97803:64"/>
this received Principle also I conclude justly, that since <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws, and the old Laws of other Nations have been preserv'd, most of them without writing, and by mere Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, why may not the same Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be trusted for the Names, and for some general and probable actions of our Kings for 130 years, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Rheuda,</hi> to <hi>Fergus the First?</hi> or why might not our Monasteries have received these Traditions from such as lived nearer these times than <hi>Gildas</hi> did, to the first planting of <hi>Christianity</hi> in <hi>Britain?</hi> And yet his, and other Ecclesiastick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are generally receiv'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, and founded on, by our severe Doctor, and Churchmen ought to be tender of them, because without these, Fanaticks and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians might press them very much.</p>
            <p>Another ground whereby I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render it probable that there were such Warrants as these declar'd to have been seen by our Historians, was, that what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd was probable, and ordinary, for our Countrey, and other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97803:65"/>
Countries, as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Domestick Historians call'd <hi>Sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi> and <hi>Bards,</hi> who as Poets preserv'd their Histories. This <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> observes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Powell</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Antiquit. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern. c. 5.</note>

Nor can it be imagin'd, that a Family can rise without getting their Lands from some Kings; nor could they have done considerable Actions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in their service: and so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring their own Genealogies and Actions, could not omit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord those of their Kings. And <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,</hi> in the place cited, <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Praef. p. 28.</note> tells us, that the Histories of Private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were us'd as the Warrants of the General History, and those <hi>Luddus</hi> does cry up as the Warrants he us'd. Nor does <hi>Buchanan</hi> decry them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in opposition to <hi>Luddus</hi> his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them as proofs of these positions onely, that are inconsistent with the <hi>Roman</hi> Contemporary, and other Histories. And in so far I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97803:65"/>
they ought not to be received; but that cannot be alledged against us.</p>
            <p>I urg'd also that it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that we had ancient Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Histories; because we had the <hi>Druids</hi> amongst us who were Priests under <hi>Paganism,</hi> and they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Caesar</hi> to have had the use of Letters. And though <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> does observe that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from consigning to Letters the Mysteries of their Religion, yet it does not follow that therefore they us'd them not, in preserving the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their Kings and memorable Actions. The one proceeded from a design to keep their Mysteries from being subjected to an examination, which they knew these Principles could not bear; and to conciliate a veneration to their Religion from the ignorance of the Admirers, as <hi>Varaeus</hi> also confesses <note n="*" place="margin">De Antiq. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern. c. 5.</note>. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, Letters had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together useless: for in what could they have employed them, if not in this? And since <hi>Caesar</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">De Bell. Gal. l. 6.</note> is positive, that they us'd the <hi>Graecian</hi> Letters,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97803:66"/>
               <hi>in privatis publicisque rationibus,</hi> what can be meant by <hi>publicae ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones,</hi> save their Historical account of things? And this seems the more probable, that many of our Towns and Ports especially, have <hi>Greek</hi> names. And to the Doctor's diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty how the <hi>Druids</hi> could have preserv'd their <hi>Chronology</hi> in these Ancient Times, I answer from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> who tells, that they numbred time by the course of the Moon, and not of the Sun <note n="*" place="margin">L. 17. c. ult.</note>: which proves, that very anciently they used <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology.</hi> Nor does it follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some of the <hi>Druids</hi> are said to have oppos'd the conversion of their People to Christianity, therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them were not zealous for their conversion: even as though the Ancient Philosophers were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally severe Opposers of the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christianity, yet many of them, when converted, were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lights in their time. And therefore I may conclude, that since it is very probable, that our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours would be curious to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Names of their first Kings,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97803:66"/>
and the way of their first settlement: and since they had Letters wherein these might have been preserved: therefore it is probable that they were accordingly preserved. And that these Traditions and Records, as well as the Histories of Private Families relating these were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the custody of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries with us, as elsewhere. So that since four or five Worthy His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians declare, They saw these each a-part, their Testimonies concurring in a probable matter of fact must be as sufficient, as if the Warrants were yet extant; for since these would prove and satisfy in a Legal Trial, much more ought they to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in an Historical one, <hi>quod e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat probandum.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Our Authours vindicated in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts they give of the Genealogy of our Kings.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Doctor being convinced from these undeniable Proofs, that neither <hi>Fordon,</hi> nor <hi>Boethius</hi> did forge the ancient Genealogy of our Kings, which the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> did positively assert, but that they had Warrants and Authorities before their times; He falls upon a new device, and contends that <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> did insert many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the account of the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy preceding him. For as to the particular Genealogy from <hi>Fergus</hi> the First to <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, he hath no account of this from <hi>Fordon,</hi> who hath (as the Doctor says) professed, that he could find nothing particular <note place="margin">Pref. p. 5.</note> concerning them; though he cites se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chronicles; and though <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> mentions an old <hi>High Land</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, a Genealogist, who gives an <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 2.</note>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:97803:67"/>
account of the first Line betwixt the two <hi>Ferguses;</hi> yet the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by him given differs from that, which is owned by <hi>Boeth</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> both in the number, and in the names of our Kings. And this is alledged to have been done of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to put in Regents not owned by the Genealogists, and to support the Law of incapacity, and that he might get mention made of <hi>Reutha, Galdus, Caratacus</hi> and <hi>Donald.</hi> And the Genealogist thus having extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the first Line, doth as much shorten the second Line, betwixt <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third; whereof the Doctor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to give particular Instances. So that the Modern Historians had added more Kings in the Race from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, than are contained in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy betwixt <hi>Fergus</hi> the First and <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second. And, upon the matter, the Genealogist hath made no more Kings in both Races, than the Historians make in the last Race from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor is as culpable in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97803:68"/>
shortning the Royal Line, as the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> He adds also, <note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 60.</note> that <hi>Fordon</hi> mentions another Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of St. <hi>David,</hi> made at the time of his death, which ought not to be attributed to <hi>Baldredus,</hi> but to Cardinal <hi>Walter Wardlaw,</hi> which exactly agrees with that of the <hi>Highlander,</hi> except in the spelling of some few names, from <hi>Fergus the second</hi> upwards, to <hi>Fergus the first.</hi> But the latter part of the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy from St. <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Fergus the second,</hi> being corrupted before <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s time, he would not have it stand in Record against his History, but cut it off with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to <hi>Fergus;</hi> which Caution he forgot, when he did specially insert the <hi>Highlander's</hi> Genealogy from <hi>Alexander the third,</hi> to <hi>Fergus the second.</hi> This is the meaning, as near as I can understand, of the Doctor's words, being in themselves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perplexed. But the Doctor takes notice of a third Genealogy in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which supplies, in some measure, the defects of that of King <hi>David,</hi> and it is the Succession of <hi>Kenneth,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:97803:68"/>
the first Monarch of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and there he takes notice of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Genealogy and our Historians. For he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that he doth agree with the <hi>Highland Genealogy,</hi> except that it hath <hi>Dongare</hi> the Son of <hi>Donald Braick,</hi> which the <hi>Highlander</hi> doth omit, and makes onely ten Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Fergus</hi> and <hi>Kenneth,</hi> whereas our Historians make twenty eight.</p>
            <p>In Answer to this objection, I shall follow the method of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Genealogist, which proceeds ascending from <hi>Alexander the third,</hi> and the Nature of the objection it self, which insists most upon the difference in the Genealogist from our Historians as to the second Line, there being no objection made as to the first, except as to some small difference in the names; and the onely considerable difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Finnanus</hi> and <hi>Caratacus,</hi> which will easily be cleared in answer to the objection against the second Line. And though the Race and Line be the same with <hi>Fergus</hi> downwards; yet with the Doctor
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97803:69"/>
we shall make an Imaginary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of first and second Race: And first; as I applaud the Doctor, who hath better thoughts of <hi>Fordon</hi> (than the Bishop had, who asserted him to have dreamed the History of our Kings) that he was so cautious, as not to set down the accounts that were imparted to him otherwise than in his sleep, because he could not give a full account of them; so I must likewise vindicate <hi>Boeth,</hi> who in his History hath neither dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from, nor contradicted <hi>Fordon,</hi> nor any other of these mentioned Genealogies. For as to <hi>Fordon,</hi> though he gives not a particular account of the Names, times and Actions of all the Kings betwixt the <hi>Ferguses,</hi> yet he doth not profess, that he could find nothing in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, as appears by the words cited by the Doctor himself; <hi>Sed &amp; horum Sigillatim distinguere</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Which is not <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. but <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note>

But as he left Materials for the last and great part of his Book, so he might have increased the first part of his Book in distinguishing these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reigns. But it is likely, these Authours he cites, viz. <hi>Legenda Brendani, Congalli, Grossum caput,</hi> and the several <hi>Chronica,</hi> had nothing concerning these Kings; or that <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> himself had found nothing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concerning them, when he knew so well their Genealogy, both upon the occasion of the death of St. <hi>David,</hi> and the Coronation of King <hi>Alexander?</hi> And as he gives the account of the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 12. 13. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But to come to the <hi>Highland</hi> Genealogist, there is no difference betwixt him and our Historians: for though his number be fewer than that in our Records and Histories, yet the reason is, because our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians mention all that did Reign, whether by Right or by Usurpation, or whether in the Direct or Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Line; the Genealogist doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third from Son to Father in the direct Line,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97803:71"/>
considering that Line onely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that King was descended, amongst whom some were never Kings. The Genealogist begins, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>William,</hi> the Son of <hi>Henry,</hi> the Son of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Doctor objects, that <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Fourth the <hi>Maiden</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Historians, is omitted, and <hi>Henry</hi> placed for him. But this was very reasonable: for St. <hi>David</hi>

And then from <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtoun,</hi> the third Brother by the Families of <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Stuart,</hi> the Royal Race is continued in a direct Line till King <hi>Iames</hi> the Seventh, who now Reigns. So then, if the Genealogist had said, that <hi>William</hi> was Son to his Brother <hi>Malcolm</hi> the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97803:71"/>
               <hi>Maiden,</hi> and not Son to <hi>Henry</hi> his Father, instead of agreeing with our Histories, he had both contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them and common Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>The Doctor next complains, that betwixt <hi>Malcolm, Canmore</hi> and St. <hi>David</hi> four of our Kings are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and, we say, very justly for the same Reason: for <hi>Donald</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth was <hi>Malcolm</hi>'s Brother, and <hi>Duncan</hi> his <hi>Bastard</hi> Son, none of whom had right to Reign. And though <hi>Malcolm</hi> had two elder Sons, <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the First, who did successively Reign, yet they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Children of their own, the Succession did devolve upon St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the youngest Son.</p>
            <p>The third Objection is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <note place="margin">Ford. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. at the beginning. Maj. <hi>lib. 3. c.</hi> 5. Boeth. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. Buch. <hi>l.</hi> 7. Les<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Duncan,</hi> and <hi>Malcolm Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> the Historians put <hi>Machaboeus,</hi> whom the Genealogist omits, and very reasonably: for he was a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral by <hi>Dovada</hi> Second Daughter to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Second, and usurped the Succession before <hi>Malcolm Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> who was Son of <hi>Duncan.</hi> and was great Grand-child to <hi>Malcolm</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:97803:72"/>
the Second by his eldest Daughter <hi>Beatrix,</hi> whom the Genealogist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, though she was never a Queen, because by her the Succession was continued.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's fourth and main Objection is, that betwixt <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Second, and <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Son of <hi>Alpin,</hi> the Genealogist inserts none, whereas our Historians insert thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; viz. <hi>Donald</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Second, <hi>Ethus</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, Gregory the Great, Donald</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Third. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi> the First, <hi>Indulphus, Duffus, Culenus, Kenneth</hi> the Third, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Grimus.</hi> Here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I acknowledge the Doctor hath discovered an Errour; but I think it must be of the Writer, or at worst in the <hi>Highland</hi> Genealogist his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory or Expressions. And it is very happy, that it hath fallen out in this place, otherwise <hi>Fordon</hi> as well as <hi>Boeth</hi> might be suspected of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or that they inserted these Kings to serve their own ends: For even the Doctor's worthy Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Ubbo Emmius</hi> and <hi>Boxhornius,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:97803:72"/>
who have deserved so well of him, because they are most injuriously extravagant; as to the Antiquity of our Kings, do admit the truth of this Genealogy, after <hi>Kenneth</hi> who subdued the <hi>Picts.</hi> There are four indeed here omitted in the direct Line; <hi>Constantine</hi> the second Son to <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Second, <hi>Donald</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Malcolm</hi> the First, <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third, <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Second's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Besides nine Collateral, viz. <hi>Donald</hi> the fifth Brother to <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Second, <hi>Ethus Alipes, Constantine</hi> the Second's Brother, <hi>Gregory</hi> Son to <hi>Dongallus, Constantine</hi> the Third Son to <hi>Ethus, Indulphus Constantine</hi> the Third his Son, <hi>Duffus, Malcolm</hi> the First his eldest Son, <hi>Culenus, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> his Son, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Fourth <hi>Culenus</hi> his Son, and <hi>Grimus, Duffus</hi> his Son, who were all Collateral to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Second. I shall give a very probable account of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of the Genealogist in this place. We see that it is twice <hi>Kenneth</hi> and <hi>Malcolm; Kenneth</hi> the Second and <hi>Malcolm</hi> the First, and <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third, who was Father to <hi>Malcolm</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:97803:73"/>
the Second. The Transcriber hath thought, he had transcribed the First <hi>Kenneth</hi> and <hi>Malcolm,</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and <hi>Donald</hi> that were betwixt them, and so hath omitted them, and proceeded to <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third, who was Father to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. As in reading or writing, if two Lines begin with one word, the Reader or Writer ordinarily omitteth one of the Lines by mistake. And as this was no design in <hi>Fordon,</hi> so it could not be ignorance: for he describes particularly all those omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Kings, and there is also a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Genealogy of them subjoyn'd to the end of <hi>Fordon</hi>'s Book in the Genealogy of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And if any man make a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of persons, and draw out a Summary of their Genealogy, if there be any difference, the Summary must be regulated by the History, and not the History by the Summary.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's fifth Objection is, that betwixt <hi>Alpin</hi> and <hi>Achaius</hi> the Historians put <hi>Convallus</hi> and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallus;</hi> and very reasonably, because <hi>Convallus</hi> was <hi>Fergus</hi>'s third Son,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97803:73"/>
and <hi>Dongallus</hi> was <hi>Solvathius</hi>'s Son, and so Collateral, to shew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of our Historians, as well in <note place="margin">Ford. <hi>lib. 3, &amp;</hi> 4. Maj. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. Boeth. <hi>lib.</hi> 8, 9, 10. Buch. <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</note> the Collateral, as in the direct Line. The degree of Proximity of every Person is proved by our Historians from <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Second till <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>The next Objection is, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Genealogist and our Historians, from King <hi>Othabin</hi> Son of <hi>Aydan,</hi> whom <hi>Fordon</hi> calls <hi>Ethodius bind,</hi> and our Historians, <hi>Eugenius</hi> (a Grand difference in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) and <hi>Achaius</hi> the Second Son of <hi>Etfin,</hi> who was Son of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Seventh, who was Son of <hi>Findan</hi> who was never King, Son of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fifth, Son of <hi>Dongard</hi> never King, second Son to <hi>Donald Braik,</hi> second Son to <hi>Eugenius bin:</hi> For here there is both difference of Kings, and many omitted. It is true, that here there is the like Errour committed in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing with the former: for the Genealogist, betwixt <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Seventh, (whom he calls <hi>Ethac)</hi> and <hi>Donald Braik,</hi> he omits <hi>Dongard, Eugenius</hi> the Fifth; and <hi>Fordon</hi>'s
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97803:74"/>
Genealogy of <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Great, to <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, mentions <hi>Dongard,</hi> but omits <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Findan.</hi> Which errour of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seems to have proceeded, because there are two of the name of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> so near together, that he thought, when he wrote <hi>Eugenius,</hi> he had written all that had preceded <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Seventh, and did the more easily forget <hi>Dongard</hi> and <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> because they were not so well known, as never having been Kings. But the mistake cannot be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a design, seeing there is no advantage in it, and it is in omitting and not in adding any that never were of the right Line, and falls hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily out, where our Antiquity is not questioned by any but by <hi>Ubbo Emmius,</hi> and <hi>Boxhornius.</hi> For even <hi>Iocelin</hi> and St. <hi>Asaph</hi> do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Scots</hi> to have been setled under <hi>Aydan</hi> mentioned by <hi>Beda,</hi> as the Father of this <hi>Ethodius bind.</hi> And the Doctor himself does settle this Scepticism concerning the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> of the Settlement of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> under <hi>Aydan,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97803:74"/>
of the Seventh <hi>Century;</hi> but is uncertain, if, or how much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before that time. And it could not be ignorance in <hi>Fordon,</hi> who describes all the particular Reigns of these Kings. And in the opinion of <hi>Boeth, Findan</hi> is not omitted; for he makes <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Seventh not to be Grand-child to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fifth by <hi>Findan,</hi> but immediately Son to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fifth. The rest of these intervening Kings were Collaterals, viz. <hi>Ferchard</hi> the Second Son of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the First, <hi>Malduine</hi> eldest Son to <hi>Donald Braik, Eugenius</hi> the Sixth <hi>Ferchard</hi>'s second Son, <hi>Amberkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus Findan</hi>'s eldest Son, <hi>Murdach</hi> his Son, <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Eighth and <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vathius,</hi> these four lineally descending from one another in the Collateral Line; <hi>Fergus</hi> the Third eldest Son of <hi>Etfin</hi> and elder Brother to <hi>Achaius, Ethas,</hi> or <hi>Ethachi,</hi> or whether <hi>Et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin</hi> or <hi>Ethafind.</hi> But I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Genealogist calls <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thafind</hi> Son to <hi>Ethdre,</hi> but he calls him Son to <hi>Ethachi;</hi> or that the Genealogist calls <hi>Eugenius Ethac.</hi> Indeed the Genealogist calls him
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97803:75"/>
               <hi>Ethachi,</hi> whom <hi>Fordon</hi> in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of <hi>Kenneth</hi> calls <hi>Eugenius.</hi> But these are idle remarks. His Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection betwixt <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second and <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth is, that the Genealogist makes <hi>Dongall</hi> to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Fergus,</hi> and, leaves out <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Second; very reasonable indeed, because <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Second though eldest Son, had no Succession, and to <hi>Dongard Cobren</hi> succeeds, and to him <hi>Aydan</hi> the Father of <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> And there are left out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Kings mentioned by our Historians <hi>Constantine</hi> the First, whom the Doctor calls <hi>Constantius,</hi> because he was <hi>Dongard</hi>'s younger Brother, and <hi>Congallus Dongard</hi>'s el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son, because he did not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Line, his Line being extinct after the Death of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Third, <hi>Convallus</hi> and <hi>Kinnatell</hi> his three Sons, and <hi>Kenneth</hi> the first Son to <hi>Convallus</hi> his Grand-child. But the Doctor makes no mention of <hi>Kenneth,</hi> but in place of him saith, that <hi>Conranus</hi> is omitted by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogist, as if <hi>Conranus</hi> and <hi>Cobre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> might not pass for one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:97803:75"/>
Against the first Race, his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are much lighter, and so I shall not be so special in giving An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. His noticing the difference of names is very pretty, betwixt <hi>Arnidal</hi> and <hi>Dornadill, Rowen</hi> and <hi>Rether,</hi> not <hi>Nothatus,</hi> as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor mistakes (for <hi>Nothatus</hi> being <hi>Dornadill</hi>'s Brother a Collateral, he is left by the Genealogist as such) and <hi>Rutha</hi> for <hi>Reuda,</hi> and <hi>Ther</hi> for <hi>Thereus,</hi> and <hi>Rosine</hi> for <hi>Iosin,</hi> and <hi>Corbre</hi> for <hi>Corbred,</hi> and <hi>Daradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> for <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and that <hi>Corbre</hi>'s Sirname of <hi>Galdus</hi> was forgot; and <hi>Luthach</hi> for <hi>Lugtacus,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galama</hi> for <hi>Mogallus,</hi> and <hi>Coner</hi> for <hi>Conarus, Ethach</hi> for <hi>Ethodius,</hi> and <hi>Fiachrach</hi> for <hi>Satrahell,</hi> and <hi>Athir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi> for <hi>Athirco, Findachar</hi> for <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochus, Thrinkline</hi> for <hi>Crathilinthus, Fencormach</hi> for <hi>Fincormachus, Romaich</hi> for <hi>Romachus,</hi> and <hi>Enegussa,</hi> which the Doctor acknowledgeth is plainly <hi>Angusianus,</hi> though it be not so plain as many others of the rest he Quarrels, <hi>Fethelmech</hi> for <hi>Fethelmachus,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusafich</hi> and <hi>Etheat</hi> for <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Ethodius, Erthus</hi> for <hi>Eirch.</hi> And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97803:76"/>
so to have named this Objection is to refute it, being the difference one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt a <hi>Latine</hi> Termination and a <hi>Vulgar,</hi> betwixt a <hi>Highland</hi> and a <hi>Lowland.</hi> And if he will take the pains to compare, how these same Names are written in <hi>Fordon,</hi> and how in <hi>Major,</hi> he will find the like difference. And if he will not rest satisfied, he is referred to <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hertie</hi> in his Preface for a fuller An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But <hi>Feritharis</hi> and King <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald,</hi> the first Christian King, and <hi>Nathalocus,</hi> and other two <hi>Donalds</hi> are excluded by this ancient Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists; and very reasonably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Feritharis</hi> was Brother to King <hi>Fergus</hi> the First; and <hi>Donald,</hi> because he was Brother to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trael.

Line; <hi>Donald</hi> the Third called of the Isles, an <hi>Usurper,</hi> and <hi>Donald</hi> the Second Brother to <hi>Findoch.</hi> And what though the Genealogist by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake hath called <hi>Rosin</hi> the Son of <hi>Ther,</hi> when he was his Brother? and <hi>Ethodius</hi> the Son of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> when he was his Brother? If the Genealogist had mentioned all our Kings that did Reign, and had called the next always Son to the former King, he had committed this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour oftner. And it hath not been <hi>Fordon</hi>'s ignorance: for he tells that <hi>Ethodius</hi> was Brother to <hi>Eugenius.</hi> But the Doctor says, After this you find a greater difference: for instead of <hi>Finnanus, Durstus, Evenus, Gillus, Evenus</hi> the Second, <hi>Ederus, Evenus</hi> the Third, <hi>Metellanus, Caratacus,</hi> we find there onely <hi>Dethach, Iau, Alje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, Even, Ederskeoli, Comermore.</hi> It seems, the Doctor hath taken this at second hand; for if he had looked either the Genealogy of King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> or King <hi>David,</hi> he would have found <hi>Fin,</hi> which is the same with <hi>Finnanus.</hi> But the Doctor might have known, that such a small
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97803:77"/>
difference in names and numbers doth not overthrow the verity of a Genealogy from his Friend <hi>Flahertie</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Io. Linceus,</hi> who takes the name of <hi>Lucius Gratianus</hi> in <hi>Cambr. evers.</hi> as in the Genealogy of the Scripture <hi>Cainan</hi> is interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betwixt <hi>Arphaxad</hi> and <hi>Sala,</hi> who tells, that such like Errours may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one Person's having two names, or by taking a Brother for a Father, or the like mistake of the Writer; where the Line may be a little lengthned or shortned, the Tract of it remaining the same. But here, besides the difference of <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Lowland</hi> Language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Alexander</hi> is called <hi>Alaster,</hi> and <hi>Archibald Gillespie, Gillus</hi> was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Usurper, and <hi>Evenus</hi> a Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to <hi>Durstus,</hi> as appears by our Historians <hi>Boeth, Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Lesly.</hi> As to the Genealogy of St. <hi>David,</hi> it is subjoyn'd immediately to <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredus</hi> his Lamentation about him; and, whether it be his, or Cardinal <hi>Wardlaw</hi>'s, it furnisheth still ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient and more credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, a Cardinal. But perhaps he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97803:77"/>
was not Cardinal, when he told <hi>Fordon</hi> the Genealogy, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and the Transcriber of the <hi>Scotichronicon</hi> hath given him his most honourable Name. And though he died in <hi>Robert</hi> the First of the <hi>Stuart's</hi> time, yet he was <hi>Archidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus</hi> of <hi>Lothian,</hi> and Secretary to King <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Bruce,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 14. cap: 27.</note> 
               <hi>Scotichronicon.</hi> And <hi>Fordon</hi> saith of the account from him, <hi>Dudum acceperat,</hi> and prefixeth a Preface, in which he asserts, that St. <hi>David</hi> was descended from a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ancient Race of Kings, who had preserv'd their Kingdom free from Slavery longer than any other Race of Kings had done, and had resisted or expelled all such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies as had invaded them.

This doth not agree with the Doctor's Origin of us after the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and our dependence upon them. This <hi>Wardlaw</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> is design'd in <hi>Scotichronicon</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the account and Verses appear to be far ancienter, than either <hi>Wardlaw</hi> or <hi>Fordon,</hi> otherwise <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had hardly ever cited the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Contemporary with himself, and of one who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a younger man. And as to the Pretence, that the passing from the first Line before <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second will cut off the Pretence of esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the Regents, and incapacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sons of Kings being <hi>Minors,</hi> This appears evidently to be false. For long after <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second's time, the Collaterals did certainly succeed, till that evil Custome was abrogated by <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third, about 700 years agoe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many Murthers and Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were committed upon these Kings of the first Race, their times being more barbarous, what is that to the purpose? Were they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97803:78"/>
never in being, or not Kings? Doth not <hi>Flahertie</hi> tell us, that of the first hundred thirty six Kings of <hi>Ireland; Centum ferrum sustulit, sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temdecim naturae concesserunt, sex pestis absumpsit; tres fulmine percussi, &amp; decem diversis aliis modis, singuli vivis excesserunt?</hi> Were there not Murthers and Usurpations in our second Race, and hath not the like been every where? And doth not the Doctor remember of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third of <hi>England,</hi> who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who were his own Nephews, and usurped the Crown? And the inserting these, to lengthen the Line in favour of Regents had been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: for by a clear Law these were cut off in <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third's time; and so our Historians need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the help of forged Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in this. So that I can see no Design nor Politick in <hi>Fordon</hi> nor <hi>Boeth,</hi> in this number and account they give of our Kings, nor that they have differed from the Genealogist, nor that the <hi>Highland</hi> Genealogist hath shortned the Royal Line, as the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97803:79"/>
Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> hath done. And the Doctor ought to have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that I did undertake onely to maintain the Antiquity of our Royal Line at the least; to refute the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> of a Settlement in the Year 503, and not to vindicate every passage and part of our History which cannot be done, as to any profane History.</p>
            <p>By all which I may conclude most convincingly, that these three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given of the Genealogies of our Kings are so far from Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting our History, that they agree with it, and being inserted in three several Genealogies, <hi>prior</hi> to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and being exprest by them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very solemn occasions they do fortifie much the truth of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of the Royal Line, and that <hi>Fordon</hi> did not dream the same, but inserted these Genealogies in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story from good Authours and by good Authority.</p>
            <p>The Reader may for his better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Answers formerly made, take a general view of this complex matter, as sum'd up in these short Positions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:97803:79"/>
I. That the <hi>Highland</hi> Gentleman was obliged to ascend from Son to Father, as all Genealogies do; and consequently he was obliged to name some who were not Kings, because they were Fathers to Kings.</p>
            <p n="2">II. He was obliged to omit Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals, because, though they were Kings, yet they were not such as were comprehended within the Gradation from Son to Father, whereas our History rightly sets down those who succeeded as Brothers, as well as Sons.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In this Genealogy some are omitted, as Bastards, and other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers; and so should not have been insert in a Genealogy to be repeated before the King, though they were likewise expressed in our Histories, they having Reigned <hi>de facto,</hi> though not <hi>de jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. The greatest doubt, that is made by the Doctor himself, as to our Kings, is since <hi>Fergus</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, after which, the <hi>Irish</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acknowledge our Historical Genealogy; or after <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Second, since which time even
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97803:80"/>
               <hi>Ubbo Emmius</hi> does assert the truth of our History. And so any difference betwixt our History and Genealogy must arise from the mistake of the Genealogist's memory, or the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber's negligence; and I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended upon a probable Ground of mistake.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Most of the Difficulties arise from the difference of Names of the same Persons, which is very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in all Genealogies.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. There could be no Design in our Historians inserting any to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Right of Regents: for the Succession of Regents was condemn'd by a positive Law, before some of these controverted Kings did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is not imaginable, that our Historians would insert in their Histories contradictory Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: for that were so palpable, that, though it could have escaped one Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, yet it could not have escaped many.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. To illustrate farther the whole matter, I have subjoyned the Tree of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97803:80"/>
Predecessours, both in the Direct and Collateral Line, whereby it doth evidently appear, that all his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours mentioned by the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logist were in the direct Line, and that these Kings of whom the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogist made no mention, were onely Collaterals to King <hi>Alexander;</hi> whose Genealogy was recited. And I have also farther continued this Genealogy in a direct Line from St. <hi>David</hi> by the Families of <hi>Bruce,</hi> and <hi>Stuart</hi> to King <hi>Iames</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who now Reigns.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogy of our Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the accounts given by the Chronicle of <hi>Melross,</hi> and both compared with the Genealogies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Histories; with a full proof, that our Historians are to be preferred to the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals as to this point: <hi>Ogygia</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Having urg'd, that our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were to be believed in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, such as are the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of our Kings, they being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Men of Authority; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared, that they extracted their Histories from Authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, though now lost: And these matters of fact being probable in themselves, and adminiculated by the current of Foreign Histories and Authours, except our Adversaries should redargue them by Authours living in the time, or more credible, which were inconsistent with them.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97803:81"/>
The Doctor did therefore urge the inconsistency of our Genealogies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, which I have fully answered in the preceding Chapter, and their inconsistency with the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals, which he contends are to be preferred to ours, We being descended from the <hi>Irish,</hi> and they having more ancient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals than ours; which I am to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in this Chapter. And, for the preference of our Histories in the point of Credibility, I adduce these following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No History can be discredited, as uncertain and fabulous, upon the Testimony and Authority of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther History, except that other His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory be acknowledg'd by both the Debaters; but much less, where it is reprobated by him, who urges an Argument from it. But so it is, that Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> himself does treat the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals in Ridicule, as to the remote part of their Antiquity, in his Preface, <hi>page</hi> 33. and <hi>Chap. 5. p.</hi> 272. where he proves, that they had not sufficient Warrants before <note place="margin">Pref. p. 47.</note>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:97803:82"/>
the Eleventh Century, which is long after the time, wherein both the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that we were setled here. And consequently the Authority of their History is not sufficient to overturn the time of our settlement, as it is asserted by our Historians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We desire to know, what War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the <hi>Irish</hi> had within six Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Iaphet?</hi> Especially to warrant them, not onely to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon particular actions, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and adminiculated by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Histories, but even to be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in the coming of some from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

                  <hi>Ogyg.</hi> part 3. cap. 1.</note> just 40 days before the Floud. And that <hi>Partholanus,</hi> and others, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ogyg.</hi> part 3. cap. 2.</note> arrived in <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 312. after the Floud, in the month of <hi>May,</hi> the 14th of the Moon, and upon <hi>Wednesday.</hi> And how the Doctor should urge this History against ours, as sufficient to overturn the credibility of ours, when he will not allow us to know so much, as when our Nation at first setled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and who was our first King, about
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97803:82"/>
2000 years after that time, when the <hi>Romans,</hi> who lived long in our Neighbourhood, in <hi>France,</hi> and fought long with us, are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have had the use of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the way of calculating time: both which were absolutely unknown in the Ages mentioned in the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals. And either the <hi>Irish</hi> had the exact knowledge of Letters, and the calculation of time, when our first Colonies came over from them, or not: If they had them; why not we likewise? and so the Doctor does unjustly object to us, that our Histories are not to be believed, because we wanted both these. Or if the <hi>Irish</hi> had them not, our History cannot be overturned by the Authority of theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's acknowledg'd by all the <hi>Irish,</hi> except <hi>Iocelin;</hi> that we were at least setled here since the Year 503. and so since that time we must understand the History and descent of our own Kings better than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation can doe; nor should any man debate with these that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97803:83"/>
deny this principle. But so it is, that since that time, the <hi>Irish</hi> accompt of the descent of our Kings differs extremely from ours; for they will have <hi>Loarn</hi> to have been our first King, and elder Brother to <hi>Fergus,</hi> whereas our Story makes no mention at all of any such King, but makes <hi>Fergus the Second</hi> the Restorer of our Monarchy. And their Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue calls him <hi>Fergusius Magnus,</hi> a title never given to him who founds, but to him who augments the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. And how can any man imagine, that a Nation would have forgot who was the Founder of their Monarchy, and being so late, and yet have remembred his Brothers, and all the rest of the Line; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since <hi>Loarn</hi> is said to have reign'd ten years, as <hi>Offlahartie</hi> says. We make <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Second to have succeeded to this King <hi>Fergus,</hi> but they make <hi>Domangardus</hi> to have succeeded to him.</p>
            <p>They make <hi>Congallus</hi> to have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Domangardus,</hi> but we make <hi>Constantine</hi> the First to have
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97803:83"/>
succeeded to <hi>Dongardus,</hi> whom I conceive they make <hi>Domangardus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To our <hi>Corranus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Gouranus,</hi> did succeed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Third; but he makes <hi>Conallus</hi> to have succeeded to him.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Congallus</hi> succeeded truly <hi>Kenatellus,</hi> but he makes <hi>Ayda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to have succeeded to him.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Aydanus</hi> succeeded <hi>Keneth</hi> the First, but he makes <hi>Achaius</hi> the First to have succeeded to him.</p>
            <p>The differences after him, will best appear in these Columns, which may likewise be observed from the beginning of this period.</p>

            <p>So that, comparing. <hi>Flahertie</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with ours, we shall find them to differ in names, the times of their Reign, and Degrees of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity, the <hi>Irish</hi> omitting some who did Reign, and inserting others who never Reign'd, or at least, who Reign'd not near these times, in which they are placed.</p>
            <p>My fourth Argument shall be, That after the Year 503 we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be setled, and to have had a distinct Kingdom from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to have had the learned Monastery of <hi>Icolmkill,</hi> from which Swarms of learned Men were sent to all places; But especially to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97803:84"/>
the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Lindesfarne,</hi> to whom <hi>Aidan, Finan</hi> and <hi>Colman</hi> were sent <hi>Bishops,</hi> as St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and <hi>Flahertie</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. And therefore it cannot be denied, but that our Histories must be much better believed, than either the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals, or the Chronicle of <hi>Melross,</hi> though they agreed in what they differed from our Histories; But much more, when they contradict one another; especially when their differences are very considerable. And since the Chronicle of <hi>Melross</hi> is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so Authentick by the Bishop and the Doctor; it must be concluded, that, when that Chronicle differs very much from the <hi>Irish,</hi> and comes near to ours, ours must be preferred to the <hi>Irish</hi> in point of Credibility. But so it is that all this will appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the three, in so far as concerns the Genealogies of our Kings, from <hi>Murdachus,</hi> to <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>By our Histories and Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, <hi>Murdachus</hi> was Son to <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kellethus,</hi> and began to Reign <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 715, whereas by the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Mailross</hi> he is made the Son of <hi>Ewam</hi> as he was indeed Successour
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97803:85"/>
to <hi>Ewam,</hi> or <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Uncle, <note place="margin">Chron. Mail. <hi>p. 136. edit.</hi> Oxon. 1684.</note> though not his Son, and he is called <hi>Murizant,</hi> and he is said there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Reign <hi>Anno</hi> 741. But by the <hi>Irish</hi> Catalogue of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings in <hi>Ogygia,</hi> his Reign is said to <note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 480.</note> begin <hi>Anno</hi> 733.</p>
            <p>By our History, <hi>Etfinus,</hi> Son to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> begun his Reign <hi>Anno</hi> 730. By the Chronicle, <hi>Ewen,</hi> Son to <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizant, Anno</hi> 744. By the Catalogue, <hi>Dongallus</hi> Son of <hi>Selvachus,</hi> is said to succeed his Cousin German <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dachus, Anno</hi> 736. Whereas <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallus</hi> did not succeed till the Year 824. Nor did <hi>Solvathius</hi> succeed till the Year 767.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Etfin</hi> succeeded <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who began to Reign <hi>Anno</hi> 761. according to our History. By the Chronicle, <hi>Hedobbus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ewen,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Ewen, Anno</hi> 747. By the Catalogue <hi>Achaius</hi> the Fourth suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Dongall, Anno</hi> 743, and <hi>Offlahartie</hi> the Authour of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue subjoyns to this King an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that in divers Copies of this Poem or Catalogue. <hi>Selvachus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaius</hi> the Third, <hi>Achaius</hi> the Fourth,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97803:85"/>
and <hi>Achaius</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Gregory</hi> are wanting; which shews, of how small Authority this Poem or Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue should be: for <hi>Achaius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> are two of the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and uncontroverted of all our Kings in these Periods. For <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaius</hi> did make the League with <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and is mentioned in many Histories beside ours. And <hi>Gregory</hi> lived after the time of <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> the Second, and is Sirnamed the Great, because of the Victory over the <hi>Britains, Irish</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and this is acknowledged, and is cited as such in the famous debate betwixt us and the <hi>English</hi> before the Pope. <hi>Selvachus</hi> also is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Chronicle of <hi>Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ross.</hi> But the secret and true Reason of this suggestion is, that he might obviate the objection from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the number, and suppress <hi>Achaius,</hi> because they will have the League not to be made with him, but with the <hi>Irish;</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he invaded <hi>Ireland.</hi> O! How witty are these Contrivances?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:97803:86"/>
To <hi>Eugenius</hi> succeeded <hi>Fergus</hi> the Third, who began his reign <hi>Anno</hi> 764. By the Chronicle to <hi>Hed</hi> succeeded <hi>Fergus</hi> his Son, <hi>Anno</hi> 777. By the Catalogue, <hi>Aidus fin</hi> the First, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Ethfinn,</hi> succeeded to <hi>Achaius</hi> the Fourth his Father, <hi>Anno</hi> 748. whereas truly <hi>Achaius</hi> was not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Etfin;</hi> but <hi>Etfin</hi> was Father to <hi>Achaius.</hi>

            <p>Here are many Kings, of whom the Nation, where they are said to have Reigned in a very late and uncontroverted time, know nothing, and in which the <hi>Irish</hi> not onely
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97803:86"/>
differ from us, but also from the Chronicle of <hi>Mailross,</hi> which seems to have been written by some <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Borderers, who though they have somewhat carelesly observed what was doing among us; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Neighbourhood and Commerce, have understood the same better than the <hi>Irish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's likewise observable, that by Collationing that Period of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of our Kings, from <hi>Fergus</hi> 2 to <hi>Malcolm</hi> 3; the <hi>Irish</hi> Catalogue in <hi>Ogygia,</hi> allows from the 503 to the 1057, being 554 years for 51 Kings which is very short, whereas we allow from the 404 to 1057, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 653 years for 46 Kings, which is far more probable in it self, and more agreeable to the Doctor's obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who allows twenty five years <note place="margin">Praef. p. 25.</note> to a Generation, according to the most received opinion; whereas this Calculation allows onely ten years, and about ten Months to every King, even in those ancient times when Men lived long. And whereas it is still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> that he augmented the number of our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97803:87"/>
Kings, by inserting Collaterals to support the Law of incapacity; and to make the long account of time seem probable. It's answered, that this objection is fully satisfied, both by the Authority of the Chronicle of <hi>Mailross,</hi> and this <hi>Irish</hi> Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which insert Collaterals, as well as those of the direct Line. And if all these Kings named by them had been in the direct Line, that great number of fifty two joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Collaterals, had made the number of our Kings in that Period to have come near to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and thus each King to have had about six years allow'd him.</p>
            <p>I had not fully considered the <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogies when I insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Argument from <hi>Carbre Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fachair,</hi> and now I acknowledge that my own Argument from that Book was of no moment, and to shew my ingenuity I pass from it. But the reason why I said then, that there might be a hundred years allowed for a Man's Life, is because the Civil Law allows so much, and a Man is never presumed to be dead, till it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97803:87"/>
is proved he lived an hundred years; but I confess the Doctor's Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Censorinus,</hi> of what makes a Generation, holds ordinarily true; and is to be preferred in the accounts of Genealogy.</p>
            <p>My fifth Argument against the <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogy is, That it differs not onely from ours and from that account in the Abbacy of <hi>Mailross,</hi> but from all the <hi>French</hi> Historians, and our ancient Records yet extant; by which it is clear, that our King <hi>Achaius</hi> entred in League with the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charlemain:</hi> whereas the exact <hi>Offlahartie,</hi> makes onely this <hi>French</hi> League to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into with <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth in the Year 1380, which fell in the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ogyg.</hi> Pr. p. 27.</note> time of King <hi>Robert</hi> the Second, and adds, that this League was made by <hi>Robert Stewart, Lord d'Aubigny,</hi> in which he confounds two known Stories, that he may contradict <hi>Wardaeus</hi> his Countreyman; for it is indeed true, that the ancient League was renewed with King <hi>Robert</hi> the First of the <hi>Stewarts, Anno</hi> 1380, the Original whereof is yet extant in our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97803:88"/>
Records, and whereof the Copy is in <hi>Fordon:</hi> But this League was treated by Cardinal <hi>Wardlaw</hi> for us, and the <hi>Count d'Bryan</hi> for the <hi>French,</hi> and the same League was again renewed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1425, by <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> Constable of <hi>France,</hi> for the <hi>French;</hi> and <hi>Wardaeus</hi> makes this last Treaty to be the first that was made betwixt our Kings and the <hi>French:</hi> and <hi>Offlahartie,</hi> not to contradict him, has joyned the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who treated the one League, with the time wherein the other was treated. But that there was a League betwixt our <hi>Achaius</hi> and <hi>Charlmaigne,</hi> or at least long before the Year 1380, is most uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertable for these Reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>French</hi> Historians acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this League was betwixt <hi>Achaius</hi> and <hi>Charlemain;</hi> and I have proved by <hi>Eguinard</hi> Secretary to the said <hi>Charlemain,</hi> that there was great Correspondence betwixt them; and that he esteemed very much the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> As also, I have proved from <hi>Italian</hi> Authours,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97803:88"/>
that there were Families descended of our <hi>Scotland</hi> setled in <hi>Italy,</hi> who came over with <hi>William</hi> Brother to the said <hi>Achaius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Not onely does <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who lived then in <hi>France,</hi> set down the Articles of that Treaty, and the several times it was renewed; but <hi>Fordon</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 14. c. 44.</note> does expresly insert the League that was betwixt <hi>Robert</hi> the Second, first of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> and the King of <hi>France.</hi> Wherein the King of <hi>France</hi> acknowledges even at that time, the old Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Leagues, <hi>√† longo tempore, inter Praedecessores nostros Reges fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matae &amp; connexae;</hi> and the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> on the other part expresses, <hi>Confoederatio inter illustres Reges Franciae &amp; avum nostrum,</hi> this was <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce;</hi> and adds, <hi>Et ab olim facta &amp; diutius observata.</hi> And to instruct this part of <hi>Fordon</hi>'s Story, as well as the League it self, we have the Original League with King <hi>Robert</hi> the First yet extant, and <note place="margin">Lib. 11. c. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Baliol</hi> (then pretended King of <hi>Scotland)</hi> refused to joyn with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97803:89"/>
               <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> against <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> because of the ancient League made by their Predecessours <hi>Charlemain</hi> and <hi>Achaius, Et usque nunc inconcus√® servata.</hi> Whereupon a League is renewed and confirmed by a Marriage, the Tenour whereof is also extant in <hi>Fordon,</hi> who also sets down the Tenour of the Pope's Bull, prohibiting <hi>Alexander</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, our King, to continue in his League with the King of <hi>France,</hi> but to joyn with the King of <hi>England;</hi> and, as an effect of these Leagues, <hi>Marianus</hi> (whom the <hi>Irish</hi> call their Countrey-man, albeit they also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that he called our Countrey <hi>Scotia)</hi> mentions, that <hi>Anno</hi> 1070, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French</hi> wasted the <hi>English:</hi> Which shews, that this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance was much elder, than either the 1425, or the 1380, as <hi>O Flaher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> asserts: And therefore, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Historian the <hi>Sieur Varillas</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Education du Prince, l. 1. chap. 1. p. 39.</note> relates, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour did advise him not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> would enter into his Interests, because the Alliance of that Nation with the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97803:89"/>
               <hi>French</hi> had lasted seven hundred Years, without interruption, from King to King, before that time. And by these we may see, what a just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <hi>Ubbo Emmius</hi> is, who rejects our History for many years after this Alliance, and how judiciously he is produced by the Doctor. But, though the <hi>French</hi> could have been mistaken in all their Histories, yet it is not imaginable, that they would have bestowed great Privileges and Rewards upon us for Services done by the <hi>Irish;</hi> and that the Families, who came over at that time, would not have own'd themselves to be descended from the <hi>Irish,</hi> and not from us.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, to induce his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to believe, that we are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">Praef. p. 4. 46.</note> in the Genealogies of our own Kings, pretends that the true Reason of the mistake of the <hi>Scotish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> was, that we finding, that there was a <hi>Fergus</hi> in the <hi>Irish</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy called <hi>Fortis</hi> or <hi>Fortamalius,</hi> who Reigned truly in 3775, and that in the descent of that <hi>Fergus</hi> there was a <hi>Conar;</hi> and from him
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97803:90"/>
               <hi>Rieda</hi> called by the <hi>Irish Carbre Rieda,</hi> and by us <hi>Eoch</hi> and <hi>Ried;</hi> and that there were several other Names in our Genealogies agreeing with the Genealogies of the <hi>Irish,</hi> as <hi>Eochoid,</hi> who was Father to <hi>Erk,</hi> and is acknowledged by both to be Father to <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second; the Doctor from all this concludes, that the Original mistake lay in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogy to the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imagined, or would have others believe, that all the Kings mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Erk</hi> were Kings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so went back by degrees, till we made up a formal Story of forty Kings.</p>
            <p>To this we Answer; That it were a strange thing, that our Story, which we have so well prov'd, should be overturned by the Doctor's mere Conjecture; especially, seeing there is no Ground for such a Conjecture from any of these Steps on which the Doctor founds his Probability. No Authour, for ought we can see, concurs with the Doctor in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, as to <hi>Fergus;</hi> and <hi>O-Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hertie,</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:97803:90"/>
who pretends that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands <note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 468.</note> the differences betwixt the Descents and the Reasons thereof, goes no higher than <hi>Conar</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And speaking twice of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 114, &amp; 264.</note> 
               <hi>Fortis,</hi> he makes not at all him to be the first Authour of our Race. 2. If we had not had a sure Warrant of the Settlement and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of our Kings, but had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inserted the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as ours, from a vanity to be thought Ancient; it is more probable by the same Reason, that we would have improved it to a Story of twice forty Kings backwards. And why should the Doctor make us to have sisted in <hi>Fergusius Fortis</hi> rather, than in <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Rogius,</hi> or <hi>Fergusius Denti-niger,</hi> both Kings in <hi>Ireland</hi> before <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second? 3. That there could be no Ground for our sisting in <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius fortis,</hi> is very clear: for he reign'd <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3775, whereas our <hi>Fergus</hi> began to Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3641, and so we had lost 134 years of our Antiquity; and we should rather have fixed upon <hi>Hugonius Magnus,</hi> who began to Reign 3619.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97803:91"/>
and consequently agreed with the true time of our Settlement, and there had been a more probable Conjecture from what is said in <hi>Ogygia,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Reactus</hi> immediate Predecessour to <hi>Hugonius,</hi> in whose time it's said from the Manuscript of <hi>O-Duveganus,</hi> that one <hi>Ferc</hi> made a descent into <hi>Albania,</hi> and conquered it; and this <hi>Ferc</hi> might have been more probably said to have been <hi>Ferqhard,</hi> and so to have made way for the Settlementof <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> his Son as King here.</p>
            <p>The next step of this Conjecture is, that wherein <hi>O-Flahertie</hi> agrees with the Doctor, and <hi>O-Flahertie</hi> asserts, that all the Antiquaries of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> agree, that our Kings are descended from <hi>Carbre Ried</hi> the Son of <hi>Conar</hi> the Second, who was King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which step is also ill founded. For 1. Though indeed we had a King called <hi>Conar</hi> (as we had but one <hi>Conar)</hi> yet here our <hi>Conar</hi> does not at all agree with the <hi>Irish Conar</hi> in time: For our <hi>Conar</hi> began to Reign in the Year of <hi>Christ</hi> 149, whereas the <hi>Irish Conar</hi> the Second began to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97803:91"/>
Reign <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 212. So that here we had lost 63 years again of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. And the Conjecture from the Agreements in Names is very sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we being Neighbours, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Language; and Kings even in remoter Kingdoms use to give their Children, one another's Names 2. The other part of that Position, that we are all agreed, that our Kings are descended from <hi>Carbre Ried</hi> the Son of <hi>Conar,</hi> and that our Countrey is called <hi>Dalrieda</hi> from him, this is false: for we own our being called <hi>Dalreu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> from King <hi>Reuda</hi> or <hi>Reutha,</hi> in which our Historians follow <hi>Beda</hi>'s express words; and <hi>Rieda</hi> and <hi>Reutha</hi> differ much in time, <hi>Reutha</hi> having in <hi>Beda</hi>'s opinion setled here before <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar;</hi> whereas <hi>Carbre Rieda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd to be born long after that time, for his Father <hi>Conar</hi> Reigned onely 112 years after <hi>Christ.</hi> 3. We had no <hi>Carbres,</hi> who could be Sons to <hi>Conar</hi> the Second, for we had onely one <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> and so no <hi>Conar</hi> the Second, and he was Posterior to both our <hi>Carbres;</hi> for <hi>Carbredus Galdus</hi> Reign'd in <hi>Anno</hi> 76, and <hi>Carbredus</hi> the Second reign'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97803:92"/>
in <hi>Anno</hi> 113, and so long Prior to the Reign of <hi>Conar</hi> in 212. 4. As to the Pretence, that <hi>Eochoid Ried,</hi> or <hi>Etdach Ried</hi> is the same with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre Ried,</hi> and that our Genealogy had an <hi>Eochoid Ried</hi> Posterior to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar;</hi> this is Groundless: for both our Genealogies, and the <hi>Irish</hi> have both <hi>Eochoids</hi> and <hi>Carbres,</hi> as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Names, nor do the Names appear the same any manner of way. 5. Though it might be pretended, that our Countrey was call'd <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieda</hi> from a Countrey in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not from <hi>Reutha;</hi> yet <hi>non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slat,</hi> that it was so called from a Countrey call'd <hi>Dalrieda,</hi> and so from the Sirname of <hi>Ried;</hi> but from <hi>Araidh</hi> King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> seeing the same, <hi>O-Flahertie</hi> gives an account <note place="margin">Pag. 165. 190. 327.</note> of a King of <hi>Ulster</hi> called <hi>Fiachus Araidh,</hi> from whom also a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in <hi>Ulster</hi> is call'd <hi>Dalaradia</hi> and <hi>Dalriadia,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>Dalaradii.</hi> And this King <hi>Araidh</hi> was also after <hi>Conar:</hi> For he began to reign <hi>Anno</hi> 240. And as it was more honourable to have a Countrey called after <hi>Reuda</hi> a <hi>Scotish</hi> King,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97803:92"/>
than from <hi>Araidh,</hi> who was but a King of <hi>Ulster,</hi> and so one of the Kings of a Province in <hi>Ireland;</hi> so it is yet more dishonourable, to have our glorious Monarch, who now Reigns, descended from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre Ried,</hi> who was but a <hi>Dynastie</hi> in this Provincial Kingdom of <hi>Ulster;</hi> and so a Subject, each Provincial Kingdom having five <hi>Dynasties,</hi> as <hi>O-Flahertie</hi> tells us. And from all this I leave to my Readers to judge, whether Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours doe the King greater Honour, in making him to be descended from a petty Subject; or our Historians, who make him still to be descended from absolute Monarchs.</p>
            <p>I cannot here omit to laugh at good <hi>O-Flahertie</hi> for asserting, that <note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 475.</note> our Kings, even till the 590, were but <hi>Dynasties,</hi> Tributaries and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that <hi>Aidanus</hi> got an Exemption from paying Tribute at the Parliament of <hi>Dromcheat;</hi> where he appeared. And the Doctor does great Honour to our King in following such Authours, and rather to follow
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97803:93"/>
them, than the venerable <hi>Beda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> has a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent derivation of <hi>Dalrieda</hi> from all the former Authours: for he brought it from <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> which signifies King in the <hi>Irish,</hi> and <hi>Eda</hi> the King's name; so that <hi>Eda</hi> was a different King (and Authour of this Appellation) from <hi>Rheuda, Carbre Ried, Echoid Ried</hi> or <hi>Araidh.</hi> And are our Histories to be overturn'd by such irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authours?</p>
            <p>The fourth step of this Conjecture is, in the Agreement of our History with the <hi>Irish</hi> in the Persons of <hi>Eric, Eochoid, Mainreamhere, Oengus Fear,</hi> the Father, Grandfather and Great Grandfather of our <hi>Fergus</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, though there be a difference in the rest of the Line, from <hi>Carbre</hi> to <hi>Fergus,</hi> our Historians making this Line to consist of thirteen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and theirs of ten. But against this last Period it is represented, That the small Agreement in this step, as to the Names of Father and Grandfather of <hi>Fergus,</hi> with their residence in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Grandfather having been expell'd from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:97803:93"/>
and fled to <hi>Ireland,</hi> when King <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> was killed by the <hi>Romans</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Maximus,</hi> gave a Rise to some unexact <hi>Irish</hi> Writers to imagine, that the return of this <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second from <hi>Ireland,</hi> after forty four years absence, was our first Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Britain.</hi> But the want of three in this Period of thirteen in a direct Line does much over-balance the small Probability, that is urged against us from the Agreement in two Names, and some resemblance in other two, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Carbre Ried,</hi> and <hi>Eochoid Ried,</hi> and <hi>Aenegusa Tich</hi> and <hi>Angus Fear.</hi> It is also very observable, that this <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogy allows 283 years to these ten, <hi>viz.</hi> from the death of <hi>Conar Carbre</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 220, <hi>Arthur</hi> his Successour having begun his Reign that year) to the Year 503, wherein <hi>Laorn</hi> eldest Brother to our <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second (as they say) began his Reign; and yet to fifty one Kings from that <hi>Laorn</hi> to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi> the Third, they allow onely 554 years. And from the reflexion it is also more probable, that there
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97803:94"/>
were thirteen in this Period, and that <hi>Conar</hi> began to reign in the Year 149, and <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second in the Year 404, as our Historians assert.</p>
            <p>To all these I add the irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble differences amongst the <hi>Irish</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, as to the first Founder of our Monarchy, and the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was founded; as also the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable Consequences following thereupon, wherein our three great Adversaries <hi>Camden, Usher</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> did so widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as I have fully prov'd in my first Book, without any Answer; and by which Contradictions Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> himself is so misted, that he cannot determine, whether we setled in the fourth, fifth, sixth <note place="margin">Chap. 5. pag. 282.</note> or seventh Centuries, professing, that in matters of so great obscurity he could determine nothing.</p>
            <p>My last Argument to prove, that our Histories cannot be overturn'd by the <hi>Irish,</hi> shall be from comparing the Warrants of both. But, before I enter upon this, I must again regret in this Book, as I did in my last, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97803:94"/>
the <hi>Irish</hi> should mistake so far their own Interest, as to suffer or furnish theirs to overturn the Credibility of ours: Since, because we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our selves to have come last from <hi>Ireland,</hi> it were our common Interest to unite together, and to sustain one another's Antiquities, as their Authours did before Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> who was of foreign Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, though they controverted some of our Saints and Monasteries, because of the common name <hi>Scoti,</hi> yet till then they never opposed our Antiquities, knowing that in so far as we prov'd our Antiquity by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and foreign Authors, which they had not the occasion to do, they in so far were proved to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which <hi>Stanihurst</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, as I did remark, in my first Book. And upon seeing the use that is made of Authours against us, who are really for us (as <hi>Beda</hi> and others) we are apt to believe, that theirs are not, if we saw them; and that the <hi>Irish</hi> rather omit our remote Antiquities, than contradict them. Nor would we have contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97803:95"/>
the Authority of their Annals, though some of the <hi>English</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them against us, if some of the <hi>Irish</hi> had not by ignorance or mistake concurr'd of late with them. We likewise desire them to consider, how our Adversaries, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> railly their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities and Authours <hi>Ketin, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeus</hi> and <hi>O-Flahertie,</hi> and yet seem (which is severe) to allow their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, to the end they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to oppose us, laying still foundations in the mean time to overturn theirs also, when they have serv'd their turn, which I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to discover.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Milesian</hi> Race is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by the <hi>Irish</hi> their Fourth Race; and yet this is controverted by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> And the Authority <note place="margin">Praef. &amp; Chap. 5. passim.</note> and Learning of the <hi>Druids,</hi> upon which the <hi>Irish</hi> do chiefly found the Authority of their Histories, is absolutely denied; as it also is, that the <hi>Irish</hi> had use of Letters, till after St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s time: and all the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity he does allow them is, as to general things, as, from whence they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97803:95"/>
were peopl'd, and that they had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of Kings time out of mind; <note place="margin">Praef. p. 45, 46.</note> and does magnify the <hi>Tygerneck</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals for confessing, that the <hi>Irish</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, till the Reign of <hi>Kimbacius</hi> their 73d King, are very uncertain, and he liv'd within 59 years of our <hi>Fergus.</hi> And the Doctor adds, that he might have gone farther, and done no injury to Truth; and at last brings down this Truth to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusius Fortamalius,</hi> who liv'd <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3775. which is 134 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our <hi>Fergus;</hi> whereas we necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conclude the <hi>Irish</hi> to have a much greater Antiquity: for there were many Descents made here from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to prepare the settlement of <hi>Fergus;</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> lying in the neighbourhood of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and describ'd by the Ancientest Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers and other Writers, as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and without any mention of Conquest, it necessarily follows, that they must have been <hi>Aborigines</hi> there. And, by the same reason, they having been very ancient, and wanting Wars, must have eased themselves by Colonies; And, this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97803:96"/>
Countrey being within 13 Miles of them, our settlement must have been very ancient. And so the one does necessarily infer the other, and should not be made use of to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it; and the <hi>English,</hi> who have conquer'd them, are interested to humble them, but we to maintain them. Albeit then it is our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to support their Antiquities; yet in as far as they are now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to overturn what relates to our Countrey, they are not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to ours, as the Doctor asserts: for who would maintain, that the Accounts given by the <hi>Saxons, Celtae</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi> should be preferr'd to the <hi>British,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the times, after the <hi>Britains, English</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> were acknowledg'd to be setled? And as to the <hi>Irish</hi> Writers themselves, this Poem selec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preferr'd to all other Annals by <hi>O-Flahertie,</hi> as not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an acknowledgment of our settlement, but a Genealogy of our Kings, we have prov'd, that it is not preferable to our Historians in point of Credibility. And besides all that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97803:96"/>
I have said of it, I must add, that <hi>O-Flahertie</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ogyg.</hi> p. 467. Verum aliquot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider at is Disti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis, integrum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographum repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire non contigit; ali√†s absolutum ex eo Catalogum contexere non du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitaremus.</note> acknowledges, that there were several different Copies of it, and even this, which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, was not intire, some Distichs being wanting, else he doubted not to make an intire Catalogue.

            <p>The main ground insisted on by the Doctor for preferring the <hi>Irish</hi> in the point of Credibility to us is, that we neither had, nor could have so ancient Annals as they, our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries being onely founded by St. <hi>David,</hi> and after him, and so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>osterior to their Annals. Which Argument is founded upon a false Supposition: for the Doctor himself <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> chap. 5. p. 271.</note> acknowledges that the Psalter of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> contains onely matters of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the <hi>Irish</hi> Antiquaries cited by him confess. This is the eldest, and was written in the latter end of the Eighth Century. The next is the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97803:97"/>
Psalter of <hi>Cashel,</hi> which he rejects as not well founded, and allows none as credible, but those which are written after the Year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1000. And it cannot be deny'd, but we might have had well-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted Annals before that time; which the Doctor denies. For first, We were then fully possess'd not onely of our own first part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but even of the <hi>Pictish</hi> part of it, and also of the <hi>Northern</hi> (now <hi>English)</hi> Countries confirm'd to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the First (by the <hi>English</hi> own acknowledgment) who reign'd <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 943. And so we were Masters of <hi>Icolmkill, Abercorn, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernethie, Mailross, Lindisfern,</hi> and other Monasteries, which lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that great extent; and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> acknowledges, since <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall is by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to be built betwixt <hi>Tine</hi> and <hi>Esk.</hi> We had also the number of our Bishopricks increased by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of the <hi>Picts,</hi> as is not onely probable in it self, but is clear by the acknowledg'd Catalogues of Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks in <hi>Fordon. Icolmkill</hi> is by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97803:97"/>
               <hi>Beda</hi> said to be founded about the 560. and to be the chief of all the Monasteries in <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland. Abernethie</hi> was founded in <hi>Garnard</hi>'s time, who was next <hi>Pictish</hi> King to <hi>Brudeus,</hi> in whose time <hi>Columba</hi> liv'd, and so about the 600. And <hi>Fordon</hi> relates, that this Monastery was founded 200 years before the Church of <hi>Dunkeld</hi> was founded. And here is not onely a Monastery mention'd, which might have had Annals higher than the Psalter of <hi>Naran,</hi> suppose it had created His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but he cites the Chronicle of <hi>Abernethie,</hi> which the Doctor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges <note place="margin">Praef. p. 51.</note> to be an old Chronicle; and <hi>Beda</hi> also acknowledges; that there was such a Monastery as <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</hi> And though the Doctor cites <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Praef. p. 48.</note> saying, that it was so demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, that no vestige of it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; yet, the <hi>Pictish</hi> Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite ruin'd, the Argument, that there was no such Monastery, is of no force: for the Records of many demolish'd Monasteries are preserv'd. And, though the Abbacy of <hi>Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ross</hi> was rebuilt by St. <hi>David;</hi> yet,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97803:98"/>
that it was a famous Monastery in <hi>Beda</hi>'s time, is clear (for he tells, that the Abbat of <hi>Mailross</hi> was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to <hi>Lindisfern)</hi> and has proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly remained long demolish'd by the Wars, as <hi>Abercorn</hi> did; and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did thereby express the rebuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as an original foundation. And the reason, why I said in my former Book, that this Abbacy was (before it was rebuilt) called <hi>Rivallis,</hi> was because I have seen in a Collection of Foundations made by our Lord Register <hi>Skeen</hi> a Copy of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Mailross,</hi> wherein the Lands of <hi>Mailross</hi> and others are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Monks of <hi>Rivallis.</hi> But, whether <hi>Mailross</hi> or <hi>Rivallis</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct or not, is not material to our point; and, if they be distinct, it is more for our advantage, since by that Concession we have two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries doted by St. <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It contributes much to the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Histories beyond the <hi>Irish</hi> in point of Credibility, and to the establishment of the Credibility of our Histories against all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, that in the Debate before
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97803:98"/>
the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Year 1300. (where the <hi>Roman</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties must certainly be best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and when the Debate was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Learn'd <hi>English,</hi> who were very much concerned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict us) we did own this our set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into this Isle; and that we as a setled Nation, and not as a vagrant company of <hi>Irishes,</hi> maintain'd that long series of Wars related by <hi>Beda</hi> and our own Historians. And in that Debate we assert justly, that the visible Ruines of the two Walls built by the <hi>Romans</hi> against us and the <hi>Picts</hi> are certain proofs of our Antiquity, and that we were the People who maintain'd the War. As also in a Letter from our Nobility to the Pope about the Year 1320. we again assert our Antiquity, and that <hi>Haec collegimus ex Antiquorum gestis &amp; libris.</hi> And all this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and Letter being yet extant, these are surer Warrants for our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, than any thing that can be urg'd against us from the <hi>Irish</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the eldest whereof are in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97803:99"/>
Year 1100. written by Natives at home, without any contradiction or warrant, for ought we have yet seen. Nor has the Learn'd Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> answered the same Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when urged in my First Book, though with less force than it is now urg'd.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> answers to all that is urg'd from the Antiquity of our Monasteries, That this proves one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we might have had, but not that we had sufficient Warrants, since we produce not the Annals of these Monasteries. To which my Answer is, that (1.) This at least overturns his Position, that <hi>We nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, nor could have sufficient Warrants for a greater Antiquity than the</hi> Irish. (2.) The <hi>Irish</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no Warrants for their Annals, though much later than ours; and, as we are equal in other things, so we are stronger in this. (3.) We have formerly prov'd, as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly as can be in any such case, that we had such Annals in these our Monasteries, and that our His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians compil'd our Histories from
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97803:99"/>
them; and that they were lost by the Invasions of the <hi>English,</hi> and by the demolishing of our Monasteries in an Age, wherein all their Records were thought Reliques of Popery.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's own chief grounds for preference, in point of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Still.</hi> chap. 1. p. 35.</note> Testimonies founded upon Ancient Credible Writers, having a concurrent probability of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and that amongst these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers, consideration is to be had of their abilities, opportunities, care and diligence, according to which Rules, I have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many concurring Testimonies from Ancient Credible Authours, relating things credible, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and now in competition with the <hi>Irish,</hi> as to the abilities, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of our Authours, and their care and diligence in collecting our Histories, I contend, we ought to be preferable; because, beside the grounds above urg'd, I must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Readers, that the Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the <hi>Irish</hi> any opportunity of transmitting their Histories by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till after St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s time.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97803:100"/>
But so it is, that I have prov'd that <hi>Palladius</hi>'s Mission was to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Doctor has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that this Mission of <hi>Palladius</hi> was Prior to that of Saint <hi>Patrick:</hi> and which is higher, the Doctor acknowledges that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd Nations beyond the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall, were the <hi>Christians</hi> spoke of by <hi>Tertullian;</hi> and I have prov'd that we were one of these Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Nations. And therefore, since we had the use of Letters before the <hi>Irish,</hi> Letters being the surest Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of History, and Christianity the chief Nursery of Letters, it follows necessarily from the Doctor's own Rules, that our Histories are more credible than the <hi>Irish.</hi> And this Argument holds equally good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we our selves were the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Nations, when Christianity was first planted, or became Masters by conquest of these <hi>Christians</hi> here, who had the early use of Letters: even as the <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Saxons,</hi> had good grounds of knowledge, from the Letters and Learning of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> whom they conquer'd. The
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97803:100"/>
next is, that we had greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to know our own Histories, and greater reason to use care and diligence in writing them, than the <hi>Irish,</hi> who were Strangers. The third is, that the <hi>Irish</hi> having err'd so grossly in the last, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted part of our History, and in which they contradict the Foreign and Contemporary Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of other Nations, it cannot be urg'd that their Credibility is of any moment, in the more ancient and darker part of our Antiquities, and History, wherein they differ from us. And lastly, our Historians have for their Abilities been very famous for many Ages, in Foreign Nations, and amongst the best Criticks; whereas we have seen no Histories from <hi>Ireland</hi> till of late, and much later than ours. And though we are far from having any low esteem of the <hi>Irish</hi> Abilities, yet we conceive, that the Doctor should remember that by the suggestion of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> gives the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the <note place="margin">Vid. Bul. in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> lib. 12. cap. 33.</note> Second of <hi>England, ad declarandum
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97803:101"/>
indoctis, &amp; rudibus populis Christianoe fidei veritatem, &amp;c.</hi> whereupon they writ a Letter to Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> wherein <note place="margin">Fordon, <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </note> they complain, that they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely and cruelly us'd as Beasts, and therefore desire that his Holiness would confirm the Election they had made of <hi>Edward,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce,</hi> for their King.</p>
            <p>The Learn'd Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> was pleas'd, in partiality to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to assert that this his Majesty's Kingdom was never called <hi>Scotland,</hi> till 1000 years after <hi>Christ.</hi> But the Reverend Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this was not tenable; he onely asserts, that after the Year 900. we got the rest of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and then it onely came to be called <hi>Scotland.</hi> Both these Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I have endeavoured to refute in the Seventh Section of my Book, where I have clear'd all this matter in nine Positions, to all which the Doctor is pleased to answer nothing, save (1.) That I have unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly asserted that the Name of <hi>Scots,</hi> doth originally belong to the <hi>Scots</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:97803:101"/>
in <hi>Britain,</hi> and onely by way of Communication to these in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But I beg his pardon, to tell him, that I have no such Position, though for confirming my Answers to these two Reverend Bishops in the former Debates, I did onely for farther clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the matter, assert that the old name under which <hi>Ireland</hi> was known to the <hi>Greeks</hi> was <hi>Ierna,</hi> and to the <hi>Latines Hibernia,</hi> which I prov'd from Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> himself. (2.) I asserted that before the Year 400. there was no Author that made mention of <hi>Scotia,</hi> or <hi>Scoti,</hi> but when they meant our Country, and Country-men: and this I have prov'd without any Answer. But in the (3.) place, I positively say, <hi>pag.</hi> 143. of my First Book, that I was not concerned to debate the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the names of <hi>Scotia,</hi> or <hi>Scoti,</hi> but onely when we first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here. And therefore though our Historians do assert that the <hi>Irish</hi> were first called <hi>Scots,</hi> that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts not any of my Positions. For though very anciently the <hi>Irish</hi> might be called <hi>Scots,</hi> yet about the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97803:102"/>
time that the <hi>Romans</hi> and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to write of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Books now extant do onely apply these Names to us, and to our Country. And the Authour of <hi>Ogygia</hi> does him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">P. 348.</note> acknowledge, that the <hi>Romans</hi> first invented the Name of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and if so, it was probably applicable to Us: for they had much commerce with us, but none with <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst the many Citations which I adduced for proving that <hi>Scotland</hi> was called <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Bede</hi>'s time, one was from his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical History, wherein <hi>Bede</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 26.</note> relates, that <hi>Egfrid,</hi> King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> having sent an Army into <hi>Ireland</hi> under <hi>Bertus,</hi> he wasted the Country, and the Innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the next year, having sent an Army to waste the Province of the <hi>Picts,</hi> contrary to the advice of his Friends, and of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> God suffered that Army to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, because the former year he had rejected their advice, that he should not invade <hi>Scotland</hi> which did not wrong him. And to clear that the <hi>Scotia</hi> here exprest was not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97803:102"/>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> he adds the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> who abide in <hi>Britain.</hi> This Passage (as well as the others, which I have cited, and shall cite) proves (1.) That <hi>Scotland</hi> then has been promiscuously called by the names of <hi>Hibernia,</hi> and <hi>Scotia:</hi> for the same thing is said first to have been done in <hi>Scotia,</hi> and then in <hi>Hibernia.</hi> And this answers the Objection, <hi>Hiberni revertuntur do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> and where could their home be but in <hi>Ireland?</hi> (2.) It proves that this our Country was called <hi>Scotia</hi> in <hi>Beda</hi>'s time, and so long before the Year 1000. which the Bishop denies. Nor can it be prov'd that the King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> went to make war in <hi>Ireland,</hi> otherwise than from <hi>Offlahartie</hi>'s late Book, which is not to be put in balance with <hi>Beda,</hi> who was disinterested, and liv'd in the very time. To which the Doctor answers, that by <hi>Scotland</hi> must be there meant <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> because the Nation which <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid</hi> invaded, had been always kind to the <hi>English;</hi> which cannot be said of our <hi>Scotland.</hi> But to this it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97803:103"/>
is replied, that I have prov'd in my <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 27.</note> Book, from the same <hi>Beda</hi> (who must be the best Interpreter of his own words) that the <hi>English</hi> at that time were very kindly entertained by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and furnished with all things necessary: which kindness proceeded from an Union in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which in those happy, and pious days, was the foundation of all kindness: and thus I have answered the Doctor's Argument, but he has not answered mine. But to prove that <hi>Scotland</hi> was called <hi>Ireland</hi> in those days, and that this place of <hi>Beda</hi>'s is applicable to our Country, and not to <hi>Ireland;</hi> I cite the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Polychronicon,</hi> who says many <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 37.</note> evidences we have that this <hi>Scotland</hi> is ofttimes called <hi>(Heght) Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> as <hi>Ireland</hi> does: for which he cites many Proofs, and particularly this Passage in <hi>Beda.</hi> 
               <q>If it is a <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de <hi>Scotia</hi> cap. 39.</note> common Saw, that the Country which now is nam'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> is an outstretching of the North part of <hi>Britain.</hi> This <hi>Lond hete</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>Albania,</hi> and hath that name of <hi>Albanactus,</hi> afterwards the <hi>Lond

               </q> And thereafter it is said at the end of that Page, many Evidences we have out of this <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it is oft called and <hi>Hyte Hibernia,</hi> as <hi>Ireland</hi> has: and particularly amongst many Citations out of <hi>Beda,</hi> he cites <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 22.</note> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> which is the Passage controverted.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Polychronicon</hi> is cited by <hi>Fordon,</hi> and was Prior to him, for as <hi>Vossius</hi> tells us, it was written by <hi>Ranulphus Higden,</hi> who died, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1363. and was translated by <hi>Iohannes Trevisa,</hi> who continu'd it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Voss.</hi> de Hist. Lat. lib. 3.</note> to the Year 1398.</p>
            <p>From which I draw these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. (1.) That this Country was called <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Year 1000. which overthrows the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s Assertion. (2.) That our Country was called <hi>Hibernia,</hi> which answers most of all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries Arguments. (3.) That this place in <hi>Bede</hi> is to be ascrib'd to us, notwithstanding Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97803:104"/>
reason, and <hi>Offlahartie</hi>'s His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>For proving likewise that <hi>Scotland</hi> was called <hi>Hibernia,</hi> in <hi>Beda</hi>'s time, and by him, I produced among many other Passages that very clear one, <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> Where he says that <hi>Aidan</hi> was sent from the Isle which is called <hi>Hy,</hi> which is the chief of the <hi>Scotish</hi> and <hi>Pictish Monasteries, and belongs to Britan; Et ad jus Britanniae perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:</hi> albeit, speaking of <hi>Hy,</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, he says it is in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Doctor answers, Doth not <hi>Beda</hi> in the same place say, that the Island <hi>Hy</hi> was given by the <hi>Picts,</hi> and not by the <hi>Scots</hi> to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Monks that came from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> But what a Paralogism is this? For it might have been given by the <hi>Picts,</hi> and yet have been within the Territories of the <hi>Scots:</hi> for these neighbouring Nations did seise oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Places belonging to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the <hi>Picts</hi> being sensible, that they were not able to keep this Place which was so remote from their own Territories, they did
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97803:104"/>
therefore the more easily mortify it to a Monastery. Nor could it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have belong'd to the <hi>Picts:</hi> for it was never pretended that the <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Dominions extended to our Western Isles, or that they did reach farther than <hi>Clyd:</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> himself does march them so. And the Shire of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and many Isles such, as <hi>Bute,</hi> lie betwixt <hi>Clyd</hi> and <hi>Icolm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill,</hi> or <hi>Hy:</hi> and it was never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, but that these belong'd to Us, and were the Seat of Our Kings. And <hi>Usher</hi> thinks that <hi>Beda</hi> was mistaken, in saying that the <hi>Picts</hi> gave this Isle to this Monastery. But (2.) does this Answer prove, that it belong'd to <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is the onely Point here in debate. Or can there be any thing more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that, than <hi>Beda</hi>'s own words, which are, <hi>that it belong'd to</hi> Britain <hi>as a part of it?</hi> And if it be a part of <hi>Britain,</hi> it cannot be in <hi>Ireland,</hi> otherwise, than because <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was a part of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> was then called <hi>Ireland.</hi> Nor does the situation of the Place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute less to clear this, than <hi>Beda</hi>'s
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97803:105"/>
clear Authority. For it was never pretended by the <hi>Irish,</hi> that our Western Isles, which lie upon our Coast, belong'd to <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the first thing that is known of them, is, that they belong'd to <hi>Scotland;</hi> and since this Monastery and Isle is now in the possession of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and has been so for many Ages; We desire the Learned Doctor, and his <hi>Irish</hi> Evidences, to condescend when, and by what War or Transaction the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> lost that, or the other Isles: for if it had been theirs, we could not have got it, but by one of these two ways.</p>
            <p>Since then <hi>Hy</hi> was a part of our <hi>Scotland,</hi> it necessarily follows, that <hi>Aidan</hi> came not from the Northern <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> asserts: for the Bishop of Saint <hi>Asaph</hi> acknowledges, that <hi>Aidan</hi> was ordained at <hi>Hy,</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>Hy,</hi> and <hi>Dunkeld</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 5. p. 103, 104, 105.</note>, which he supposes with <hi>Usher</hi> to be then founded, and cites <hi>Bede</hi>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97803:105"/>
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> that is, from <hi>Hy;</hi> and that he was a Bishop of <hi>Scotland:</hi> which must be our <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the reasons aforesaid, notwithstanding of what the Doctor says. And <hi>from all this we wonder, with the Doctor, that any that can carefully reade</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, <hi>can dispute, what is so clearly said in him, that</hi> Scotland <hi>was called</hi> Hibernia; and so we'll conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Praef. p. 69.</note> him in his own words. But we wonder what the Doctor means, when he acknowledges that from <hi>Beda</hi> it appears, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had a Kingdom in <hi>Britain.</hi> But when he speaks of the Religion of the same <hi>Scots,</hi> he means the <hi>Scots of Ireland:</hi> this is indeed beyond my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but I am sure, it can have no colour, from making the <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein <hi>Icolmkill,</hi> or <hi>Hy</hi> is, an Isle distinct from <hi>Britain;</hi> having in my former Book cleared, that our part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was called an Isle, as contradistinguished from <hi>Britain,</hi> by the two Firths, <hi>Clyd,</hi> and <hi>Forth,</hi> being clos'd up by a Wall, and is therefore called an Isle by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and others whom
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97803:106"/>
I formerly cited. To whom I now add several <hi>English</hi> Authours, as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Britain,</hi> says, <hi>&amp; per se, velut insulam, √†</hi> Scotia <hi>divisa.</hi> And <hi>Bartholomoeus Anglicus</hi> says, that <hi>Scotia Regnum promontorium est, montibus &amp; maris brachiis √†</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia <hi>separata: &amp;</hi> Anglorum <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genies,</hi> Britanniam <hi>insulam possidet.</hi> And therefore <hi>Beda</hi> speaking of <hi>Weremith</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he tells us, that it is near to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and adds, that by this it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the remotest part of the Isle of <hi>Britain</hi> towards the North is <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Which could <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:97803:107"/>
I add to these <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epit. hist. <hi>Rom.</hi> p. 672.</note> who speaking of Wars betwixt the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> from the time of <hi>Ambrosius Aurelianus,</hi> says, that the Victory hung uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain betwixt them, <hi>donec Saxones potentiores effecti, tota per longum Insula potirentur:</hi> And this must be onely understood of <hi>England,</hi> for the <hi>Saxons</hi> did not in his time, nor since conquer that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which belong'd to us. But by that he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> conquer'd that part which belonged to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and was called an Isle, as contra-distinguished from ours. I <note place="margin">Decr. 16. <hi>pag.</hi> 783.</note> prov'd this also from the <hi>Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologium Romanum, Abredonioe in Hibernia, Sancti Beani Episcopi,</hi> to which nothing is answered: And I now add to it, <hi>Baronius in not is,</hi>

            <p>Having thus cleared the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Kings, and the truth of our Histories, by so solid Reasons, and from so good Authority. I hope the reverend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> will be

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97803:108"/>
as Ingenuous, in retracting what he has written against the State, in these Points; As he did very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably retract what he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against the Government of his own Church, in his <hi>Irenicum:</hi> At least he will retract <hi>That insolent Expression,</hi> Praef. pag. 72. <hi>That our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities are universally dis-esteem'd, amongst all Iudicious and inquisitive Men:</hi> Since all men have not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their opinion, nor has he read all Writers; and this at least contradicts the many parts of his Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he acknowledges, that <hi>Lipsius</hi> and other great Criticks are of our side. And I have cited most of all the considerable Criticks, and have fully satisfied the insignificant Answers made by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to them; and if I have left any Expression in all the Book unanswered, it is because it was unworthy of having been urged by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> or answered by me.</p>
            <p>And, though I could add many new Authours, who have owned our Antiquities; yet, loving rather to reason, than to cite, I produce
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97803:108"/>
one, who not onely owns our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, but makes our Antiquities a strong Argument against the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Pope. For (says he) the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the Church in <hi>Britain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> since <hi>Scotland,</hi> a part of it, was <hi>Christian</hi> before the <hi>Romans</hi> had access to it.

Here is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of a King before <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, and long before the Year 503, proved too by Laws yet observ'd, which was a sure way of preserving his Memory; and the matter of Fact is true, for we remember those Laws as his to this very day. <note n="*" place="margin">And though it may be objected that he had this from our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, yet it still proves that he and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> 3. Here is an acknowledgment, that <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Citation is applicable to us. 4. It seems by this more just, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> should rather have sustained our Antiquities, as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Popery, than rejected them for answering an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Episcopacy, Religion being of greater consequence than Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the inference being stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the one Case than the other; for he should have urg'd that it is not probable, that we who were
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97803:109"/>
Enemies to the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation would have submitted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but would have rather lookt upon their Missionaries as Spies, especially in those barbarous times, when Nations were considered more than Doctrine: for though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion already received, might have Cemented us; yet before it was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, so great an enmity as was betwixt us, might have obstructed Commerce and Kindness; from which probably proceeded our aversion to the <hi>Romish</hi> Rites as to <hi>Easter,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points for many Ages, in which we followed the <hi>Greek</hi> Church in opposition to the <hi>Romish.</hi> But leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Argument to be prosecuted by Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but both the learned <hi>Blondel</hi> cited by the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and <hi>Lomeierus</hi> were both convinced, that our Antiquities were undeniable, for no man in his Wits draws Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Premisses which himself thinks uncertain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Possevinus</hi> also the Jesuit, in his <note place="margin">Lib. 16. Cap. 5.</note>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97803:110"/>
as most Authentick, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Antiquities: Wherein among other things, we are asserted to have had a Christian Church here in the Year 203. and the Citations from <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Ierom</hi> are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to us, and to these are added three other Citations, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, one from St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> in <hi>Serm. de Pentecost.</hi> a second from the same Authour, in his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia qu√≤d Deus sit homo,</hi> and a third from <hi>Petrus Venerabilis,</hi> lib. 8. epist. 16. And therefore, as in my last Book I did conclude, that our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity behoved to be very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, since before Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s time, every Nation made us most ancient, next to themselves; so in this Book I may conclude, that our Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity must be much ancienter, than those reverend Divines would make even our settlement, since men of all persuasions concur in it, and speak of it with great Elogies, and draw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences from it, for the honour of their own Church: Which according to the Doctor's principles cited by me, are the surest marks of Conviction.

Nations, and who the Doctor says, were different from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> It's fit to add to what I said on this subject, that our Adversaries differ among themselves, and contradict one another in this point; for <hi>Cambden,</hi> whom St. <hi>Asaph</hi> follows, makes the <hi>Picts</hi>

After the word <hi>Piracy,</hi> add, And whereas the Doctor objects, that this Wall was unnecessarily built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Seas to hinder the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> seeing, I supposed, the custome was to cross over the two Firths, and to land on this side of the Wall; for so they landed on the <hi>British</hi> side, and left the Wall behind them, and consequently the expence had
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97803:112"/>
been unnecessary, and the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> very idle in building it. To this it is answered, that I very justly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that the invasions were over the Firths; and though they had left the Wall behind them after their landing, yet the objection concludes not, that therefore the building of the Wall was unnecessary; for the <hi>Britains</hi> being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and distinguished from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> by two Firths which did meet onely in a short neck of Land, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted this natural fortification of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by building a Wall on the Land where it was wanting, thereby defending themselves against the irruptions of their Enemies; so that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debarred from entring by this Neck, which was the easie and ordinary way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were after necessitated to invade by water, formerly the more difficult way. And this is not onely a conjecture ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the clear probability of the thing (which were sufficient to answer <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 12.</note> the Doctor's Objection that is onely founded on a bare conjecture) but it's the express reason given by <hi>Beda,</hi> who lived so near the time and the place, and who speaking of this Wall, saith, <hi>Fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt autem eum inter duo freta, vel sinus (de quibus diximus) maris per millia pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum plurima, ut ubi aquarum munitio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erat, ibi praesidio valli fines suas ab hostium irruptione defenderent</hi>‚Äîfrom which I
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97803:113"/>
must also add, that the Seas we came over, were our own Firths abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and not the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea; for the Wall is said to be betwixt the two Firths and Bays of the Sea, and thereafter in the same Chapter it's said <hi>fugavit eos transmaria,</hi> which are also the words of <hi>Gildas:</hi> All which is appli√©d to our Firths, and not applicable to the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, which can neither be called Firth nor Bay in the singular number, nor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> in the plural, it being called <hi>Mare Hibernicum,</hi> as our Seas are called <hi>Mare Germanicum,</hi> or <hi>Deucaledonicum.</hi> And that the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea was not passable, nor fit for such Anniversary Invasions in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> is (beside all I have said former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) clear from the <hi>English</hi> Writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Bartholomaeus Anglicus,</hi> and the <hi>English Polychronicon</hi> in their descriptions <note place="margin">Polychr. lib. 1. cap. 32.</note> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the Sea that is between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is all the year round full of great waves, and uneasie; so that men can seldom sail it securely. This Sea is sixscore miles broad, and <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus Anglicus</hi> says of it,‚Äî<hi>Mare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Doctor, to evite the force of our Arguments, makes the <hi>Caledonii</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atae</hi> to differ from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and to be <hi>Britains</hi> dwelling near the Wall; who being forced to attend there
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97803:113"/>
for the defence of the Wall against the <hi>Romans,</hi> left the more Northern parts of the Isle waste, which they formerly inhabited, as the Bloud doth the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, when it runs to the Heart: Whereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> invaded their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions from the West out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi> from <hi>Scandanavia.</hi> But besides the Arguments I urged formerly in my Second Chapter, I now add, that first, <hi>Beda</hi> makes onely mention of five Nations, who inhabited <hi>Britain, viz.</hi> the <hi>Britains, Romans, Picts, Scots</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> whereas if the <hi>Caledonii</hi> and <hi>Meatae</hi> had been different from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> (and not the Highlanders and Lowlanders of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> under different names; as I have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to be) then there had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been five, but seven Nations inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Britain.</hi> Whereas the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that <hi>Dion</hi> must interpret <hi>Beda</hi>'s words, it's more reasonable that <hi>Beda,</hi> who wrote long after <hi>Dion,</hi> should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret his words; since <hi>Beda</hi> is so express in describing who were Inhabitants of old, and in his time; and <hi>Dion,</hi> who was before <hi>Beda,</hi> could not interpret him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Either the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Possessions of these <hi>Caledonii</hi> and <hi>Meatae</hi> before the <hi>Romans,</hi> or after: if they came in before, then the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> must have come and setled here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Year 412. because the <hi>Romans</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:97803:114"/>
left this Isle altogether about that time, without ever returning, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were setled here before the Year 503. which is the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi>'s Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But if after the <hi>Romans</hi> left the Isle, then it was not when the <hi>Caledonii</hi> and <hi>Meatae</hi> were necessitated to come for the defence of the Wall against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which is Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Irish</hi> had overcome the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provincial <hi>Britains,</hi> whom, as the Doctor confesses, the <hi>Romans</hi> could not overcome; this Conquest must needs have fallen out near to those times wherein <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> lived, and whereof they write the Wars and Vastations so particularly and exactly; and especially since the Learned Doctor gives as a Rule, that a negative testimony is concluding, where the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is knowing, and had opportunity to know, and the thing omitted is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the subject treated of; all this quadrats exactly with this case: and though these Authours had omitted this Conquest, yet it is incredible that these Ancient <hi>Irish</hi> Annals (by the Doctor alone so much preferred to ours) would have omitted the full and clear relation of a Conquest so very glorious to them, as the overcoming Nations, who could never be conquered by the mighty power of the <hi>Romans;</hi> especially since this must have been, not some particular Victories
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97803:114"/>
onely, but one intire extinction of the <hi>Meatae</hi> and <hi>Caledonii,</hi> for these are never after so much as mentioned: And it's yet more incredible to think that we could have overthrown these Extraprovincial <hi>Britains,</hi> after the <hi>Romans</hi> had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave the Island, and yet never be able to prevail so far against them, when they had the <hi>Britains, Romans,</hi> and Us to be their Enemies; it being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that we were by continual incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions endeavouring to settle here about 200 years before the <hi>Romans</hi> left the Isle.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Doctor cites <hi>Fordon</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> from the <hi>Caledonii,</hi> and <hi>Meatae;</hi> and making them to be the Extraprovincial <hi>Britains</hi> in the 36th Chapter of the Third Book of his <hi>Scoto-Chronicon,</hi> I have considered the place cited, but I find no such thing in that Chapter. Indeed in the 37th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Second Book I find <hi>Fulgentius</hi> is called <hi>Dux Britannorum Albanensium,</hi> and that the <hi>Britanni Boreales,</hi> are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the <hi>Britanni Australes;</hi> but there is no mention made in that place of the <hi>Caledonii</hi> and <hi>Meatae;</hi> nor does the division of South and North-<hi>Britains</hi> make any thing against us, but on the contrary, it seems very clear by that Chapter, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> had been long setled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before the <hi>Romans</hi> left this Isle; for it's said there,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97803:115"/>
that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> having (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their accustomed manner) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the Countrey, notwithstanding the assistence given by the <hi>Romans</hi> to these <hi>Britains, Fulgentius</hi> was forced to make a peace with them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Bishop of St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph</hi> makes use of <hi>Plantin</hi>'s Edition in the Catalogue prefixt by him, and in that Edition <hi>Eumenius</hi>'s words are pointed as I have cited them.</p>
