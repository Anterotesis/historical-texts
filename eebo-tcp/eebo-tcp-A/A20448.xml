            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with the wares and passages, or how to bend
his course, straggling here and there (the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exceeding hot,<note place="margin">After honour.</note> and he extreme thirsty) at length hée
enquired of haruest people, intreating their directions
where he might get drinke: who very courteously shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him a playne beaten way, leading to a <hi>Noblemans</hi>
house not farre off.</p>
            <p>The Fayry Champion put on a bold sharpe face, went
to the <hi>Noblemans</hi> house, and desired the Butler to giue
him a cup of his giuing drinke. But the Butler <hi>(as the
custome is)</hi> churlishly denyed him, and bid him be gone,
for that he had not any charity, much lesse <hi>commission,</hi> to
giue any thing to such an able wandering fellow as hee
was, bidding him go looke for worke amongst haruest
folkes, and take paynes for his liuing.</p>
            <p>Whereupon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Fayry Champion,</hi> like a valiant sturdy
<hi>Begger,</hi> tooke the <hi>Butler</hi> by the <hi>braines,</hi> &amp; dasht his <hi>heeles</hi>
against the wall, made <hi>corkes</hi> to stop <hi>Ale-bottles</hi> of his
<hi>bones,</hi> &amp; threw them into his Buttery, for al succeeding
Butlers (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not <hi>boon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions</hi>) to, take example.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He tooke his braines from foorth his head before,</l>
               <l>Else sore Kibe-heeles, perhaps, had made him rore.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>So he dranke vp all the beere in the Buttery, before he
could quench his intolerable thirst: for the house was not
then so well furnisht as at other times, by reason there
was no houshold: for the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Lady</hi> were gone
vp to <hi>Moropolis</hi> to take <hi>phisicke,</hi> &amp; see the newest <hi>fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4622:7"/>Thus he procéeded on his intended iourney, and after hee
had gone twenty miles or thereabouts, he began to finde a
fainting in himselfe, and felt his guts shrinke together like
burnt parchment, yet he tooke as good courage as necessity
vseth to driue men to, in such a case, and ere long, by good
hap he espied not farre off, a very fayre new built house, with
many goodly turrets and battlements, and whole clusters
of chimneyes more then néede required, for that he could
not see any vse of those that were néedfull, in regard there
was not any Tobacco stirring amongst them, which argued
there was but little good fellowship: therefore his heart wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cold; yet he went and knockt at the gate, but all in vaine:
for there was not any within to giue him answere, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spyders: for all the Rats and Mice were eyther gone, or
else staru'd with that extreame dearth.</p>

               <l>O Champion fayre, what ill did thee befall,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>It fortuned, as he was thus standing at the gate, a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
of a néere neighbouring village, came by and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Fayry Champion what he would haue there. Sir, qd.
the Fayry Champion, I am a traueller without money, and

            </lg>
            <p>But I pray, sir, tell me: what Gentleman owes this faire

Zuerly sur, he is no Gentleman, vor he is a Knight,

            <p>When the Fayry Champion vnderſtood, there were more wayes then one to attaine to a Knightſhip, he held himſelfe in the moſt fortunateſt place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth; for in the Fayry land they onely haue it by deſert: &amp; on the ſudden he grew to ſuch an excéeding height of ambition, that with all haſte he would be gone, and to that purpoſe tooke leaue of the Huſbandman, who (as it appeared) was high Conſtable of the hundred, by reaſon he went to the pariſh Clarke, &amp; cauſed him to make a paſſe for the ſecurity of <hi>Tom Pheander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fayry Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his trauels, wherein he charged all the petty Conſtables within the hamlets of his hundred, to ayde and reſiſt the Fayry Champion againſt any one whatſoeuer, that ſhould

            <p>And although the <hi>Paſport</hi> was written by the hand of an old Wood-hen, (one would haue thought) if Hennes had had hands, yet the countenance of a Magiſtrates hand at it bore it out, &amp; made it carry meate in the mouth. So he than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him for all his good chéere and much kindnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in purſute of the fortunes he aymed at, which was to be a Knight at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>When he began to come néere the heart of the Iland, hée heard of the rich and flouriſhing City of <hi>Moropolis</hi>; thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he repayred with what expedition he could deuiſe, and drawing within ſight of it, he met in the way a proper tall trading Gentlewoman, ſet out after the fineſt faſhion of new deuices, with a white looſe body in a ſtraight blacke Gowne, hooped about with the flexible bones of a ſlender <hi>Whale</hi>: the crowne of her <hi>Cap</hi> was ſo déepe in band, that it durſt not ſcarce peepe out to be ſeene: her <hi>Maſke</hi> came downe to the tippe of her noſe, and her chin tyed vp with a lac'd clout (or handkercher,) as if ſhee were iawe-falne.</p>

               <l>You do not much in your ſimile fayle:</l>

the <hi>Vse</hi> of his memory, at the very last houre of his death,
that he dyed without bequeathing the least sparke of wit to

the meanest Hospitall of diseased people.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He might haue left something, although but little,</l>

            <p>This parcell of <hi>Sinne,</hi> going towards the place of action,

shorne, which was going along with her, and being in the
fields, the dog fetch't his courses to and againe afarre off,
so that she was fearefull of losing him, and with a loud shrill
voice, she called him by the name of Lyon. Which the Fayry
Champion hearing, and withall séeing the dog runne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, he thought she had cryed out to saue her from the
Lyon, and therefore drew his sword, and spéedily ranne to
ayde the ouerpressed virgin, according to the othe and office
of an arrant Knight.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When Tom Pheander espy'd this dogged Lion,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>And comming to her, he sayd, Feare not, fayre Swéeting,

            <p>The dog comming néere her, began to leape and fawne,
and lickt her hand: which the Fayry Champion seeing, sayd,
Now do I well perceiue, that you are a most spotlesse mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
mayde: for that you are armed with the armour of
pure honesty, against the insatiety of this all-deuouring <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Pheander shewed his iudgement was but poore,</l>

            <p>Although he spoke seriously to his owne vnderstanding,
thinking indéed it had bin a Lyon: yet she (who scorned the
name of a mayd at those yeres) thought (as well she might)
<pb facs="tcp:4622:9"/>
that he had laughed her to scorne, &amp; derided her with scoffes;
and therefore with her hand, she suddenly basht him on the
lips, that the very bloud sprang from his teeth: which flirt
he accepted as a token of great fauour from her bounteous
fist, and with his handkercher spung'd the blood from his
mouth, which he sayd he would kéepe as a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
giuen by the hand of a faire vertuous virgin. With
which spéeches she grew so excéeding angry, and was so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incensed against him, that she commanded Sir <hi>Panderus</hi>
to set vpon him with his long sword: which he refused to
doe, being daunted with the feare of hauing his profession
questioned.</p>

fitting the worths of a Knight errant, he quietly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
&amp; addresses himselfe into that much renowned City
of <hi>Moropolis,</hi> where he purposed to spend some time about
the City, to learne a generous carriage of himselfe: and, for
that he would auoyde to be déemed an Intelligencer to some
forrayne State, he altogether abandoned <hi>Ord'naryes,</hi> and
<hi>Tauernes,</hi> and would not at any time séeme to intrude
himselfe into the company of those that vnderstood much, but
tooke a Poeticall <hi>Sculler,</hi> (whose swift <hi>Muse</hi> borrowed the

whose two mouthes had deuoured more hay, then his one
stomacke could disgest, so that it lyes yet in his belly as fresh,
as when he first eate it, without putrifaction, as may be seene.
Hee likewise noted a very strange thing, which was, a
Blind man led through euery street of <hi>Moropolis</hi> by a staffe,
which had eaten so much Garlicke, that he could follow it
by the smell. And truely, many more great obseruations
<pb facs="tcp:4622:10"/>
he had gotten from amongst the Motion-mongers of <hi>Niniuy</hi>
and <hi>Babylon,</hi> so that now hee had sufficient experience to
mayntayne an argument by <hi>Parrattisme</hi> after dinner or

talke of their small trauels.</p>
            <lg>

faces were rays'd little mounts, appearing like <hi>Noses,</hi> on
which stood pretty conceited Windmills, which in the going
made as pleasant a sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as curious Fawlcons <hi>Bells.</hi> On the

            </lg>
            <p>This complete Coate-armour was committed by the

            </p>
            <p>Madame <hi>Moriana</hi> séemed to hasten, and with all possible

<hi>Andromago</hi> a monstrous, strong and terrible little Gyant:
and thus it was.</p>
            <p>Madame <hi>Moriana,</hi> vpon a time, walking in an euening
(as the custome is in Fayry Land) downe in a greene valley,
wherein <hi>Nature</hi> had seated a most pleasant <hi>Groue,</hi> so fit for

               <hi>Andromago,</hi> a mighty huge and chollericke <hi>Pigmey</hi> Gyant. He was a full halfe yard broad betwixt the eyes, and almoſt eightéene ynches by the rule (wanting but the breadth of a ſuper-fine wyer) from the crowne to the héele, and the reſt of his body proportionable accordingly.</p>
            <p>This monſtrous grim-looking Gyant, knowing <hi>Moria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> vſuall houres of reſort to the Groue, ambuſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a very great Thicket, (in the middle way) growing on the ſide of a high cloud-pearcing Mole-hill.</p>
            <p>The faſhion of the countrey is, that the Nobles and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of ancient houſes, haue their Armes portrayed in a ſmall <hi>Eſcuchion,</hi> which they euermore beare before them, to the end they may be knowne from priuate perſons, and that the thronging multitude may giue way, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neere; whereas otherwiſe, they could not haue that due reſpect which belongs to them, in regard it is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nation, and ſubiect to Inſurrections: THerefore for that they may be euer in a readynes vpon any domeſtick warre, all go ready arm'd with Maſkes and Mufflers.</p>
            <p>Now had <hi>Andromago</hi> the Gyant, with his Fawchion, lopt downe the great arme of an Eglentine trée, where hee (Saliſberry playne like) looked through, to ſée the paſſing by of <hi>Moriana,</hi> whom at length he eſpyed comming alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, towards her wonted place of recreation. And draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing néere within the apprehenſion of his eye, he was well aſſured it was ſhe, and knew her by the <hi>Eſcuchion</hi> ſhe cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before her, wherein was charged in chiefe, a halfe <hi>Moone Gules,</hi> in a <hi>iagged cloud Sables,</hi> and the lower (or backe) charge was, thrée <hi>Drops Or,</hi> vnder a <hi>Feſſ Argent.</hi> This coate ſhe gaue, which was the moſt ancientſt in al the Fayry Land, and euer continued hereditary to the heyres female of that houſe.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was come néere the Thicket, <hi>Andromago</hi> watched his fit opportunity, and ſuddenly ruſhed out like a <hi>Snake</hi> from a hedge, leaping thirty ynches by the rod, and caught her in his armes, and with very ioy of his prey, ror'd
<pb facs="tcp:4622:11"/>
               <!-- keyed by pfs after PQ rescan -->
like a Bull of eight dayes old, This hideous yell ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted the poore Lady, that ſhe was euer after troubled with a kind of <hi>Falling ſickneſſe.</hi> So leading her along as his priſoner, towards a Caſtle he had not farre off, which was double grated with huge Iron barres, not much vnlike the mighty ſtrong Baracadoed windowes of a monſtrous ouergrowne <hi>Mouſe-trap</hi>: wherein he had impriſoned many ancient tooth-wanting <hi>Ladyes,</hi> and fed them with nothing but hard candied <hi>ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meates,</hi> and the ſowreſt iuyce of the <hi>ſweeteſt Grape.</hi>

            <p>It was S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Archmorianders</hi> good hap, to take his way through the Fayry Land, homewards from his trauels, who had bene amongſt the <hi>barbarous Braſillians,</hi> to ſée the <hi>faſhion</hi> of the countrey, &amp; alſo to learne the <hi>nature</hi> of the people, by a moſt happy chance, he met the poore cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiu'd <hi>Lady,</hi> led by the hand of his vgly <hi>Monſter,</hi> who was néere as high as the Ladyes girdle, which compaſt her delicate waſte ſeuen times, beſides the knot.</p>
            <p>The ſudden appearance of the Gyant to Sir <hi>Archmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> (for he had neuer ſéene in all his trauels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures the like creature before) ſtroke him into ſuch a ſhaking palſey, that he could very hardly ſtand ſtill on his legs,<note place="margin">Hee would haue bin gone.</note> yet he tooke an indifferent ſtrong heart, and addreſſed himſelfe towards the Gyant, with a ſwéete quauering voice, ſaying:</p>
            <p>Thou moſt monſtrous and huge diminitiue of <hi>nature,</hi> which haſt alwayes bene an enemy to <hi>Ladyes,</hi> I aduiſe thée ſurrender thy priſoner into my hands, or elſe by the light of this marſhall hand, thou ſhalt well vnderſtand the price of her: for thou haſt done her ſuch ſkuruy pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wrongs, as thy weake ſtate cannot counteruayle to make her ſatisfaction; for reaſon induces my worthy ſelfe to wey both your cauſes in my vpright ballance of vnequity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andromago</hi> ſtaring at Sir <hi>Archmoriander,</hi> like a wild <hi>Gooſe,</hi> ready to fly vpon, ſayd, Thou fooliſh
<pb facs="tcp:4622:12"/>
Knight, thinkest thou I will so easily part with the
thing I haue so long stood and wayted for? No; I aduise
thée be gone, or else I will wyther thy very face, and
confound thy <hi>smelling sence</hi> with my breath: for I
scorne to stand to thy vnequall <hi>Chaundlers</hi> weights.</p>
            <p>The Gyants threats could not discourage Sir <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriander</hi>
one iot more then he was before, (although
surely the <hi>Giants</hi> breath was very strong, by reason he
was so short wasted, and his two ends were so néere
neighbours, that their friendshipp were alike, and the
one did participate the others strength and sauour) But
Sir <hi>Archmoriander</hi> well backt with hope to winne the
Ladyes fauour, and his affection to iustice, made him
looke so néere to his busines in hand, as an old purblinde<note place="margin">Purblind men are good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and looke neere to their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines.</note>
               <hi>Counceller</hi> (or rather <hi>concealer</hi>) whose veluet Ierkin is
sufficient to make a Iustice of peace without a commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that will not suffer the smallest caracter of a fault
to runne at randome vnpunished: but binds it fast in
recognizance, to receiue eyther <hi>corporall</hi> or <hi>pecunier</hi>
punishment. Euen so he consideratly bare in mind the
execution of some seuers iustice vpon a homicide, and
with warme courage betooke him to his sword; which
<hi>Andromago</hi> perceiuing, he likewise prouided to defend
himselfe against his aduerse Assaylant.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Iustices law did so assist his Clyent,</l>
               <l>As Morianders sword, the Lady from the Gyant.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Sir <hi>Archmoriander,</hi> in the first encounter, had made
an end of the fight before they began, but that (being mad
with fury) he mist the Gyant, and runne the poynt of
his sword into the ground. <hi>Andromago</hi> (léering like a
<hi>Sargeant)</hi> espyed that aduantage (seeing him tugging
to pull it foorth againe) omitted no time, but aduanc'd
his club, and with one blow pasht Sir <hi>Archmorianders</hi>
head all into a lumpe: which euer after looked like a <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:</hi>
so that afterwards, when he came to be drest, the
<hi>Surgeons</hi> opinion was, that he was very likely to carry
<pb facs="tcp:4622:12"/>
that marke to his graue.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Archmoriander</hi> recouered himselfe so well
as he could, and turned about as swift as a Windmill
sayle in a hot Summers day, (with strong agility of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and resolution withall, to giue a finall period to the
battayle) and most valiantly vntrussed his <hi>poynts,</hi> put
off his <hi>Doublet,</hi> snatcht vp his breeches by the sides,
and with his sword cut off the Gyants right hand,
so that it onely hung by the very bare bone and
<hi>sinewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this blow, <hi>Andromagoes</hi> Club fell out of his
hand: which Sir <hi>Archmoriander</hi> suddenly tooke aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of by closing with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with a nimble strength
threw him flat on the earth with as much facility, as if
the Gyant had bene a <hi>childe</hi> of two yéeres old.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Sir Moriander cut the Gyant on the hand,</l>
               <l>And hurt his little Toe, he could not stand.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Moriana</hi> standing by all the time of the
fight, perplexed with an extreame feare of danger, and
now séeing a hope of victory attend her Champion, shée
began to take comfort in a pretty <hi>Medley,</hi> betweene
<hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>laughing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Archmoriander</hi> hauing gotten <hi>Andromago</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, lay vpon him with such a heauy weight, and
pressed him so sore, that till then,<note place="margin">Archmo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riander lay very heauy vpon the little Gyant.</note> 
               <hi>Andromago</hi> felt not
Sir <hi>Archmorianders</hi> heauy displeasure fall vpon him:
which caused <hi>Andromago</hi> to cry out to the <hi>Lady,</hi> for
pardon, and craued mercy of Sir <hi>Archmoriander,</hi>
with a great shew of sorrow, for the excéeding iniurious
wrongs offered to the <hi>Lady,</hi> and the heauy vnsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
iniuryes intended against Sir <hi>Archmoriander:</hi> All
which was now fallen vpon himselfe, and the <hi>burden</hi>
did much bruise his conscience.</p>
            <p>Upon this submission, with penitency for his faults,
Sir <hi>Archmoriander</hi> most honourably <hi>(befitting his
worth</hi>) cut off his head, &amp; set it on his doublet brest (where
<pb facs="tcp:4622:13"/>
a <hi>button</hi> was lost in this fray) wearing it in token of his
valour and victory, and so set him at liberty to go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Although the Gyant would haue giuen a groate,</l>
               <l>Yet Moriander vow'd, to see his naked throate.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Sir <hi>Archmoriander</hi> hauing thus freed the Lady <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>
from the outrage of <hi>Andromago,</hi> hee went to
comfort her, who was then suddenly falne into a déepe
passion of sadnes.</p>
            <p>Swéete <hi>Madam</hi> (quoth he) you see your dangerous
enemy héere lye slaine: therefore, fayre Lady, I much
scorne your thoughts should be possest with any future
feare. Let me be the example of your courage, to take a
strong heart, and valiantly beare vp your <hi>Escuchion</hi> and
<hi>Armes</hi> without feare: for vnder your coate will I fight,
whilest I can sland or breathe: for nature hath taught
man to be an agent euen to brute Animals, much more
to fayre Ladyes, as for example: The heauy <hi>Oxe,</hi> hee
lightens with the <hi>Goade;</hi> the sullen <hi>Horse,</hi> he quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
with the <hi>spurre;</hi> and the Melancholy dull <hi>Lady,</hi>
he stirrs vp to mirth, with the <hi>pricke</hi> of witty inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from a good brayne.</p>
            <p>At these pretty Similes <hi>Moriana</hi> smiled, and bid him
knéele downe, taking his sword, which was yet bloudy
with cutting the Gyants throate, and layd it on his
shoulder, bidding him rise vp, Sir <hi>Archmoriander,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>Dunce-ll dell Cinthya</hi> her Knight of the <hi>Moone,</hi>
(dubbing him in the <hi>ordure</hi> of the <hi>Escuchion</hi> she bore,

he seal'd with his lips,<note place="margin">Not on the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuchion,</note> on the backe of her hand, with a

sweete Lady,</hi> and so departed.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Moriana thus was freed from the Gyant,</l>
               <l>And gaue him thanks, with tongue which went most plyant.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This well deserued affection from <hi>Moriana</hi> to Sir
<hi>Archmoriander,</hi> possest him with the <hi>Armour,</hi> which of
<pb facs="tcp:4622:13"/>
right belong'd to the Knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> when he (as
many <hi>Gallants</hi> vse) neglected not the least opportunity
that occasion could minister, to crake and bragge of his
<hi>Mistris</hi> fauours most, when (if truth had béene knowne)
they least concern'd him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tom Pheander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">For he was euer a great dreamer of Fayry busines.</note> the Knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> had a
<hi>vision,</hi> wherein he had intelligence of a <hi>Coate-armour,</hi>
that was sent vnto him by the <hi>Fayry Queene,</hi> which
Coate-armour was likewise shewed to him in this
dreame, whereof he tooke especiall obseruation for the
markes and tokens, so that hee could not fayle in the
challenging of it.</p>
            <p>It was likewise told him in this vision, that <hi>Moria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
a Fayry Lady, had most trecherously betrayde it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the Knight of the <hi>Moone,</hi> who wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
delaynde it from him.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Sir Pheander had the Armour shewed in vision,</l>
               <l>Which made him hold Moriander in derision.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This vision put the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> into such a
passion of anger, that like a foolish mad man he tore his
hayre, and vowed a reuenge against the Knight of the
<hi>Moone,</hi> which he should be well assured to heare of, and
hastens with all spéed towards the Court, to sée whether
he could méete with his iniurious aduersary.</p>
            <p>That very morning the Knight of the <hi>Moone</hi> was
ready armed in the Knight of the <hi>Sunnes</hi> armour, and
almost vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking horse, to ryde abroad for some strange
aduentures, euen at the instant, when the Knight of the
<hi>Sunne</hi> came to Court.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Archmoriander was arm'd, I know not how,</l>
               <l>To ride abroad to slay the sauage Sowe.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And méeting the Knight of the <hi>Moone,</hi> he was well
assured (calling his memory to aduise, and summoning
the remembrance of the markes) that it was his armour:
therefore he stept to the Knight of the <hi>Moone,</hi> and sayd,</p>
            <p>Sir Knight, my simple opinion cannot iudge any of
<pb facs="tcp:4622:14"/>
your actions lesse then <hi>abominable honest,</hi> yet this
Coate-armour (and clapt him on the shoulder) belongs
to me, although you most ignobly detayne it from mee,
yet I am sure tis my right, and by <hi>Cockes</hi> and <hi>Combes</hi>
(the badge of my honour) I looke to haue it.</p>
            <p>The Knight of the <hi>Moone,</hi> thinking that he had struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him in earnest, most valiantly blurted out his tongue,
and bade him come by it how he could.</p>
            <p>This now likely to grow to a dangerous quarrell,
the freinds of both parts vsed their mediations, and
perswaded them to haue the matter put to arbitterme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and not fight, or go to lawe like brabbling <hi>fooles,</hi> which
arrest one another for Moone-shine in water: and so
with much adoe they both yéelded to haue the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by two indifferent honest men.<note place="margin">Not too honest by no meanes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So they were both bound, each to other in <hi>generall
acquittances</hi> of a hundred pounds a péece: and the
Knight of the <hi>Moone</hi> vnarm'd himselfe, and deliuered
the Coate-armour and Helmet, (as he was inioyned)
into the custody of the <hi>Arbitrators</hi> then chosen, which
were two <hi>Headborrowes</hi> of a <hi>Hamlet</hi> neere adioyning
to the City <hi>Moropolis:</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>The one had no wit, the other had no land,</l>
               <l>But botcht vp his liuing by patching with Holland.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>These <hi>Headborrowes</hi> being altogether vnskilfull in
deciding controuersies of such nature, retaynde a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Lawyer,</hi> as an <hi>Vmpeere</hi> to assist them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lawyer,</hi> when he had séene the Coate-armour,
tooke a very great liking to it, insomuch that he purpos'd
to giue the two Knights satisfaction by money, and
kéepe the Armour to himselfe, if it would fit his body
(although his conscience told him it belong'd but to one,
yet he would please both parties to serue his owne turne.
So putting it on to try the fitnes, he felt it giue him such
a shrewde pinch in the <hi>Gues,</hi> (by reason it was too little)
that he could neuer after graze any where, but on <hi>bare
<pb facs="tcp:4622:14"/>
Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>O Gaffer Lawyer, stay, how do you looke?</l>
               <l>Sir Pheander will note downe your name in his book.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>So the <hi>Lawyer</hi> séeing his purpose preuented by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and no benefit like to rise towards himselfe, he
would take no further paynes in the busines, but left it
to the discretion of the two <hi>Headborrowes:</hi> who now
hauing the whole and absolute power of determining
the cause, and withall the Coate-armour in their owne
hands, they made no great haste to beate their heads
together about an award, but (like subtill <hi>Foxes)</hi> made
good vse of the Armour for the most part of their whole
yéere, to <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Ward</hi> in, and (hauing learned
a tricke of the <hi>Lawyer,)</hi> fed the two Knights with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
till their owne turnes were serued, and in the
end, (because neyther of them could write or read) they
return'd an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the matter was vnderstood to bée so difficult,
that such Understanding men (as they were taken to
be) could not decyde the controuersie, it was held
fit, that they should try out their owne rights in single
combate, by reason both challeng'd with like proofes,
and the one would not indure the other, to bee riuall
in eythers absolute right: where indéed, necessity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no plurality in such a <hi>Case.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>You say very true, the weather growes hot:</l>
               <l>And two fooles at once were too much in one coate.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The day for Combate was appoynted, and the
two Combatants had warning giuen them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
themselues sufficiently for the mayntenance of their
iust claymes.</p>
            <p>Now does the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> lye rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
euery night, tossing and tumbling in his bed
without sléepe, bethinking himselfe (being of a timorous
nature) what the issue of this dangerous quarrell
may come to, and (oftentimes) heartily wished,
<pb facs="tcp:4622:15"/>
               <!-- keyed by pfs after PQ rescan -->
he had neuer challeng'd ſo worthy a Knight, for ſo ſmall a trifle.</p>
            <p>On the contrary part, the Knight of the <hi>Moone</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be very vnwilling to expoſe his body to ſuch an eminent danger, eſpecially againſt a Knight of his owne order, but rather could wiſh him to sléepe in peace, till he did awake him, which he would not do for a world; but that his <hi>Knight-ſheeps word</hi> was ſo farre ingag'd.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Alas, poore Knights, I much bewayle their caſe,</l>
               <l>To ſee how meager both looke in the face.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> armed himſelfe in a new white armour, which he neuer tryed before, and (for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencyes ſake) went into his chamber, to his looking <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> to ſée how his Armour did fit and become him, and finding it to his liking, he called his <hi>Page,</hi> and aſked his opinion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Page</hi> anſwered, that the Armour did not fit or become him, in his opinion. (Quoth the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi>) No, my pretty <hi>Page</hi>? Why, the Glaſſe in my chamber tels me, it is very proportionable and fit.</p>
            <p>Sir, beléeue not the <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> (quoth the <hi>Page</hi>) for the <hi>knquiſh Opticke</hi> made it to reflect many faire figures on fowle faces, and they will flatter many, and make them ſéeme farre better then they are.

            </lg>
            <p>At his sudden comming in, the two Knights stomacks

he sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded a charge: which the two Knights hearing, they
put on couragiously, with as swift speed as their horses

               <note place="margin">Or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadilla.</note> which put him in such a madde standing <hi>Choller,</hi>
that he forgot to beare vp the poynt of his <hi>Launce,</hi> in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the <hi>Burre</hi> had like to light vpon the skirts of

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> (premeditating the danger,

tooke hold of the Saddle pummell with one hand, and
checkt in his Courser with the other, so fiercely &amp; short,
that he made a sudden stand, in lesse then a quarter of an

            <p>In the second course, the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> vsed
his Launce for a <hi>Iacobs staffe,</hi> and winking with one

to which height, he most politikely glided his Launce,
all along on the top of the <hi>Barre,</hi> the whole careere to the
very shocke, where (by great chaunce) he broke his
staffe with such a counterbuffe, that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the
<hi>Sunne</hi> was halfe way behind the saddle, before he could
catch hold of his horses mayne, which otherwise had kist
his <hi>tayle</hi> to the very ground but his sure hold so nimbly
recouered him, that he brake his Launce athwart the
<hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Moones</hi> brest with such fury, that the
<hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> was extremely troubled with
the passion of the heart: wherewith he was so grieued,
that the next course he was fully resolued, to seale the
<hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> his <hi>Quietus est.</hi> And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he called for a stiffe Launce, with a full resolue, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to breake the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Suns</hi> backe, or at least,
to dismount him ouer his horses crooper.</p>
            <p>The Launce was deliuered to him, which was a
great deale too big for the graspe of his hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:4622:17"/>
he put it vnder his arme, and tooke fast hold with
both his hands on the <hi>Pummell</hi> of the Saddle: and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his full course, he hit the Knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the thumbe of his <hi>Gauntlet,</hi> which beat backe the

turnd the Knight of the <hi>Moone</hi> out of his Saddle to the

            <p>But recouering himselfe, and halfe mad with fury,
he ranne his horse about to the same side of the <hi>Barre,</hi>
where the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> was, and most cowardly
(against the law of <hi>legges</hi>) set vpon the Knight of the
<hi>Sunne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or, armes.</note> with both his armed fists, when the Knight of

but his <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Launce</hi> (which he so dearely loued)
that he carefully preserued it from breaking that course.</p>
            <p>In this their last course of <hi>Tilting,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not ale-tubs.</note> the very <hi>dregges</hi>

not dare to appeare from their valiant swords, for feare

            <p>In this conflict they were both so farre spent and

could not take the true picture of <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman,</hi>

            <p>This darke <hi>Eclipse</hi> was more beneficiall to <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chaundlers,</hi>

the often going to and fro of the <hi>Pot,</hi> made them talke

So that <hi>State</hi> businesses (which nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd

braynes, that many of them went raling out of doores.
But if money began to fail out somewhat short, before
they came to the heyght of their <hi>State</hi> matters, then
many of them, (like a company of <hi>fowle-mouth'd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes</hi>)

            <p>This darke Eclipse was almost the vndoing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
