         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this poore Pamphlet to your nobility, in
all seruility and humility: not doubting
but the fluent fecundity of your wisdomes

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aturday</hi> the 17. of August,
1616. (after I had taken
leaue of some friends that
would hardly giue me leaue
to leaue them) I was associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with fiue or sixe courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Comrades to the Hauen
of <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> where I was
no sooner come, but I was shipt in a wherry for
the port of Graues-end, and hauing two women
and three men in my company thither, we past the
way away by telling tales by turnes. Where one
of the women tooke vpon her very Logically to
defend the honesty of Brokers, and she maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
her Paradoxicall Arguments so pithily, as if
her selfe like a desperate pawne had layen seauen
yeares in Lauender on sweetning in long Lane, or
<pb facs="tcp:18858:5"/>
amongst the dogged inhabitants of Houndsditch.
And one of the men replied that he thanked God
he neuer had any need of them, whereupon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to suspect him to be a crafty knaue, because
the Prouerbe saies, <hi>A crafty knaue needs no broker,</hi>
and indeede after I had enquired what countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he was, he told me he was a Welch man, and
a Iustices Clarke. I left him as I found him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
neuer to be troubled with his binding ouer,
and withdrawing: and so landing at Graues-end,
wee all went to the <hi>Christopher</hi> where wee tooke a
Bachanalian farewell one of another, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
till the Munday following, awayting the
comming downe of the ship that I was to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
in. About the houre of three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
with good hope we weighed Anchor, and
with a curteous tide and a gentle winde we sailed
downe the riuer of Thames, as farre as the grand
Oyster hauen of <hi>Quinborough,</hi> where though our
ship was not Sea-sicke, yet shee cast, (Anchor I
meane.)</p>
            <p>On the morrow, being Tuesday, wee weighed,
and with the friendly breath of <hi>Zephirus,</hi> aliâs a
Westerne wind, our sailes being swolne, our ship
called the <hi>Iudith,</hi> who with her sterne cut the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
mounting mountaines of <hi>Neptunes</hi> wauering
territories, as nimbly as Hebrew <hi>Iudith</hi> beheaded
<hi>Holofernes,</hi> so that by the bountifull fauour of him
that rules both Windes and Seas, on the Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following wee espied the coast of Freezeland,
and the next day wee sailed by an Iland called the
Holy Land, which may bee called the Land of
<pb facs="tcp:18858:5"/>
Lobsters, or the Countrie of Crabs for the plentie
of those kinde of crawling creatures that are taken
there. But we, taking time by the fore-top, let no
aduantage slip, but with a merry Gale, and a
friendly floud, on the Friday wee sailed vp the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of Elue, as farre as Stoad, where we Anchou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
till the morrow, being Saturday, and the feast
of S. <hi>Bartholmew</hi> the Apostle, we ariued at a bleake
aliâs, a towne an English mile from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi>
called <hi>Altonagh,</hi> which is so called by the <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers</hi>
because it stands all-too-nigh them for
their profit, beeing inhabited with diuers trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which doe hinder their freedome. I was no
sooner landed there, but my company and my
selfe went to a Dutch drinking-schoole, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vpsefreez'd foure pots of boone beere as yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
as gold, our host said we had foure shilling to
betall, or to pay, which made me suspect it to bee
a bawdy house by his large reckoning, till at last
I vnderstood that the shillings hee meant were but
stiuers, or three halfe pence a peece. So this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
shot being discharged (which in the totall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to the sum of sixepence English,) we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
towards <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where by the way I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
some 20. men, women, and children in diuers
places of <hi>Altonagh,</hi> all deformed, some with one
eye, some with hare-lips, crooke backt, splay foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
halfe-nozed, or one blemish or other. I admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at them, was told they were all Iewes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I perceiued the Iudgement of the high Iudge of
all, that had permitted Nature to deforme their
formes, whose Gracelesse mindes were so much
<pb facs="tcp:18858:6"/>
mishapen through want of Grace.</p>
            <p>But I being entred the City of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> on the
Saturday, I was presently conducted to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
house, where I found a kinde Host, an honest
hostesse, good company, store of meat, more of
drinke, a true Tapster, and sweet lodging. And
being at dinner, because I was a stranger, I was
promoted to the chiefest place at the Table, where
to obserue an olde custome, euery man did his best
endeuour to hauns me for my welcome, which by
interpretation is to giue a man a loafe too much
out of the Brewers basket; in which kinde of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
our English are growne such stout Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
that some of them dares bandy and contend
with the Dutch their first teachers. But after they
had hanced me as well as they could, and I pleas'd,
they administred an oath to mee, in manner and
forme as followeth;
<q>Laying my hand on a full pot</q>
            </p>
            <p>I sweare by these contents, and all that is heerein
contained, that by the courteous fauour of these
Gentlemen, I doe finde my selfe sufficiently han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and that henceforth euer I shall acknowledge
it; and that whensoeuer I shall offer to be hanced
again, I shall arme my selfe with the craft of a Fox,
the manners of a Hogge, the wisdome of an Asse,
mixt with the ciuility of a Beare. This was the
forme of the oath, which as neere as I can shall be
performed on my part; and heere is to be noted
that the first word a Nurse or a Mother doth teach
her children if they be males, is Drinke, or Beere:
So that most of them are transformed to Barrels,
<pb facs="tcp:18858:6"/>
Firkins, and Kinderkins, alwaies fraight with <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
beere.</p>
            <p>And though the City is not much more then
halfe the bignes as London is within the walls, yet
are there in it almost 800. Brewhouses, and in one
day there hath beene shipped away from thence,
337. brewings of Beere, besides 13 or 14. brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
haue beene wrackt or stayed in the towne, as
not sufficient to be bezelled in the Country.</p>
            <p>The Saturday beeing thus past, and Sunday
come, I went toward the English Church, where I
obserued many shops open, buying and selling,
chopping and changing of all maner of wares, with
the streetes furnished with Apples, Peares, Plums,
Nuts, Grapes, or any thing else that an ordinary
Market can afford, as commonly as if the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth
were but a bare ceremony without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
In which I note the Iewes in their
execrable superstition, to be more deuout and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruant,
then these Pedlars in their profession;
for on the Saturday (beeing the Iewes Sabaoth)
they neglect all humane affares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
irreligiously to their misbeleeuing faithlesse
religion.</p>
            <p>The Sermon being ended at the English
Church, I walked in the afternoone with a friend
of mine, (an Inhabitant of the Towne) to see and
to be seene, where at one of the gates was placed a
strong guard of Souldiers with Muskets, Pikes,
Halberts, and other warlike accoutrements, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the cause, and I was informed it was because
of the building of certaine new mounts and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks,
<pb facs="tcp:18858:7"/>
which were partly erected without the old
wall: And when I perceiued these fortifications,
I was amazed, for it is almost incredible for the
number of men and horses that are daily set on
worke about it, besides the work it selfe is so great
that it is past the credit of Report, and as I suppose
will prooue most inexpugnable and inuincible
Rampiers to strengthen the Towne on that side
against the inuasiue attempts of the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke
that should assaile them.</p>
            <p>But after much musing, walking further to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the fields, I espied foure or fiue pretty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of modesty goe very friendly into a counsell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
by the wayes side, as we and thousands of
people vsed to passe; they were handsome young
Girles of the age of 18. or 20. yeares a peece, and
although they had a door to shut, yet they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their businesse to bee necessary and naturall,
sate still in louing and neighbourly manner: so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
traced a turne or two, wee returned into the
Towne againe, and entring a long Garden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the walls, some of the Townes-men were shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for wagers at a marke with their muskets:
some bowling: some at slide-thrift, or shouell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord:
some dancing before a blinde fidler and
his cowbellied, dropsie, durty drabb: some at one
game, some at another, most of them drinking,
and all of them drunke, that though it was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,
which should wholly be dedicated to God,
yet by the abvse of these bursten-gutted bibbers,
they made it an after-noone consecrated, or more
truely execrated to the seruice of hell, and to the
<pb facs="tcp:18858:7"/>
great amplification of the Deuills kingdome.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When Christians dare Gods Sabboth to abuse,</l>
               <l>They make themselues a scorne to Turkes and Iewes:</l>
               <l>You stealing <hi>Barabasses</hi> beastly Race,</l>
               <l>Rob God of glory, and your selues of Grace.</l>
               <l>Thinke on the supreame Iudge who all things tries,</l>
               <l>When Iewes in Iudgement shall against you rise.</l>
               <l>Their feigned trueth, with feruent Zeale they show,</l>
               <l>The Truth vnfeign'd you know, yet will not know.</l>
               <l>Then at the Barre in new Ierusalem,</l>
               <l>It shall be harder much for you then them.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But leauing them to their drunken designes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
toward my lodging, where by the way I saw
at the common Iayle of the town, a great number
of people were clustred together, I asked the cause
of their concourse, and I was certified that there
was a Prisoner to be broken vpon the wheele the
next day, and that these idle Gazers did prease to
gape vpon him for want of better imployments, I
being as inquisitiue after nouelties, as a Traueller
of my small experience might be, enquired earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the true cause of the next daies execution: my
friend told me that the Prisoner was a poore Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
dwelling in the Towne, who lately hauing
stolne a Goose, and plucking it within his doores,
a little Girle, (his daughter in Law) went out of
his house, &amp; left the dore open, by which meanes,
the owner of the Goose passing by, espied the
wretched theefe very diligently picking what hee
before had beene stealing, to whom the owner
<pb facs="tcp:18858:8"/>
said; Neighbour I now perceiue which way my
Geese vse to goe, but I will haue you in question
for them, and so away he went: the Caitife being
thus reproued grew desperate, and his child com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into his house; ye yong whore, quoth hee,
must ye leaue my dore open for folkes to looke in
vpon me? and with that word, hee tooke a Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet,
and with a fatall cursed stroake, he cloue the
childes head: for the which murder hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and iudged to be broaken aliue vpon the
wheele. Close to the Iayle I espied a house of free
stone, round and flat roofed, and leaded, vpon the
which was erected the true picture of a most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
Hang-man; and now I am entred into
a discourse of this braue abiect, or subiect, you
must vnderstand that this fellow is a merry, a mad
and a subsidie hangman, to whom our Tyburne
Tatterdemallian, or our Wapping windpipe-stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
is but a Raggamuffin, not woorth the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for this teare-throat Termagant is a fellow in
Folio, a commander of such great command, &amp; of
such greatnesse to command, that I neuer saw any
that in that respect could countermand him: For
his making is almost past description, no Saracens
head seemes greater, and sure I thinke his braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
if it were emptied, (as I thinke hee hath not
much braine in it,) would well containe halfe a
bushell of mault, his shaggie haire and beard would
stuffe a Cusheon for <hi>Charons</hi> boate, his Imbost
nose and embroydered face, would furnish a Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller;
his eies well dried, would make good Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-balls,
or shot for a small peece of Ordinance,
<pb facs="tcp:18858:8"/>
his yawning mouth would serue for a Connibor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and his two ragged rowes of teeth, for a stone
wall, or a Pale; then hath hee a necke like one of
<hi>Hercules</hi> his pillars, with a winde-pipe, (or rather a
beere pipe) as bigge as the boare of a Demiculue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
or a woodden pumpe; through which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
halfe a brewing of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> beere doth run
downe into his vnmeasurable paunch, wherein
is more midriff, guts and garbage then three tripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues
could be able to vtter before it stunke. His
post-like legges were answerable to the rest of the
great frame which they supported, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
sir <hi>Beuis, Ascapart, Gogmagog,</hi> or our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
sir <hi>Iohn Falstaff,</hi> were but shrimpes to this bez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeling
Bombards longitude, latitude, altitude, and
crassitude, for hee passes, and surpasses the whole
Germane multitude.</p>
            <p>And as he is great in corpulency, so is he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
in potency, for figuratiuely he hath spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
resemblance of Romish authority, and in some
sort hee is a kinde of demy-Pope, for once a yeere
in the dogge-daies he sends out his men with bats
in stead of Buls, with full power from his greatnes
to knocke downe all the curs without contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whose masters or owners will not be at the
charge to buy a pardon for them of his mightines,
which pardon is more dureable then the Popes of
waxe or parchment, for his is made of a piece of
the hide of an Oxe, a Horse, or such lasting stuffe,
which with his stigmaticall stampe or seale is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
about euery dogs necke who is freed from his
<pb facs="tcp:18858:9"/>
furie by the purchase of his pardon. And sure I
am perswaded that these dogges are more sure of
their liues with the hangmans pardon, then the
poore besotted blinded Papists are of their sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
soules from any pardon of the Popes.</p>
            <p>The priuiledges of this graund haulter-master
are many, as he hath the emptying of all the vaults
or draughts in the city, which no doubt he gaines
some sauour by. Besides all Oxen, Kine, Horses,
Hogs, Dogs, or any such beasts, if they dye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
or if they be not like to liue, the hang-man
must knocke them on the heads, and haue their
skins: and whatsoeuer inhabitant in his iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth any of these things aforesaid himselfe, is
abhorred and accounted as a villaine without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
So that with hangings, headings, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
pardoning and killing of dogges, flaying of
beasts, emptying vaults, and such priuy commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
his whole reuenue sometimes amounts to 4.
or 5. hundred pounds a yeere. And hee is held in
that regard and estimation, that any man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
and drinke with him, nay sometimes the
Lords of the Towne will feast with him, and it is
accounted no impeachment to their honours; for
he is held in the ranke of a Gentleman, (or a ranke
Gentleman) and he scornes to bee clad in the cast
weedes of executed offenders: No, he goes to the
Mercers, and hath his Sattin, his Veluet, or what
stuffe he pleases, measured out by the yard or the
ell, with his gould and siluer lace, his silke stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
laced spangled garters and roses, hat and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:18858:9"/>
with foure or fiue brauè villaines attending
him in Liuery cloakes, who haue stipendary
meanes from his ignominious bounty.</p>
            <p>Monday the 19. of August, about the houre of
12. at noone, the people of the towne in great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
flocked to the place of execution; which is
halfe a mile English without the gates, built more
like a sconce then a Gallowes, for it is walled and
ditched about with a draw-bridge, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
came on foot with a Diuine with <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, all the
way exhorting him to repentance, and because
death should not terrifie him, they had giuen him
many rowses and carowses of wine and beere: for
it is the custome there to make such poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
drunke, whereby they may be sencelesse ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Gods mercy or their owne miserie; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prayed for by others, they themselues may
die resolutely, or (to be feared) desperately.</p>
            <p>But the prisoner beeing come to the place of
death, hee was by the officers deliuered to the
hangman, who entring his strangling fortification
with two graund hangmen more and their men,
which were come from the city of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
towne, (which I cannot name) to assist their
<hi>Hamburghian</hi> brother in this great and weighty
worke: the draw-bridge was drawne vp, and the
prisoner mounted on a mount of earth, built high
on purpose that the people without may see the
execution a quarter of a mile round about: foure
of the hangmans men takes each of them a small
halter, and by the hands and the feet they hold the
<pb facs="tcp:18858:10"/>
prisoner extended all abroad lying on his backe:
then the Arch-hangman, or the great Master of
this mighty busines tooke vp a wheele, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bignesse of one of the fore wheeles of a
Coach: and first hauing put off his doublet, his
hat, and being in his shirt as if he meant to play at
tennis, he tooke the wheele, and set it on the edge,
and turned it with one hand like a top or a whiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gigg,
then he tooke it by the spoaks, and lifting it
vp with a mighty stroke he beat one of the poore
wretches leggs in peeces, (the bones I meane) at
which hee rored grieuously; then after a little
pawse he breakes the other legg in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and consequently breakes his armes, and then
he stroke foure or fiue maine blowes on his breast,
and burst all his bulke and chest in shiuers, lastly he
smoate his necke, and missing, burst his chin and
iawes to mammocks; then hee tooke the broken
mangled corps, and spreads it on the wheele, and
thrusts a great post or pile into the Naue or hole
of the wheele, and then fixed the post into the
earth some sixe foot deepe, being in height aboue
the ground, some tenne or twelue foote, and there
the carkasse must lye till it be consumed by all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consuming
time, or rauening fowles.</p>
            <p>This was the terrible manner of this horrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and at this place are twenty posts with
those wheeles, or peeces of wheeles, with heads of
men nailed on the top of the posts, with a great
spike driuen through the skull. The seuerall kinds
of torments which they inflict vpon offenders in
<pb facs="tcp:18858:10"/>
those parts, makes me to imagine our English han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to be but a flea-biting.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if any man in those parts are to be
beheaded, the fashion is, that the Prisoner kneeles
downe, and being blinded with a Napkin, one
takes hold of the haire of the crowne of the head,
holding the party vpright, whilest the hangman
with a backward blow with a sword will take the
head from a mans shoulders so nimbly, and with
such dexterity, that the owner of the head shall
neuer misse the want of it. And if it be any mans
fortune to be hanged for neuer so small a crime,
though he be mounted whole, yet hee shall come
downe in peeces, for he shall hang till euery ioynt
and limbe drop one from another.</p>
            <p>They haue strange torments and varieties of
deaths, according to the various nature of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
that are committed: as for example, he that
countersets any Princes coyne, and is prooued a
Coyner, his iudgement is to be boyled to death in
oyle, not throwne into the vessell all at once, but
with a pully or a Rope to bee hanged vnder the
Armepits, and let downe into the oyle by degrees:
first the feete, and next the legs, and so to boyle
his flesh from his bones aliue. For those that set
houses on fire wilfully, they are smoked to death,
as first there is a pile or post fixed in the ground,
and within an English Ell of the top of it is a peece
of wood nailed crosse, wherepuon the offender
is made fast sitting, then ouer the top of the post is
whelmed a great tub or Dryfat, which doth couer
<pb facs="tcp:18858:11"/>
or ouerwhelme the prisoner as low as his middle.
Then vnderneath the executioner hath wet straw,
hay, stubble, or such kinde of stuffe, which is fired,
but by reason it is wet and danke, it doth not burn
but smolder and smoake, which smoake ascends
vp into the tub where the Prisoners head is, and
not being able to speake, hee will heaue vp and
downe with his belly, and people may perceiue
him in these torments to liue three or foure
houres,</p>
            <p>Adultery there, if it bee prooued, is punished
with death, as the losse of both the parties heads,
if they be both married, or if not both, yet the
the married party must dye for it, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must endure some easier punishment, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the purse or carkasse; which in the end
proues little better then halfe a hanging.</p>
            <p>But as after a tempest a calme is best welcome;
so I imagine it not amisse after all this tragicall
harsh discourse, to sweeten the Readers pallat
with a few Comicall reports which were related
vnto me, wherein, if I seeme fabulous, it must
be remembred that I claime the priuiledge of a
traueller, who hath authority to report all that hee
heares and sees, and more too. I was informed
of a fellow that was hanged somewhat neere the
high way, within a mile or two of <hi>Collein,</hi> and
the fashion being to hang him with a halter and a
chaine, that when the haulter is rotten with the
weather, the carkasse drops a butten hole lower
into the chaine. Now it fortuned that this fellow
<pb facs="tcp:18858:11"/>
was executed on a winters afternoone towards
night, and being hanged, the chaine was shorter
then the halter, by reason whereof hee was not
strangled, but by the gamming of the chaine
which could not slip close to his necke, he hanged
in great torments vnder the Iawes, it happened
that as soone as hee was trust vp, there fell a great
storme of raine and winde, whereupon all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ran away from the Gallowes to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
But night being come, and the moone
shining bright, it chanced that a Country Boore,
or a waggoner and his Sonne with him were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their empty waggon by the place where the
fellow was hanged, who being not choaked, in
the extremity of his paines did stirre his legges and
writhe and crumple his body, which the waggo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Sonne perceiued, and said; Father looke, the
man vpon the Gallowes doth mooue: quoth the
olde man he moues indeed, I pray thee let vs make
hast, and put the Waggon vnder the Gibbet, to
see if we can vnhang and saue him. This beeing
said was quickely done, and the wretch halfe dead
was laid in straw in the Boores wagon, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home, where with good attendance he was in
foure or fiue daies recouered to his health, but that
he had a cricke in his necke, and the crampe in his
iawes. The olde man was glad that he had done
so good a deed, (as he thought) began to giue the
thiefe Fatherly counsell, and told him that it was
Gods great mercy towards him to make mee
(quoth he) the Instrument of thy deliuerance, and
<pb facs="tcp:18858:12"/>
therefore looke that thou make good vse of this
his gracious fauour towards thee, and labour to
redeeme the time thou hast mispent, get thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
some other Princes countrey, where thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
crimes may not bring thee into the danger of
the Law againe, and there with honest industrious
endeuours get thy liuing.</p>
            <p>The theefe seemed willing to entertaine these
good admonitions, and thanked the Boore and
his Sonne, telling them that the next morning he
would be gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if euer his fortunes made
him able, he promised to be so gratefull vnto them
that they should haue cause to say their great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
were well bestowed vpon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all his
sugred sweet promises, were in the proofe but
Gall and wormwood in the performance: for this
gracelesse Caitiffe arose betimes in the morning,
and drew on a paire of Bootes and spurs which
were the mans sonnes of the house, and slipping
out of the dores, went to the stable and stole one
of his kinde hosts best horses, and away rode hee.
The man and his Sonne, when they were vp and
missed the thiefe and the horse, were amazed at
the ingratitude of the wretch, and withall speed
his sonne and he rode seuerall waies in pursuit of
him, and in briefe one of them tooke him, and
brought him backe to their house againe, and
when it was night they bound him, and laid him
in their wagon (hauing deafe eares, and hardened
hearts to all his intreaties) and away to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
where they found him hanging, there they
<pb facs="tcp:18858:12"/>
with the halter being a little shortned, they left
him. The next day the Country people wondred
to see him hanging there againe, for they had seene
him hanged, and missed him gone, and now to be
thus strangely and priuately come againe in boots
and spurs, whereas they remembred at his first
hanging he had shoes and stockings, it made them
muse what iourney he had beene riding, and what
a mad Ghest he was to take the Gallowes for his
Inne, or (as I suppose) for his end.</p>
            <p>The rumour of this accident being bruited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brood,
the people came far and neere to see him,
all in generall wondring how these things should
come to passe. At last, to cleere all doubts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
were published with pardon, and a
reward to any that could discouer the truth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the old Boore and Sonne came in and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the whole circumstance of the matter.</p>
            <p>At another place (the hangmans place being
void) there were two of the bloud, (for it is to be
noted that the succession of that office doth lineal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
descend from the Father to the Sonne, or to the
next of the bloud) which were at strife for the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of this high indignity. Now it happened
that two men were to be beheaded at the same
towne, and at the same time, and (to auoid suite in
Law for this great prerogatiue) it was concluded
by the Arbitrators, that each of these new hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should execute one of the prisoners, and hee
that with greatest cunning and sleight could take
the head from the body, should haue the place, to
<pb facs="tcp:18858:13"/>
this they all agreed, &amp; the Prisoners were brought
forth, where one of the Executioners did binde a
red silke thred double about his prisoners necke,
the threds beeing distant one from another onely
the bredth of one thred, and he promised to cut off
the head with a backward blow with a sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the threds. The other called his prisoner
aside, and told him that if he would bee ruled by
him, hee should haue his life saued, and besides,
(quoth he) I shall be sure to haue the office. The
Prisoner was glad of the motion, and said he wold
doe any thing vpon these conditions, then said the
hangman, when thou art on thy knees, and hast
said thy prayers, and that I doe lift vp my Axe,
(for I will vse an Axe) to strike thee, I will cry
Hem, at which word doe thou rise and run away,
(thou knowest none will stay thee if thou canst
once escape after thou art deliuered into my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody,
it is the fashion of our countrie) and let me
alone to shift to answer the matter. This being
said, or whispered, the heads-man with the sword
did cut off his prisoners head iust betweene the
threds as hee had said, which made all the people
wonder at the steddinesse of his hand, and most of
them iudged that he was the man that was and
would be fittest to make a mad hangman of.</p>
            <p>But as one tale is good till another be told, and
as there be three degrees of good, better, and best,
so this last hangman did much exceed and ecclips
the others cunning: For his prisoner being on his
knees, and he lifting vp his axe to giue the fatall
<pb facs="tcp:18858:13"/>
blow, <hi>Hem</hi> said he (according to promise) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the fellow arose and ran away, but when he
had ran some seuen or eight paces, the hangman
threw the axe after him, and strooke his head
smoothly from his shoulders: now for al this, who
shall haue the place is vnknowne, for they are yet
in Law for it; and I doubt not but before the
matter be ended, that the lawyers will make them
exercise their owne trades vpon themselues to end
the controuersie. This tale doth sauour somwhat
hyperbolicall, but I wish the Reader to beleeue
no more of the matter then I saw, and there is
an end.</p>
            <p>At another Towne there stood an olde ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne
despised paire of Gallowes, but yet not so
old but they will last many a faire yeare with good
vsage, but the Townsmen a little distance from
them built another pair, in a more stately Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall
port and fashion, whereupon they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
why they would be at the charge to erect
a new Gallowes, hauing so sufficient an old one:
they answered, that those old Gallowes should
serue to hang fugitiues and strangers; but those
new ones were built for them and their heires for
euer. Thus much for Hangmen, Theeues, and
Gallowses.</p>
            <p>Yet one thing more for theeues: In <hi>Hamburgh</hi>
those that are not hanged for theft, are chained 2.
or three together, and they must in that sort sixe
or seauen yeares draw a dung-cart, and clense the
streetes of the towne, &amp; euery one of those theeues
<pb facs="tcp:18858:14"/>
for as many yeares as he is condemned to that
slauery, so many bells he hath hanged at an iron
aboue one of his shoulders, and euery yeare a bell
is taken off, till all are gone, and then he is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
againe, and I did see ten or twelue of these
Carts, and some of the theeues had seuen bels,
some 5. some 6. some one, but such a noyse they
make, as if all the Deuils in hell were dancing the
morrice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hamburgh</hi> is a free City, not being subiect to
the Emperor, or any other Prince, but onely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by 24 Burgomasters, whereof two are the
chiefe, who are clled Lords, adn doe hold that
dignity from their first election during their liues;
The buildings are all of bricke, of one vniforme
fashion, very lofty and stately, it is wonderfull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
and the water with boates comes through
most of the streetes of the Towne.</p>
            <p>Their Churches are most gloriously set forth,
as the most of them couered with copper, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lofty spires, and within sides they are adorned
with crucifixes, Images and pictures, which they
doe charily keepe for ornaments, but not for idle
or idoll adoration; In Saint <hi>Iacobs</hi> and in Saint <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therines</hi>
Churches, there is in one of them a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
of Alablaster, and in the other a paire of such
Organs, which for worth and workemanship are
vnparalelld in Christendome, as most trauellers
doe relate.</p>
            <p>The women there are no fashion-mongers, but
they keepe in their degrees one continuall habite,
<pb facs="tcp:18858:14"/>
as the Richer sort doe weare a Huicke, which is a
robe of cloth or stuffe plaited, and the vpper part
of it is gathered and sowed to a thing in the forme
of an English potlid, with a tassell on the top, and
so put vpon the head, and the garment goes ouer
her ruffe and face if she please, and so down to the
ground, so that a man may meet his owne wife,
and perhaps not know her from another Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>They haue no Porters to beare burdens, but
they haue bigge burly-bon'd knaues with their
wiues that doe daily draw Carts any whether vp
and downe the towne, with Marchants goods or
any other imployments: And it is reported that
these Cart-drawers are to see the rich men of the
Towne prouided of milch-nurses for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which nurses they call by the name of <hi>Ams,</hi>
so that if they doe want a nurse at any time, these
fellowes are cursed, because they haue not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wenches enough with childe to supply their
wants.</p>
            <p>But if a man of any fashion doe chance to goe
astray to a house of iniquity, the whilst he is in the
house at his drudgery, another of the whores will
go to the Sherif, (which they call the Rightheere)
and informe that such a man is in such a suspected
howse, then is his comming forth narrowly wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and hee is taken and brought before the
Right-heere, and examined, where if he be a man
of credit, he must, and will pay forty, fifty, or sixty
Rex Dollors before hee will haue his reputation
<pb facs="tcp:18858:15"/>
called in question. Of which money, the queane
that did informe shall haue her reward.</p>
            <p>A Lawyer hath but a bad trade there, for any
Cause or Controuersie is tried and determined in
three daies, Quirks, Quiddits, Demurs, Habeas
Corposes, Sursararaes, Procedendoes, or any such
dilatory Law-tricks are abolished, and not worth
a button there.</p>
            <p>But aboue all, I must not forget the rare acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and humours of a Quacksaluer or Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke,
or to speake more familiarly, a shadow of
a skilfull Chirurgian. This fellow beeing clad in
an ancient doublet of decayed Satin, with a Spruce
Leather Ierkin with Glasse buttons, the rest of his
attire being correspondent, was mounted vpon
a Scaffold, hauing shelues set with Viols, Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots,
Glasses, Boxes, and such like stuffe, wherein
as he said, were Waters, Oyles, Vnguents, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasters,
Ellectuaries, Vomits, Purges, and a world
of neuer heard of Drugs; and being mounted (as
I said) he and his man begin to proclaime all their
skill and more, hauing a great number of idle and
ignorant gazers on, he began as followeth (as I
was informed by my Interpreter) for I vnderstood
not one worde he spake.)</p>
            <p>I <hi>Iacomo Compostella,</hi> Practitioner in Physicke,
Chyrurgery, and the Mathematicks, being a man
famous through Europe, Asia, Affricke and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
from the Orientall exaltation of <hi>Titan,</hi> to his
Occidentall declination, who for the Testimony
of my skill, and the rare Cures that I haue done,
<pb facs="tcp:18858:15"/>
haue these Princes hands and seales; as first the
great <hi>Cham</hi> of Tartaria, in whose Court, onely
with this Water, which is the Ellixar of Henbane
diafracted in a Diurnall of ingredients Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonticke,
Auicenian, and Catarackt, With this did
I cure the great Dutchesse of <hi>Promulpho</hi> of the
cramp in her tongue: and with this Oyle did I
restore the Emperor <hi>Gregory Euanowich</hi> of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion
in his Pericranion. From thence I trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
through <hi>Slauonia,</hi> where I met with <hi>Mustapha
Despot</hi> of <hi>Seruia,</hi> who at that time was intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
vexed with a <hi>Spasmus,</hi> so that it often droue
him into a Syncope with the violent obstructions
of the conflagerating of his Vaines. Onely with
this precious Vnguent being the Quintessence of
<hi>Mugwort,</hi> with <hi>Auripigmenty</hi> terragrophicated in
a Limbecke of Christalline Translucency, I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
him to his former health, and for my reward
I had a Barbary Horse with rich Caparisons, a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Semitar, a Persian Robe, and 2000. Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Ducats.</p>
            <p>Besides, here are the hands and seales of <hi>Poto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamacke,
Adelantado</hi> of <hi>Prozewgma,</hi> and of <hi>Gulch
Flownderscurse</hi> chiefe Burgomaster of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,
and of diuers Princes and estates, which to
auoid tedious prolixity I omit. But good people

the body of man or woman, come and buy
while you may haue it for money, for I am sent
for speedily to the Emperour of <hi>Trapezond</hi> about
affaires of great Importance that highly concernes
his royall person.</p>
            <p>Thus almost two houres did this fellow with
embost words, and most laborious action, talke
and sweat to the people, that vnderstood no more
what hee said, then hee himselfe vnderstood him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And I thinke his whole takings for simple
compounds did amount in the totall to 9. pence
sterling.</p>
            <p>But leauing <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> (hauing gathered these
few obseruations aforesaid) out of it I went <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
28. and my first iaunt of my trauels was by
water, to a Towne called <hi>Buckstahoo,</hi> it is a little
walled Towne, and stands on the other side of the
Riuer, three miles (as they call it) from <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
The boate wee passed in is called an <hi>Iuar,</hi> not so
good as a Graues-end barge, yet I thinke it bee as
great, and the three miles longer then from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to Graues-end, for I am sure that we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nine houres before we could be landed: Our
passage cost vs threepence a peece, and one thing I
remember well, that the lazie water-men will sit
<pb facs="tcp:18858:16"/>
still all (or the most part of) the way, whilest their
passengers, (be they neuer so rich or poore, all is
one to them, be they men or women) they must
rowe by turnes, an houre or such a matter: and we
landed in the night at a place called Crants, where
all the passengers were to goe to supper, but such
diet we had that the Prouerbe was truely verified,
<hi>God sent meat, and the Deuill sent Cookes;</hi> for as there
was no respect of persons in the boate, so all fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
at the Table, and all once price, the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
and the Plebeian: our first messe was great
platters of blacke broath, in shape like new tarre,
and in tast Cosen Germane, to slut pottage; our
second were dishes of Eeeles, chop'd as small as
hearbs, and the broth they were in as salt as
brine: then had wee a boyld Goose, with choake
peares and carrats, buried in a deepe dish; and
when wee demanded what was to pay, it was but
three pence a man, I mused at the cheapnesse of it,
but afterward they came vpon vs with a fresh rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
of fiue pence a man for beere, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
count their meate and drinke together, but
bring in seuerall reckonings for them: but the
morning being come, we hired a Boores Wagon,
to carry vs to a place called <hi>Citizen,</hi> three miles
there, or 12. English miles from <hi>Buckstahoo:</hi> a little
bald dorp it is, where we came about noone, and
found such slender entertainment, that we had no
cause to boast of our good cheere, or our Hostesse
Cookery. We hauing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refreshed our selues, and
hyred a fresh Wagon, away wee went two miles
<pb facs="tcp:18858:17"/>
further to another Dorp called <hi>Rodonburgh,</hi> this
village belongeth to the Bishop of <hi>Rodonburgh,</hi>
who hath a faire house there, stronglie walled and
deepely ditched and moated about, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible,
with draw-bridges, and good Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
This Bishop is a temporall Lord, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his spirituall title; and no doubt but the
flesh preuailes aboue the Spirit with him; So the
Bishops of <hi>Breame, Luningburgh,</hi> and diuers other
places in Germany, doe very charitably take the
fleece, (for they themselues neuer looke to the
flocke) by reason they vse no Ecclesiasticke fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but onely in name.</p>
            <p>Being lodged at <hi>Rodonburgh,</hi> in a stately Inne,
where the Host, Hostesse, Guests, Cowes, Horses,
Swine, lay all in one Roome; yet I must confesse
their beds to be very good, and their linnen sweet,
but in those parts they vse no couerlet, rugge or
blanket, but a good featherbed vndermost, with
cleane sheetes, pillowes, and pillowbeares, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
featherbed vppermost, with a faire sheet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all, so that a mans lodging is like a womans
lying In, all white.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> the 30. wee went from <hi>Rodonburgh,</hi>
and about noone wee came to an olde walled
towne, called <hi>Feirden,</hi> it hath two Churches in
it, and the hangmans statue very artificially car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in stone, and set on a high pillar, with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a rod
rampant in his hand, at this towne I met with
sixe strangers, all trauellers, where we went to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
together all at one table, and euery man ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:18858:17"/>
his knapsack or budget with victualls; (for he
that carries no meat with him, many fast by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in most places of that country) but to note the
kindnes of these people one to another, some had
bread and a boxe of salt butter, some had raw ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
some had cheese, some had pickled herring,
some dried beefe, and amongest the rest, I had
brought three ribs of rost beefe, and other proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from <hi>Hanburgh:</hi> to conclude, wee drew all
like fidlers, and fed (for the most part) like swine
for euery man eat what was his owne, and no man
did proffer one bit of what he had to his neighbor,
so he that had cheese must dine with cheese, for he
that had meat would offer him none; I did cut e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one a part of my rost beefe; which my guide
told me they would not take well because it is not
the fashion of the Countrey: I tried, and found
them very tractable to take any thing that was
good, so that I perceiued their modesty to take
one from another, proceedes from their want of
manners to offer. But dinner being done, away
wee went ouer a bridge, in the midst whereof is
a Iynn, made in the likenesse of a great Lanthorne,
it is hanged on a turning Gybbet, like a Crane: so
that it may be turned on the bridge, and ouer the
Riuer, as they shall please that haue occasion to
vse it. It is bigge enough to hold two men, and it is
for this purpose, if any one or more doe rob gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
or orchards, or cornefields, (if they be taken)
he or they are put into this same whirligigge, or
kickumbob, and the gybbet being turned, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
<pb facs="tcp:18858:18"/>
hangs in this Cage ouer the Riuer some 12
or 14 foot from the water, then there is a small line
made fast to the party some 5. or 6. fadome, and
with a tricke which they haue, the bottome of the
cage drops out, and the thiefe fals sodenly into the
water. I had not gone farre, but at the end of the
bridge I saw an olde chappell, which in olde time
they say was dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Frodswicke,</hi> which
hath the day after S. <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangelist: I entring
in, perceiued it was a charitable Chappell, for the
dores and windowes were alwaies open, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there were none to shut, and it was a common
receptacle for beggars and rogues. There was the
image of our Lady, with a vaile ouer her, made (as
I thinke) of a Bakers bolter, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a candle to her. I cut a peece of her Vaile, and
taking <hi>Peter</hi> by the hand at my departure, the kind
Image (I know not vpon what acquaintance) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loose handed, let me haue his hand with mee,
which being made of wood, by reason of ruinous
antiquity, burst of in the handling: which two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
relickes I brought home with me to defend
me and all my friends from sparrow blasting.</p>
            <p>From this place we were glad to trauell on foot
one dutch mile to a Dorpe called <hi>Durfurne,</hi> where
we hired a Boores waggon to a town called <hi>Nein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
but we could not reach thither by 2 English
miles, so that we were glad to lodge in a barne that
night: On the morrow early, we arose and came to
<hi>Nienburgh,</hi> which is a little walled town, belonging
to that Bishopricke from whence it is so named.
<pb facs="tcp:18858:18"/>
There we staied 3. houres before wee could get a
Waggon, at last we were mounted to a Dorpe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Leiz,</hi> two Dutch miles; I would haue bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Boore to haue carried vs to <hi>Dorne,</hi>
which I bade my guide tell him it was but a mile
further, a mile quoth the Boore, indeed we call it
no more, but it was measured with a dogge, and
they threw in the taile and all to the bargaine; so to
<hi>Leiz</hi> he carried vs, and there we found a Waggon
of <hi>Dorne</hi> homeward bound, which made vs ride
the cheaper; but it was the longest mile that euer I
rode or went, for surely it is as much as some ten
of our miles in England. But hauing ouercome it
at last, from thence I tooke a fresh Waggon to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
me two miles further to a towne called <hi>Bucka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghe,</hi>
where I had, and haue, I hope, a brother
residing; to whom my iourney was entended,
and with whom my Perambulation was at a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.
This towne of <hi>Buckaburgh</hi> is wholely and
solely belonging to the Grass or <hi>Graue</hi> of <hi>Shom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
a Prince of great command and eminence,
absolute in his authority and power, not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded
by the Emperour, or any other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then curtesie requires; and in a word, hee is
one of the best accomplisht Gentlemen in Europe
for his person, port, and princely magnificence.
He hath there to his inestimable charge, built the
towne, with many goodly houses, streets, Lanes,
a strong wall, and a deepe ditch, all well furnished
with munition and artillery, with a band of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
which he keepeth in continuall pay, allowing
<pb facs="tcp:18858:19"/>
euery man a Doller a weeke, and double apparell
euery yeere. Besides, hee hath built a stately
Church, being aboue 120. steps to the roofe, with
a faire paire of Organes, a curious carued Pulpit,
and all other ornaments belonging to the same.
His owne Pallace may well be called an earthly
Paradice, which if I should run into the praise of
the description of, I should bring my wits into an
intricate Labyrinth, that I should hardly find the
way out: yet according to the imbecillity of my
memory, I will onely touch a little at the shadow
of it, and let the substance stand where it doth.</p>
            <p>At the front or outward gate is a most stately
Arch, vpon the top whereof is erected the image
of Enuy, (as great as a demy Colossus) betweene
two Dragons, all guilt with gold; before the gate
is an iron grate to open &amp; shut as it were of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or worke of Embroydery, at which gate stands
alwaies a court of Guard, and a Sentinell, and at
the lower part of the Arch is the Princes title or
in Capitall letters as followeth;
<q>ERNESTVS, DEI GRATIA, CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MES
HOLST, Scomburgh,
Sternburgh, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After I was entred within the outward gate, I
was shewed his stables, where I saw very faire and
goodly horses, both for warre and other vses, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest there was one naturally spotted
like a Leopard, or Panther, and is called by the
name of Leopard, a stately couragious beast, and
so formed as if Nature had laid all hir cunning
<pb facs="tcp:18858:19"/>
aside, onely to compose that Horse, and indeed I
must acknowledge that hee was made for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of some great <hi>Prince,</hi> and not for any inferior
Person.</p>
            <p>Passing further, I came to another Court of
Guard, and ouer a draw-bridge, into the inner
court, where on the right hand, I was conducted
into the Chappell, in which Chappell, if it were
possible that the hand of mortall men (with artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
workemanship) could visibly set forth the
magnificent glory of the immortal Creator, then
absolutely there it is, but beeing impossible so to
doe, (as neere as I can) I will describe it; the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is all of blacke and gray marble, curiously
wrought with Chequer-worke, the seats and pues
are carued Wainscot of wonderfull cunning and
workemanship: the roofe is adorned with the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Angels and Cherubins, many in number,
all so richly guilded, as if Gold were as plentifull
as peauter, there could not be more liberality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed:
besides there are a faire set of Organs,
with a braue sweete Quire of Queristers: so that
when they sing, the Lutes, Viols, Bandoraes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
Recorders, Sagbuts, and other musicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
all strike vp together, with such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
delicious harmony, as if the Angelicall mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
of the spheares were descended into that
earthly Tabernacle. The Prince himselfe is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
very zealous in his Prayer, and diligent in
his attention to the Preacher, who although I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not, yet I perceiued he was a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb facs="tcp:18858:20"/>
who grauely and sincerely with reuerence
and eloquent Elocution deliuered the breade of
life to the vnderstanding Auditors.</p>
            <p>In this Towne I stayd with my brother from
Saturday the last of <hi>August,</hi> till the Thursday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
which was the fifth of <hi>September.</hi> When
I was conducted an English mile on my way by
certaine of my countrey-men my Lords Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
where we dranke and parted, onely my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and my Guide brought mee that night to a
strong walled Towne called <hi>Minden,</hi> which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
on the riuer of <hi>Weazer,</hi> and belongeth to the
Bishop of that See. On the morrow I walked to
see the Towne, where I bought 36. cheeses for
eight pence, and a yard and halfe of pudding for
fiue pence, which I brought into <hi>England</hi> for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.
So about noone wee tooke a boat to passe
downe the Riuer, which boat is much longer
then any westerne barge, but nothing neere so
broad, it was halfe laden with lime and chalke,
and by reason the winde blew hard, we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
choaked with the flying and scattering of
that dusty commodity. Besides the water was so
shallow, that we ran a ground 3. or 4. times, and
sometimes an houre, sometimes lesse before wee
could get a float againe: which made mee and
my Guide goe a shore at a village called <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haghen,</hi>
where we hired a waggon to <hi>Leize,</hi> where
wee stayd all night, (being come into our olde
way againe) where were a crew of strowling
rogues and whores that tooke vpon them the
name of AEgyptians, Iuglers and Fortune tellers,
<pb facs="tcp:18858:20"/>
and indeede one of them helde the Good-wife
with a tale, the whilst another was picking her
chest, and stole out ten dollors, which is fortie
shillings, and she that talked with her, looked in
her hand, and tolde her that if shee did not take
great heede, she knew by her Art that some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
was neere her: which prooued true, for
her money was gone the whilst her fortune was
telling.</p>
            <p>But I appoynted a waggon ouer night to bee
ready by three of the clocke in the morning,
when I arose and applyed my trauell so hard by
changing fresh waggons, so that that day I came
as farre as <hi>Rodonburgh,</hi> which was nine Dutch
miles, where I stayd that night: The next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sunday the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> wee tooke
waggon towards <hi>Buckstahoo,</hi> we had a mad merry
Boore, with an hundred totters about him; and
now I thinke it fit a little to describe these Boores,
their natures, habits, and vnmannerly manners.
In our English tongue the name Bore or Boore
doth truely explane their swinish condition, for
most of them are as full of humanity as a Bacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hogge,
or a Bore, and their wiues as cleanely and
and courteous as Sowes. For the most part of the
men they are clad in thinne buckerom, vnlined,
barelegged and footed, neither band or scarce
shirt, no woollen in the world about them, and
thus will they runne through all weathers for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by the waggons side, and though no better
apparrelled, yet all of them haue houses, land, or
manuall meanes to liue by: The substantiall
<pb facs="tcp:18858:21"/>
Boores I did meet aboue 120. of them that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
with euery one an hatchet in his hand, I mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at it, and thought they had been going to fell
wood that day, but my Guide told me they were
all going to Church, and that in stead of cloakes
they carried hatchets, and that it was the fashion
of the Country: wherupon it came to my mind,
Cloake, <hi>quasi</hi> Cleaue-oake, <hi>ergo</hi> the Boores weare
hatchets in steede of cloakes.</p>
            <p>There are other fashion Boores, who weare
white linnen breeches as close as Irish trouzes, but
so long, that they are turned vp at the shooe in a
role like a maides sleeues at the hand, but what
these fellowes want in the bignesse of their hose,
they haue in dublets, for their sleeues are as big
as breeches and the bodies great enough to hold
a kinderkin of beere and a barrell of butter.</p>
            <p>The Countey is very full of woods, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
oakes, which they very seldome cut downe,
because of the mast for their swine, which liue
there in great abundance. If any man bee slaine
or murthered on the way, they vse to set vp a
woodden crosse in the place, for a memoriall of
the bloody fact committed there, and there were
many of those woodden crosses in the way as I
trauelled.</p>
            <p>They seldom haue any robbery committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, but there is a murther with it, for
their vnmannerly manner is, to knocke out a mans
braines first, or else to lurke behinde a tree, and
shoot a man with a peece or a pistoll, and so make

It is as dangerous to steale or kill an hare in
some places there, as it is to rob a Church or kill
a man in <hi>England,</hi> and yet a two-penny matter
will discharge the offender, for the best and the
worst is but an halter; and I was enformed that
an English Marchant (not knowing the danger)
as he was riding on the way, hauing a peece char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his hand (as it is an ordinary weapon to
trauell with there) by chance hee espied an hare,
and shot at her and killed her; but he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
for it, and it was like to haue cost him his
life; but before he got out of the trouble, he was
faine to vse his best friends and meanes, (&amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ignorance for his innocency) at last with the
losse of a great deale of liberty, and fiue hundred
pound in money, he was discharged: The reason
of this strict conrse is, because all the hares in the
countrey doe belong to one Lord or other, and
being in abundance, they are killed by the owners
appoyntment, and carried to the markets by
cart-loads, and sold for the vse of the honourable
owners: and no Boore or Tenant that dwels in
those parts where those hares are plenty, must
keepe a dogge, except he pay fiue shillings a yeere
to the Lord, or else one of his fore-feet must be cut
of that he may not hunt hares.</p>
            <p>A man is in almost as high promotion to bee a
knaue in England, as a Knight in Germany, for
there a Gentleman is called a Youngcurr, and a
Knight is but a Youngcurs man, so that you
shall haue a scuruy Squire command a Knight to
hold his stirrup, plucke off his boots, or any other

vnknightly peece of seruice: and verily I thinke
there are an 100. seuerall Princes, Earles, Bishops
and other estates, that do euery one keepe a mint,
and in their owne names stampe Money, Gold,
Siluer, &amp; Brasse, &amp; amongst 23. two pences which
I had of their brasse money (which they call
Grushes) I had 13. seuerall coynes.</p>
            <p>Many more such worthy iniunctions and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
ordinances I obserued, which are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worth pen and inke the describing, and therefore
I omit them, and draw toward an end, for on the

&amp; on the Friday night following I was (by Gods
gracions assistance) landed at London. So that
in three weeks and three dayes, I sailed from <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and backe againe, staying in
the countrey 17. dayes, and trauelled 200. miles
by land there: gathering like a busie Bee all these
honyed obseruations, some by sight, some
by hearing, some by both, some by
neither, &amp; some by bare
supposition.</p>
