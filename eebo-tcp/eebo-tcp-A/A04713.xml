         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We will firſt begin to ſpeake of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8409:4"/>
Army conducted by the Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi>
whereof ſome three months paſt a great
rumor went, aſwell by taking vp of new
forces, withdrawing of his olde Souldiers,
as alſo his marches, ſieges, and taking in
of the towns &amp; places, lying in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of <hi>Gulicke, Cleue</hi> and <hi>Berch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the moneth of Auguſt, the Marquis
hauing gathered an Army together mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
from <hi>Brabant</hi> to the towne of <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geren,</hi>
and ſo to <hi>Maſtricke,</hi> where he increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Armie, and here came his forces
from all places marching. It was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his campe was then twentie thouſand
ſtrong aſwell horſe as foot. From thence
he went with his whole Army the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of Auguſt, marching through the
Country of <hi>Valkenburch,</hi> towards the town
of <hi>Acon</hi> or <hi>Aken;</hi> before which he came the
two and twentieth of Auguſt, deuiding
his Campe in three quarters, the one at
<hi>Bortſet,</hi> the other at the Townes place
of Execution, and the third at Saint
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8409:4"/>
               <hi>Sauiours Hill,</hi> making preſentlie his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries

            <p>The Romiſh Catholikes within,
ſeeing they were ſo fiercelie aſſaulted,
fled altogether with their goods into
the Cloiſters. And thoſe of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

ſame, were not a little amaſed, and
thereupon thought it fitte to conferre
with him; whereunto the Marquiſſe

to a Parlee, and concluded vpon the
foure and twentieth of Auguſt, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8409:5"/>
keyes were deliuered into his handes,
placing for Gouernour of the Towne
the Earle of <hi>Ritbergen,</hi> brother vnto the
Earle of <hi>Embden;</hi> permitting the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who on the behalfe of the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburger</hi>
lay within the town, to march
forth with their full Armes, flying
Enſignes, burning matches, &amp;c. Placing
for the Garriſon of the Towne fifteen
hundreth new entertained <hi>Lutzenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
Souldiers, and ſo marched forward
with his whole Armie towards <hi>Dueren.</hi>
The which thoſe of the town vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and perceiuing that he would
aſſault them, durſt not ſtay his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
but reſolued to meet him, and
deliuered him the keyes at his firſt
approach, and ſo yeelded themſelues
without compulſion or any ſhot of
Canon. The Marquis placing his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
therin, and ſo inſtantlie ſet forward
towards <hi>Berchem:</hi> Where he ſent part
of his Souldiers towards <hi>Collen,</hi> to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8409:5"/>
end with the aide of the Burgers of
<hi>Collen</hi> to ſpoile and deface the Town

and after that they had beaten
downe the walles, they inſtantlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne

left vndone, ſo as the Proteſtant inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
remaine as yet reaſonable peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in their ſeuerall houſes. A garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
onelie there remaining. Then hee
marched forward in good order with
the whole Campe through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of <hi>Gulicke</hi> towards <hi>Rynbercke,</hi> where
when he came, hee made a Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the <hi>Ryne,</hi> where the whole Armie
of the Marquis marched ouer, ioining
themſelues to the forces of <hi>Lingen</hi> and

            <p>And then a great part of the Campe
in all haſte attempted to ſhoote vpon
the towne, and by force to compell the

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8409:6"/>
cauſing ſuch a feare in ſhort time in the
City, that the Burgars who being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
with that haſt were aſtoniſhed,
&amp; being altogether diſcouraged, found
it conuenient to agree with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe,

campe in the meane time grew ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
both with horſe and foote, which
came from all quarters.</p>
            <p>And hauing this ſtrong Armie of

made, which the Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
thought they would come vpon
him, and cauſed inſtantlie a battery to
be made on the way of <hi>Rees:</hi> he had
a day before alſo, ſent out ſom troopes
higher vp into the country with certain
Wagons who ſpoiled and robbed the
poore countrimen of all that they had,

The Marquis ſtrengthning himſelfe
before <hi>Weſell,</hi> and not comming into

Excellency did vndertake ſome thing,
and ſent his brother Count <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Naſſau</hi> acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with a good troope
of horſe and foote, and ſome wagons

ſtayed for that his Princely Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
came into field, and lay ſo cloſe
vnder his wings, found It fit for the firſt
to make ſtrong and to intrench him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
endeauouring to make a ſtrong
Fort neare to the <hi>Rhine</hi> before <hi>Weſell,</hi>
whereunto his Souldiers haue as greate
deſire as a thiefe hath to bee hanged
and doe plainely ſay this, <hi>we make for
our enemy, as wee made the Skonce of Saint
Andrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo they ſay, that the Marquis

lying in the houſes ſhall buye

which thoſe of the towne muſt euerie
weeke diſburſe two thouſand Gilders,
euery one according to his ability.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, there is newes come out
of the Campe of the Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi>
that the Regiment of the Colonell <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,</hi>
being ſtrong; about twelue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
with three peeces of Ordnance,

and it is thought they goe to take the
other remaining ſmall townes, namely
<hi>Brughe, Dulken, Dalen</hi> and <hi>Glabberck.</hi> In
fine, euery one hath a ſnatch at that he
can gette, but the poore countriman
muſt looke to himſelfe, therefore the
olde Prouerbe is true, <hi>euery one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reported alſo that his excellency
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8409:15"/>
will attempt ſome other matter of no

the time will ſhew. There is preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in hand to make a ſtronger bridge
