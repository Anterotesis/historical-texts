            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>MY preaching upon this Subject was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by what I met with from a gracious Perſon's mouth (who is a Member of the Church under my charge) who ſeemed very uneaſy in her Communion, becauſe in my preaching ſhe ſaid, tho I hold forth the Doctrine of free Grace, and exalt Chriſt, yet do poſitively maintain that the Elect are under Wrath, or in a lamentable ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, or before they are united to Chriſt by the Holy Spirit, or are in a State of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him: which might I fear be occaſioned through a miſtake of that Doctrine ſome in this City of late ſo much inſiſt on, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt before the Spirit (the bond of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion) is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; not that any of our Brethren, I hope, that preach that Doctrine do believe that the Elect are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sentence of Condemnation and Wrath while they abide in the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> tho I fear they do not ſo carefully diſtinguiſh as they ought between our Fundamental and Virtual Juſtification in Chriſt, as our Head and Repreſentative, and our actual or Perſonal Juſtification when we are united to him. And finding ill uſe made of that Doctrine, I have been perſwaded to publiſh the firſt Sermon I preached upon this occaſion, not knowing how far this Notion might ſpread amongſt weak and unwary hearers, and having ſome hope this may be (through the Bleſſing of God) a prevention of it. One thing I cannot but bewail, <hi>i.e.</hi> that becauſe we may differ perhaps in ſome reſpect from that Doctrine before mentioned, that we muſt therefore be charged with
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:45979:3"/>
               <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which Error we abhor, and any other that tends to becloud or darken the Doctrine of free Juſtification by Chriſt alone, without Works or inherent Righteouſneſs. None have reaſon to think that I favour in the leaſt the <hi>Arminian</hi> or <hi>Baxterian</hi> Errors, conſidering what I have lately publiſhed on the great Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in two Sermons on <hi>Rom. 4.5.</hi> which Doctrine I have farther confirmed in thoſe Sermons preached from the Text this is grounded upon, <hi>viz.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.1.</hi> (this being only the firſt) in which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt is opened, and the ſweet Conſolation that flows therefrom to all Believers largly applied.</p>
            <p>Reader, juſt as this Sermon was going into the Preſs, I met with Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark's</hi> new Book, intituled <hi>Scripture-Juſtification,</hi> and have made ſhort Remarks on ſome things he hath ſaid: In a time of common Invaſion every Man ſhould take to his Arms; they need not wait for Orders, as one notes; for by this Man's Doctrine all is ſtruck at.</p>
            <p>Some think the difference between us and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are unjuſtly called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more in Words or Terms than otherwiſe; and I hope it is ſo: however if I differ from them in any thing, I cannot help it; I have here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted what I in my Heart do believe, and I ſhall leave it to the Cenſure of all my Brethren, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with my earneſt Prayers that Love, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Humility, and Charity may be more preſt after, which certainly is much wanting among us; and remain thine to ſerve thee in the Goſpel, according to that ſmall meaſure of Light and Ability received,</p>

            <p>That he might effectually do the firſt, he in the three firſt Chapters diſcovers the diſmal ſtate of all, both Jews and Gentiles, as conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or the condition of every Soul by Nature, and the weakneſs and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Law by reaſon of Man's Pravity to obtain Juſtification and eternal Life thereby;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> inſomuch that the Jews were in no better ſtate than the Gentiles, <hi>all being gone out of the way,</hi>

of God in Jeſus Chriſt, that tho the Law pronounces nothing but Wrath and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to every Soul of Man, and alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of Sin, or the Law in our Members, doth diſtreſs and ſorely afflict Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet he ſhews us that through Jeſus Chriſt we have a bleſſed Victory over the Law of Sin and Death, ſo that Sin cannot expoſe a true Believer to eternal Wrath, and that the Law of God (which holds all Unbelievers down under Guilt) can no more oblige Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to eternal Condemnation, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt in our Nature hath anſwered all the Demands, and born the Penalty thereof. And from hence he brings in the Words of our Text, as the profitable Uſe or Application of that Doctrine he had ſo well proved.</p>

            <p>[<hi>Now</hi>] This [<hi>Now</hi>] refers (as ſome think) to what precedes, others take it as an Adverb of Time, <hi>i.e.</hi> in time paſt it was otherwiſe; once they who are now in Chriſt Jeſus were in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> dead and condemned <hi>Adam</hi>; and were under the Law,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note>

and delivered from Condemnation, (as were all thoſe alſo under the Law, when they were in Chriſt) <hi>which walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Theſe are the happy Perſons, and this is their Character that are in Chriſt Jeſus. Let me note here three things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is an account of their ſpecial Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>They are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is implied their Juſtification; <hi>There is now no Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is comprehended alſo their Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negatively,</hi> They walk not after the Fleſh, they are not unſanctified or unholy Perſons, they lead not ungodly Lives; they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power and Dominion of Sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away whither ever carnal Affections would lead them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affirmatively, But after the Spirit</hi>; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Holy Spirit, they follow the Dictates of the Spirit; tho there is Fleſh in them, much Corruption in them, yet they walk not after the Fleſh, they reſiſt Sin, mortify Sin, or have crucified Sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> with the Affections and Luſts; they walk in a holy courſe of Life, and not as they did in times paſt: they live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of the new Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> here by the way, that negative Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not enough; we muſt not only forſake Sin, but follow after Holineſs, and bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs; not only ceaſe from doing evil, but learn to do well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45979:6"/>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> Wherefore? look back to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapters, particularly to <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.25. <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> tho I have a Body of Sin in me that makes me cry out, and tho it be thus alſo with all Believers, yet Chriſt hath delivered me and them from the Guilt, the Power and Slavery thereof; <hi>There is now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as this <hi>therefore</hi> may look backward to what precedes, ſo it may look forward to what ſucceeds, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. But firſt take notice of the <hi>2d</hi> verſe, <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath delivered me from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>

            <p>By <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Root of all Grace in the Perſon of Chriſt, which is made over to Believers by the Spirit in their myſtical Union; in which Senſe Chriſt is not only made to us <hi>Wiſdom and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.16.</note> but the Grace and Spirit in him is ours, as he is our Root or Head. 'Tis worthy to be noted that the Apoſtle brings in

what he ſpeaks in <hi>ver.</hi> 2, and 3. to confirm what he ſpeaks in <hi>ver.</hi> 1.

            <p>But further to prove and demonſtrate that this is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Evident it is, that all are born in Sin, all come into the World with the ſtain and guilt of Original Sin upon them;<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> 
               <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Moreover, how doth <hi>Paul</hi> aggravate this Sin, and bewail himſelf for it? this is beloved, the Fountain and Root of all Sin; our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proceedeth from Original Sin, the firſt tranſgreſſion:<note place="margin">Job 25.4.</note> 
               <hi>Can Man be clean that is born of a Woman?</hi> Adam <hi>begat a Son in his own likeneſs,</hi> i.e. a ſinful Creature like guilty, and unclean as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; not in God's likeneſs, having his Image, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling him, no, but contrariwiſe, was more like unto Satan, and reſembling him than God.</p>
            <p>There are three things in this Sin, as it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a worthy Writer.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45979:8"/>1. <hi>A particular Act</hi> which he did,<note place="margin">Caryl <hi>on</hi> ob, <hi>chap.</hi> 25. <hi>p.</hi> 706.</note> namely the breaking the Law of the firſt Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The legal Guilt</hi> that flowed from that Act both upon his own Perſon, and upon all his Poſterity by Imputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>Natural pravity</hi> and corruption of our whole Nature in Soul and Body; the whole Man being defiled.
And from hence comes Wrath and Condemnation upon all Men.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now, Brethren, let me here add one thing to your conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> tho <hi>Adam</hi> fell by this Sin in his own Perſon under Condemnation (as well as we in him) yet afterwards when he believed and received by Faith the free promiſe of God, <hi>in the Seed of the Woman,</hi> he came into a Juſtified State: <hi>Adam</hi> no doubt was an Elect Perſon, the promiſe of Chriſt being directly made to him (<hi>who was alſo a Figure of him that was to come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note>) But now it would follow that if the Elect were never under the Sentence of Wrath and Condemnation, then <hi>Adam</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what I have ſaid, was not; and if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was not in his own Perſon under it for his firſt Sin, then none of his Seed or Poſterity were. But how abſurd and contrary ſuch a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to Truth, I leave to all Mens Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">All Men naturally under the Guilt of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sins.</note>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> As all Men are under Sin and Guilt by Original Tranſgreſſion, ſo they are alſo by their own actual Sins: <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> yea, eternal Death; <hi>for there is no difference, for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally there is no difference in reſpect of Sin and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45979:8"/>
Guilt, nor actually neither between Jews and Gentiles, the Elect and Reprobates, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their State before Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> This alſo further appears,<note place="margin">All Men by nature Children of Wrath.</note> becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect before they are in Chriſt <hi>are by Nature the Children of Wrath as well as others.</hi> Our ſinful Nature is the proper object of God's Wrath,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> every one having a natural averſneſs to God in them, yea an antipathy to him, and enmity in their Carnal Minds againſt him:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7. Pſal. 7.11.</note> and hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſaid, that <hi>God hates and is angry with all the Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 5.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All Men before Grace and Union with Jeſus Chriſt are in a State of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they are all under the Covenant of Works; and if all Unbelievers are under the Covenant of Works, then they are under Guilt and Wrath. <hi>Now we know that whatſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>that every mouth might be ſtopped, and all the World may become guilty before God</hi>; that is, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to God's juſt Judgment and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law to every one that believeth:</hi> Not to any other,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> not to any one that believeth not. If Believers only are in the new Covenant or Covenant of Grace, then all that are in a ſtate of Unbelief are in the Covenant of Works, and ſo under the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law: For all muſt be in one or the other Covenant, and in the firſt or ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, the Sentence of the Law lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Elect before they are in Chriſt; tho Chriſt hath received their Diſcharge for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45979:9"/>
them, yet in their own Perſons they are not acquitted. Sirs, Chriſt came only to redeem them that were under the Law, and the Curſe thereof: And now if the Elect were not under the Law, and the Curſe, who were they that he came to redeem? it appears they were not the Elect (by this ſtrange Notion) nor indeed if it be, as ſome hint, the Elect had no need of Redemption; for if not under Guilt, Wrath, and Condemnation, what Redemption did they need?<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>But when the fulneſs of time came, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>made under the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note> 
               <hi>to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Elect were once under the Curſe of the Law.</note> 
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Elect as well as others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Union, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are under the Curſe of the Law, and Condemnation, appears, becauſe Chriſt bore the Curſe of the Law, and was condemned for them, or in their ſtead; if they were not under the Curſe of the Law, Why did God lay Jeſus Chriſt our Surety un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe thereof?<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law; being made a Curſe for us.</hi> How redeemed from that which we were never under! Now there is a twofold Curſe of the Law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Original Curſe in <hi>Adam</hi>; this paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him (as I have proved) and upon all Men in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An actual Curſe, or a Curſe for all actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sin which remains upon all whilſt they abide under the Law:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>for as many as are for the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe; for it is written, Curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is every one that continueth not in all things that are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45979:9"/>
written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Thus by our actual Sins we were brought alſo under this Curſe, is evident.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not</hi> Paul <hi>ſay, Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It appears ſuch whom he hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were once under it; and if they were delivered before they believed, 'tis neceſſary that ſuch who aſſert that, ſhould aſſign the time when they were delivered. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Saints when they were delivered from Sin, Guilt, and the Curſe;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>being then made free from Sin:</hi> Then, when? why, when they believed, and received Chriſt and his holy Doctrine, and obeyed it from the Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is evident that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks it of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, even of ſuch as had received the Spirit of Adoption; and ſo could call God Father.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Price may be paid for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Captives, and yet they may not preſently be delivered, but may remain in Bondage, in Slavery, and lie in Chains: A Surety may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Law for a Criminal, or for a Debtor, yea pay the utmoſt Farthing; but he may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding lie under the Sentence of Death, or remain in Priſon for a time, and not have his perſonal Diſcharge.</p>
            <p>The Sacrifice may be offered up, and an Atonement may be made, but the Blood may not be ſprinkled; the ſlaying the Sacrifice is one thing, and the ſprinkling the Blood is another.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.19, 20, 21.</note> So the Atonement made for us by Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Price and meritorious Cauſe of our Redemption and Juſtification, is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45979:10"/>
one thing, and our receiving the Atonement or the application of his Blood to our perſonal and actual diſcharge from Sin, Guilt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, is another thing: <hi>For if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> 
               <hi>much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his Life.</hi> We grant God was not only made reconcilable by the death of his Son, but by his Death God was fully reconciled; that is he received a full Satisfaction by that one Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> Faith adds nothing to the Merits of Chriſt's Blood, or meritorious Sacrifice, but it is by his Life, by his Interceſſion, that it is made effectual or efficacious unto us, who pleads with God for the Spirit, which he purchaſed alſo for his Elect, that ſo the ſaving Benefits and Bleſſings might be applied to them: And therefore the Apoſtle adds in the next verſe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
               <hi>And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the Atonement.</hi> God hath, as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, through Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion given us a free and perſonal Diſcharge purchaſed for us; he hath given us Faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Atonement. The particle <hi>Now</hi> hath its <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> denoting the Privilege of all ſuch as believe; and hence it is that <hi>we glory in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation:</hi> we are now actually acquitted and for ever delivered from Condemnation. Sirs, ſince the ſtrict time of the laying down the Price of our Redemption was not the time when many of the Elect were actually acquitted and juſtified, why ſhould it be aſſerted to be the time when any of them were? For thoſe Believers that lived and died from <hi>Adam</hi> till
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45979:10"/>
Chriſt came, were juſtified, and went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Sacrifice was offered, and the Atonement actually made: the Father truſted the Son according to that holy Compact that was between them, Chriſt covenanting and engaging that he would die for them. And now as <hi>Adam</hi> received the Atonement when he believed, and not till then; ſo we when we are in Chriſt, believe, do receive the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, and not before: for at the ſame time, and upon the ſame terms, they under the Law received it, we under the Goſpel-Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation do receive it: by Time I mean when they had, and we have actual Union with Chriſt, and believe, or do receive the Spirit, the Bonds of this Union.</p>
            <p>Brethren, tho all in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> were fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally and repreſentatively condemned in him, his Sin being imputed ſo to all his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; yet none are actually condemned until they actually exiſt and partake of his corrupt Nature: So in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> all the Elect were fundamentally and repreſentatively juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, his Righteouſneſs being imputed ſo to all his Spiritual Seed, or Off-ſpring; yet none of them are actually and perſonally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied until they are united to him,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> and <hi>partake</hi> of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> All Men, the Elect as well as others,<note place="margin">Sinners that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, condemned already.</note> are under Condemnation before Grrce, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Union with Chriſt, becauſe it is poſitively ſaid, that <hi>he that believeth not, is condemned; and the Wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi> The Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him, let him be who he will,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.18. and 36.</note> even eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Soul that believes not ſavingly in Jeſus Chriſt; and it remains upon him becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not, or becauſe he continues in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in condemned <hi>Adam,</hi> and is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: Nay, and his Unbelief binds all his Sins, and the Sentence upon him; not believing is not the firſt Diſeaſe, but it is the refuſing the Remedy. Thoſe ſtung with <hi>fiery Serpents</hi> were mortally wounded, that was their Diſeaſe; and if any would not, did not look up to the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that was the reaſon they died, in reſpect of their refuſing the Remedy; but their being ſtung was that which kill'd them. So 'tis Sin that is the breach of the Law of God, which is the Diſeaſe, and the Cauſe why Sinners periſh; all are condemned already, and their refuſing of Chriſt offered in the Goſpel for their Cure, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates their Sin and Condemnation: and it leaves ſuch that finally perſiſt in Unbelief, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable for ever.</p>

            <p>Brethren, Where is it ſaid in the Scripture that any Perſon was juſtified that believed not, or whilſt an Unbeliever, or before he believed? And is it not good, nay beſt, to keep to the form of ſound Words? For tho it is ſaid that <hi>God juſtifies the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.5.</note> yet they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly when juſtified: true, that excludes all previous Qualifications to Faith; but not that God juſtifies an Unbeliever that is in his Sins in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Is it not Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs that which juſtifies us, or is the matter of our Juſtification? Will ye make Faith to be a Cauſe, or the condition of our Juſtification before God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, by no means;<note place="margin">Faith no procuring cauſe or condition of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> tho I know ſome Learned Men, and ſound in the Faith, ſeem to hint as if Faith was a condition of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how that which God himſelf gives to us by his free and abſolute Promiſes, can be a condition of the Covenant, or of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſee not: that which is part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on God's part, can't be the Condition of it on our part. Alſo they call Faith the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe of Juſtification, which we muſt leave them to explain (they mean, I think, but as the Hand that applies a Plaiſter is a cauſe of the Cure.) We muſt ſay with a late learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Faith is no qualifying Condition, nor any procuring Cauſe of our Juſtification; tho with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith God declares no Man a juſtified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45979:12"/>2. Faith doth not cauſe or render the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt any ways the more ſatisfactory unto God; for God was as much ſatisfied in Chriſt for his Elect before Faith as after, tho the Satisfaction, Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are not applied ſo as the Man is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a juſtified Perſon until he is united to Chriſt by the Spirit, and ſo is help'd to believe on him; Faith being the Hand that receives, or that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Brethren, The Holy Spirit in our Union with Chriſt, puts upon us the Robe of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which was not upon us before we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Spiritual Union; it is offered <hi>unto all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.22.</note> but it is <hi>upon all them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All our Orthodox Divines agree with us, that Faith, neither as a Habit, or Grace, or as an Act, much leſs in reſpect of the Fruits thereof, juſtifies us: when therefore 'tis ſaid we are juſtified by Faith, it intends not any Moral or Phyſical Cauſality in Faith as a Qualification, but only by virtue of the Object it apprehends. Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> that <hi>Holy Martyr</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Fox, <hi>p.</hi> 1659.</note> 
               <hi>Not the Action it ſelf of believing, as it is a quality in Man, doth ſo deſerve, but becauſe it taketh that Dignity and Virtue from the Object Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We do not mean,<note place="margin">The later <hi>Helvetian</hi> Confeſſion.</note> that Faith by it ſelf, and of it ſelf doth juſtify us, which is only as an Inſtrument whereby we apprehend Chriſt who is our Juſtice.<note place="margin">Zanchy <hi>on</hi> Phil. 3.</note> Faith was accounted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs, not the action by which, but that which he did believe; or Faith not in reſpect of it ſelf apprehending, but in reſpect of the Object apprehended.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45979:12"/>
Faith juſtifies a Sinner in the ſight of God, not becauſe of thoſe other Graces that do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompany it, or of good Works,<note place="margin">Aſſemblies large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm.</note> which are the Fruits thereof, nor as if the Grace of Faith, or any act thereof were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for Juſtification; but only as an Inſtrument by which he receiveth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs.</q>
For any to ſay otherwiſe, is to render Faith to be part of our Reconciliation or Satisfaction to God, which is to leſſen the Merits of Chriſt, and take the Crown from his Head, and make Juſtification not to be by Grace alone, or by Chriſt alone. Faith we know is the Creatures act, tho given of God, or a Grace beſtowed upon us, by which we are helped ſo to do; yet <hi>with the Heart Man bel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eveth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of ſome Men about Faith juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Sinner, tends to bring in a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, <hi>i.e.</hi> a mild Law of Faith, and ſincere Obedience in the ſtead of the ſevere Law of perfect Obedience, and plainly renders the Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt defective or inſufficient; as if Faith was part of our juſtifying Righteouſneſs, or as if we were not fully reconciled to God by the death of his Son, but that he was only reconcileable; and that it is Faith and ſincere Obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which compleats that Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>Brethren, Faith, I ſay again, is ſaid to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us only in reſpect of the Object Jeſus Chriſt, whom it apprehended; and it is no part of the matter which doth juſtify us (the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt being alone the material cauſe of our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45979:13"/>
Juſtification) nor doth Faith add any thing to Chriſt's Satisfaction, or to his Righteouſneſs which alone is imputed to us to our Juſtification before God. Tho we ſay that Righteouſneſs is not imputed to the actual and perſonal Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of any Man till he has actual Union with Chriſt; yet I deny that Faith in order of Nature is before Union (or at leaſt before the reception of the Spirit in order to Union) tho not as to time; for Chriſt takes hold of us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can take hold of him; alſo Faith is a Fruit of the Spirit; and ſure the Seed muſt be ſown before there can be Fruit. We are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in Regeneration, but not in the act of Faith. But when a poor Sinner receives the Spirit, then it is that he in his own Perſon is declared and pronounced righteous; he being in Chriſt is pardoned, and actually acquitted and diſcharged from that Legal Guilt, or from that Obligation he lay under to Condemnation in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the Sentence being then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and he looſed from thoſe Fetters and Chains by which he was before bound; and this therefore is more no doubt than ſimply juſtified in his own Conſcience.</p>
            <p>For tho Chriſt as our Surety when he roſe from the dead, received a full diſcharge for us; yet until we are united by the Spirit unto him, by which Faith is wrought in our Souls, and our Eyes are inlightned, we have not this great Bleſſing made over to us. Mind that Paſſage of the Apoſtle again,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>By whom now we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Atonement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45979:13"/>Now the Caſe is altered, <hi>now</hi> we are in Chriſt Jeſus. Brethren, we have not the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion until we have the Perſon; now the Law's Sentence and Condemnation can no more reach us; <hi>now</hi> that Husband is dead, that cruel Husband, and we are married unto another; <hi>now</hi> we are actually acquitted; or not till <hi>now</hi> perſonally juſtified.</p>
            <p>Some add juſtified <hi>Foro Dei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Before God or in his ſight all things were from Eternity.</note> or in God's ſight: but ſo expreſſing it, I fear hath clouded the matter, becauſe known to God, before him, or in his ſight were all his Works from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Juſtified before God may be taken two ways. (1.) In diſtinction from that before Men, or in a Man's own Conſcience: if they mean that, I grant it. (2.) In reſpect had to that ſight he hath of things; <hi>who calls</hi> things, and ſeeth things that are not, <hi>as if they were.</hi> As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is called <hi>the Father of many Nations,</hi> when he was not then the Father of one <hi>Iſaac.</hi> God ſaw us in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> condemned, and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> juſtified, at one and the ſame time, even from Eternity: but will it follow from thence that we were both actually condemned and actually juſtified from Eternity? yet as our <hi>Annotators</hi> note concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was the Father of many Nations in God's ſight, or before him; who, as <hi>Paul</hi> adds, <hi>quickneth the dead, and that calleth things that are not as if they were.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.17.</note> Will any ſay, as to matter of Fact, that thing is, when God's Word ſays it is not? now they affirm this, becauſe it was ſo to God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; who beholds things long before they are, or do exiſt, or have a being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45979:14"/>So then, my Brethren, the Controverſy (if there be any) lies not in the caſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reſpect had to what a ſight God hath of it, or how matters are before his eyes, before whom or in whoſe ſight all things were done from Eternity, which were not actually done until things, and perſons, in time did, or do actually exiſt.<note place="margin">An Elect Sinner not pronounced juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in Chriſt.</note> But it lies in this, <hi>viz.</hi> when, or at what time a Sinner is pronounced a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, being actually pardoned, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and diſcharged from Condemnation, or perſonally juſtified as to matter of Fact.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Brethren, that Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified is call'd <hi>a Gift.</hi> Do we receive the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, before we received Chriſt himſelf? Moreover, certainly no Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt till he receives the Spirit of Chriſt. Now the Apoſtle declares expreſly, that when we receive Grace (at leaſtwiſe in the Seed) then alſo we receive the Gift of Righteouſneſs; <hi>They that receive abundance of Grace, and the Gift of Righteouſneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.17.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">When we receive Chriſt we receive his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not till then.</note>From the whole it is evident, that until we do receive Chriſt, and have Union with him, we receive not his Righteouſneſs, or are not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally juſtified, but are under the Condemnation of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes a relative Change.</note> Moreover, this further will appear, becauſe Juſtification of our Perſons makes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Change (tho not a real Change) a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Change is a Change of the State of the Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that was dead, dead in Law, is brought into a State of Life; there is, my Brethren,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45979:14"/>
the Life of Juſtification, and the Life of Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; I mean the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Life of Juſtification: <hi>This thy Brother was dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 15.32</note> 
               <hi>and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again; and was loſt, and is found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that was a child of Wrath is now become a Child of God: Such who were not God's People, are now his People. He that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, is now actually juſtified. But if we were delivered from Condemnation before we were in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo perſonally juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this Act of Juſtification makes no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative change; for then it will follow that the Elect were never dead in Law, but alive, and in a good State when Unbelievers, and groſs Sinners, Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Thieves, and what not;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>for ſuch were ſome of you:</hi> And not the Children of Wrath before, but the Children of God; and not condemned, but juſtified; not under the Law, but under Grace.</p>
            <p>Or elſe this Abſurdity will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Man may be dead and alive, a Child of Wrath and yet a Child of God; be actually condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet be actually juſtified, at one and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Obj.<hi>The Elect we ſay are not juſtified in their own Conſciences, or have not the evidence of it until they believe. They were acquitted and juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but they did not know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This will not help, nor alter the caſe in the leaſt; the purport of this is, <hi>i.e.</hi> my ſtate was good, but I did not know it; I was alive, a Child of God and Juſtified, but did not know it, or had not the feeling or ſenſible comfort and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45979:15"/>
of it in my own Soul; I had a perſonal Right and Title to the eternal Inheritance, but the Deeds and Evidence were not in my own ſight.</p>
            <p>Brethren, it is one thing to have a thing in my own actual Poſſeſſion, and another thing to know I have it. I am not a ſpeaking of what a ſight God might have of Men, or how he ſees, or how things are before him; before whom, or in whoſe ſight the World was from eternity; but of things that actually be, or do actually exiſt, and take hold of Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Purpoſe of God without the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, brings nothing actually to be or to exiſt: tho his Decree doth render the thing certain to be in time. I deny not that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and repreſentative Juſtification of the Elect in Chriſt their Head, or as a common Perſon, which is before Faith, which lies in Chriſt making full Satisfaction for all their Sins, and meriting Faith for them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">There was a federal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Elect with Chriſt.</note> I alſo grant a federal Union of the Elect with Chriſt, as our Surety and bleſſed Sponſor, from Eternity, who alſo then received a grant of a diſcharge for them from Condemnation, upon his holy Compact and Covenant with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on the account of what he was to do and ſuffer, which made Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſure for them all, ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.

                  </note> his Death was but the Satisfaction and Payment; but this is the firſt Act of abſolution, yea and it is the Original Act which is upon record between God and Chriſt; and our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Atonement (when we are juſtified by Faith in Chriſt) is but a copy fetch'd from this Roll and Court-Sentence then pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this, I ſay, tho Chriſt was thus juſtified, and we virtually in him, when he aroſe from the Dead, and he received for us an actual diſcharge as our Surety, yet the Elect do not receive an actual diſcharge, or are not in their own Perſons acquitted or pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced juſtified and righteous Perſons, until they have actual Union with Chriſt: and ſuch as call this a contradiction, do but betray their own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.

               <q>Leſt there be a miſtake, let me add this, that it is neceſſary that we be juſtified in our own Perſons, by Faith (notwithſtanding this former Act thus legally paſſed) whereby we lay hold upon what God did thus before for us in Chriſt, to the end that God upon our believing, may, according to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45979:16"/>
his own Rules, juſtify his juſtifying of us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the World; which until we do believe he could not do: for according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Rules of his Word (which he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to proceed by at the latter day) there is a Curſe and Sentence of Condemnation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt us, under which we ſtand till he ſhall take it off by giving us Faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he hath in the ſame word made the promiſe of juſtifying us in our own Perſons as before he had done in Chriſt.

Now ſure the Divine Spirit in Convictions, would never hold forth or repreſent this to be the ſtate of the Soul before it is in Jeſus Chriſt, if it was not really ſo; becauſe he is a faithful and true Witneſs, and becauſe he is God, and cannot lie.

               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 1. Shall be a Uſe of Caution to ſuch, to take heed how they ſeek to render the ſtate of the Elect to be good before Grace and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the holy Word of God declares their State to be very bad;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.22.</note> and as to the preſent State of their Perſons whilſt Unbelievers, <hi>there is no difference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45979:17"/>2. Becauſe ſuch a Notion cannot tend to the Glory of God, nor the profit of any Perſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after they do believe. I challenge any to ſhew what Glory it can bring to God, or benefit it can be to any Sinner, to hear he is juſtified or diſcharged from Wrath and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation before he is in Chriſt; or that it can be of profit to him when he doth believe, to be told that his State was good before he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt Jeſus, tho he knew it not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But contrariwiſe it may tend to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Unbelievers to conclude that their State is good, <hi>tho Swearers, Drunkards, and what not,</hi> and ſo harden them in their Sins, and to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or caſt contempt upon what ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters daily declare to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It alſo clearly tends to leſſen or extenuate the rich Grace of God, in giving his Spirit to regenerate the Soul, and to work Faith in us, if the relative and real change were not at one and the ſame time, which the Scripture doth affirm it is; <hi>But you are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> &amp;c. Alſo then Grace received, could not be any ſign of our being paſſed from a ſtate of Death unto a ſtate of Life, which the Apoſtle aſſerts it is, <hi>By this we know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>he that loveth not his Brother abideth in Death.</hi> The Apoſtle no doubt intends a ſtate of Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> It puts alſo a juſt rebuke upon ſuch as cauſe trouble or diviſions amongſt Chriſtians on ſuch a Notion. Brethren, were it a Truth that the Elect were actually delivered from Condemnation, and were perſonally juſtified
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45979:18"/>
before they are in Jeſus Chriſt, yet certainly it cannot be judged to be an Eſſential of Salvation nor of Church-communion: Are all ſuch Perſons not to be communicated with that can't believe the Elect are acquitted or delivered from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, or perſonally juſtified before they are in Chriſt Jeſus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This I hope may tend to clear up the matter, and ſhew the preſent difference is but little, and riſes rather from miſtaking of words than otherwiſe: for according to what I have ſaid and proved it appeareth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God ſees things, even all his works from everlaſting; <hi>and calls things that are not as if they were.</hi> Things before God or in his ſight, is one thing; and things as to us, or as actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, is another thing. That God ſees the Elect juſtified and glorified too from Eternity, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who are not actually and perſonally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor indeed can be ſaid ſo to be, until they perſonally exiſt and are in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to be federally, fundamentally and repreſentatively juſtified in Chriſt is one thing, and to be actually and perſonally juſtified is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; or Chriſt's receiving our Diſcharge and Juſtification (as our Head and Surety) for us, is one thing; and the application thereof, or his giving of it out unto us, pronouncing us juſt and righteous before God, in our own Conſciences, and before all the World, is another thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We infer from hence that God mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his rich Grace exceedingly to us who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or that the work of Grace is a glorious work upon the Soul, and that Union with Chriſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45979:18"/>
is to be eſteemed as one of the richeſt manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his electing Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all Men out of Chriſt may ſee cauſe from hence to tremble, conſidering what a woful State they are in, and ſo ſtrive to fly to Chriſt with ſpeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That ſuch who are in Chriſt have cauſe to admire God's Free Grace, and may from hence alſo take in a moſt precious and rich Cordial of the higheſt comfort and conſolation; for therefore, <hi>Now there is no Condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But no more at this time.</p>

'Tis not, according to Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> the Object of Faith, not Jeſus Chriſt that Faith apprehends, and we alone truſt in, but it is Faith that juſtifieth us comprehenſively taken; that is, Faith, Love, Charity, good Works, and ſincere Obedience that is imputed to us, to our Juſtification in the ſight of God: And that ſo far as you act in Faith, Holineſs, and in ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo far you are juſtified.

Theſe are his Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now if we are not perfectly juſtified, it follows then we are not perfectly delivered from Condemnation, nor acquitted from the Guilt of all Sin,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.36. Cant. 4.7.</note> and ſo not in a ſtate of Life, nor made <hi>free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> by the Son of God; and then alſo <hi>Chriſt's Dove is not without ſpot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5.2.</note> nor undefiled in reſpect to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: And then alſo it follows (as the Papiſts ſay) there is no aſſurance can be had or attained in this Life, or until Death, nor can we be ſaid to be compleat in Chriſt; beſides, it confounds Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Sanctification, nay it makes them but one and the ſame thing:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.21.</note> Nay more, that by a Law Righteouſneſs is to be obtained, and ſo Chriſt is dead in vain.</p>
            <p>Now I profeſs, I can ſee but little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Doctrine and that of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s and other Papiſts. If famous <hi>Luther</hi> and other worthy Reformers, had wrought no better Reformation than this, the Church of God would have received but little benefit from them, nor would the Papiſts have been ſo angry with them; but the Notion of Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> and his Abettors certainly tends to raze and root out that antient Doctrine which the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles preached, and thoſe worthy Men laboured to reſtore about Juſtification. Did <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that their good Works and inherent Holineſs, which they made the matter of their Juſtification before God, were performed by the Grace of God, and the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit?

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:45979:20"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet he would feign inſinuate that this Doctrine of his is in effect the ſame with that of the old received Doctrine of our Divines <note n="*" place="margin">But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all may ſee it is in effect the ſame with the Papiſts.</note>: who teach, ſaith he,
<q>That the <hi>ſola fides ſolum,</hi> yet not <hi>fides ſola,</hi> i.e. <hi>ſolitaria juſtificat</hi>; tho Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet not that Faith which is alone does juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy.</q>
What's the Purport of this? Why becauſe the Faith of God's Elect, by which alone we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or receive the Object, Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we are juſtified, is attended with good Fruits, as Sanctification and Holineſs, by which it is known from a falſe and dead Faith; therefore Faith, good Works, and Holineſs is (the matter, or) that which doth juſtify us before God: or becauſe Faith in reſpect of its own excellent Nature doth purify and ſanctify us; therefore God hath inſtituted and ordained Faith and inherent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to juſtify us; and becauſe inherent Holineſs and Sanctification tends to make us meet for Heaven, therefore it is our only Title for Heaven. Is it not ſaid that God imputes Righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, and juſtifies him that works not? How then do Works concur with, or are included, or joined with that Righteouſneſs that is our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God?</p>

               <q>It is objected that true Faith is never alone; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaith he, thus Faith is never alone in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſtified, nor in Godly Converſation, but is joined with all other Vertues, yet in the act and office of Juſtification it is alone; the Eye in the Body is not alone, being joined with all other Parts, Hand, Foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nevertheleſs the Eye in ſeeing is alone, for no part of the Body ſeeth but the Eye.</q>— He ſhews that Faith alone is the Eye which ſees the Object Jeſus Chriſt, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends him and his Righteouſneſs, whoſe Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only is the material cauſe of our Juſtification

before God. See the Aſſembly's Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <q>All whom God effectually calleth, he freely juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, not by infuſing Righteouſneſs into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting and accepting their Perſons as righteous, not for any thing wrought in them or done by them, but for Chriſt's ſake alone; not by imputing Faith it ſelf, the act of believing, nor any other Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obedience as their Righteouſneſs, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Obedience and Satisfaction of Chriſt unto them; they receiving and reſting on him, and his Righteouſneſs by Faith: which Faith they have not of themſelves, it is the Gift of God.</q>

            <p>Reader, The Righteouſneſs this Man contends for, by which we are juſtified, is not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one, but the Righteouſneſs of many, <hi>i.e.</hi> every Man's own Faith and ſincere Obedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18, 19.</p>

If ſo, who pays the Debt for us? the Penalty was but one part of our Debt. Then alſo it ſeems, the Law of perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs doth not reſult from the Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, but only from the Sovereignty of his Will, not from the rectitude of his Nature.

               <q>The Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle declares, that as <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual Sin is imputed unto us to Condemnation, ſo is the Obedience of Chriſt imputed unto us to the Juſtification of Life; but <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin is not ſo imputed unto any Perſon, as that he ſhould then and thereby be the cauſe of Sin and Condemnation unto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons in the World, but only that he himſelf ſhould become guilty before God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo is it on the other ſide: and as we are made guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual Sin, which is not inherent in us, but only imputed unto us; ſo are we made righteous by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is not inherent in us, but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us; and with it, not for himſelf but for us.</q>

<q>In this Imputation the thing is firſt imputed unto us, and not any of the Effects of it; but they are ours by virtue of that Imputation. To ſay that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that is his Obedience and Sufferings, are imputed to us only in their Effects, is to ſay
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45979:22"/>
that we have the benefit of them and no more, but Imputation it ſelf is denied; ſo ſay (ſaith he) the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Again he ſaith,
<q>The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed unto us, as unto its Effects, hath this ſound Senſe in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Effects of it are made ours, by reaſon of that Imputation; it is ſo imputed, ſo reckoned unto us of God, as that he readily communicates all the Effects of it unto us; but to ſay the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not imputed unto us, but the Effects only, is really to overthrow all Imputation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> ſays,
<q>'Tis the Righteouſneſs of God by which we are juſtified,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>He will not have it be the Righteouſneſs of him that was God, or take it in that Senſe; but that Righteouſneſs that God hath ordained and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> our Faith and ſincere Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not only ſay it was the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of him that was God as well as Man, but alſo that Righteouſneſs which God hath found out, and approves of, as agreeing with his Holy Nature and infinite Juſtice, and Purity of his Law, <hi>That he might be juſt:</hi> not the eſſential Righteouſneſs of God, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as Mediator, <hi>Who of God is made to us Wiſdom and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> Where pray hath God made our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs a Righteouſneſs to juſtify us at his Bar?

Ay, but we muſt take the Scripture in the plain literal Senſe about Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; this he much harps at, tho his Notion by thus doing brings in Juſtification by Works, which the Apoſtle ſhews is inconſiſtent, and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.

               </note> ſpeaking of Chriſt's fulfilling the Law for us; he ſaith,</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">That it was not meerly Obedience, but a meriting Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; there was an intrinſick Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in Chriſt's Obedience, anſwering to our Salvation: Hence, tho we have Juſtification of meer Grace, yet in reſpect of Chriſt, it was Juſtice and Debt; ſo that in Chriſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works was fulfilled, tho in us the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace: This Work Chriſt finiſhed and compleated;</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that he did it wholly and univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there was not one Tittle of the Law which he did not fulfil.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He finiſhed it univerſally for Parts, and not only ſo, but fully for Degrees: He did not only love God, but loved him as much as the Law requires; all that he did, was ſo fully done, that there wanted not the leaſt Degree of Grace in any Duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe he had not only an Objective Perfection in Parts and Degrees, but alſo a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective; all within was throughly and perfectly holy: So that as we are originally and actually polluted, he was originally and actually holy; ſo that the Law had no fault to find with him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He finiſhed it in reſpect of Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Law requiring continuance, tho there were Perfection of Parts and Degrees, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Perfection alſo: Yet <hi>curſed is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not therein.</hi> Again he ſaith, For to obey the Law of God, and to ſuffer all the Wrath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45979:24"/>
that was due to our Sins, was a bitter Cup to drink.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus Chriſt fulfilled the Law for us as our Surety, and in him it was fulfilled in us, there being a Legal or Law-Union between him and us.</p>
            <p>Now ſince this perfect, this compleat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Obedience to the Law, was our Duty, and that Debt we owed to God, Dare you deny Chriſt as our Surety, paid it? Certainly had he not fulfilled the Preceptory part of the Law (as well as born the Penal part) for us, we could not be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified from the Charge and Curſe thereof: But why muſt we (becauſe we ſay Surety hath done this) be juſtified by the Law or Covenant of Works? Are we Saviours or Mediators, becauſe we have his Righteouſneſs imputed to us of meer Grace? Is the Debtor the Surety, becauſe the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Payment is accepted for him? The old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Righteouſneſs was an inherent Righteouſneſs, a Righteouſneſs in a Man's ſelf, <hi>i. e. Adam</hi>'s own Righteouſneſs, not a Righteouſneſs imputed, but inherent: the Righteouſneſs of your new Law, is a Legal or Law-Righteouſneſs, and looks more like an old Covenant-Righteouſneſs, becauſe 'tis inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or infuſed into you, not put upon you, or imputed to you, as being wrought out for you without you. And, Sir, is there no favour ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, becauſe our Surety has paid this Debt? Was it not great Love, great Grace and Favour for God to accept of a Surety? nay, to ſubſtitute his own Son in our ſtead to ſatisfy all the Demands of the Law and Juſtice? True, we are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply dealt with in a way of Mercy, (I mean par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned only) but in a way of Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs alſo: Juſtification has more than Pardon in it (as your Notion allows;) we found not the Surety, but God found him; therefore all is of God's free Grace, tho alſo all is by the Obedience
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45979:24"/>
of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his keeping Law for us, and dying in our ſtead. To plead for a Righteouſneſs by Obedience to any mild Law, is no other than to plead for a Legal Righteouſneſs in our ſelves to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify us; and that is as oppoſite to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, as the truſting in the Moral and Ceremonial Law, it being oppoſite to Grace: the Righteouſneſs therefore of the Law, by which no Fleſh can be juſtified, is a Righteouſneſs reſted in, or truſted to, that is inherent in us, whatſoever Thoughts a Perſon may have of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> as perfectly, or only ſincerely kept.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: Did not God <hi>ſend his Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> 
               <hi>that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c? that is, in our Nature, in our Head. Chriſt and Believers (as I ſaid before) are one in a Law-ſenſe; and evident it is, that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law is not fulfilled in us in Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that is imperfect, that is far from ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling it; and there is no other way it can be ſaid to be fulfilled in us, but by imputation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by Chriſt's coming to keep the Law in our Nature, God hath <hi>magnified the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> 
               <hi>and made it honourable</hi>; and hereby <hi>we do not make void the Law through Faith, but eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> in that the Son of God, in Man's Nature, yielded perfect Obedience thereto, and died for our breach of it, whoſe Obedience is ours by imputation to our Juſtification at his Bar.</p>
            <p>Pray obſerve that through Faith we attain a perfect Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> are intereſted in the moſt compleat Obedience of Chriſt to the Moral Law; but now if Chriſt only ſatisfied for our breach of the Law by his Death, and his perfect active Obedience has no hand in, or is not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Cauſe of our Juſtification before God, how do we by believing in him eſtabliſh the Law?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:45979:25"/>I ſay the Righteouſneſs of the Law (which is ſo called) which the Apoſtle decries as unable to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us, is a reſting in or truſting to our inperfect Conformity to it, or to any other Law tho never ſo ſincerely performed; for this ſort of Righteouſneſs is always oppoſed to the Righteouſneſs of Faith or of Grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> 
               <hi>If it be of Works</hi> (of any Works what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) <hi>it is not of Grace:</hi> all works of ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to any Law of God, are alike materially good. But God has not ordained any Law of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience to juſtify us, becauſe Grace excludeth all Works done by us in point of Juſtification in God's Sight. We can no more be juſtified by the Law of the Goſpel, <hi>i.e.</hi> the New Law, than by the Old.</p>

How then can Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> ſay, the Juſtification <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, and that which <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, is all one and the ſame thing?</p>
            <p>This Man contends for a mild Law; certainly the Moral Law remains a perpetual Rule of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience: let this Man ſhew us where and how he can prove that God in the Goſpel only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſincere imperfect Obedience to the Moral Law: the Law ſurely loſes no part of its ſanction by the Goſpel; that is as holy, juſt and good as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.48.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> We are ſtill to <hi>love the Lord our God with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Strength.</hi> Our Faith, Love, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be perfect; the Law or Commands of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel know no bounds or limits: tho the Law is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated as a Covenant of Works, yet not as a rule of perfect Obedience. See what Reverend Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. on</hi> Rom. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>i.e.</hi>
               <q>Either the Goſpel Law, or Law of Faith muſt require perfection in thoſe Duties, or ſome other Divine Law, or elſe God would become an indulger of Sin by Law; if it be by another Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Moral, that requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, and this ſincere only: then theſe Laws differ but in degree, not in <hi>Specie</hi> or Kind; becauſe both require the ſame Duties or Works: and ſo this Goſpel Law would be no diſtinct
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45979:26"/>
Law, but only the meaſure of ſincere Obedience, would receive a new Uſe of its giving right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we own it has, to wit, to be an index or mark of our Juſtification, tho we can't own that uſe of giving right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—a diſtinct Law they muſt hold, or quit their Cauſe, or this Foundation of it; for the Text ſets the Law of Faith down as an oppoſite Law to that of Works, and that they hold: then if it be a perfect Law requiring perfect Obedience, there is no poſſibility of Juſtification in this Life — but this is not all the difficulty, for it's the adding a load to a burden: Is this Goſpel to a Man that is not able to perform the leaſt part of the Moral Law, to tell him that God or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator requires perfect Obedience to it for the future, and another too? Or is this Goſpel, to ſay you ſhall periſh eternally, and have the Fire of Hell ſeven times heated, if you obey not the Goſpel! it's indeed a conditional Hell, but it is more dreadful than the Fire of Hell; and the condition is more impoſſible, becauſe we have leſs Power to ſhun this difficulty of two perfect Laws: Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> owns no other perfect Law but the Goſpel, ſince Man fell; but by ſhunning one difficulty he falls into as great. (1) Then the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law is abrogated, beſides the falſeneſs of the Doctrine it ſelf; for it is impoſſible that ſhould ceaſe to be our duty to love God with all our Hearts and Souls. What advantage brings in Chriſt's Death, to abrogate one perfecting Law, and eſtabliſh another? here is little Goſpel. A ſecond difficulty, <hi>i. e.</hi> we muſt either ſay Chriſt has purchaſed to us pardon for Sins againſt the Goſpel Law, or none at all but that one Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, if the Moral Law be abrogated; after the fall we never ſinned againſt any Law but the Goſpel, for we were under no other Law accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Thus Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is not much of our Obedience under the Goſpel, Obedience to the Moral Law? Nay, is not the Moral Law the Rule of all our Obedience to God in all poſitive Goſpel-precepts?</p>
            <p>Reader, This mild Law of theirs they ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſincere Obedience as the condition of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; now there is no ſincere Obedience without it be univerſal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how then may this fill a poor Chriſtian with terror, and ſlaviſh Fear? I do all I hope ſincerely, but I may not obey univerſally, ſome Precept through ignorance I may lie ſhort of; I can't tell when my Obedience is full: Alſo according to them I can be but partially juſtified in this Life, and therefore I am partially condemned: and thus the Creature hangs till Death, between Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell.</p>
            <p>Ah poor <hi>England,</hi> poor Church of God, where are thy brave old Heroes, that ſtood up to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Truths of Chriſt? What Apoſtacy is here from the Orthodox Faith? what decay of doctrinal and practical Chriſtianity? what dark Clouds ſpread over our Heavens? How are many fallen from the Faith? But I muſt leave Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> to an abler Pen, I deſign'd no more than to make a few Remarks to provoke ſome others to reply to the Argumentative part of his Book, which I ſee no great difficulty to anſwer. Now that the Lord would ſcatter this Cloud, and all other dangerous Errors, let it be all our Prayers both Day and Night. Yet I doubt not but the preſent oppoſition againſt this Fundamental Point of Faith will cauſe the Truth in the end to ſhine more clear and bright, which the Lord grant in his Infinite Mercy, to the praiſe of his own Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>
