            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Ornaments of Nature are ſo many and marvellous, that they not only ſubmit the mind of Man in a devote honour to that Being that preſerveth this variety in ſo ſweet a conſort; but force alſo our thoughts to purſue the inqueſt of the ſeveral ties and dependencies of this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proportion, that at laſt we may come to the knowledge of things in their cauſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. This <hi>Pythagoras</hi> moſt properly termed Philoſophy. And indeed Nature hath not been in this, neither in any other of her works, empty: but hath beſtowed on us largely all means fit for the accompliſhment of our wiſhes. Amongſt which Experience and Reaſon deſervedly challenge precedency: Experience, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Chance and Imitation, is pleaſed to impart her Obſervations to Reaſon; who not
<pb facs="tcp:46874:3"/>
being diſcourteous, doth aſſiſt her with her own Principles, and ſo muſtereth in the fields of Learning Noble Squadrons of Concluſions againſt their common enemy Ignorance.</p>
            <p>This is vigorouſly illuſtrated by the Relation of famous <hi>Galen;</hi> A Viper by chance being ſtifled in Wine, and a Leprous perſon drinking it, was cured. A Philoſopher hearing it, uſed the ſame means, and was rid of the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. Chance in the one, and Imitation in the other, aſſerted the experience: Which Reaſon now in others makes plauſible uſe of.</p>
            <p>From this Baſe is the Noble Frame of Medicine raiſed to ſo great a magnificence: For the Ancients, being by event or advice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from their ſickneſs, hung up votive Tables in the Chapels of their Gods, drawn with the Lineaments of their Diſeaſe and Remedy. Out of theſe approved, yet ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Records did the divine <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Theorems, which all Poſterity adore and embrace as the higheſt Maſterpiece of this skill.</p>
            <p>And our Author ſeems in this his Treatiſe of the Elder to tread the foot-ſteps of that more than mortal old man: For here, as in a curious Landskip, he hath clearly and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically repreſented to your view the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Vertues of this humble Shrub;
<pb facs="tcp:46874:3"/>
whether by chance diſcovered to the Commons, or by improvement to the rational. In whoſe ragged Cote are contained, I dare aver, rarer and ſafer Medicines, than the rob'd Indies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich us with; and though they ſeem but homely, and the Products of Peaſants; yet are more ſafe and effectual for our bodies and diſeaſes, than the moſt renowned Exoticks: For Nature, with a plentiful Horn, hath provided each Climate proper Medicines.</p>
            <p>This being conſidered by the ingenious, it will not only inforce upon them a grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Author for collecting, but of the Tranſlator alſo for imparting his Experiments to us in our Mother Tongue.</p>
            <p>For my own part, though I might put in for my ſhare, if not of Thanks, yet of Acceptance, for this Bill of Revival, if I may ſo term it, which brings you at preſent a new ſight of that Tranſlation, which, with many other things of great value, ſeem'd lately buried in the rubbiſh of our Cities Ruines, I ſhall content my ſelf with performance of a work conducing to the Service of my Countrymen: and hope that this ſecond apparence of ſo uſeful a Piece will be no leſs acceptable to them, than the firſt. I am ſure it cannot be leſs uſeful, if the frequent and urgent enquiries with which the Book was demanded, when out of Print, deceive me not,
<pb facs="tcp:46874:4"/>
But without peradventure, the great Experience which hath lately juſtified the Vertues of the Elder Tree (ſuch, I dare ſay, as hath far exceeded the knowledge of Elder Times) will make for me with them that know, as many do, that from its Berries is drawn a Spirit of ſuch uſe and requeſt in ſome parts of the Land, that not only Shops, but Private Houſes alſo, are thought ill furniſhed without it. I will not therefore by a tedeous Preface detain you any longer from the benefit of this excellent Diſcourſe, of which it is not the leaſt commendation, that it can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently commend it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>The Elder Tree in figure is like the Aſh, ſendeth forth long, ſmall, reed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like branches, covered with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bark of an aſh colour; the next rine to it is green, and that is yellow and ſucculent which next clotheth the wood; within which is contained a white and fungous pith; the leaves are like thoſe of the Walnut tree, but leſs, growing by intervals by threes, fours, yea if you look to both the ſides of the branch, by fives and ſevens, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing it together; of an heavy ſmell, lightly cut in edges. In the tops of the branches and twigs there ſpringeth ſweet and criſped umbels, ſwelling with white, ſweet ſmelling flowers (in <hi>June</hi> befor St. <hi>Johns</hi> Eve) which by their fall give place to a many branched Grape, firſt green, then ruddy, laſtly of a black, dark,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dioſcorides?</hi> who, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, hath of all others written moſt accurately, moſt truly, and moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly of Plants) did long agoe in more proper colours limn them in his fourth Book, and 175 <hi>Chapter,</hi> of the <hi>Matter of Medicine.</hi> Theſe are his words.</p>
                  <p>The faculty and uſe of both (he meaneth the Elder and Ebulus) is the ſame in exiccating, and drawing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the belly: They are indeed troubleſom to the ſtomach, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their leaves being boyled as pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearbs, will purge bile and pituite: Their tender ſtalks being boyled in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46874:14"/>
pot or pan effect the ſame. The root being boyled in wine and given in meat, helpeth the Hydroped; yea it helpeth thoſe that are bitten of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, drunk after the ſame manner. Being boyl'd with water for bathing, it ſoftneth and openeth the <hi>vulva,</hi> and corrects what enormities are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. The berries thereof drunk with Wine work the ſame effect. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed on the hair, they make them black. The recent and tender leaves mitigate inflammations, being with Polent anointed thereon. Their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing helps burning and the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of mad dogs. They conglutinate profound and fuſtulous ulcers, and helps the guttiſh, being together with the fat of a Bull or hee Goat anointed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vertues ſo nobilitate the Elder, that if after ages had not found out any, yet they are enough to commend it to us. But as in all other things (as <hi>Seneca</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Queſt. Natur. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 31.) Nature doth not at once diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her myſteries, neither are her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46874:15"/>
promiſcouſly laid open to all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawn and ſhut in her inmoſt Cabinets, out of which, ſome in this age, ſome in another, is received and unfolded. Even ſo here, one day hath taught another. And the later Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians with more intent thoughts, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the contemplation both of other herbs, and of the Elder, they have tryed it in many affections to be moſt wholſom; ſo that not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly they eſteem it a <hi>Panacaea,</hi> or All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heal: For what is given to others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, experience proves together to be in the Elder. That I may ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its wondrous and hid opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in expugning Epilepſies, Plague, Eryſipelaſſes, and other malign affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which ſhall be ſpoken of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: It hath a wonderfull force in purging out of the body all hurtfull, bilous, pituitous, and eſpecially ſerous humors, from which bud ſuch troops of ſickneſſes, as is to be ſeen in that famous and learned Treatiſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Piſo De ſeroſa Colluvie.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

                     <p>This ſeems to be the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon thereof, That that putrid filthineſs is by this means diſcuſſed without delay, and the body rarified; which, if it had been left longer in the body, without doubt would have dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſed the corruption, &amp; given vigor to the Fever; as is learnedly

                        <p>In which a few things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: That the commons are fully perſwaded, and call experience to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that if thoſe middle barks be pulled downward from the Tree, it emptieth the body of evil humors by purge; if they be pulled upward, it worketh by vomit.</p>
                        <p>The truth of which, as I dare not call in queſtion ſeeing I know the ſame thing is aſſerted of <hi>Aſſarum</hi> by ſome Phyſicians; if notwithſtanding it be free for me to give my opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to others, and the truth, I believe we ought rather to aſcribe the effect to the conſtitution and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar property of the receivers, or to the nature of preſent humor. I will ſay nothing now of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46874:58"/>
whereby the receivers perſwade themſelves, the Medicine will work downward or upward, which they endevour to help by ſundry waies, by motion, compreſſion of the belly, ſuppoſitors, thruſting their fingers in their throats, and ſo forth.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs I will not deny that the bark, and whole Elder alſo, hath divers vertues in purging the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter, by divers places; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I doubt that theſe are rather to be aſcribed to the divers pulling it off the Tree, then to theſe cauſes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and other more weighty, which I leave to the ſerious conſideration of the learned, and proceed.</p>
                        <p>That the ſtalks and leaves of the hearbs, being boyled, doth purge phlegm, is manifeſt out of <hi>Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> to which nevertheleſs the ſprigs or ſprouts are preferred, if in the Spring time, in which they are to be found, they be macerated a little in hot water, and prepared with oyl and vinegar, and be eaten ſparingly

before ſupper, in place of a ſallet; for they gently looſe the belly, unlock the obſtructions of the Meſentery, and being frequently eaten, deliver and preſerve from contumacious feavers.</p>
                        <p>Inſtead of theſe the Conſerve of buds, mixed with the Conſerve of the flowers, is profitable; of which take daily an ounce, half an hour before ſupper, in the water of the bark.</p>

                     <p>This ſame is performed by the ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſyrup of the Elder, deſcribed in the next Chapter, which is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Barley-water, till it come to the conſiſtency of a Julap.</p>

                  <p>Rob of the Elder and the extract prepared of it, here are excellent: The firſt whereof is named by many. The Country-mans Theriack, of which each week to ſwallow the bigneſs of a Walnut, and drink above it its proper Vinegar, and ſo to ſweat in bed, is a commonly received preſervative. This may be fitly uſed by thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Plague, eſpecially if you mix with it ſome of the anti-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential powders; or at leaſt drink above it three or four ſpoonfuls of Antilemick Vinegar of the Elder.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Rob chiefly it that is moſt recent, being ſpread more thickly on a ſhive of bread, and eaten an hour or two before your meat, looſneth the belly; in whoſe place you may give a

                     <p>The ſpirit of the Elder by it ſelf is here very powerful, both in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, a few drops thereof being taken with a little white bread in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and likewiſe in the beginning of the diſeaſe, a ſpoonful or two being taken thereof before the feveriſh heat be powerful.</p>
                     <p>But that ſpirit is far more noble, which is drawn off by an Alimbeck in the preparation of the Antilemick extract; ſeeing from the volatile eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe Bezoartick ſimples it hath carried much with it.

                     <p>Some drops of the ſpirit of Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalt given in the broth of fleſh is a preſervative.</p>

                     <p>The way of uſing it is this; The whole body of the infected perſon within 24 hours is to be anointed with this oyl warm, and being wrapt in warm ſheets, he is to be laid in a warmed bed to ſweat; for they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that it is proved, that by this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy many have ſafely eſcaped the fierceneſs of this poiſon: which unction, as it is not diſapproved, ſeeing it openeth the pores of the skin, and

                     <p>It ſeems this hath come from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of whom <hi>Alpinus</hi> in his 4 Book and 15 Chapter relates, that they uſe this medicine in peſtilential fevers, in which the ſpots are either begun to appear, with great profit, at leaſt once a day uſing this hot lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after which, without delay, they cover the feveriſh with many cloths, endeavouring to draw the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous humor from the bowels to the skin.</p>

If there be nauce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or vomit, with oppreſſing of the heart, and difficulty of breathing; it is ſuſpicious that theſe effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from tough phlegm, or ſome other putred humor gathered there; then give two ounces of the oil of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed flowers, or bark of the Elder, with black water; and by thruſting the finger in the throat provoke vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; or give a drachm of the oil drawn out of the berries and kernels in a draught of warm Ale, &amp; haſten vomit.</p>
                     <p>By which means any thing that's trouble to the ſtomach will be caſt up,

which being done, give a ſpoonful of the ſtomatical Elder-ſpirit or ſimple, well ſweetned with Sugar, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed in the heart of the Rie-bread for ſtrengthening the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>That Wine which is prepared of the dried berries, as we appointed, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtomatical, and greatly help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the weak and windy ſtomach; whereof you muſt drink oft, chiefly in time of ſupper a cup full or two.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it to be objected that <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſays, That Elder is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſtomach, ſeeing he ſpeaks there of the crude and unprepared, which we acknowledge is hurtful to the ſtomach, as ſome preparations thereof likewiſe are; but experience it ſelf doth atteſt, that this wine, and other medicines thereof, have great vertue in corroborating and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirit of Elder-ſalt, taken in ſix grains or more, weekly in fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broth, doth cleanſe the ſtomach, and ſtir up appetite.</p>

                        <p>Of the Wines we have often made mention before, chiefly in the ſecond Section; nevertheleſs we will ſet down this of <hi>Quercetans,</hi> in his firſt Book and ninth Chapter, becauſe it differs little from others; The ſeeds are to be preſt, and the juice drawn out, which being mixed with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of the Muſt of the beſt white wine, is to be put in a Hogſhead of convenient bigneſs, till it be fully digeſted and fermented.</p>
                        <p>Note, That it is better if it be done in a cloſe Hogſhead, that is, if the Hogſhead be not altogether full;

but at leaſt the third part be left emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and be well cloſed that nothing do exhale.

                        <p>The ſame <hi>Foreſtus</hi> in the ſame book and 87 <hi>Obſerv.</hi> hath this, The bark of the root of the Elder reduced in a Succus, the doſe is two ounces, in fragrant Wine. <hi>Benedic. Veronenſis</hi> writes, that ſome give four drachms of the juice of the bark of Elder-roots. Others give for 9 days together the juice of Elder-bark-roots in a pretty quantity, or an ounce in the waning of the Moon, and ſo cure Hydropick perſons: for it bravely purgeth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the middle bark of the Elder doth likewiſe. <hi>Nicholas</hi> at one time gives ſix ounces of the decoction of middle Elder-bark: The ſame man

giveth two or three drachms of the juice of the Elder, and of the juice of Ebulus four drachms to an ounce. Some give the juice of the middle-bark of the Elder with Oximel. Thus far <hi>Foreſtus.</hi>

                     <p>Note, there was a certain Citizen of <hi>Haina,</hi> who for two years being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with a continual falling again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fevers, and after that became Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophlegmatick through his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by my advice he was cured by theſe following; Firſt, I deſired him to uſe wine wherein the Elder-bark and flowers, and the tops of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in equal parts were infuſed, thereby to open the obſtructions of the Meſeraick veſſels, &amp; to purge the ſerous &amp; pituitous inundations of the firſt region. Of which every morning, after he had taken a little broth, he was to take a good draught. From which time, after the belly had for a few days anſwered the Medicine, I deſir'd him to ſwallow a pretty ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Elder-rob, mixt with Hearts-horn; and having drank Vinegar of the Elder, mixed with Wine, go to ſweat in bed; which being done twice or thrice, his whole body did detumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; a more lively colour, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46874:92"/>
laudable appetite did return; neither to this day hath appeared any reſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Fevers.</p>

ſhe was in a ſhort time reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and lived till ſhe was fourſcore years old, to the great wonder of all thoſe that ſaw and heard it.</p>

                  <p>The water diſtilled out of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent bark in the Autumn, or Spring, is oft to be drank.

Vomits are good to preſerve from this diſeaſe, if it be provoked once a moneth by thoſe that are uſed to it.

                  <p>IN the ſtinging of venemous beaſts, the green leaves of the Elder being applyed, are praiſed, becauſe they draw out the poyſon, and dry the wound.</p>

                     <hi>George Amwald</hi> in his <hi>Panacea</hi> bids us diſſolve Rob of the Elder in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Wine, and rub therewith the ſtung or bitten place, and waſh it therewith.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtinging of Waſps and Bees anoint the place with the oyle of the infuſed flowers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or with that which is preſt out of the kernels of the berries, and put a leaf thereon; it mitigateth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46874:125"/>
the pain, and in a ſhort time cauſeth the tumor to fall and evaniſh.</p>
                  <p>To ſtop the poyſon of the Vipers bitings, beſides theſe Topicks, <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides</hi> bids us boyle the roots of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Wine, and drink the Colature. He attributeth the ſame vertue to the berry drank in Wine.</p>
                  <p>'Tis better to uſe the Wine of the berries, to take two drachmes of the Rob; or as many ſcruples of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in the water of Elder-flowers, and provoke ſweat.</p>
                  <p>In Philtrums, or thoſe Potions wicked Whores uſe to give for love, or in other poyſons taken inwardly nothing is better, then upon the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately to caſt all up by vomit, that is in the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>Give two ounces or three of the oyle of the infuſed flowers or bark of the Elder in warm Ale, and accelerate vomit.</p>
                  <p>Or, take an indifferent ſpoonful of the oyle preſſed out of the kernels; give it in warme Ale: For by this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46874:126"/>
means all venom that is in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, is happily excluded, and the corroſive acrimony of the poyſon is qualified; uſe it again, if it be needful.</p>
                  <p>Which being done, provoke ſweat, that that which ſticketh in the veins (for the more maligne the humor is, the more it penetrateth, and like fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, infecteth the whole bloud) muſt be evacuated by ſweat.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things which were brought for the Plague, are profitable here: Rob ſimple, and Antilemick, their extracts, &amp;c. of which give as much as is convenient to the age and ſtrength of the patient, diſſolved in the diſtilled water of Elder-flowers, of other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient liquor. And ſeeing ſeldom the force of the poyſon is daunted by once or twice; but rather under the ſubtile ſhew of a ſervant, as being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and obeying Natures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by ſecret mines lurketh and worketh to overthrow the ſtrength of Nature, and overcome it by little and little. Therefore the uſe of theſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46874:126"/>
Alexitericks is not to be intermitted but to be continued, till all the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and maligne impreſſions that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main be extirpate out of the body. This mixture is profitable.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Conſerve of Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, of the flowers of Burrage, as much as you will; mix them. Give half an ounce thereof daily, an hour or two before dinner. Drink a ſpoonful of the juice of the berries above it.</p>
                  <p>Give two drachmes every week of the Rob of the Elder, in the water of Elder-flowers, and provoke ſweat in bed, or bath. After the ſweat, the heat to be tempered with a ſpoonful or two of the ſowre ſyrup of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>This experiment is praiſed by many; Take of the middle Elder-bark, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly ſhaven, and dry it lightly in the ſhadow, a little more then a handful; put on it three quarters of a pound of Goats milk, boyle it on a ſoft fire till the half be conſumed; of whoſe Cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture drink morning and evening.</p>

They ſay that this doth abſolutely out-rout all poyſon given by whores and knaves, though it were given three years before. If it do not ſucceed at firſt, the patient is to uſe it often; and by divine aſſiſtance he ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the wiſhed event.</p>

If there occur any thing here which doth not pleaſe you, it is your part fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to conſtruct it, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the cenſure, till you try all things more exactly in the infallible ballance of reaſon and experience.</p>
