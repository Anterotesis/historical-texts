         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meikle
as Wee are not ignorant of the great diſorders, which have happened of late within this our
ancient Kingdome of Scotland, occaſioned, as is pretended, upon the introduction of the Service book,
book of Canons, and High Commiſſion, thereby fearing innovation of Religion and Laws. For ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of which fears, we well hoped, that the two proclamations of the eleventh of December, and
nineteenth of Februarie, had been abundantly ſufficient: Nevertheleſſe, finding that diſorders have daily
ſo increaſed, that a powerfull rather then perſwaſive way, might have been juſtly expected from Us:
Yet We out of Our innative indulgence to our people, grieving to ſee them run themſelves ſo headlong into ruine, are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
pleaſed to try, if by a faire way We can reclaime them from their faults, rather then to let them periſh in the ſame.
And therefore once for all We have thought fit to declare, and hereby to aſſure all our good people, that We neither were, are,
nor by the Grace of God ever ſhall be ſtained with Popiſh ſuperſtition: But by the contrarie, are reſolved to maintain the true
Proteſtant Chriſtian Religion already profeſt within this our ancient Kingdome. And for farther clearing of ſcruples, We do
hereby aſſure all men, that We will neither now nor hereafter preſſe the practice of the foreſaid Canons and Service book,
nor any thing of that nature, but in ſuch a fair and legall way, as ſhall ſatisfie all our loving ſubjects, that We neither intend
innovation in Religion or Laws. And to this effect have given order to diſcharge all Acts of Counſell made thereanent. And
for the high Commiſſion, We ſhall ſo rectifie it with the help of advice of Our privie Counſell, that it ſhall never impugne
the Laws, nor be a juſt grievance to Our loyall Subjects. And what is farder fitting to be agitat in generall Aſſemblies and
Parliament, for the good and peace of the Kirk, and peaceable government of the ſame, in eſtabliſhing of the Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
profeſt, ſhall likewaies be taken into Our Royall conſideration, in a free Aſſembly and Parliament, which ſhall be
indicted and called with Our beſt conveniencie. And We hereby take God to witneſſe, that Our true meaning and intention is,
not to admit of any innovations either in Religion or Laws, but carefully to maintain the puritie of Religion already profeſt
and eſtabliſhed, and no wayes to ſuffer our Laws to be infringed. And although We cannot be ignorant, that there may be ſome
diſ-affected perſons who will ſtrive to poſſeſſe the hearts of Our good ſubjects, that this Our gracious declaration is not to be
regarded: Yet We do expect that the behaviour of all Our good and loyall ſubjects will be ſuch, as may give teſtimonie of
their obedience, and how ſenſible they are of Our grace and favour, that thus paſſeth over their miſdemeanors, and by their
future carriage make appeare, that it was only fear of innovation, that hath cauſed the diſorders which have happened of
late within this Our ancient Kingdome. And are confident, that they will not ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced and miſ-led, to
miſconſtrue Us or Our actions, but reſt heartily ſatisfied with Our pious and reall intentions, for maintenance of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Laws of this Kingdome. VVherefore We require and heartily wiſh all Our good people carefully to advert to theſe
dangerous ſuggeſtions, and not to permit themſelves, blindely under pretext of Religion, to be led in diſobedience, and draw
on infinitely to Our grief their own ruine, which We have, and ſtill ſhall ſtrive to ſave them from, ſo long as VVe ſee not royall
Authoritie ſhaken off. And moſt unwillingly ſhall make uſe of that power which God hath endued Us with, for reclaiming of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
people.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR VVILL is herefore, and VVe charge you ſtraitly and command, that incontinent theſe Our Letters ſeen, you
paſſe to the market croſſe of Our Burgh of Edinburgh, and all other places needfull, and there by open proclamation
