            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AFter my humble duty remembred, &amp;c. I wrot to you the laſt weeke by a friend bound for <hi>London,</hi> incloſed to my Brother <hi>Roger Cole,</hi> and incloſed a Proclamation ſet forth by the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and Councell here, ſhewing the names of divers of the Capitall Rebels, and what reward ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him that ſhall bring in the heads of them or kill them, although they ſhall not be able to bring in their heads, yet a different reward to be given the doers of it, and ſince which time, Sir <hi>Phelom O Neale</hi> and the Lords of the Engliſh Pale, <hi>viz.</hi> the antient Engliſh Inhabiting divers Counties about <hi>Dublin,</hi> beſtowed on them by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> of whom I wrot the names in my former letters, have made a Proclamation on their parts, that whoſoever ſhall bring unto them the head of the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> our Generall, of Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi> and other Collonels and Captaines of ours, ſhall have a very great reward, and the fine of each is expreſſed in the Proclamation, as yet they dare doe any thing, for if we count the arme of the fleſh to be ſtrength, they are neere 20 to one againſt us. There is of them gon into the Province of <hi>Munſter</hi> above 30000 men, and ſome report they are compleat in Armes, and the Commanders are the Lord <hi>Montgarret,</hi> L. <hi>Dunboyne,</hi>

L. of <hi>Icharin,</hi> L. <hi>Kihare,</hi> L. <hi>Brittis,</hi> and Lord of up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per <hi>Oſsery,</hi> and ſome affirme that my Lord of <hi>Muz<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grave</hi> is Generall, they have driven the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent into <hi>Corke,</hi> and 14 or 1500 men with him, and have laid ſiege to <hi>Bandon-bridge,</hi> &amp; <hi>Kingſale,</hi> of which we have certaine newes, but what miſchiefe they have done to our Engliſh in all the Countrey there about, we know not, but doe grieve to thinke upon. All the Province of <hi>Connaght</hi> is likewiſe in rebellion, and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laway</hi> taken by them, onely we underſtand that the Fort there is on our ſide, but hour long they can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without proviſion we know not, that is the moſt dangerous place in the Kingdom, becauſe it is a good Harbour and lyes open to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and you know that <hi>ſpain</hi> hath ever bin a harbour of Rebels againſt <hi>England,</hi> their Religion teacheth men ſo to be. I wrot you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly that if wee have not ſhipping in all the Ports of this Kingdome, to prevent the comming in of Armes to the Rebels, that all the ayd <hi>England</hi> can ſend will doe us little good, for you may pleaſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the difference betweene their Souldiers and ours, ſetting their Commanders a part: our men are for the moſt part poore men and weake in many reſpects, for he that is of any great meanes and great breeding in <hi>England,</hi> will not come over to be common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier here, and thoſe that are here they are (many of them) poore pilledg'd people, the better ſort are gon for the moſt part into <hi>England:</hi> they are the moſt wiſe able and active men of this Kingdome, and in battle they have a very great advantage againſt us, for they commonly place themſelves heare unto ſome great Bog, and if they be put to the worſe in 500 yards running they will get into the Bogs, where no horſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56337:3"/>
can come neare them, neither are our foot skilfull to follow them: if it were poſſible there to compaſſd them in, it were to the purpoſe, but to meet with them on the other ſide of the Bog, it may be will coſt our men (as in many places) 20 or 30 miles march, and by that time they will be far from our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Rebellion is ſo generall, and their men ſo many, that if our Army here, which with my Lord Lieut. Regiment now landed, and the 4 or 500 horſe now come (as is reported) will make hardly 8000 men, 1000 whereof are Inhabitants, and moſt of them houſeholders, Marchants and Tradeſmen of this City, and their ſervants, who may not leave this Citty without great danger. I have two ſervants in the Kings pay, and I ſtand with my owne Armes upon any ſervice that ſhall be required, and will God willing, adventure my hearts blood for the cauſe in hand; I ſay if our Army here ſhould adventure farre into the Countrey againſt them one way, they will eſcape our Army many wayes, and come upon <hi>Dublin,</hi> which would indanger the loſſe of the whole Kingdome, for all depends upon this place: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee have no intelligence out of the North, whereby to write you of it, yet you may pleaſe to conceive, that where the Rebellion began, they will make ſure ſomething for themſelves: I thinke there are none but Scots Inhabitants, very few Engliſh left to oppoſe them, wee have no certaine intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence thence of the landing of any out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but what we heare out of <hi>England;</hi> I wrot you of the going away of ſhipping from hence with proviſion for to relieve our Souldiers in <hi>Tredath</hi> (or <hi>Droghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath)</hi> and was in hope that they had got in ſafe, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56337:3"/>
On Saturday we underſtood that they were not then gotten in, that the Rebels had ſunck many boats and chained them together, and that Captaine <hi>Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> of the Kings Pinaſſe; intended to try the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the chaine, or if the ſpring-tyde would bring water enough to carry them over the chaine, and that Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> had taken one veſſell loaden with Herrings, and ſunck another being come from <hi>Wexford,</hi> thither with proviſion for the Rebels, I truſt to heare good newes from thence.</p>
            <p>We heare that there are two Prieſts at <hi>Nantz</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> buying of Powder and Armes for the Rebels, I am much affraid that this South wind hath brought them in unto <hi>VVexford,</hi> for that Towne is in their owne cuſtody, I cannot heare whether <hi>Youghall</hi> and <hi>Dungarven</hi> be taken by them or not; but they have a very great Army gon that way; we are here in a very bad caſe for want of mony, and we have had good hope to have had ſtore out of <hi>England</hi> this wind, but there is not mony to pay the Souldiers that are now come over. We have great joy for the bleſſed agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the King and the Parliament. God who is the Author of peace and Unity, keepe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and his inſtruments; the ſower of ſedition, and his children, from diſturbing the ſame, that the King may be happy, God glorified, his Religion eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that truth and honeſty may be in faſhion, and ſuperſtition and lyes may be put away from our <hi>Land,</hi> and the father of lyes and Antichriſt utterly baniſht. We have reported here, that my Lord <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> hath great forces apart, beſides the Army that is with my Lord <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> but I thinke it is all one Army, and I marvell from whence they have
