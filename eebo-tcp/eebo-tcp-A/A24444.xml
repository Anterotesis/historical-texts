            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt to trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with Prefaces, which are ſo much Exploded by the Wits of the Age, I cannot but take Notice of an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Obſervation made by a Worthy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Divine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing concerning <hi>Papiſts,</hi> expreſſes himſelf thus: <hi>I doubt not, but</hi> Papiſts <hi>are made like other Men; Nature hath not generally given them ſuch Savage Diſpoſitions, but their Religion hath made them ſo: I am loth to ſay it, and yet I am confident 'tis very True, That many</hi> Papiſts <hi>would have been Excellent Perſons, and very Good Men, if their Religion had not hind'red them, if</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52073:2"/>
               <hi>the Doctrines and Principles of their Church had not perverted and ſpoyled their Natural Diſpoſitions.</hi> And in relating ſome of their Meritorious Acts of Treaſon and Murther, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and applauded by ſome of that Party, the ſame Excellent Perſon ſpeaks thus: <hi>Good God! That any thing that is called</hi> Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ſhould ſo perfectly ſtrip Men of all Humanity, and transform the Mild and Gentle Race of Mankind, into ſuch Wolves and Tygers.</hi> And this is the Exact Character of a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and leaſt we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what they are, they dayly give us freſh Occaſions to ſatisfie us, that they are ſtill the ſame Men, and that no Favour nor Kindneſs on our Parts, can alter their curſed Natures, nor ſecure us from their Deſigning the utter Deſtruction of any that dare appear againſt their Villanous Contrivances: And this we have a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of, in the following brief Account, as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Inhabitants and Neighbours in and near the Place where it was Acted.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of this inſtant <hi>April, John Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> was at a Tavern with ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honor, near <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> and going from thence he had occaſion to paſs through a Place called <hi>Bell-Yard,</hi> near <hi>Chancery-Lane,</hi> between Nine and Ten a Clock the ſame Evening, toward his Lodging in <hi>Fleet-Street;</hi> as he was going along, he obſerved Two or Three Perſons to follow him, which he ſuppoſed to be his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but coming nigh a little Lane, called <hi>Jack-a-Napes Lane,</hi> one of theſe Perſons ſtept before him, and threw a Cloak over his Head; and dragging him a little out of the way, threw him down; and inſtantly Three Men fell upon him, and with their Swords or Daggers, endeavoured to Murder him, ſtabing him in the Head, Breſt, and Arm, and run him quite through the Side; but finding their Weapons met with ſome Oppoſition, they ſwore <hi>Dam 'um, he wore privat Armour, or a Coat of Mail,</hi> or words to that purpoſe; whereupon one ſaid, <hi>God Dam the Dog, Cut his Throat,</hi> or to that effect, which one of them Immediatly endeavored to do, kneeling down upon him, and cutting him from one Ear to the other, and likewiſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52073:2"/>
up to his mouth in a moſt Horrid manner, yet happily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Wind-Pipe; one of the Villains ſaid, Dam me ye Dog, now Pray for the Soul of Captain <hi>Evans.</hi> This <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> it ſeems being a Jeſuit, who was lately Executed for High Treaſon in the County of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and who ſomtime before his Apprehenſion had threatned to Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the ſaid Mr. <hi>Arnold;</hi> One of them attempting to give another Wound to Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> ſtruck one of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions into the Leg, which made him ſwear <hi>God Dam me, you have Wounded me;</hi> While they are proceeding in their bloody Purpoſe to diſpatch him, it happened that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman having occaſion to ſend his Servant out, and the Villany being Acted very near his Door, the glance of the Candle it is thought affrighted them, for they Immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fled, and Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> Crying out <hi>Murder,</hi> ſeveral of the Neighbors came in and found him there weltring in his <hi>own</hi> Blood, who deſired they would help him to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was at the Poſt-Houſe in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> where he now remains.</p>
            <p>He hath received no leſs than Seven Wounds from the Hands of theſe Curſed Villains: One in the Throat, one in the Head, two in the Arm, two in the Breaſt, and one in the Side; and yet it is very much hoped that through Gods Aſſiſtance he may eſcape with his Life, though no queſtion the ſame Fate was deſigned for him as was for that Worthy and never to be forgotten Gentleman Sir <hi>Edmundbury-Godfrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of his Majeſties Juſtices of Peace, who Lives near that Place, having an Account of this horrid Fact, was pleaſed to take a particular Information of all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and humbly preſented it to His Majeſty, who was extreamly concerned at this Villanous Attempt; and his Majeſty was further Graciouſly pleaſed to order one of his own Chyrurgeons to Viſit Mr. <hi>Arnold:</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing the whole matter in Council, His Majeſty was Graciouſly pleaſed to Order, that the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the Juſtices of Peace of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> do cauſe diligent ſearch to be forthwith made within their ſeveral Jurisdictions for the ſaid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or any of them, or any that did incite, incourage,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52073:3"/>
or ſet them on to make this Attempt: And for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, his Majeſty is pleaſed to promiſe an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound to any who ſhall Diſcover or Apprehend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the ſaid three Perſons, or any who did incite them thereto; and if any of the three Perſons, ſhall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Accomplices, His Majeſty is Graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to promiſe him his Pardon for the ſame, beſides the ſaid Reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Arnold</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is known to be a very good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and a ſtrong Oppoſer of the Plots and Deſigns of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and has been likewiſe very Inſtrumental in the Diſcovery of the late horrid Conſpiracy; and we may therefore Reaſonally ſuppoſe he was marked out for Popiſh Vengeance, and that this curſed Attempt came from their Hands, as their words at parting ſeem very much to confirm, bidding him Pray for the Soul of Captain <hi>Evans,</hi> who was lately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Legally Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Executed as a <hi>Jeſuit;</hi> ſo that it ſeems <hi>Papiſts</hi> can take up any ſhapes, (and both Captains and Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) as well as Act the greateſt Crimes for advancing the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>'s being in <hi>London,</hi> was (as hath been often Publiſhed) about an Accuſation of one Maſter <hi>Herbert</hi> in <hi>Monmouth-ſhire,</hi> concerning ſome Tranſactions in that Country; and Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had now brought ſeveral Witneſſes from thence, to make good the Accuſation, and the Cauſe was ordered to be heard the very next Day, that is the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> Inſtant before his Majeſty in Council: Now by Reaſon of ſome Words uttered by Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> a while before, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> was ordered to be taken into Cuſtody; and we hear that notwithſtanding this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> there will be a hearing of the Cauſe by Council of both ſides at the time appointed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let all good Proteſtants beſeech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to Diſcover and bring to Juſtice, theſe, and all other our Curſed, Popiſh Adverſaries, who deſign the Deſtruction of his Majeſty and his Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the overthrow of our Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Eſtabliſhed, and to this let all the People ſay,</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
