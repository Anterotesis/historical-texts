         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Author, born in a low Countrey, hath, by his excellent works, both Divine and Humane, raiſed himſelf to the juſt Repute of the moſt General, and the wiſeſt Scholar of his time; So that, it is become a character of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Student (as it was ſaid, in the laſt Age, of his Country-man, the Great <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>) to be well verſed in the Books of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> Out of whoſe Magazine, our beſt Engliſh Writers, to their praiſe, have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſome of their beſt furniture.

                  </note> That Authority about Sacred things belongs to the Higheſt Power thus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we prove, Firſt from the Unity of the matter about which it is converſant, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is the Miniſter of God, a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi> Under the name of <hi>Evill,</hi> is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo all that which is committed in Holy things; for the Indefinite ſpeech ſignifies as much as the Univerſall, which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath expreſſed: <note place="margin">Pro. 20.8.</note> 
                  <hi>A King that ſitteth in the throne of Judgement ſcattereth away ALL evill with his eyes.</hi> This is confirmed by a <hi>Similie;</hi> for the Authority of a Father is leſſe than of the Higheſt Power, yet are Children commanded <hi>to obey their Parents in all things.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. And by naturall reaſon.</note> And truly there can be no reaſon given why any thing ſhould be excepted; For, if that which is excepted be ſubject to no Authority at all which who can prove?) there will follow confuſion among the things exempted, whereof God is not the Author: or, if it be ſubject to ſome other Authority, not under the Higheſt Power, there muſt then bee two Higheſt Powers diſtinct: which is a Contradiction; for the Higheſt hath no equall.

               <p>Nor is this the effect of Religion, in that part only, where it preſcribes a rule for manners, and ſtrengthens it with threats and promiſes: the Doctrines and Rites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have no ſmall moment to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of good life, and advancing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick happineſſe. <hi>Xenophon</hi> perhaps thought it was a witty conceit when he ſaid, T'was

So alſo, to the Authority of the Higheſt Power are ſubject in the former way the offices that have in them Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Juriſdiction, as the office of Major, Governour of a town, and the like: In the latter way the Function of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, Philoſopher, Husbandman and Merchant. Wherefore they fight with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114767:12"/>their own ſhadow, who take great pains to prove that the Paſtors of Churches, <hi>as ſuen,</hi> are not the Vicars or Deputies of the Higheſt Powers; for who knows not that, when Phyſicians neither can without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake be ſtiled ſo. But that the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as they receive ſome Authority or Juriſdiction, beſide their Paſtorall office, <hi>in reſpect of that acceſsion,</hi> may be called Deputies or Delegates of the Supreme Powers, ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.

The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Officers are both Subjects to the Higheſt, and Deputies; the Paſtors, as ſuch, are only Subjects, not Deputies.</p>

The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, and the Sacred Function, united in the ſame Perſon, by the Law of Nature.</note> The Authority over the Function, and the Function it ſelf being diſtinguiſhed, we muſt enquire, Whether that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the holy Function may be united in the ſame perſon, Whereunto that we apply a fit anſwer, a difference muſt be made between the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive divine Law.</hi> By the naturall Law, the ſame perſon may have the higheſt Authority and the Prieſthood too: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe have no ſuch oppoſition, but they may meet in one man. Nay more, ſet aſide the Poſitive Law, and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall impediments, it is in ſome ſort, naturall, that the ſame Perſon be both King and Prieſt; not ſo naturall, as that it cannot be otherwiſe, but as thoſe things are tearmed naturall, which are well agreeing unto nature and right reaſon. For ſeeing Kings, whoſe Dominions are not of the largeſt, may eaſily joyne ſome peculiar Function to the care of their Kingdome, as we have known Kings to have been Phyſicians, Philoſophers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers, Poets, and very many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in War; and ſeeing, no Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more excellent, and whence doe flow down upon the people ſo many benefits, as the Prieſtly Office; it appears, that this, above all other, is moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114767:13"/>and worthy of a King. <note place="margin">4. It was ſo before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after, among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> The conſent of Nations doth evince it: for in the firſt times, when men were govern'd more by Domeſticall than Civill Power, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of families, as all confeſſe, did both repreſent ſome Image of Kings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Prieſthood alſo.

After the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, as the Principality of the Family, ſo the Prieſthood too was devolved to the firſt borne, and that cuſtome continued in the poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> for as yet they had no Common-wealth conſtituted) untill the <hi>Levits</hi> (that is, the Prieſts, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters unto the Prieſts,) were ſurrogated and put in place of the firſt borne: as the divine Law doth expreſly tell us. But in the meane time, in the Country of <hi>Canaan,</hi> there being a kind of Common-wealth, we read of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> King and Prieſt.

               </p>
               <p>It may be enquired, whether thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Kings, while the true worſhip of God laſted (as it is credible it laſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many of the Fathers for ſome Ages after the floud) received the Prieſthood by ſome ſpeciall Title, or challenged it to themſelves by their Paternall and Regall Right?</p>
               <p>Very learned men are of opinion, that, as ſome probably had the authority of the divine Oracle, ſo others had it not: nor is any ſuch thing, the Law poſitive being ſet aſide, requir'd to the conſtitution of a Prieſt. Yea, when the men of thoſe times, all the world over, were bound, as far as they knew him, to honour God, and <hi>to give him thanks,</hi> as the Apoſtle convinces, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. they were either bound every one to be Prieſts, or to commend the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to ſome choſen men. But it is the Fathers part to aſſigne all, in the family, their ſeverall offices; and among the reſt the Prieſthood, as being, by the Law of Nature, not excepted: and the function, which he may aſſigne unto another, the ſame, if he be fit for it, nature forbids him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114767:14"/>not to aſſigne unto himſelfe. What is faid of the Father, let it be underſtood of the King; and the rather becauſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, the free multitude, in that firſt ſtate, had a right to chooſe themſelves a Prieſt. Which right of the Multitude, is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Higheſt Power. For ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection conſiſts of bidding and forbidding; becauſe one is licenced to performe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions, others interdicted the ſame. But to bid and forbid are acts of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he that hath not wholly, hath not truly the name of the Higheſt Power. That which is ſpoken to the Hebrews is not oppoſite hereto; <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelfe, but he that is called by God, as Aaron.</hi> For the divine writer in that place treateth of the legall Prieſt, not of him that was, or might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or out of the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and he ſhewes, whatſoever was excellent in the legall Prieſt, was much more eminently in Chriſt, in whom alſo there were many things illuſtrious, which in the legall Prieſt were wanting. But the Cuſtome of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empire with the Prieſthood uſed through all the world about two thouſand five hundred years, in many places longer, the Luxury of Kings, their ſloth, or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of war, in other Nations; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114767:15"/>the people of God, the Poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law did at laſt abrogate: that Law I mean, which gave the Prieſthood not to any of the people, but only to the houſe of <hi>Aaron.</hi> After this, what was before a praiſe, became a treſpaſſe.</p>

                  </note> Why God ſeparated the kingdome of Iſrael from the Prieſthood, 'twere hard to find out, unleſſe the divine writer to the Hebrews had open'd us the way. 'Tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent the Hebrew Nation was very prone to ſuperſtition, and often fell away to Idols; To reſtrain them from this, when God had impoſed on them a great burthen of labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ceremonies, they began to place all their hope in them; from which moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable perſwaſion, the holy men very often call them off; and ſhew, that Mercy and integrity of heart is far more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God, than all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Had the King himſelfe offered their chiefe Sacrifices, as of old the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was, how much more would their minds have been taken up with ſo great a Majeſty? But now, when the Prieſthood was, though ſtill with Pompe enough, yet diſrob'd, as they ſaw, of the Royall Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and brought down below the King; hereby, they were put in mind, to hope for ſome great Prieſt, who ſhould alſo be a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114767:15"/>King as <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was, and to put their truſt in him. What admirers the Jewes were of their Prieſts, even in this appears, that after their return from the Captivity, they forth-with added to the Prieſthood the Principality, which quickly advanced to a Kingdome, and ſo to a Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is worth our obſervation, that, after the Inſtitution of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſome reliques of the antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome ſtill remained. For, to the Fathers of families was left, the killing of the Paſſeover; wherein, as the Jewes rightly note, they performed ſomewhat of the Prieſts office. Circumciſion alſo was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred without a Prieſt, as all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews conſent by any one that had skill to do it. And this is not to be omitted, that Prophecy, which ſeems to have a naturall coherence with the Prieſthood, was as well given to Kings as Prieſts; Yea, to private men, more often than to the Prieſts. Thus did God, many wayes, bring the people to an acknowledgement of the weakneſſe of the Leviticall order. Thus did the Law, as it were, by the hand lead them unto Chriſt; who was to be the higheſt Prophet, the higheſt Prieſt, and the higheſt King; who alſo ſhould make all believers in him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that threefold honour.

So alſo, the Kingdome of Chriſt, which partly conſiſts in his divine care of his Church againſt her enemies, partly in a ſpirituall government of the hearts of men, hath not taken away either the right, or the name of Kings, whoſe Empire is externall, and ſubject both to the divine providence, and the ſpirituall actions of Chriſt: according to that of <hi>Sedulius:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>He doth not earthly Kings dethrone,</l>
                     <l>Who gives to His an heavenly Crown.</l>
                  </q>
The name of Prieſts is alſo given to the preachers of the New Teſtament in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner: but, there was ſome reaſon, why Chriſt and his Apoſtles did alwaies
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114767:16"/>abſtain from that kind of ſpeech; which ought to admoniſh us, that we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and promiſcuouſly argue, from the Leviticall order, to the Evangelicall; feeing, there is a wide difference, both in the office, and the deſigning of the perſons to it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">6.

Many arguments are brought to prove they cannot, but all are not of the ſame ſtrength; for ſome doe more rightly prove the offices to be divers, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have been; and, that Paſtors, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, have no Empire; rather than the conjunction of the offices to be interdicted. That is of more efficacy, that the Apoſtle for bids the <hi>ſouldier of Chriſt</hi> (he ſeems to ſpeak of the Paſtorall warfare) <hi>to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with worldly buſineſſe;</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114767:17"/>the Paſtorall office is of ſuch weight and difficulty, that it requires the whole man. Although this muſt not be taken ſo rigidly, as alwayes to exclude Paſtors from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking any ſecular charge (the Lawes, for example, <note place="margin">Novel. 123 Cap. 5.</note> except Tuitions) yet in ſufficeth to remove from the Paſtor my charge, that is difficult and perpetuall; as we ſee the Apoſtles exempted themſelves, for the ſame reaſon, from the care of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes maintenance; an office otherwiſe not improper for them. But the charge of a Kingdome, is both perpetuall, and more weighty, than any other. The ſtrongeſt argument is, That the royall office requires far other manners and behaviour, than the Paſtorall, as it is deſcribed in the Goſpell, So that, even thence it ſufficiently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, both cannot with any convenience and comlineſſe be ſuſtained by one nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inconſtant levity in paſſing from the exerciſe of one to the other.</p>

Unto men, the internall acts of others are uknown, by their own nature: <hi>by their own nature,</hi> I therefore adde, becauſe the externall, that are done in ſecret, are under Government: for by their nature, they may be known.

               <p>We have conſidered, how largely the matter under Humane Power is extended, and what acts belong unto it, in every kind: now, let us ſee what acts are not, by right, within the Command thereof. <note place="margin">5. Acts not under Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are only thoſe that are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Divine Law.</note> It is certaine, thoſe only are without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Supreme Power, which are repugnant either to the Naturall, or to any other Divine Law; no other way, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the right of the Higheſt Power, can poſſibly be invented. The things defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law Divine (wherein I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Naturall) are of two ſorts; ſome commanded, ſome forbidden. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are two acts of Empire, which belong not to the Right of him that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; <hi>To command what God forbids: To forbid what God commands.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe, as in naturall cauſes, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour have no force to work, againſt the Efficacy of the Superiour; ſo it is in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114767:21"/>Wherefore ſuch Commands, ſo far as they doe contradict the Divine, cannot have the proper effect of Commands; they cannot Impoſe an Obligation. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſaith <hi>Auſtin: If the Curator Commands ſomewhat, is it not to be done? no; If the Proconſul forbids. Herein you contemn not the Power, but chooſe to obey the Higher. Againe, if the Proconſul bid one thing, the Emperour appoint the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, without doubt you muſt hearken to the Emperour. Therefore, if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour doe require one thing, and God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what is to be done? God is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Power; Give us leave, O Emperour, to obey Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Act of Authority, <note place="margin">6. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands repugnant to Divine Law bind to a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> which moves the Subject to work; and the Force offered, which impoſes, on the Subject, a neceſſity of ſuffring. For, when the Act of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is without effect, and layes no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the Force hath an effect, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſicall, but Morall; not on the agents part, but the patients; namely, that it is not lawfull, to repell that force, by force: for violent defence, being lawfull againſt an Equal, againſt a Superiour is unlawfull. <note place="margin">1.

For, <hi>Peter</hi> teaching obedience to the King (that is, to the Higheſt Power) as Supreme, to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (that is, to Inferiour Powers) as ſent, and ordained by Him, manifeſtly ſhewes, all the right of Inferiour Powers to depend
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114767:22"/>upon the Commiſſion they receive from the Higheſt. Hence <hi>Auſtin</hi> concerning <hi>Pontius Pilat: Such power God had given him, that was contained under</hi> Caeſar's <hi>Power.</hi> And, was not <hi>David</hi> a Prince, and a Leader among the people of God, who was ſo farre from touching that Tyrants perſon, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24, 7.</note> that his heart ſmote him, for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the lap of his garment? Reaſon confirmes what we have ſaid. For, thoſe Magiſtrates, in reſpect of their Inferiours, are Magiſtrates, as long as it pleaſeth the Supreme Power; but, in reſpect of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, they are but private men; becauſe all Power, and all Juriſdiction flowes from the Supreme, and ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. Hence <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> that moſt wife Emperour, ſaid, <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates judge Private men, Princes the Magiſtrates, and God the Princes.</hi> By the name of Princes underſtanding the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who were now become abſolute. The ancient Chriſtendome was of the ſame judgement; for no Governours, no Leaders of legions, ever attempted any thing with Arms, againſt the moſt impious, cruell, and bloudy Emperours: So that, it is a very ſad thing, that our Age hath brought forth men of learning, who by a new-coyned doctrine, have opened a broad
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114767:23"/>way for Seditions, <note place="margin">8. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alle ged to the contrary anſwered.</note> and Wars to enter in. Neither ought we to be moved by any late examples of Arms taken up againſt Kings. For if they were taken up againſt Kings, upon whom the whole Right of the people was tranſlated; and, who therefore raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by a precarious, but proper Right; whatſoever pretext or ſucceſſe they had, they cannot be prais'd without impiety. But, if any where Kings were bound by Contracts, on Poſitive Lawes, and Decrees of ſome Senate or States; againſt theſe, having not the higheſt Authority, upon juſt cauſes, by the judgement of the ſame Senate or States, Arms might be taken up. For many Kings, even ſuch as ſucceed by inheritance, are Kings by name, rather than by Power; as <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Laconians. But, this deceives the unskilfull, that they doe not enough diſcern the daily adminiſtration of affaires obvious to their eyes, which in an Optima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is oft committed unto one; from the interiour Conſtitution of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. What I have ſaid of Kings, I would have to be underſtood much more of them, who both really, and in title, were not Kings, but Princes; that is, not <hi>chiefeſt,</hi> but <hi>firſt.</hi> Whoſe Principality much differs from Supremacy. And again,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114767:23"/>this is to be noted, that ſome Lords and Cities have Supreme Authority, though they ſeeme not to have it, being under the Truſt and protection of another. But, ſeeing to be under protection, is not to be in ſubjection; and, as the Roman Lawyers note, <hi>The people ceaſeth not to be free, that are fairly obſervant to anothers Majeſty;</hi> theſe alſo may be endowed with Supreme Authority, who are obliged to another by unequall League, or tye of Homage. All this I ſet down to that end, leſt any one hereafter (as I ſee hath been often done) defame good cauſes, by an ill Defence. I would more enlarge in this Argument (for 'tis of great conſequence, and here to erre is dangerous) but that 'tis done already with great care by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and of late by the learned <hi>Arniſaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe premiſes, let us come to demonſtrate the parity of Empire over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and other matters. <note place="margin">9. The difference 'twixt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> As in all things, the thoughts are not ſo eafily ruled, as the words: ſo particularly, in Religion, <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath truly ſaid; <hi>Who ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me, either to believe, what I will not; or, not to believe, what I will?</hi> And in this ſenſe that of <hi>Caſiodor</hi> is true, <hi>Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Commanded;</hi> and of <hi>Bernard, Faith
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114767:24"/>is</hi> to <hi>be planted by perſuaſion, not obtruded by violence.</hi> Wherefore alſo the Emperours <hi>Gratian, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> ſaid concerning an Heretick, <hi>Let him think, if he will, what is hurtfull for himſelf; let him not utter it, to the hurt of others.</hi> And, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had reſpect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, when he call'd himſelf a Biſhop or Overſeer of <hi>things without:</hi> becauſe, the inward acts, taken by themſelves, are not the matter of Humane power; but are Subject to the power of God; who, by Biſhops, not <hi>Commanding</hi> but <hi>Miniſtring,</hi> moves the minds of men with voices and ſigns; yet ſo, that the ſtill reſerves the maine Efficacy to himſelf alone. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, inward acts of all ſorts, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken joyntly with the outward, fall under Humane Authority. The <hi>Cornelian</hi> Law lays hold on him, who carrys a weapon, with purpoſe to kill a man: and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour ſaith, <hi>not only the event in evill deeds, but the will is to be conſider'd.</hi> So in <hi>Juſtinians Code, concerning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith,</hi> a Title is extant, to wit, for the Profeſſion of Faith, which the firſt Law explains, <hi>All people under our Empire we require to be of ſuch Religion,</hi> &amp;c. Hence came thoſe names of Kings, <hi>Rectors, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Defenders of the Faith.</hi> So alſo of

What God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, cannot be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by by man with vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</note> That things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God cannot with validity be commanded; nor things by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, be forbidden by Humane power, is no leſſe true in other actions, than in Sacred; in both, that of the Apoſtle hath place, <hi>We muſt obey God rather than men:</hi> which a Diſciple of the Apoſtles, <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi> hath expreſſed thus; <hi>We have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to render to the Powers ordained by God, all the honour we can, without hurting our own ſouls.</hi> The King of <hi>Egypt</hi> Commands the Mid-wives to kill the Male-children of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> They doe not obey. The cauſe is expreſt. <hi>For they feared God:</hi> who by the dictate of Nature forbids to ſlay the innocent. King <hi>Ahab</hi> would have <hi>Naboth</hi> ſell him his Vineyard; <hi>Naboth</hi> denyes; for, the Divine Law, given to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> forbad inheritances to be alienated from the ſame family. <hi>Antoninus Caracal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> commands <hi>Papinian</hi> the Lawyer, to defend the paricide committed by him: <hi>Papinian</hi> refuſes, and had rather dye; becauſe he knew, it was againſt the Law of Nature and Nations, to ſpeak falſe and Patronize ſo great a crime. By the ſame right, but with more holy affection, the Apoſtles, when the Councill charged
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114767:25"/>them, not to ſpeak or teach in the name of Jeſus, <note place="margin">Acts 4.19.</note>, aske, <hi>whether they muſt not obey God rather than men?</hi> and juſtly: for they had received a charge from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the mouth of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>in his name to Preach repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> and that <hi>beginning at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> for this alſo was ſpecified in their Commiſſion. What therefore the Divine Command had made neceſſary for them to be done, Humane command could not render unlawfull. And in this ſenſe the Authors are to be explain'd, who ſay, the Goſpel, the Miniſtry, the Sacraments, are not ſubject to Humane Power; that is, to change that, <note place="margin">11. How Religion is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Humane Power.</note> which Divine Law hath introduced.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the Preaching of the word of ſalvation, and the exhibition of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, being commanded by God, cannot effectually be forbidden by men. Likewiſe, the Nourſing of Parents or Children, the relieving of the innocent, and many other duties, are ſo far exempt from Humane Law, that the prohibition of them is of no force or vertue. Secondly, the forme by God preſcrib'd, for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his word and Sacrament, cannot be alter'd by men; nor is this proper to things Sacred. For alſo, the Forme of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114767:25"/>Matrimony, as it conſiſts in the unity and individuall knot of two perſons, is by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law immutable. Thirdly, it belongs not unto Humane Power, to make new Articles of Faith, or, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>to innovate the Faith;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">L. cum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut. L. de ſum. Trin.</note> nor to inſtitute a new worſhip of God, or new Sacraments; becauſe, the nature of ſuch things will not admit thereof: for nothing can be believed or done, in order to ſalvation, but what God hath declared ſuch; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing be fit to apply unto us the Divine grace, unleſſe God hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd it to that uſe. Yet, to ſpeak accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, theſe things which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, Sacred and others, may be rather ſaid to have ſomething in them of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right, than ſimply and altogether exempted from the Rule of the Higheſt Powers; ſeeing there be very many and very great acts of Authority concerning them; <note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.15.30.12.</note> which acts are call'd in Scripture <hi>the Commandements of the King in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">12. And how it is Subject.</note> For firſt, it is the proper effect of the Higheſt Powers, that we have liberty and convenience to doe the things which God commandeth, being freed from impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſupplyed with helps. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> gave leave to the Jews to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaur

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:114767:27"/>the Temple, and to ſacrifice there; and gave them moneys too, to beare their charges. So, by the edict of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> the Chriſtians had open exerciſe of their Religion. Secondly, not only by permitting, but (as before was touched) Humane Law, by Commanding, what Divine Law doth Command, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddes another Obligation. Thirdly, to the actions Commanded by God, the Higheſt Power preſcribes certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of place, time and manner, that they may be done <hi>decently and in order.</hi> Fourthly from actions forbidden by God, the matter and oceaſions are by Humane Power withdrawn. So <hi>Ezechias</hi> brake the braſen Serpent; ſo the Emperours ſhut up the Heathen Temples. Fiftly, 'tis the part of the Higheſt Power, by propoſing puniſhments, to draw men to the doing of that, which God Commands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre them from the contrary. as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi> made it death to ſpeak evill of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> God; and the Emperours, to offer ſacrifice to the God of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> And in theſe particulars conſiſteth, as I take it, that Office of the Higheſt Powers which is called by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nov. 138.</note>

                  <hi>Let the Kings of the earth ſerve Chriſt, by making Lawes alſo on behalf of Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame particulars have place in things not Sacred, which are likewiſe defined one way, by that Divine Law, <note place="margin">Rom. 1.32.</note> which the Apoſtle cals <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> For therefore the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Law is ſaid to conſiſt, partly of Civill inſtitutions, partly of Naturall precepts.

They were men to be feared for their number, had they choſen rather to ſhed others bloud, than their own: for, <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews how they had filled both the Camp and City. That victorious <hi>Thebane</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for Religion ſake, was contented to loſe every tenth man, at the Emperours Command; and, it is memorable, that when there was one Chriſtian put to death for tearing the Imperiall edict, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Bibles to be burnt, Churches to be demoliſht, and the Chriſtians Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; the reſt of the Chriſtians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, He had juſtly deſerved that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

The power of Parems o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Children, of Husbands over their Wives, hath its o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iginall, not from any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitution, but from God himſelf: yet who will deny theſe Powers, though more antient, to be ſubject to the Higheſt. The Phyſicians function is from God, the author of Nature, (as the Paſtor's from God the author of Grace,) and from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Experience he receiveth rules to execute his office, not from the Higheſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114767:30"/>Powers; nor is he in their ſtead, when he pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And, that Paſtors are not bound to obey the Higheſt Powers, when their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Prohibitions are contrary to Gods; herein is nothing ſingular. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private man hath ſo much right, and that in other things, as well as Sacred. Yea, the Judge, that receives his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Higheſt Power, being coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſame to judge againſt right and reaſon, is not bound to obey, or rather, is bound not to obey; which comes to paſſe, not becauſe the private man, or the Judge is not ſubject to the Higheſt Power; (none will imagine that:) but becauſe both the Power and they are all ſubject unto God: and when Commands are contrary, the Superiour is to be preferr'd.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114767:32"/>Merchants and the like, the King ſtands in need of, but to come nearer, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician cures the King as well as his Groome, and preſcribes to both what may conduce to their recovery; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Counſellour of State is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about the King, not only as a man, but as a King.

And what that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars.</note> We muſt come now unto them, who think all Authority about Sacred things ſo to belong unto Chriſt alone, that Kings cannot be partakers of it, becauſe he is ſufficient alone for the Adminiſtration of his Kingdome, and needs not the help of a Deputy. That we may ſatisfy theſe men, the actions of Chriſt muſt be diſtinguiſhed. His <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> and his finall <hi>Judgement</hi> are peculiar to him. In his Legiſlation is comprehended not only a more plaine promulgation of the Divine Law, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations being rejected and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference laid open between the things which God alwaies approved, and thoſe which he did wink at or beare with for a time; but alſo the conſtitution of the Evangelicall Miniſtry and Sacraments,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114767:33"/>with the abrogation of the Ceremoniall Law. His finall Judgement conteins the condemnation of ſome, and the abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others with exhibition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Which being done, Chriſt ſhall put off the Adminiſtration of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet retein the Majeſty of a King for ever. Theſe actions therefore being done, and to be done by Chriſt himſelf; Life and Death Eternall, with the Promiſe, commination and adjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame, being not in the power of meer men; it is certaine, that in them no man is the aſſociate or Deputy to him. But there be other actions call'd <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate:</hi> and of theſe againe, ſome are about the inward, ſome about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. Thoſe about the inward man are partly in the man, partly concerning him. <hi>In the man,</hi> Chriſt works when by the vertue of his Spirit he illuminats ſome, others by not illuminating he blinds, he opens the heart of ſome, others by not opening he hardens; ſometimes he affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth greater aydes againſt temptations, ſometimes leſſe. <hi>Concerning the man,</hi> Chriſt works, when he remits or reteins ſin: yet for the moſt part in thoſe actions alſo ſome ſigns of them are inwardly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the man by Divine Efficacy.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114767:33"/>All thoſe actions exceeding the Power of meer Man, are alſo ſo peculiar to Chriſt, that he admits no Fellow in them not Vicar. Miniſters indeed he admits to theſe actions, <hi>Paſtors: Private men,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> too, every ohe in his way. But there is a difference between a Vicar, and a meer Miniſter; becauſe it is the part of a <hi>Vicar</hi> to produce actions of like kind with his actions whoſe place he holds; though of leſſe perfection: and to a meer <hi>Miniſter</hi> it perteins not to produce actions of like kind, but ſuch as are ſerviceable to the actions of the principall cauſe. Whence it appears, that the ſame action is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atributed, yet proportionably, both to the <hi>Prineipall</hi> and the <hi>Vicegerent;</hi> for the King truly Governs and gives judgement; ſo doth the Judge alſo, though not with equall Right. But, to the Principall and the meer Miniſter, the ſame action can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accommodated without a Trope: as Paſtors are ſaid <hi>to ſave men, to remit and reteine their ſins.</hi> There remaine the actions of Chriſt about the outward man: which eſpecially conſiſt in defence and deliverance from enemies, and in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and adorning of his Church; actions rightly referr'd unto his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And as the generall providence of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114767:34"/>God which hath a warchfull eye over all things although by it ſelf it be ſufficient for the diſpoſition and execution of them; yet, for the demonſtration of his. mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdome, He makes uſe of the Higheſt Powers, as his <hi>Deputies,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the common ſociety of men; whence alſo they are ſtiled Gods: So that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence of Chriſt, watching over his Church, aſſumes unto it ſelf the ſame Powers to Patronise the true Faith; and to them Chriſt alſo imparted his own name.

The law of the Sabbath being abrogated, 'twas at the Chriſtians pleaſure, keeping a juſt proportion, to ſet apart what part of time they would for the worſhip of God. Now, becauſe that worſhip, according to the precept of Chriſt, requir'd a certain Congregation of godly men, that part of time could not be determin'd but by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. So the Apoſtles leading the way, and the Church following, was dedicated to holy Aſſemblies <hi>the firſt day of the week;</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114767:38"/>and made election of perſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to performe it. In both places wee find ſomewhat defined and conſtituted by conſent, which without great fault none could gainſay. For, it was requiſite that ſomewhat ſhould be conſtituted; and that could not be, one or two diſſenting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, either the minor part ſhould give place to the major, or the major to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. This being unreaſonable, that was neceſſary. This right of Conſtitution therefore, to the Church is naturall. But, the Imperative Government, <note place="margin">12.

The Higheſt, if the faithfull unmixed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and free from all ſubjection, make up a Common-wealth of themſelves; This ſeemeth to have happened to the Jewes in the times of the Maccabees; <note place="margin">1 Mac. 4.59.</note> the Church had then the Higheſt Authority: yet, not properly as a <hi>faithfull</hi> people, but as a <hi>free</hi> people. An Inferiour Authority, and liberty to uſe their own Law, the ſame Jewes, not only in their own Land, but at <hi>Alemandria</hi> and elſe-where, have often had, with ſome kind of coactive Power, ſometimes of more, ſometimes of leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;

               <p>THe Authority of the Higheſt Powers about Sacred things being clear'd wee come to that which pertains to the right uſe of this Authority. <note place="margin">1. The word, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> The Commands of Authority muſt proceed from Judgement. Judgement properly denotes the act of a Superiour, defining what is juſt between two parties; and the Higheſt Judgement is that of the Higheſt Power; for the Lawes and Decrees thereof cannot be nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or repealed by any Higher: although obedience to ſuch Lawes and Decrees be not abſolutely due, but ſo farre as it may be given, without violation of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

Yet there muſt be a reſpect had to the preſent things, and a reſpect to the places too: Wiſely ſaith <hi>Jerom: In things neither contrary to Faith nor manners, let the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of our Country be as Canons Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.

But we ſay, there was no need to ask leave, when there were no Imperiall Edicts againſt it. As for the antient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Senate againſt meetings, religious meetings were excepted in them, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Jewes (as <hi>Philo</hi> relates it) had leave of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to aſſemble.

Beſides, in the places where moſt of the Synods were held, though ſubject to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they had the benefit of their own Lawes. Wherefore, if at any time the Churches enjoyed Peace, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened under Pagan Emperours, the Biſhops had no hindrance, but they might meet in Synods. But in the heat of Perſecution, as the Chriſtians could not intermit Church-meetings, although forbidden by humane
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114767:61"/>Lawes, becauſe they were commanded by Divine; So the Biſhops were carefull, not to incurre the ſuſpition and hatred of the Rulers by Synodicall Aſſemblies, ſo long as the Church could ſubſiſt without them. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhewes in ſeverall places, when under perſecution there aroſe a great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about <hi>receiving the lapſed into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> and to the deciding of it there was need of Common-Counſell, nevertheleſſe the Biſhops deferred their meeting till the ſtorme was paſt: neither durſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Liberius,</hi> without the conſent of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> call a Synod.

                  <note place="margin">8. Three Queſtions about Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</note> But there are three principall Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies concerning the Higheſt Powers right and office about Synods. Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull for the Higheſt Power to command any thing in Sacred affaires without a Synod; Second, what is lawfull for him, and what he ought to doe before the Synod, and in the Synod; Third, what after the Synod.</p>
               <p>For the reſolution of the firſt Queſtion,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114767:63"/>we muſt conceive, <note place="margin">9.1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the H Power may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</note> whatſoever is ſaid very juſtly of the exceeding great commodities of Synods, belongs to the manner of uſing the Right of Empire, not to the Right it ſelf. For if the Higheſt Power ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Synod any right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, it were not then the Higheſt: The Higheſt being that which is ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God alone, and under God hath the fulleſt right of governing. Again, if the Higheſt Power without a Synod could not command that, which it might command with a Synod, then ſhould it receive part of the right of governing from the Synod: and then, becauſe none can give what he hath not, it would follow, that ſomewhat of the Government were in the Synod; which the Synod, not having by any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane right, muſt challenge by Divine right; whereas the Divine Law denies any ſuch Power to have been given by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, (as hath been ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,) and therefore not to Synods. The Right being thus confirmed, we make no ſcruple to affirme, That the Higheſt Power may <hi>ſometimes</hi> rightly order Sacred things without a Synod: They that univerſally hold it unlawfull, <note place="margin">10. The affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> will never prove what they ſay: but we ſhall eaſily. For there are extant many examples of the Hebrew
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114767:64"/>Kings, that without a Synod gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Sacred matters.</p>
               <p>Whether the Church declare or not, even before the Churches declaration the Kings duty is to reform what is amiſſe, and for neglect thereof he muſt give account to God. Eminent among the Chriſtian Emperours is the example of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> He ſate as Arbitratour between ſeverall Factions of the Biſhops, he gives every one the hearing, he reads their (confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and after prayers to God for his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he gives his judgement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his ſentence for the Truth. To omit other examples; The Kings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Higheſt Powers, which in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our fathers have purged their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from inveterate errours, have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern of thoſe antient Kings and Emperours: as elſewhere we have ſhewed. True it is, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their diligence that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it, there were ſuch circumſtances in thoſe actions, by reaſon whereof that courſe was taken, and no other could ſerve the turn. And we acknowledge that courſe to have been extraordinary, and more ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome taken: but (as before) we ſay, The manner of doing being divers with regard to times and perſons, changeth not the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114767:64"/>right; but floweth from it according to the rules of prudence; Nor doth any one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, a Synod is to be omitted without cauſe, but that ſometimes there may be cauſes for the omiſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe cauſes may be referr'd to two heads; either becauſe a Synod is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or becauſe it appears it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. That both may be the better underſtood, we muſt note the Ends of a Synod in a publick Church; for of this we ſpeak. We have proved already, that a Synod is not called, as if it had any part of the Government belonging to it. <note place="margin">11. Three ends of Synods: yet not neceſſary. Counſell. Conſent. Jariſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The end therefore is, that it may give Counſell to the Prince for the advancement of Truth and Piety, that is, goe before him by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Judgement. Another end is, that by the Synod the Conſent of the Church may be ſetled and made known. So, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apoſtles ſeverally had both knowledge and authority to define the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of Moſaicall Ceremonies, it was 01 for the Churches good, that it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they were all of one mind, and that the pious people ſhould be taught to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth rightly, and to make unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous confeſſion of it. A third end may be added to the former: as Presbyteries in a publick Church, ſo Synods, beſide their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114767:65"/>
                  <hi>native,</hi> have an <hi>adventions</hi> right from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law: whereby they judge of Cauſes, as other Courts ordained by the Higheſt Power; and ſo, that upon their ſentence coaction followes. But now, of all theſe ends none is neceſſary, nor is a Synod ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary to thoſe ends. Counſell is not neceſſary in things manifeſt to any one by naturall or ſupernaturall Light; For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid well, <hi>Wee make uſe of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours in great matters, when we diſtruſt our ſelves, as unable without the help of others to diſcern the Truth.</hi> Who doubts, but the man that denies God, or his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or his Judgement after this life; the man that makes God the proper author of all ſins; the man that denies the Deity of Chriſt, or the Redemption wrought by him; I ſay, who doubts, but a man ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, may be put out of office, or out of the Common-wealth, by the command of the Higheſt Power, without the adviſe of many Counſellours. Again, the Higheſt Power may have ſuch aſſurance out of ſome former Synod, that he need not call a new one. Therefore a Synod is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the end ſufficient Counſell may be had. And as for conſent of the Church to be enquir'd or conſtituted, 'tis in vain ſometimes to take any pains about it, when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114767:65"/>the Church is manifeſtly divided two wayes, the parties and their heat being well night equall, as in the Donatiſts time it happen'd in <hi>Africa.</hi> Sometimes alſo, the conſent of the Church may be known without a Synod: if there be extant the unanimons writings of almoſt all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Doctors in their Churches. Be ſides, every one in private may either by voice or writing declare his opinion, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith was done in his time, and commends it. And he that peruſeth antient ſtory ſhall find the Churches affaires more often tranſacted, and conſent teſtified by communication of Letters, than by Synods: as is obſerved by <hi>Bilſon, Reynolds,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgenſes.</hi> And laſtly, it may be the Cauſe in hand is ſo peculiar to one Church, that the conſent of others is not needfull. Now for the third end of Synods, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Cauſes, it depends upon the will of the Higheſt Power, from whoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it proceeds; although in the ordinary way, inferiour Courts are not paſt by, yet if thoſe Courts be liable to ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the buſineſſe will not bear delay, the Higheſt Power may call it from them to himſelf. We conclude therefore, that which <hi>Whitaker</hi> and others have written before, and the <hi>example</hi> of Free Cities,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114767:66"/>that without a Synod preſerve their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doe confirm: A Synod is not at all times neceſſary, nor in every caſe.</p>

Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not uſefull.</note> So far from neceſſary ſometimes, that it is not profitable; for as the parts are, ſuch is the whole. I will not here repeat the old complaint almoſt of all ages, that the chiefeſt diſtempers of the Church have proceeded from the Prieſts. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath ſaid enough, where he alſo renders the principall cauſes thereof, the Ambition and Pride of Church-men; nor doth hee ſpeak of Arian Synods only, but of all of his time, thoſe eſpecially wherein himſelf was preſent: <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have I withdrawn my ſelf, and ſought for ſecurity of mind in reſt and ſolitude.</hi> This evill will happen if it appear, either that the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgement is hindred by vehement prejudices, (which often befalls men, not malitious:) or that factions are ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that a farther branch may rather bee expected from the Synod, than any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of conſent. I much wonder, what came in ſome mens minds, when they ſaid, They that accuſe another of impiety, <note place="margin">13. Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers may not be Judges in a Synod.</note> may be his Judges alſo in a Synod; and, that the Right of refuſing, which hath place in civill affans, cannot be extended to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall. For certainly, the common
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114767:66"/>Rules, which ariſe out of naturall equity, ought to be of force, no leſſe in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall than other judgements; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Optatus</hi> ſpeaking properly of the Eccleſiaſticall, ſaith, <hi>Judges muſt be ſought, which are not of either party, becauſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is hindred by affection.</hi> In the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the Judges charge the Legats of the Roman B. they ſhould put off the Judges perſon, if they would be the accuſers of <hi>Dioſcorus;</hi> And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> would not come unto the Synods, wherein 'twas manifeſt the adverſe party raigned.

The contrary may alſo happen, that the preſent evill cannot endure the delay of a Synod, and calls for a more compendions remedy. Moreover, the ſame cauſes for which great Aſſemblies are ſuſpected by the Higheſt Power, may alſo have place in Synods;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114767:67"/>for, as a very learned man hath ſaid, <hi>It is not leſſe Politicall, to aſſemble Biſhops, than other Orders of men.</hi> There is the ſame fear, the ſame danger, unleſſe they have put off Humane paſſions, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Paſtors.

Yet I confeſſe, the Church is not in the beſt condition, when Synods cannot be had: and therefore all means is to be uſed, that theſe Aſſemblies may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, or after long omiſſion reſtor'd, whereby the Church ſpeaks both to her Members, and her Governours with moſt convenience. <note place="margin">15. What may ſerve in their ſtead.</note> And yet, even then, when the Higheſt Power governs without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Synod, it hath the judgement of the Church in former Synods; it hath the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall conſent of the moſt famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which flouriſhed in every Age and Nation; it hath the moſt learned and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Divines of the time preſent, both do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick and forraign, whoſe opinions are worthy of an equall regard, eſpecially in points of Doctrine, which is the common

So in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, it was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome for Emperours to commit the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the examination of other Biſhops, for their religion and wiſedome moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and, taking account of them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what in their own diſcretion they jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged beſt. And this is the cauſe why againſt former Synods, other new, and theſe not greater than the former, were ſo often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: not becauſe this Synod by it ſelf was Superiour unto that; but, theſe men had greater credit with the Emperours, than the former. It was but ſeldome, that the Emperours heard all the Cauſe again themſelves: as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> after the Church had judged twice, himſelf exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Gauſe of <hi>Coecilian,</hi> and gave fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Judgement in it.

               <p>It is true in Sacred no leſſe than in other matters, that an <hi>Appeale</hi> ſtrictly taken, which inhibites the execurion of Sentence

For if this be denyed, the King <hi>could not ſcatter away all evill from his throne, Hee could not be a terrour to all evill,</hi> which is his perpetuall office: ſo that the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaid well to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon, If he were not at leiſure to be Judge, Hee ſhould <note place="margin">Dio.</note> not be at leiſure to be King.

The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Of this ſort was the command of <hi>Nebuchodonoſor</hi> the King, that they ſhould be torn in pieces, who were contumelious againſt the true God; and that of <hi>Joſias,</hi> wherby Idolaters were put to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114767:83"/>Death. Relegation alſo belongs to Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So <hi>Solomon</hi> confin'd <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt; without any Council, as the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> well notes; twas indeed for treaſon, but he had as good Right to puniſh him, if the offence had been againſt the Divine Lawes. So the Chriſtian Emperours ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht <hi>Arius, Neſtorius,</hi> and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. <hi>Eſdras</hi> and his aſſociates received Juriſdiction from <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> whereby they puniſhed the obſtinate Jewes with the publication of their goods, and ejection out of the publick Society. The very ſame puniſhment in the Goſpell is call'd <hi>Caſting out of the Synagogue.</hi> For as <hi>Eſdras</hi> had all kind of Juriſdiction by the grant of the Perſian King: ſo by the permiſſion of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Emperours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, the Synedry of the Jewes retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this part of it, with the power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſcourging. We learn out of the Hebrew maſters, that there were three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of caſting out of the Synagogue: by the firſt, <hi>Nidui,</hi> the party was commanded to ſtand off in the Synagogue in a meaner place: by the ſecond, <hi>Cherem,</hi> He was not permitted to appear in the Synagogue, nor any other ſuffer'd to make uſe of him, nor allow him any thing, but to ſuſtain his life in a moſt ſlender manner: the third degree,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114767:83"/>in Chaldee <hi>Scammatha,</hi> was the proper puniſhment of him, who by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had deſerved death, but, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of capitall Judgement being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, could not be put to death: his touch and commerce all men ſhunned. Some ſuch thing ſeems that to be in <hi>Johns</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, <hi>caſting out of the Church,</hi> which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did, that lov'd preeminence, <note place="margin">Ep. 3. v. 10</note> and aſſum'd unto himſelf Dominion.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo a point of Juriſdiction to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any one from the Prieſts Office, which <hi>Joſias</hi> did to the Schiſmaticall Prieſts, only allowing them where with to live. So <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and other Emperours made decrees about the depoſition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Biſhops. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the contumacious Biſhops, and tels them they ſhould be rul'd, by the vertue of Gods ſervant, that is, ſaith he, <hi>my ſelf.</hi> For we muſt note, to the right of the ſword it belongs, not only to eject out of that Office, which flows from the Empire of the Higheſt Power, but from all other Offices of what kind ſoever.</p>

Under which pretence, cannot be excuſed ſeditious Sermons, Which are refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Scripture, and the objections anſwered.</note> they are injurious to the Goſpell, who under the name of the Keyes, cover their popular declamations, wherein they openly traduce the actions of the Higheſt Powers, that are either of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Interpretation, or not at all known, or not certainly; and with much acerbity inveigh againſt them before the common people. This is a way to pleaſe the people, who being naturally jealous of their betters, lend a willing care, and an eaſic faith to ſuch invectives; but 'tis not the way to edifie them. Hence, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that ſeditions follow or, which is the next ſtep to Seditions, the Contempt of the Soveraign; nor without reaſon hath that moſt wiſe writer reckoned, <hi>Deubtfull ſpeeches of the Prince, among the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of popular Tumults.</hi> A wide difference there is, between the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the uſe of the Keyes. The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, being to all, is ſo to be attempered, that it may profit all; and concealing the perſons, aimes only at the vices. It is an evill cuſtome, to turn the Pulpit into a Stage, and the ſweet voice of the Goſpell, into the old reviling Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The antient Romans cenſur'd it as an unworthy thing, <hi>to accuſe any man in ſuch
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114767:93"/>a place, where he might not preſently give in his Anſwer:</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates. But God, by an edict of his Law, hath eſpecially guarded, not the life only, but the fame of the Higheſt Powers, when He ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evill of the Ruler;</hi> Where manifeſtly, we muſt underſtand ſomewhat more to be forbidden, than what is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full toward private perſons; nor is the Law meant of Power abſtractly, or the Ruler only, that governs well. <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that command to the High Prieſt <hi>Ananias,</hi> one that Judged contrary to the Law. <hi>Saul</hi> had grievouſly ſinned; and <hi>Samuel</hi> in the ſeverity of a Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Gods wrath againſt him: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by <hi>Saul,</hi> to honour him before the Elders and the People, and not to leave him, He denies not the requeſt. <hi>Nathan</hi> accus'd not <hi>David,</hi> guilty of Adultery and Murther, before the people, but comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf; as it is credible the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did to <hi>Herod,</hi> when he told him of his fault. So the antient Biſhops and whole Synods, in publick alwayes ſpeak with greateſ Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, even to the Pagan Emperours, and enemies of the Church, and to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> the Patron of Arians. Neither did the Invective Orations againſt <hi>Julian</hi> come forth in publick, till after his deceaſe.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114767:94"/>The Prophets, I confeſſe, being Divinely inſpir'd, did not alwayes obſerve this Rule. And no marvell, ſeeing God, who by the miniſtery of Prophets anointed Kings; who by <hi>Phineas,</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and by others, ſlew whom he pleaſed; and did many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things not allowed to private men; He alſo by the ſame Prophets ſet a mark of publick ignominy upon irregular Princes. For what is more true, than that nien ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially inſpired by God, to fulfill his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, are by him releaſed from the bonds of Law. Wherefore when <hi>Shimei</hi> openly upbraided King <hi>David</hi> with his homicide, <hi>David</hi> to excuſe him found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſay, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.11.</note> but, <hi>It may be the Lord hath bidden him:</hi> intimating thereby, that only one way there was, to juſtifie evill language to the King, if God hath given any one ſome ſpeciall Injunction for it. The Prophets themſelves, when they were accuſed for raiſing ſedition, take their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from nothing elſe, but a peculiar Command they had receiv'd from God. Truly, I doe not find, the Kings were thus traduc'd by the Prieſts, whoſe office was ordinary; <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.20.</note> as for the example of <hi>Zacharias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Joiada,</hi> in the Goſpel, the ſon of <hi>Barachias,</hi> his Speech aymed not at the King, but all the people; and in a common
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114767:94"/>fault, he exhorted all to a common repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, moved thereunto by the Spirit of God. This we know; Chriſt hath granted to them, who have received injury from the Brethren, that, after they had admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the injurious, firſt alone, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few, they might in the laſt place bring the matter to the knowledge of ſome pious Congregation; <note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> Where, by the name 02 of Congregation or <hi>Church,</hi> learned men, and among them the famous <hi>Beza,</hi> not without reaſon, underſtand, not all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the <hi>Synedry;</hi> for, by the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> the word is given to every Company: and in <hi>Moſes,</hi> by, <hi>all the Congregation,</hi> the <hi>Synedry</hi> of the Seventy Elders is ſignified, as <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> have long ſince noted.

Nor is the laſt terme of appealing limited by any Law Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or Divine. Wiſely ſaid the King of <hi>Britaine, in his judgement every Chriſtian King, Prince, and Common-wealth have it in their Power, to preſcribe unto their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that externall forme of Government in Church affairs, which may ſuit beſt with the forme of Civill Government.</hi> And truly, of old, it was ſo done by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours.

Thus in the caſe of the Donatiſts, after a double judgement of Biſhops, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did; who although he approved not the appeale, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not the tryall of it. But this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more rare, and yet not without right, that, if a Synod upon probable cauſes be declined, the Higheſt Power cals the cauſe before it ſelf, and weighing the opinions of moſt eminent Divines, pronounces what is moſt equitable. <note place="margin">Can. 12.</note> The Synod of <hi>Antioch</hi> prohibits him that complains of injury received from a Synod, to trouble
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114767:100"/>the Emperour with the hearing of his Caſe, ſo long as the matter may be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a greater Synod. Yet this takes not from the Emperour the Power to heare the cauſe, if it be brought before him. Moreover, the modeſty of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Biſhops hath attributed Power to Kings, not only to examine the right or wrong of Excommunication, <note place="margin">24. The Higheſt Power may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall and Legal penalties; And judg whether Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee juſt or no.</note> but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don alſo and abate the puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for ſo much as belongs to Poſitive Law. <hi>Ivo Carnotenſis,</hi> a Biſhop, and a ſtout deſender of the Churches right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Kings, was not afraid to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fellow-Biſhops, <hi>that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a certain perſon into Communion, in contemplation of the Kings favour to him, according to the Authority of a Law, that ſaith, whoſoever the King receiveth into grace, and admits unto his Table, the Prieſts and Co gregation muſt not refuſe.</hi> The Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and the Vindicators of the Regall Right, the Judges of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Courts, have often conſtituted and decreed, <hi>that publike Magiſtrates, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that Juriſdiction they exerciſe, are not ſubject unto thoſe Eccleſiaſticall penalties.</hi> So in the Decrees of <hi>Hungary,</hi> of the year 1551. the Eccleſiaſticks are forbidden <hi>to ſend out, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114767:100"/>and permiſſion of his Majeſtie, any ſentence of Excommunication againſt the Nobles of that Kingdome.</hi> And in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Law of the Engliſh it is read, <hi>that none of the Kings Miniſters be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, unleſſe the King be firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it.</hi> Which I ſee the Princes of <hi>Holland</hi> have thought ſit to imitate; for the ſame was promulged by <hi>Charls</hi> the Fift, by his edict in the year 1540. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, ſuch uſe of the Keys as is congruent to Divine Law, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of penance as is conſentancous to the Laws and Canons, the Higheſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are wont to approve. And this is the Imperiall <hi>Anathema</hi> mentioned in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Laws. We conclude, that Chriſtian Powers at this time, doe not innovate, which will not, unleſſe upon cauſes approved by themſelves, ſuffer Excommunication, being joyned with publick ſhame, to proceed unto effect; which by their command inhibit cenſures manifeſtly unjuſt; for it is their Duty, to ſave every one from injury, and to keep the Church from Tyranny.</p>

               <p>REmains that part of Empire, which, as we have ſaid, conſiſteth in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Functions. <note place="margin">1. Two perpetuall functions, of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and Deacons; And their difference.</note> The perpetuall Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Church are two, of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Presbyters, with all the antients, I call them that feed the Church, by preaching of the Word, by Sacraments, by the Keyes; which by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law are individuall. Deacons, which in ſome ſort ſerve the Presbyters, as the Levites did the Prieſts of old. To this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are referr'd the <hi>Readers,</hi> who were in the Synagogues, as the Goſpel and <hi>Philo</hi> ſhew, and were retained in the Church, as appears by Hiſtory, by the Canons, and by the writings of the Fathers. In the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he that keeps the Book is call'd <hi>the Miniſter,</hi> which is even all one with <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con:</hi> and the ſame appellation is given by the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> to the Deacons of of Inferiour degree, which were afterward called <hi>Subdeacons.</hi> But the moſt laborious part of Deaconſhip is about the care of the poore. <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the antient Latin Church tranſlated <hi>Seniors. Deacons,</hi> I think, cannot otherwiſe be ſtil'd, than <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters:</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:114767:101"/>although there be ſome, who, as their manner is in other things, had rather carp at this, than acknowledge it to be true. I am deceiv'd, if <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> did not underſtand both Greek and Latin; yet he, relating the Inſtitutes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, rendring word for word, names them Shee-Miniſters, whom <hi>Paul</hi> entitles Shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and the Church afterward <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coneſſes.</hi> Now, as the Levites could doe nothing, but the Prieſts might do the ſame; ſo is there nothing in the Deacons functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is excepted from the function of the Presbyter: becauſe the Deacons were given to the Presbyters as Aſſiſtants in leſſer matters. Before Deacons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, one of the Apoſtles, <hi>Judus Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> was Treaſurer of the Lords mony; and after him, all the Apoſtles for ſome time diſtributed their allowance among the poor, untill the contention riſen among the Widows, and the greatneſſe of their other employments enforced them to uſe the help of others. And yet, the Inſtitution of Deacons did not ſo acquit the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but they had ſtill the poor under their inſpection. Hence were the Biſhops chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſted with the diſpenſation of the Churches mony, and that with ſo full a Power, as to be unaccountable, but to uſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114767:102"/>part of it for the neceſſities of themſelved and other men, and to deliver part to the Presbyters to be diſpoſed among the poor: <note place="margin">C. 38.40.41. C. 44.</note> as appears in the Canons which are entitled Apoſtolicall, and in the Synod of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Unleſſe the antient Cuſtome had been ſo, in vain had the Apoſtle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Biſhop to be hoſpital; in vain had the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Collections been deliver'd to the Presbyters at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the Conſtitution of Presbyters, <note place="margin">2. Theſe four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Mandate. O dinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Election, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> whoſe function is principall 01 and moſt neceſſary, we muſt note four things that by many writers are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately enough diſtinguiſhed; The firſt is, the faculty it ſelf of preaching, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments, and uſing the Keyes, wich we will call the <hi>Mandate;</hi> a ſecond thing is, the application of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to a certain perſon, which by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived word we will ſtile <hi>Ordination;</hi> a third is, the application of this perſon unto a certain place or Congregation, which is called <hi>Election;</hi> the fourth is that, whereby a certain perſon in a certain place exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Miniſtery under the publick prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and with publick Authority; and let us call this, if you pleaſe, <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is to be diſtinguiſhed from the ſecond. To illuſtrate this with a <hi>Simile:</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:114767:102"/>The Husbands power is from God; the application of that Power unto a certain perſon proceeds from conſent; whereby yet the right it ſelf is not given. For, if it were given by conſent, by conſent alſo might Matrimony be diſſolved, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made that the Husband ſhould not rule over the Wife; which is not true. The Imperiall Power is not in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; therefore they doe not give it: yet they doe apply it to a certain perſon. The Power of life and death is not in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before they joyn together in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; for a private man hath no right unto the Sword: yet by them it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto a Senate, or ſingle perſon. Chriſt, without controverſie, is He from whom that right of Preaching, of exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacraments, and of uſing the Keyes, doth ariſe and receive its vertue. He alſo by his Divine providence, as he preſerves the Church, ſo procures, that the Church may not want Paſtors.</p>
               <p>The ſecond differs as much from the third, as for a Phyſician to be Licenſed to practice Phyſick, and to be choſen Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to ſuch a City: or, for a Lawyer to be admitted to the honour of that Profeſſion, and to be made a Syndic of ſome Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Theſe two have been ever diſtinct,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114767:103"/>and ſometimes ſepatate. The Apoſtles were truly Presbyters, and ſo they call themſelves; for the greater Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the leſſe; yet was not their Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction appropriate to any certain place. The Evangeliſts alſo were Presbyters, but to no place bound. And ſo, long after, was <hi>Pantanus</hi> ordained by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination without a Title.</note> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria; Frumentius,</hi> by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and were ſent to preach the Goſpell through <hi>India;</hi> Which in our time hath been alſo done; and would it were done more carefully. Indeed the 6. Canon of the Synod at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> forbids Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abſolutely, or, <hi>without a title;</hi> but this is not of Divine Law or perpetuall, but poſitive, and ſuch as admits exceptions. The reaſon of the Cannon was, leſt by too great a number of Presbyters the Church ſhall be burdened; or, the Order it ſelf grow cheap, and vile. The <hi>London</hi> Synod excepteth fellowes of Houſes in both Univerſities, and Maſters of Art li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon their own means, and who are ſhortly to undertake ſome cure. If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ordain any other, 'tis at his own perill, to keep them from want, untill they are provided for. Therefore <hi>Election,</hi> that is, aſſignation of a certain place, and <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are not alway joyn'd together, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114767:103"/>when they are, they are not the ſame.</p>
               <p>Which is farther proved, becauſe they that are tranſlated from place to place, muſt be choſen again, but not again ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which they muſt be, if either Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ordination were the ſame, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination a part of Election. Beſides, it will appear that Election was made by men of ſundry ſorts, but Ordination only by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, <note place="margin">4. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, <hi>1 Tim. 5.22.</hi>
                  </note> and antiently by Biſhops only. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the firſt Biſhop of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> gives him Admonition, <hi>That be lay hands on no man ſuddenly.</hi> And the moſt antient Canons entituled Apoſtolical, require, <hi>that a Presbyter be ordained by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, but a Biſhop not without two or three Biſhops.</hi> Which Cuſtome, if ſeems, came from the Hebrews: for the Senators of the Great Synedry could not be ordain'd, but <hi>by three Prieſts;</hi> and that <hi>by impoſition of hands,</hi> as is noted by the Talmudiſts. Without queſtion, this manner was moſt holy, and for the conſervation of ſound Doctrine moſt commodious: when none was admitted to teach the people, but he firſt receiv'd Allowance from the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctors of the ſame Faith. Paſtors therefore ought to ordain Paſtors; nor is this their office, as they are Paſtors of this or that Church, but as Miniſters of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114767:104"/>Church Catholick. For, ſaith <hi>Cyprian, There is but one entire Epiſcopacy, whereof every one is a partaker.</hi> Hence it hath been alwayes held, that the Baptiſm is of force, given by a Presbyter without the limits of his peculiar Charge.</p>
               <p>Nor is it materiall, whether the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on precede the Ordinarion, or be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it; for, when it precedes, it is a conditionate, not plenary Election: which the Canons of later times have called <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. The H. Power hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over it.</note> Over this Ordination the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Power hath an Imperiall inſpection and care. <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Conſtitutions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, <hi>of the Ordination of Biſhops and Clerks;</hi> and other Lawes of others, which preſcribe the age and ſtanding of men to be ordained. Lawes of good uſe, and fit to be reviv'd for the prevention of the Churches ruine, through the rawneſſe and ignorance, and inexperience of her Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: according to that out of the old Poët:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>What loſt your ſtate, founded on ſo good Rules?</hi>

                     <l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth member of our diſtinction, <hi>Confirmation,</hi> differs as much from the third, as the Church conſidered by it ſelf, differs from the Church publick. Tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent here, that <hi>Ezechiah</hi> is read to have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114767:104"/>
                  <hi>Confirmed the Prieſts;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 29.3.</note> that Paſtors are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Lawes and Armes; that ſome Juriſdiction or <hi>Audience</hi> is attributed to them; that Maintenance is aſſigned them, out of the publick, either lands or moneys; that Vacation from civill offices, and in ſome cauſes exemption from the Court of Inferiour Judges is indulged to them. All which ſhewes, that their publick <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is by the favour of the H. Power; as the <hi>Inſtitution of their Office</hi> is from God, their <hi>Ordination</hi> by the Paſtors. Only there remaines to be diſputed their <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is, the Application of the Perſon to the Place, or of the Place to the Perſon.</p>
               <p>That we may handle this queſtion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> we muſt have recourſe to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſet down afore. <note place="margin">6. Right Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Mutable.</note> Some things are of immutable right; other things are juſt and right, untill it be conſtituted otherwiſe. In this later way, not in the former, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Paſtor, in any place whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, belongs to the Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull in that place. That the Election is rightly made by the Church, is proved by the very Law of Nature; for, naturally every Society is permitted to procure thoſe things, which are to their own conſervation neceſſary; in which number, is the Application of Functions.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114767:105"/>So have the Company in a ſhip, a right to chooſe the Maſter Fellow-Travellers their Leader; a free people their King. Whence it follows; <note place="margin">7. How the Election of Paſtors belongs to the Church.</note> if the Divine Law hath not preſcribed a certain way of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as yet no Humane Law thereof is extant, then the Election of their Paſtor pertains unto the Church.</p>
               <p>But he that will affirm this Right to be immutable, muſt evince the immutability, either by the Law of Nature, or by the poſtive Law of God. By the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he cannot: for no reaſon perſuades it, and like examples ſhew the contrary. So, many Nations, who are under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the beſt men, or of hereditary Kings, may not now Elect their King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that which Nature did permit, might be chang'd by Humane Law, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been chang'd. He muſt then have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Poſitive Law, which he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to produce.

                  </note> So, there is another word in the <hi>Acts,</hi> wherein ſome are more ſubtile, than is neceſſary. The Apoſtles are ſaid to have commended the faithfull <hi>Lycaonians</hi> to God, with prayer and faſting, after they had <hi>ordained</hi> them: Presbyters in every Church. This ordaining is expreſſed by a Greek word, in whoſe Etymology ſome have found the ſuffrages of the people. And 'tis true, that both at <hi>Athens</hi> and in the Cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> there was a Cuſtome of giving ſuffrages with the hand ſtretched forth. And if we were delighted with that ſubtilty, 'twere eaſy to interpret the word of the Apoſtolicall Impoſition of hands or Ordination, for he that impoſeth hands muſt needs ſtretch them forth, and the next writers after the Apoſtles uſe the word in this ſenſe. But indeed, neither the Evangeliſts, nor other Greek Authors are ſo curious in their words; yea there is ſcarce any word which hath not enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged its ſignification, beyond the originall meaning. Againe, if <hi>Luke</hi> in this place would have ſignified a popular election, he would not have aſcribed the word, <hi>ordained,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as hoe doth, but to the multitude. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> doe the ſame thing here, which in another place <hi>Paul</hi> would
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114767:108"/>have <hi>Titus</hi> doe, <note place="margin">Til. 1.5.</note> that is, <hi>or daine Presbyters in every City.</hi> That which <hi>Titus</hi> is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe, by the precept of the Apoſtle, the ſame doth the Apoſtle here, being ſo authoriz'd by the Spirit of God, that he needed not the aſſiſtance of the people. Laſtly, the faſting and prayers did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Ordination, but intervened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Valediction; that it is ſtrange, this ſhould be drawn into an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of popular election, when as, if the prayer and faſting of the people had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this were nothing to the purpoſe. For, the people may alſo faſt and pray to God, that the election of a King to be made by the Electors, may be proſperous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; yet are not the people therefore the Electors.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">12. Nor by the precept of avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding falſe Teachers.</note> I have ſeen them, who would aſſert Election to the people by Divine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable right, upon this ground, that the people hath from God a precept to avoid falſe Paſtors. But theſe men doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that this argument, if it have any force, proves Election to be the right not of the multitude only, but entirely of every ſingle perſon. For all, and every one, muſt avoid falſe Paſtors, with all care. And ſo muſt every ſick man take heed of a raſh Phyſician: but no man will therefore ſay,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114767:108"/>that the City Phyſician is to be choſen by the <hi>Plebeians.</hi> This may rightly be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thence, <note place="margin">13.

                  <hi>And let theſe alſo firſt be proved,</hi> where, requiring that to be obſerv'd in Deacons, which was to be obſerv'd in Biſhops, there is no doubt but he would have Biſhops to be proved, eſpecially ſeeing he ſaid afore, that they muſt be <hi>blameleſſe.</hi> Among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> there was a probation of their Princes, the forme whereof was this: <note place="margin">Pollu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So, if a Paſtor were to be elected, it was juſtly granted every one to enquire, what his behaviour was, how married, what his children were, and the reſt which <hi>Paul</hi> would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a Paſtor. This is that in the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon, <note place="margin">Can. 6.</note> Let the name of the ordained be publiſht;</hi> for ſo <hi>Lampridius</hi> hath expreſt it, in the life of <hi>Alexander Severus: When he appointed Governours

For between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and the Reign of <hi>Severus,</hi> are about a hundred years and ten. But this place is ſo far from evincing the Chriſtian Prieſts to have bin choſen by the people, that hence you may rather conclude the contrary. For 'tis one thing to be admitted to prove crimes or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, another thing to elect. <hi>Severus</hi> did propoſe unto the people the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours names: but that they were elected by the Emperour himſelf, no man, that hath read Hiſtory, will doubt. Yea, 'twas needleſſe to propoſe the Prieſts unto the people, if the people did elect them. It is moſt certaine, in the antient Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles age, although by right the people might chooſe their Paſtors, that was not every where obſerv'd, but the people abſtained very often from ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

No man denies them to have been choſen by the people, that is, by the Laity and the Clergy, after the Apoſtles time: but, this to have been of right immutable, no man can affirm. For, to paſſe by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of them that have been conſtituted Succeſſors by the deceaſing, Biſhops; it is a thing of moſt eaſie proof, that Biſhops were very often choſen, either by the Clergy of their City alone, or by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of their Comprovinciall Bb. For the right of the Clergy, the place of St. <hi>Ferom</hi> is remarkable: <hi>At Alexandria, from</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangeleſt, unto</hi> Heracles <hi>and</hi> Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <hi>the Biſhops; the Presbyters alwayes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one to be Biſhop, choſen out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and placed in a higher degree.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114767:111"/>Elections were permitted, either to the Clergy alone, or chiefly to them; for ſo leſſe evill would befall the Churches: yet withall he ſhewes, this was not obſerv'd in his time, but the ſuffrages of the richeſt and moſt potent men, yea, the Votes of the people too, had the ſtroke in Elections. But, the Election made by the Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Biſhops is approved by the great <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, <note place="margin">Can. 4.</note> without any mention of the people. Whereunto agrees the <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian,</hi> adding this, <note place="margin">Can. 19.</note> If any contradicted ſuch Election, the ſuffrages of the greater part of Biſhops ſhould carry it. Yet I deny not, in many places, even in the time of theſe Synods, the people alſo had their Votes: but the cuſtome was not univerſall. It was free, untill the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was confirmed by an Univerſall Councill: the xii. Canon whereof, following the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> and <hi>Antiochian,</hi> gives the right of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to the Comprovinciall Biſhops: the xiii. expreſly takes away all Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Elections from the multitude. <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> alſo hath excluded the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Election of Biſhops, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it namely to the Clergy, and the prime men of the City.

Of this judgementa alſo, they muſt needs be, whoſoever have transferred the Election to the Presbytery; for, were it of Divine and immutable right that the Multitude ſhould Elect, the election could not be transferred to the Presbytery, more than to any others. Neither were the Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of any value, which we read was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made concerning Election, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Divine Precept, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people muſt chooſe the Paſtor; for that ſentence, <hi>What a man doth by another, bee ſeems to doe by himſelf,</hi> pertains only to

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:114767:113"/>in the beſt order, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. But in all things of this nature, thoſe generall rules remaining ſafe, wee have demonſtrated afore, Legiſlation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Higheſt Power. <hi>Bullinger,</hi> a man of a very ſharp judgement, is of the ſame mind, who having alleged many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of popular Election, inferrs thus; <note place="margin">L. 2. de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſc.

                  <hi>Yet I will not thence conclude, that the right of electing Biſhops, is to be reduced to the promiſcuous Votes of the common people; for, whether it be better, that the Biſhop be deſign'd, at the meeting of the whole Church, or by the ſuffrages of a few, no right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution can be preſcribed to all Churches: for ſeverall Countries have ſeverall Laws, Cuſtomes, and Inſtitutes. If any in whom the right is, abuſe it by Tyranny, they are compelled into order by the Holy Magiſtrate, or the right of deſigning Miniſters may be transferr'd from them to others: for it is ſufficient, that ſome Elders performe that office of Electing, upon command of the King or Magiſtrate, by the adviſe and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of men who underſtand what the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Biſhop is; what is the condition of that Church or People, over which a Paſtor is to be appointed; who alſo can judge of the endowments, the learning and manners of every one.</hi> By this right, <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> as we

The Lawes of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and other Kings, are extant, containing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes of Electing, ſo that <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaid moſt truly, <hi>The form of Election is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by pious Princes.</hi>

We ſay, with the excellent <hi>Marſilius Patavinus, The Law-giver or Prince is not, by any Law of God, prohibited from the Inſtitution, Collation, or Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eccleſiaſticall offices.</hi> Whoſoever affirm the contrary, doe accuſe of impiety, innumerable pious Princes of antient and of this age; which truly is a point of great temerity, when no Divine Law can be produced to prohibit it, as hath been abundantly by others, and by us in ſome part demonſtrated. Although this might ſuffice (for whatever is not circumſcrib'd by Divine Law, is within the ſphere of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114767:114"/>Higheſt Power:) yet, for the deſending of our ſentence, both reaſons and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are in readineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">20. This proved by reaſon;</note> The firſt reaſon is taken hence, that all actions, even thoſe that naturally belong to others, not having cauſes determined by nature, we ſee are rightly exerciſed by the H. Power. Naturally men chooſe teachers for their children, and give them Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſick perſons make uſe of what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician they pleaſe; Merchants elect the Curators of their Company: Yet in many places, Guardianſhip is appointed by Law alone, or the will of the Magiſtrates; Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are conſtituted by publick Order, and Informers of Youth too, with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of others from the practice of thoſe faculties; and to the Commanies of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are fit Curators alſo appointed by the Higheſt Power, without blame of any any, But, if this right be competent to the Higheſt Power, over thoſe things, which did belong to every one, much more over thoſe things that belong unto the People; becauſe, the power of the people is devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon it, as all men know, that have any knowledge of the Lawes. That ſometimes there may be juſt cauſes, why the H. Power ſhould challenge to it ſelf the Election of Paſtors, no wiſe man will deny. For often
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114767:114"/>errours introduced into the Church againſt the word of God, cannot be rooted out by other means; often, there is no other way to avoid Schiſm; often, the ſuffrages of the Clergy are diſturb'd with factions, popular election with ſeditions; whereof are extant many examples, even of the purer times. Adde in the laſt place, that the times are now and then ſo boiſterous, that the King will hardly keep the Crown upon his head, except hee have a care, the Paſtors may be moſt obedient and faithfull to him. Verily, all Hiſtories doe witneſſe, how dearly the German Emperours paid for their abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Imperiall Right.</p>

Hence, is <hi>Jeroboam</hi> juſtly blam'd,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114767:115"/>for chooſing Prieſts who were not Levits, for the Law did not allow it; nor was it in the King, to command Sacrifices to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, in any place but the accuſtomed, which, after <hi>David,</hi> was <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Other Functions, or the places for them, the King might aſſigne to the Prieſts and Levits. So were ſome Levits appointed by <hi>David</hi> for preaching, others for ſinging. And, that there ſhould be Singers with Harps and other Inſtruments, was God's precept by the Prophets: as the application of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the ſeverall offices is every where attributed to <hi>David,</hi> under the name of King; and after <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Solomon:</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> the King, not the Prophet, by name electeth Prieſts and Levits, whom he might ſend forth to the Cities of <hi>Juda</hi> to inſtruct them.

                  </note> But let us proceed with the Chriſtians. Before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> no man will wonder that no Chriſtian Paſtors were elected by the Emperours, when the Emperours ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were enemies to the Church, or had it in contempt, and accounted it not worthy of their care. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gave the force of a Law to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon, of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made by Biſhops, other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours after him did the like, either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Canon, or not abrogating of it. And, 'tis manifeſt, this manner of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was long in uſe; the Empire being of greater extent, than that the Emperours diligence could provide for all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Notwithſtanding this, it was lawfull for the Emperours, if they pleaſed, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by themſelves. For, ſeeing it is from the Higheſt Power, that the Canon hath the force of a Law, no marvell, if the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114767:116"/>Higheſt Power, upon juſt cauſes, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from that Law, either in the whole, or in ſome particular caſe. For Lawes are wont either to be abrogated, or temper'd and limited by the Law-givers, as afore is ſhewed. Yea, there is no need of abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſolution of the Law, when as the Lawyers agree in this, that, by the generall words in the Law ſet down, the right of the Higheſt Power is never conceiv'd to be excluded. 'Tis true, the Examples of Elections made by Biſhops prove, it is not neceſſary that Elections be made by the Higheſt Power; the Canons alſo ſhew, the ſame Elections are rightly made by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with conſent of the Higheſt Power: but neither of theſe is in queſtion. The Queſtion is, whether it be alſo lawfull for the Higheſt Power to make Election. That it is lawfull, we have the judgement of the beſt, both among the Emperours and the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople, Theodoſius</hi> commanded the names of all that were propoſed ſhould be given to him in papers, reſerving to himſelf the choyce of one. What can be more clear? One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Biſhops propos'd <hi>Nectarius:</hi> the Emperour makes choiſe of him, and perſiſteth in it, againſt the will of many
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114767:116"/>Biſhops; who, ſeeing the Emperour would not be remov'd, give place, and yeild him that reverence, which was due unto him, in a matter not prohibited by Law Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. Who ſees not, this was done beſide the Canons? for according to the Canons, the Emperour had no ſhare in the Election, but here the Emperour alone electeth, that is, deſigns the perſon. The Biſhops, as alſo the Clergy and people, approve of the Election. But, 'tis one thing to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> another to <hi>approve</hi> of the Election. The Biſhops approve, becauſe it was their Office, after Baptiſme, to impoſe hands upon <hi>Neitarius,</hi> as yet a lay man and Catechumen. And hert too, we obſerve, the Canon was not followed: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons, a Catechumen, nor Neophite, could not be elected. The Clergy alſo, and the people doe approve: becauſe to them belong'd the <hi>Tryal,</hi> which, how far it differs from Election is ſhew'd above.</p>
               <p>Many examples we might alleage, of Elections not Cunonicall, but Imperiall. Why the Emperours themſelves elected. we deny not they had peculiar cauſes; but this pertains not to the queſtion of right, but prudence. Certainly, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours believ'd it to be lawfull for them,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114767:117"/>before they conſider'd whether or no, it were expedient. For of things unlawfull, there ought to be no conſultation. <note place="margin">23. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections anſwer'd.</note> To ſay the cauſe hereof was ſome Divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or inſpiration, in ſuch an age of the Church, is a meer refuge of pertinacious ignorance: to ſay, the Domination of the Roman Biſhops, was the cauſe of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall elections, when as yet that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy was not turn'd into temporall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, is to be quite miſtaken in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of times. Nor yet can wee doubt, but the more Sanctimony abated in the Clergy, and Obedience was ſlackned in the people, the more juſt cauſe had the Higheſt Powers to vindicate Election to themſelves. In the Weſt, that Biſhops were moſt often, and for a long time, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the moſt Chriſtian Kings of <hi>France,</hi> without any ſuftrage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Clergy, is written in all the French Hiſtories, as it were with Sun-beams. What was ſaid of the Domination of the Roman Biſhops, as if he had given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Kings to draw to themſelves the Elections, beſides that it is before anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, cannot be applyed to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> and to thoſe times, when the French Kings did not yet poſſeſſe <hi>Italy.</hi> Yea, on the contrary, becauſe the French
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114767:117"/>Kings uſed this right in their own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, therefore alſo in <hi>Italy</hi> did <hi>Charls</hi> the great aſſume this to himſelf, that hee might not with leſſe power governe <hi>Italy,</hi> than <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> For, it is moſt truly obſerved by <hi>Godalſtus</hi> and others, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made in Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> time, pertains only to the Italian Biſhops, when in other parts, the compleat right of Election was in <hi>Charls</hi> before. In vaine alſo, a recourſe is had to the wealth of Biſhop-pricks, &amp; the Temporall Juriſdictions annexed to them; for even in the times of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, and much more in the antient and purer times, Biſhopricks were but poor and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as is noted by that moſt ſearching An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, <hi>Onuphrius.</hi> And for Juriſdictions, the Biſhops, in <hi>Charls</hi> his time, had none an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their Biſhopricks: but this came into uſe at laſt, after the avulſion of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>Ottoes</hi> were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peronrs in <hi>Germany.</hi> And, the Juriſdictions were ſo far from being the cauſe of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Elections, that, on the contrary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were Juriſdictions granted unto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, becauſe the Emperours were moſt aſſured of their fidelity, being choſen by themſelves, and thought the cuſtody of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might therefore moſt ſafely bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them: as the ſame <hi>Onuphrius</hi> hath

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114767:118"/>power, which is ſignified by the ſtaffe. For to the King himſelf alſo, when he was firſt conſecrated, together with the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was wont to be given a ſtaffe. <note place="margin">L. 5. c. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>And by this,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aimonius, the defence of the Churches, that is, a power to maintaine Religion, was deliver'd to him from God;</hi> for the Offices correſponded to the ſigns: as alſo a Canon was veſted by a Book. Many ages after, when piety had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten opulency, and the daughter laid a ſnare for the mother, the Emperours, almoſt detruded from their moſt antient right, began to ſhew the indignity of the thing, by this argument among the reſt, becauſe the Biſhops by their munificence poſſeſſed Lands and territories. But never did the Election of them depend upon this alone, being more antient than the ſame muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. Moreover, the acceſſory cannot have ſo much force, as to draw the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall after it: and befides, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at this time, ſtipends out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſucceed in place of Lands: and for all this the right of the Higheſt Powers remaineth the ſame it was. Therefore, by the name of <hi>Inveſtiture,</hi> in the ſtories of thoſe times, is not to be underſtood a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſign; nor are Kings to be thought ſo unwiſe, that, for a bare rite or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114767:119"/>they would have undertaken ſo many labours, and ſo many wars: but, with the ſign, or by the ſign, the thing ſignified muſt be conceived, that is, the Collation of Churches. Which Collation, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, was made two wayes: for, either the Kings by themſelves, made Election freely, and without the ſuffrages of any other, or elſe, they granted others the right of clecting, the right of approving, not imaginary, but with a liberty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null the Election, being reſerved to them, ſelves. Both of theſe, Hiſtorians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in the name of <hi>Inveſtiture.</hi> Which right remained in the Emperours untill the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who firſt laid violent hands upon it. <hi>Onuphrius Panuinus</hi> relating his life; <hi>He firſt of all the Roman Biſhops attempted to deprive the Emperour, not only of the election of the Pope himſelf, which alſo</hi> Adrian <hi>the third had ſometimes done; but of all Authority too, whereby he Conſtituted the other Prelats, to wit, the Biſhops and Abbats.</hi> The Author here hath rightly explan'd Inveſtiture by the name of Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two things, whereof we ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture conſiſteth, that is, the power of chooſing, and the Liberty of refuſing, if the Biſhop were choſen by any other, all
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:114767:119"/>writers approved for their diligence in this kind, have very well diſtinguiſhed, and knit together in the Regall Right. Such a liberty of refuſing I meane, which is not ſubject to the judgement of another, And indeed theſe Rights, both of election, and of rejection, are of great conſequence to maintaine both Church and State: but the former, of ſo much the greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by how much it is more to oblige, the receiver of a benefit, than to exclude, an enemy. <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> when he had declared how that right was extorted from the Emptrour <hi>Henry:</hi>

               <p>Whoſoever therefore, dares to condemn of Sacrilege, ſo many famous Kings, ſome whereof, firſt in their Kingdoms profeſſed the Chriſtian faith; ſome couragiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Popes ambition; ſome either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or promoted the Churches reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and among them many renowned for their holineſſe and learning: whoſoever, I ſay, <note place="margin">26.

Now, whereas ſome, in this buſineſſe of Election, diſtinguiſh the other Paſtors from the Biſhops, becauſe indeed themſelves live where no Biſhops are, this difference comes to nothing. For ſuch Paſtors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have this common with mere Presbyters, that they are not over others; yet have they thus much of Biſhops, that they are not under other Paſtors; and ſo 'tis doubtfull, whether they may be rather numbred among mere Presbyters, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Moreover, ſeeing Presbytery is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Epiſcopacy, they that beſtow the Biſhoprick, do withall beſtow the Paſtoral cure of a certain place or City, &amp; ſomthing more: ſo that, the Argumentation rightly proceeds, as from the greater to the leſſe, or rather from the whole to the part. 'Tis
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:114767:121"/>true, the antient Emperours &amp; Kings mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves but little with the collation of Paſtorall offices of inferiour degree; the reaſon was, becauſe they thought in reaſon, all that leſſer care might be rightly comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Biſhops, choſen either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or according to their Lawes. And therefore, in the moſt antient Canons, you ſhal hardly find anything of the Presbyters election, becauſe all that buſineſs was at the Biſhops diſpoſe as we have ſhewed before.</p>

Theſe examples, although they be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, are yet ſufficient to refell thoſe, who have adventured publickly to affirm, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, untill the very laſt times of the War, were choſen by the People.

And I, for my part, cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how it comes to paſſe, that the ſame right doth not ſtill endure to this day: whether it be expedient, or where, and how farre it is expedient, is another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The States, in my opinion, by their pains taken in the Reformation, have not deſerved to be in worſe condition, then before they were. In the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the Paſtorall Cures are conferred by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a Senate, which by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, and in the name of the Elector, hath govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches.

In the beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were content with this Call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114767:122"/>It is the Saying of <hi>Muſculus:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Loc. Com. de Elect.</note> 
                  <hi>A Chriſtian Paſtor ought not to be ſollicitous about his Call, nor to doubt that it is Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and lawfull, where he is called to preach the Goſpell, by the pious Magiſtrate or Prince.</hi> Wherefore the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches doth not deprive the Powers of this Divine Right. Neither have the States themſelves ever been of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother judgement; for, when in the year 1586, without the aſſent of the States, a Synod was held, the Earle of <hi>Leſter,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of theſe parts, to move the States to allow of the Synod, declared <hi>Nov.</hi> 16.

               </p>
               <p>Let us now give anſwer to the reſt of the Objections, uſed to be brought againſt the Higheſt Powers in this regard. Some ſay, <note place="margin">28. The Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the abuſe of Right, anſwered.</note> that certain Kings and Princes have abuſed the Elections, either through a ſordid love of gain, or through too much favour. It
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114767:123"/>is too true; but to the determination of the queſtion, 'tis impertinent; for, the abuſe of right depriveth no man of his right; unleſſe perhaps a ſubject, by the ſentence of his Superiour; much leſſe, is a poſſible abuſe ſufficient to the loſſe of right. Then, no man ſhall bee certain of any right whatſoever. But to ſpeak the truth, there is a greater number of laudable Elections, which Kings have made. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by popular Elections, the matter often was brought unto Seditions and ſlaughters, to Sword and fire; nor is the Clergy alwayes free from favour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, no not at this day. So that, if for fear of incommodities Elections may be overthrown, no kind thereof will be able to ſubſiſt. When <hi>Genebrard,</hi> an enemy to the Regall right, had ſaid, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> choſen by the Emperours were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of men, the contrary was ſhewed by our ſide, that they were good men, at leaſt in ſome mediocrity; <note place="margin">Rainold. 187.</note> but from the Election of the Clergy and People came forth Monſtces in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Moreover, the Greatneſs of the Higheſt Powers yields not to corruption ſo eaſily, as private men, nor is ſo obnoxious to unjuſt deſires and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Suters. Laſtly, Ordination, which remains with the Paſtors, and the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:114767:123"/>right of contradicting, which is left unto the people, ſhuts up the way, if not to all, which exceeds Humane Power, yet to the worſt abuſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">29. The Canons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> The Canons are objected too, and ſome Sayings of the Fathers. That old Canon, which is the 30. in their number entitled Apoſtolicall, ſpeaks of Magiſtrates, not of Emperours; and as the Canon next before is oppos'd to nundinations, ſo this to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent intruſions. The Canon pertains to them, that being not lawfully examin'd and ordain'd invade the Church by force, by the Magiſtrates help and favour. So, the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Synod diſapproves not Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but Ordination by the King; nor all the Kings Authority, but that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of the Metropolitan and Comprovinciall Biſhops, to whom the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination did belong. For King <hi>Charibert</hi> himſelf, under whom this Synod was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, elects <hi>Paſcentius</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> whom the Comprovincials re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, as rightly choſen. And if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non bear another ſenſe, yet is it nothing to the purpoſe. For, if it was made by the Kings conſent, it might be reſcinded, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelf, or by other Kings alſo, eſpecially with the ſentence of their Peers: becauſe no poſitive Lawes are immutable;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114767:124"/>but, if without the Kings conſent, then neither had that Canon the force of a Law, nor could the Regall right be impair'd thereby. This is certain, ſince the Kings began to Elect Biſhops, many Synods have been held in <hi>France,</hi> and not any one of them hath reprehended the Kings in that reſpect, but many have admoniſhed the King, to uſe that ſtudy and care in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Paſtors, which was meet. Whence it is evident, the <hi>Gallican</hi> Biſhops never found any thing in that Election, contrary to the Lawes Divine. 'Tis very improper for our men, to produce the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> ſecond Synod, whereby the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images was introduced. And yet, the meaning of the Canons alleged thence, is no other, then of thoſe we have already anſwer'd. That ſharp ſpeech of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> is alleged alſo; Who having received moſt grievous injuries, if he had uttered any thing, not ſo generally true, as accommodated to thoſe times, what marvell is it? ſeeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers too, have let fall many words, which will not bear a rigid Examination. Yet doth not <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> how hot ſoever in this cauſe, pretend any right Divine, but enquires, <hi>Where is that Canon, that a Biſhop ſhould be ſent out of the Palace?</hi> He ſhews,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:114767:124"/>what <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had done, was not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall: and rightly; for another way of Electing was then in uſe, and that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and by the Precepts of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Now, although for juſt cauſes, it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Kings, to recede from the Canon; yet to forſake the Canon, with intention of promoting to Epiſcopacy the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Arrian party, was not the part of a pious Emperour. This way of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the more juſtly reprehended, if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination alſo being omitted, Biſhops were obtruded upon the Churches: which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credible to have been done; for it was not probable, the Orthodox would ordain Arians, or ſuch as uſed Colluſion with them. Verily, not any one of the Fathers hath hitherto been found, who ſaid, there was any Divine Law to hinder the King from chooſing the Paſtor. It appears, the moſt holy Biſhops above mentioned, who condiſcended to the Election made by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> were of another mind. And thus much be ſpoken of the Higheſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers embracing the true Religion.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114767:125"/>defence of the Church from the enemies of the Church. And, ſuppoſe the matter ſhould ſucceed moſt happily, yet would it be an indecorum, that the Affaires of the Church ſhould be <hi>judged before the unjuſt,</hi>

Notwithſtanding, if Infidel Kings will not at all admit any Paſtor or Biſhop, except <hi>Elected</hi> by themſelves, and in the mean time leave to the Church the <hi>Probation,</hi> and to other Paſtors the <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands,</hi> I cannot think it convenient for Chriſtians, to refuſe men, otherwiſe fit, for this only reaſon, becauſe they are commended by Infidels. For the good God doth effect his good work, even by evill men. I am not a man of that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I dare condemn ſo many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches in <hi>Thrace,</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which doe receive Patriarchs or leſſer Biſhops from the King of the Turks; and that this patience of the Chriſtians is no new thing, is ſhewed by <hi>Barlaamus Cyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis.</hi> Clearly, 'tis better to entertain a worthy Paſtor, adorned with good report of the common People, ordained by other Paſtors, from the hand of a Prince, though
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:114767:125"/>an unbeliever, then to ſuffer the waſt of Churches. <hi>Eſdras,</hi> we are ſure, did not decline the office of reſtoring Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, impoſed on him by the Pagan King <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, that we may return unto our own, that is, unto Chriſtian Powers (for that was aſperſed on the by, to give others oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of better thoughts upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) we muſt advertiſe the Reader, that in all this Treatiſe, we enquire what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not what is at every time expedient. For, whether we reflect upon antient or later times, we ſhall ſee great variety in the manner of election: nor only through ages and Provinces, but through years and particular Cities. So much uncertainty there is in that, which the Law Divine hath left uncertain. And truly, <note place="margin">31. The beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> where the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not of the right, but of the beſt manner of Election, 'tis marvellous how many things may probably be diſcourſed on every part. Give me <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and thoſe of his time, there will be no fear of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar election. Give me the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, I would gladly aſcribe the election unto Biſhops. Give me ſuch Emperours as <hi>Theodoſius, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> there will be no danger in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Regall or Imperiall. But we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len

Which right, not only the French Kings, but alſo the antient Roman Emperours very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have uſed, as is moſt eaſie to be proved.</p>
               <p>They do much erre, who confound this will and pleaſure of the H.

For, here is a wide difference. The pleaſure of the Higheſt Powers is over the Election; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates conſent is a part of the election.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:114767:126"/>That agrees to the Higheſt Powers, as ſuch; this to the Magiſtrates, by Poſitive Law; nor properly as Magiſtrates, but as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured part of the City. Therefore the Election by the Magiſtrates ſtayes within the bounds of their City; but Emperours and Kings exerciſe their right, not only in Cities which they dwell in, and whoſe Churches they frequent; but, if they ſee it needfull, through all places of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Again, the Magiſtrates may be overcome with ſuffrages, the Higheſt Power cannot. Certainly, although the election be permitted to others, that right of free approbation cannot ſafely be abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Him that rules in Chiefe. Alſo, <note place="margin">33. And of exaucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, if need be.</note> after Election made, the right of removing a certain perſon from the Miniſtry of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, although it may be in others too, ought alwayes to remain in the Higheſt Power. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ejected <hi>Abiath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The proof whereof is eaſie. For if the Higheſt Power hath right to interdict any one the City or Province, hee muſt needs have a right alſo to interdict him, the Miniſtry of this City or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For this is included in that: and, in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:114767:127"/>whoſe Power the whole is, in his power the part cannot chooſe but be. Nor only may the Higheſt Power doe this by way of puniſhment, but by way of caution too: to wit, if any Paſtor be drawn by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into matter of tumult, which perhaps may come to paſſe without his fault. For, unleſſe the Higheſt Power could doe this, the Common-wealth were not ſufficient to ſecure it ſelfe.</p>

For, although the right or manner of regiment ſomewhat differs, thence wil follow no divulſion of the Churches, as long as neither part aſcribes to their own way, the authority of Divine precept. And this is the prihcipall cauſe, why we have taken ſo much pains to ſhew, That manner of Election, which Kings and ſome pious Princes do at this time uſe, is not by Divine Law forbidden. Not, that we propoſe their examples to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by others: for, other kinds of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be either by themſelves more profitable, of at leaſt to the diſpoſition of the people, and ſtate of ſome churches more fit; or elſe, if for no other cauſe, for the antient cuſtome ſake, to be preferr'd: but, that we may not, by a temerarious cenſure, alienate from us the Kings, and the Churches too, by whom that manner is obſerv'd.

               <p>Now, the principall Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Proteſtants, is about the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall eminence, and about their office, who being not Paſtors, that is, neither preach, nor adminiſter the Sacraments, yet are Aſſeſſors, <note place="margin">3.

It is certain, there were degrees of Prieſts among the Heathens; that the Cuſtom was not new to the Grecians, and ſuch as ſprang from Greece, we learn by the moſt antient diſcipline of the <hi>Druids, One,</hi> ſaith <hi>Coeſar, is Preſident to the</hi> Druids, <hi>who hath amongſt them the chief Authority.</hi> And how antient the Emmence of Mother Cities, in matters of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114767:136"/>Religion, is, we learn out of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Corcyreans,</hi> a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> upon which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the old Scholiaſt notes, <hi>It was the Cuſtome to receive High Prieſts from the Metropolis.

Who, although in ſome acts hee was a Type of Chriſt, yet the whole Inſtitution of this Pontificate, is not to be referr'd to this end alone. This eminence of one Prieſt, ſerved for Order alſo, as well as the Regall Power, which did alſo, in its way, adumbrate Chriſt. Although then, this example might ſuffice; yet to me, the Conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not ſo much expreſſed, according to the pattern of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as of the Synagogues. For the Synagogues were, in many places, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Power; as neither the Church of Chriſt hath any by it ſelf. Adde hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that whereſoever the Apoſtles came, they found Synagogues well enough orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114767:137"/>even from the times if the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an diſperſion: which, if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Faith of Chriſt, (as to them the Goſpel was Preached before others) there was no cauſe, why they ſhould depart from that Government, that the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many ages did commend: nor was it any burden to the Gentiles, in ſuch a matter, to accommodate themſelves to the Jewiſh inſtitutions. Now in every Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, it is certaine, there was one, who by the Greekiſh Jews was call'd the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Synagogue:</hi> which name occurs frequently, both in the Goſpell and the <hi>Acts;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lu. 8.41.</note> and every where the Prince of the Synagogue is deſigned by it.

Wherefore in that one place the Paſtors joyned to the chiefe of the Synagogue are call'd <hi>the Rulers.</hi> So, in the new Teſtament of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the High Prieſt, with thoſe next unto him, are called the <hi>chief Prieſts,</hi> and in

The Hiſtory of all times proclaims it: but I will againe uſe him for my witneſſe, who in all Antiquity was the leaſt friend of Biſhops, that is, <hi>Jerom: In the whole world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it was decreed, that for the taking away of Schiſms and diviſions, one being elected from among the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhould be ſet above the reſt.</hi> In another place. <hi>The Churches ſafety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the dignity of the chiefeſt Prieſt, that is, the Biſhop: to whom if there be not given a Superiour power over all the reſt, there will be made ſo many Schiſms in the Church, as there be Prieſts.</hi> Nor is it any thing elſe, which <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcate: <hi>Whence have Schiſms and Hereſies ariſen, and doe ſtill ariſe in the Church, but while the Biſhop which is one, and the Governour of the Church, by the proud preſumption of ſome men is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> And elſewhere: <hi>Hereſies have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Firſt, <hi>The Epiſcopall eminence is not of Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> This is prov'd enough, becauſe the contrary is not prov'd. For Chriſt is no where read to have commanded it. Indeed, he approv'd it in the Apocalyps: but it follows not, Becauſe he did approve it, Therefore he did command it. Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is of Apoſtolicall inſtitution, becauſe it appears, in ſome Churches Biſhops were ordained or approved by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: but the Apoſtles never comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſuch Biſhops ſhould be in every Church. By which diſtinction, we ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Jeroms</hi> caſe from the caſe of <hi>Aerius.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:114767:138"/>Jerom</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Biſhops became greater than the Presbyters, by cuſtome rather than by the Lords diſpoſe:</hi> As alſo <hi>Auſtin, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy is greater than Presbytery, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the titles of honour which the Church hath uſed.</hi> When the Fathers ſpeak of Cuſtome, they exclude not Apoſtolicall inſtitution; yea, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Epiſt. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>What is obſerv'd in the Univerſall Church, nor is inſtituted by Councils, but hath bin alwaies kept, is moſt rightly believ'd, to have been deliver'd by no leſſe Authority than Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall.</hi> But, as we have elſewhere ſaid, it is not preſently of Divine precept, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is inſtituted by the Apoſtles; for many things are inſtituted, with reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Liberty to make a change. That the people ſhould with a clear voice ſay <hi>Amen</hi> at the end of prayers. That the Preacher ſhould be uncover'd, was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the Apoſtolicall Church: Which in many places now, we ſee, is not obſerved. Moreover, the Apoſtles ſo appointed Biſhops, that they left cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churches without Biſhops: as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> acknowledges, <hi>There was need of Presbyters and Deacons; for by theſe two the Eccleſiaſticall Offices may be compleat; but where none was found worthy of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, the place remain'd without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:114767:139"/>but, where was need; and they were worthy of the Epiſcopacy, Biſhops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> Thoſe Churches therefore, as <hi>Jerom</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>were govern'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counſell of the Presbyters.</hi>

Not alwaies one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City.</note> This we ſhall adde in the ſecond place, <hi>It was not univerſally obſerv'd that one Biſhop ſhould be over every City.</hi> Of the Apoſtles time, we ſuppoſe it is already prov'd. And afterward, more Biſhops than one were in the ſame City, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Jews, who had as many chief Rulers as they had Synagogues; but in one City often times were many Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, or (as <hi>Philo</hi> cals them) <hi>Proſeuche,</hi> places of prayer. <note place="margin">Acts 6.9.18.8.17.</note> So, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was one Synagogue of <hi>Libertines,</hi> another of the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> a third of the <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And at <hi>Corinth,</hi> about the ſame time, were named two chief Rulers of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Soſthenes. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> declares, it was inſtituted firſt at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> that in the whole City ſhould be but one Biſhop. At laſt in the VIII. Nicene Canon, we ſee it was defin'd, <hi>That there ſhould not be two Biſhops in any City:</hi> yet ſo, that withall it appears, the Canon was ſometimes diſpenc'd with. For, the Canon permits, that Biſhops returning from the Sect of the <hi>Cathari,</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:114767:139"/>Church, ſhould retein Epiſcopall honour, next to the Catholick Biſhop. So, the <hi>Epheſin</hi> Synod, after the Election of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> grants that honour to <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> as appears by an Epiſtle to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Pamphilia:</hi> and, in the conference before <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> the Catholicks offer the ſame unto the Donatiſts, if they would returne unto Communion; <hi>Every one of us, receiving an aſſociate of his honour, may ſit with greater eminence, the peregrine Biſhops ſitting by as a Collenge.

Which, although <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith 'twas done through ignorance of the Canons, appears yet to have been a thing not unheard of afore, much leſſe believ'd repugnant to the Law Divine. Moreover, the Epiſcopall Chairs, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities, were often void, not for ſome months only, but many years together; all which time, <hi>The Churches,</hi> that I may againe ſpeak with <hi>Jerom, were govern'd by the Common Counſell of the Presbyters:</hi> or, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Annoch.</note> 
                  <hi>The Presbyters fed the flock, untill God ſhould ſhew them one to governe them.</hi> To the Roman Clergy, we ſee, <hi>Cyprian</hi> wrote many Letters, and the Clergy anſwer'd him, concerning all things pertaining to the State of the

Furthermore, all the antients doe confeſſe, there is no act, except Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo proper to the Biſhop, but it may be exercis'd by the Presbyter. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> are very clear in this point.

Synod of <hi>Carthage: When a Presbyter is ordain'd, the Biſhop bleſſing him, and holding his hand upon his head, let all the Presbyters alſo, that are preſent, hold their hands upon his head, by the Biſhops hand.</hi> For the confirmation hereof, I dare not bring that of <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the <hi>laying on of hands of the Presbytery,</hi> becauſe I perceive, <hi>Jerom, Ambroſe,</hi> and other antient, and, the Prince of all recent writers, <hi>Calvin,</hi> interpret Presbytery in that place, not the <hi>conſiſtory,</hi> but the <hi>Office</hi> to which <hi>Timothy</hi> was promoted.

                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:114767:140"/>as <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Diaconacy,</hi> to bee names of Offices.

In the meane time, I doe not ſee, how this can be refelled, (even among the Schoolmen, <hi>Antiſiodorenſis</hi> long ſince granted it:) where Biſhops are not, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination may be rightly made by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. For, the things that are obſerved for order ſake, admit exceptions. So, in the antient Councill of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it is permitted Presbyters in caſe of neceſſity, <hi>to reconcile penitents:</hi> and in another place, <hi>to lay hands on the Baptized.</hi> Moreover, as we have ſaid above, it is doubtfull, whether Presbyters, that neither have Presbyters under them, nor a Biſhop o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, are neerer to Biſhops or more Presbyters. For, of <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> argues thus, <hi>He that had not an other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him was a Biſhop.</hi> And, we know, (to take an inſtance in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) many things are lawfull for a Senate having not a King, which to a Senate under a Kings Power, are unlawfull.

But verily, never did Eccleſiaſtical ambition, from the Apoſtles age unto thoſe times, advance to ſuch a hight, as it hath done ſince thoſe times, to the memory of our Fathers. So that now, without cutting off the part wherein the cauſe lyeth, the diſeaſe ſeems almoſt impoſſible to be cur'd. It is true, good things are not to be condemn'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men abuſe them: yet the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe being turn'd into a cuſtome, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of the things themſelves is not infrequent.

I am
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:114767:142"/>loth to ſay, that the name and eminence Epiſcopall, by their fault, to whom it had fallen, had loſt all its reverence, and was come into the <hi>odium</hi> of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to whom, even when they are in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſomewhat ſometimes is to be yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Romans, being evill intreated by the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> took an oath, they would no more endure a King at <hi>Rome.</hi> A third cauſe may be added, that in thoſe moſt infeſtious times, the Preachers of the truth, being hated for the truths ſake, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to acquit themſelves, not only from the crime of ambition, but from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too; which when by taking away the Epiſcopall dignity they ſollicitouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd, for all this, they eſcaped not the calumny of their adverſaries. What reproaches ſhould they not have heard, had the change of Doctrine been joyned with the acquiſition of preferment? I will adde one cauſe more, why, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Repurgation, Epiſcopacy was not very neceſſary. God had raiſed up excellent men, of great wit, of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of great eſteeme, both among their own, and the neighbouring people: few indeed in number, but ſuch as were able to beare the weight of many buſineſſes: Their high reputation amongſt all, eaſily
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:114767:142"/>ſupplyed the defect of Epiſcopacy. But, (if we will with <hi>Zanchy</hi>-confeſſe the plaine truth,) none were indeed more truely Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops than they, whoſe Authority (although this was not their deſign) prevailed even to the overthrow of Biſhops. Nor is that here to be omitted, which we have ſaid already more than once, The Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Government, for the moſt part, receives ſome impreſſion from the Civill. In the Roman Empire, the Biſhops were correſpondent to the Dukes, the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans to the Preſidents, the Patriarchs or Primats to the Vicars or Deputies of the Emperour. What marvell is it then, if people more accuſtomed to an Optima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than Monarchy, would have the Church affairs committed rather to the Clergy, than the Biſhop? And theſe are the cauſes, wherefore I think the Churches may be excus'd, which have no Biſhops: whilſt yet they abſtaine from a diſapprobation of the moſt Sacred order, and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, what <hi>Beza</hi> judged in no wiſe to be omitted: <hi>That was Eſſentiall,</hi> ſaith he, <note place="margin">De Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to interpret Scripture in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</note> (and all were ſo, except mechanicks, as alſo among us) it was permitted to interpret Scripture. By this common liberty, Chriſt taught in the Synagoues, and after him the Apoſtles. Memorable are the places, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. and <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. There the book is reached forth to Chriſt: here <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though unknown, are asked to ſpeak unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>If they have any word of exhortation.</hi> If no ſtranger, or none of the people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himſelf, then the choſen men of the Seniors (who were nam'd the Fathers of the Synagogues, the Majors, and by an excellency the Seniors) interpreted the Law. And theſe being not well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was the Rulers Office. Some what correſpondent to this, we find in the firſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:114767:148"/>Chriſtian Church. For, <note place="margin">25. And in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church: with the d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That miraculous gift ceaſing, it was hardly lawfull for any one, except the Paſtors, to teach among the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Indeed, we read of <hi>Origen</hi> and a few more, not Presbyters, who taught in the Church: but that was ſeldome, and not without peculiar licence of the Biſhops. For the Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> being reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for permitting <hi>Origen</hi> to teach, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged three examples of the like conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, adding, it was credible, though not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, the ſame was done in other places. Here now we ſee ſome difference between the Interpreters of the Law in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and the Interpreters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the Church. In the Synagogue, they taught, as many as <hi>had any word of exhortations:</hi> in the Church, all what <hi>were approved and had obtained the honour of a Teſtimoniall,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, that is they that were <hi>ordained.</hi> The Judges of the Higheſt Synedry were wont to be <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> by impoſition of hands: but of the expounders of the Law, the ſame doth not appeare. A reaſon of the foreſaid diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, not only becauſe the Preaching
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:114767:149"/>of the Goſpel is of more moment, than the expounding of the Law; but alſo, becauſe in the Chriſtian Church the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the word are withall diſpenſers of the myſteries. Whereas, the Maſters of the Synagogue adminiſtred no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For all the Sacrifices were offer'd in the Temple only, except the Paſſeover; which yet was not celebrated in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, but in every houſe, the Maſter of the Family being chief. Nor was it any where commanded, that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be given in the Synagogues, or by any ſpeciall Miniſters. It may then be doubted, what <hi>Seniors</hi> of the Church, <hi>Pſeudambroſe</hi> underſtands: thoſe, that anſwer to the <hi>moſt skilfull</hi> of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who alſo are ſcarce any other but aged men, (in which reſpect the chief of the Monks are called <hi>Seniors</hi> in <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi>) or thoſe, <note place="margin">Nov. 133.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:114767:149"/>But if the later pleaſe you more, (and truly his ſpeech mention'd his age, not Office:) the meaning will be this, which we have expreſt a little afore; That, inſteed of all the people, the Elder men were wont to be conſulted with, in the more weighty affairs: that is, in ordaining the Cleriks, in abſolving the lapſed, and ſuch like. And indeed, it is more credible, this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was long ſince obſolete and diſus'd, to conſult with the people or the chief of the people, than that the Biſhops did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things without conſulting with the Clergy. Yet this alſo by little and little came to paſſe and prevailed againſt the antient cuſtome.

And this ought to prevaile with us, that we take not, unadviſedly and without forcible arguments, the places of Holy Scripture ſpeaking of Presbyters, in any other ſenſe, than they have been taken by them, who being nearer to the Apoſtles times had more perfect intelligence of that antient Title.</p>

As for the words of Chriſt, the antient and recent expoſitors have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd us ſundry explications of them. To repeat them all were tedious. To me, the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:114767:150"/>moſt ſimple and plaine Interpretation, and which comprehends almoſt all the reſt ſeemeth to be this: The man, that hath offended us, is not eaſily to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one deplored and incurable. There are ſeverall degrees of admonition to be obſerv'd, firſt alone, that he may, if it be poſſible, repent without a witneſſe of his fault; if that avails not, a friend is to be taken with you; one, a ſecond, and a third, if perhaps he will yield to their Authority. And hitherto Chriſt hath ſaid nothing, which is not almoſt in the ſame words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in the writings of the Jews. For this is extant in the book <hi>Muſar. If,</hi> ſay they, <hi>hee will neither then bee reconciled,</hi> (friends being uſed, two or three,) <hi>let him depart, and leave him to himſelf; for ſuch a one is implacable, and is call'd a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> But the ſame book in another place addes one degree more; for thus it ſaith, <hi>If neither by this means he ſhall prevaile any thing</hi> (friends being uſed) <hi>then he ought to make him aſhamed in the preſence of many.</hi> Which Chriſt not diſapproving, according to his exceeding lenity, which he would have us to imitate, would have us try all things firſt, before we give up the man for loſt; for that is the ſenſe of, <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and as a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:114767:151"/>Publican:</hi> that is, an incorrigible ſinner. So, <note place="margin">Mat. 11.19. Mar. 11.15.</note> in the Goſpel are often joyn'd, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners;</hi> and the Gentiles are call'd <hi>ſinners,</hi> as when Chriſt ſaith, hee ſhould be deliver'd into the hands of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Wherefore the meaning of Chriſt is, that before we relinquiſh all hope, after a few witneſſes, any company of pious men ought to be adhibited, to the end the ſcandalous perſon may be reclaim'd, by the number and conſent of grave men, <hi>by the puniſhment or cenſure of many,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. For in <hi>Muſar</hi> and in <hi>Paul the many,</hi> and in the words of Chriſt <hi>the Church,</hi> are the very ſame. Certainly, that a Company not great, is comprehended in the name of <hi>Church,</hi> both the LXX. teach us, and <hi>Paul</hi> too, who hath entitled, by the name of Church, one family of pious people. Here it ſufficeth, that it be underſtood, this place in <hi>Matthew</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their purpoſe; for a company both of Paſtors, and of non-Paſtors, may be without the Aſſeſſors, of whom now the queſtion is.</p>
               <p>What they adde concerning the Jewiſh Senates, after long conſideration, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant. The <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the Jews, their <hi>Proſeuche,</hi> and <hi>Phrontiſteries,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> cals them, were far different from
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:114767:151"/>their Courts of judgement. In their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuchae</hi> were the Scriptures read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, all were inſtructed (to ſpeak againe with <hi>Philo</hi>) <hi>to the love of God, to the love of vertue, to the love of men:</hi> whereto anſwer thoſe three words of <hi>Paul, Godly, ſoberly, juſtly.</hi> Here are no judgments exerciſed upon any. That was done in the Courts of judgement; where the Judges had cognizance of Sacred matters as well as of Profane; the ſame Judges, by the ſame Law; for in the Hebrew people theſe were never disjoyn'd. Theſe Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were partly in the ſeverall Cities, partly in the Head City. Thoſe were the leſſer Synedryes, to the Helleniſts; this the Great one, and by an excellency <hi>the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedry.</hi> Whence the Hebrews following the Helleniſts derived <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> None of theſe Courts, becauſe they had all of them coactive power, could be retained in the Apoſtolicall Church; becauſe, it is certaine, neither the Apoſtles, nor the Church had any coactive power granted to them.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:114767:153"/>Government ſhould not, I ſay, ſo ſlightly be inſinuated.

Let us then conſider the ſcope of the Apoſtle. He would have <hi>double honour</hi> given to Presbyters. What hee means by <hi>honour,</hi> may be underſtood by the words afore, <hi>Honour Widows.</hi> Where, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>to honour</hi> is nothing elſe but to <hi>maintaine</hi> them <hi>honeſtly;</hi> for, his will is that the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſhould be honour'd, who are <hi>Widows indeed,</hi> that is, as appears by the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as have not believing kindred, by whoſe help they may be relieved; for, if they have, ſuch he forbids to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to the Church.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:114767:154"/>of maintenance is commenced. The words of <hi>Paul</hi> have been commodiouſly interpreted many wayes by others. The plaineſt Interpretation is, <hi>Maintenance is due indeed to all Presbyters, that rule the Church, that is, feed the Lords flock; but eſpecially to them that wholy neglecting their private affairs, apply themſelves to the only care of propagating the Goſpel, and ſpare no labour in it.</hi> Here then, are not ſet down two ſorts of Presbyters, but it is declared that the labour of all is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall.

                  <note place="margin">Ad Mat. 11.</note> notes not every labour, but that which is moſt painfull. In ſuch <hi>labours</hi> not vulgar, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he approved himſelf the Miniſter of God; for explication whereof he addes, <hi>painfulneſſe, hunger, thirſt, watchings,</hi>

On the Churches 01
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:114767:158"/>part, we muſt repeat, what was ſaid afore, that the whole multitude was not alwaies conſulted, but ſometimes the Elders only. Now, if it was lawfull to carry the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation from the multitude to the Elders, why might it not, the company of Elders being over great, be contracted to a fewer number, eſpecially with conſent of the multitude? Moreover in chooſing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, it appears, that which was belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude was often, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe, collated on a few. And, that in Synods Laiks were preſent, and gave their vote, is ſo manifeſt, both by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Great Councill and elſewhere, that Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> could not deny it. In this point, the judgements not of <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> only and the later Authors, but of <hi>Panormitan</hi> and <hi>Gerſon</hi> are well known. Why, in Presbyteries may not be allowed as much to Laiks, choſen for that purpoſe, no reaſon can be found. But farther yet: It is apparent, in the antient Church, there were Matrons, to exhort the other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to an honeſt converſation: whom they called <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and, becauſe in the Churches they ſate above the other women, <hi>Preſidents.</hi> The XI.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:114767:158"/>as <hi>Balſamon</hi> notes.

From the ſame Spring-head is the right of the Clergy or Chapters to make elections: as may be proved by many Patents of Emperours and Kings. Wherein verily, their piety is worthy of all honour. For they judged, that unto them, who were moſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sacred affairs, and to whom the Paſtorall Regiment was by God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that other Regiment, which flows from the Imperiall Power, might alſo be

In the mean time, they, who endure not Paſtors to be call'd, in any part, Vicars of the Higheſt Powers, are to adviſed to depoſe their errour, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either by reaſon, or the Authority of Laws and Hiſtories. <note place="margin">6. Paſtors and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Elſewhere we ſee, the care of holy things was committed to Paſtors with others, not Paſtors, but pious and learned men, and that not without example of Divine Authority. For the great Synedry of LXX. among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, upon whom, among other things, the care of Religion lay, conſiſted of Prieſts, Levits, and men choſen out of the people. No doubt, in matters of Religion, (yea in all Judgements, if I miſtake not) the High Prieſt gave his ſentence before the reſt. Yet ſo, that the Kings Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, who was entitled <hi>Naſi,</hi> had the firſt place, and asked the Votes. After which exemplar, I obſerve, the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Senate is compos'd in the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. This Conjunction of the leſſer Powers with the Biſhops I find alſo in <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nov. 17. c. 11.</note> Certaine it is, in the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops, the judgements of the Synod, and of the Synators or Judges ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Emperours, met together.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:114767:162"/>So, <hi>Pholinus</hi> is depoſed by the ſentence of the Biſhop, and the men of Senators rank, whoſe names are recorded in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Sometimes therefore, the leſſer Powers were aſſociated to the Paſtors, only to ſuppreſſe violence and tumult; ſometimes, to give ſentence with them. And ſo, in the election of Biſhops, <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Law united with the Clergy, the City Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. Which manner had not its firſt Originall then; for <hi>Theodoret</hi> tels us, <hi>After the death of</hi> Athanaſius, Peter <hi>was made Biſhop by the ſuffrages of the Clergy, and of the men in dignity and office.</hi> Yea, times have ſo fallen out, that, by reaſon of Schiſms or the tumour of Biſhops, it was neceſſary, this weighty part, the care of Sacred things with command, ſhould be committed to the inferiour Powers, <note place="margin">7. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alone</note> and that without the Biſhops. For, <hi>Aelianus Conſtantin's</hi> Proconſul, and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> by Commiſſion of <hi>Honorius,</hi> examin'd the Laws of the Donatiſts, and gave ſentence 'twixt the parties, as above is noted. And in the Court of CP. one of the Patricians did particularly attend the Church affairs: whence his Office had its name. So alſo, the Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> by appeal, the Senate of <hi>Spain</hi> by way of oppoſition, the Court of <hi>Holland</hi> by penall writs, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

For they mention, among the cauſes of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Acts of the Trent Synod; and ſhew, that nothing did more hinder the publication of them, than that the Lay-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons complained, their Right was infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by thoſe Conſtitutions. What opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the States themſelves had of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, we have heard their own words. This is a certain truth, that both the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made by the Patrons may, <note place="margin">11. All Patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higheſt Power.</note> upon juſt cauſes, be reſcinded by the Higheſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all this Right, no leſſe than other things which are the properties of private men, is Subject to the Commands of Law. To which reſtraint, if we adde both the exploration of the people, and the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ordination, the corruption of the Church need no more be feared, from Noble Patrons, than from Ruſtic El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">12. Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by Divine Right.</note> Two things remaine to be ſpoken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude this part, concerning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Right. The one is this, <hi>that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:114767:165"/>powers have, by Divine Right, us Authority at all about Sacred things.</hi> What ere they have, they have it as <hi>by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi> which we have elſwhere noted. Wherefore, neither <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Decurion,</hi> nor the Proconſull <hi>Sergius,</hi> could doe more in the Church, than any private perſon. Becauſe, neither the former from the great Synedry, nor the later from the Roman Emperour, had received any Power, to diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And no man ought to ſnatch to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſword, or any part thereof. The other is this: <note place="margin">13. And little is to be given them by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things.</note> 
                  <hi>Being the tuition of the Church is a principall part of the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Higheſt Powers will doe wiſely, if they grant as little as may be of it to the Magiſtrats.</hi> And whatſoever they grant, let them take care at leaſt, to commend theſe moſt noble Offices, only to their moſt noble Peers. For, if the charge of Checker mony and Coine is committed not to the Municipall Judges, but to men of higher place, how much more doth it concerne the publick ſafety, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches honour, that Eccleſiaſticall affairs be not devolved to inferior tribunals. So, in <hi>France,</hi> no Judges below the Parliament have cognizance of abuſes of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic cenſure; nor with us, of old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:114767:166"/>the Senate of <hi>Holland.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">14. None at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</note>. But, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the Church affairs is not eaſily to be deferr'd to them, who are not in the Churches books. For, ſeeing both Jews and Chriſtians held it irreligious, to carry their private complaints before ſuch as were Aliens to their Law; much more unworthy were it and diſhonourable, in ſo great frequency of Right believers, that the wounds of the Church ſhould be committed to the cure of any other perſons, but only to the Sons of the Church.</p>
