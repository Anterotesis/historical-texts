            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of <hi>LEWIS DE GAND,</hi> a French Nobleman, Lord of Brachey and Romecour.</head>
            <opener>HVMBLY SHEWING,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat whereas ſince ſome certaine moneths, I your petitioner did for ſome certaine buſineſſe of mine, come over from France into England, in a ſhip bearing the royall Engliſh Armes, and for greater ſecurity, having the Kings Letters Pattents, it is happened I know not by what miſchance, that the Spaniſh Dunkerkers not a whit reſpecting or God, or the King, or England, contrary to the right of Nations, did ſet upon us in the very Engliſh haven, and have Robbed me your Petitioner, of all the money I had, to the value of two hundred pound Engliſh. And that you may the better be certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the truth of what I ſay, I can call to witneſſe divers Engliſhmen, which came over with me your petitioner in the ſame ſhip, and namely Maſter <hi>George Thomaſon,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Ioſuah Kirton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Robert Martin,</hi> all three marchant book-ſellers, the two firſt in Pauls Church-yard, the one at the ſigne of the Roſe, the other at the ſigne of the white-horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the third in old Bayly at the ſigne of Venice, who will without doubt, relate unto you how ignominiouſly the ſaid Dunkerkers have behaved themſelves even againſt you in this their wicked robbery.</p>
            <p>For firſt, they have beene ſo audacious, as if they were Lords of the Seas, yea of England it ſelfe, to diſcharge their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery againſt our ſhip, and to conſtraine us to yeeld unto them; After that, we having let them ſee the Kings letters Patents, yet never the leſſe diſdaining them, they have furiouſly ſet upon me your Petitioner with naked ſwords, and forced me to deliver them all my money, the Engliſh that were preſent, not a little wondring at their audacity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they were ſo greedy of prey, that they letted not to uſe the Kings naturall ſubjects, namely ſome Iriſhmen, as if they had beene Frenchmen.</p>
            <p>Finally if I adde unto what is ſaid, that all this hath beene committed even in the Engliſh haven, your ſelves may judge how great an injury, is it redounding unto your ſelves.</p>
            <p>And if the Spaniſh Embaſſadour here in England; or the Governours of Dunkerke (to whom often hath beene written of this matter by the ſaid Embaſſadour, would by ſome way or other, have covered this their moſt manifeſt ſhame, and not pretend Juſtice in this their moſt unjuſt account, in ſaying that they ſhould doe againſt their conſcience, if they ſhould preſſe to reſtore unto an enemy (againſt the law of nature) a priſe taken upon him, I your petitioner a ſtranger would not have troubled you with this my particular buſineſſe, you having imployment enough, in ſo many waighty affaires of your owne: But yet I your petitioner being not ſo a ſtranger, but that I have of late compoſed a book in Latine, of the prayſes of the King and Kingdome, dedicated unto the Kings Majeſty intituled <hi>Sol Britannicus,</hi> would not (I ſay) have troubled your eares with this my particular cauſe, except it touched the honour of all England.</p>
            <p>For if you ſuffer the Spaniſh to commit ſuch things, why may it not be permitted unto the French, the Portingalls, the Hollanders as many as are living in this Kingdome peaceably with the Spaniards, to have the like power upon the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards. And what hindreth us to uſe them here as enemies, but the Friendſhip that is betweene our Princes and you likewiſe; but the honour and reverence due unto you by us ſtrangers living in this your kingdome. All which reſpects ſeeing the Spaniards have notoriouſly ſleighted, and not regarde but injuriouſly violated:</p>
            <p>Therefore I humbly crave at your hands, that you would be pleaſed either to cauſe the ſaid money, which hath beene taken from me perforce in your owne ſhip and haven, and the ſaid ſhip having the Kings Armes, which ſhould to me have beene a moſt ſure aſyle, to be reſtored unto me with all the dammages which I have ſuſtained thereby, or elſe to give me leave, to recover it as I can upon the next Spaniard I ſhall meet withall. And untill you have taken ſuch an order, concerning this matter, as may well become England, I your petitioner moſt humbly beſeech you to cauſe the Spaniards to provide me ſome meanes, whereby in the meane while I your petitioner may live.</p>
            <closer>And the petitioner ſhall ever pray for your honours &amp;c.</closer>
