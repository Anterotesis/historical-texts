            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>To the moſt Honorable Aſſembly of the Commons houſe of Parliament.</opener>
            <head>The humble Petition of the Artizan Cloth-workers of the Citie of London.</head>
            <opener>Moſt humbly ſhewing,</opener>
            <p>THat in the times of his Maieſties moſt noble Progenitors, Kings and Queenes
of England, the State haue from time to time had an eſpeciall care for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
and ſetting on worke of the ſaid Artizans, and thereupon haue made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
good prouiſions for their reliefe. Notwithſtanding which, the Petitioners do not
at this preſent enioy or reape any or very ſmall benefit by thoſe former prouiſions,
but by reaſon of their multitude and their great charge of children (being in London
and the Liberties thereof 12000 perſons &amp; vpwards) ſome of them are enforced for
want of worke to betake themſelues to labour in the Citie as Porters, Waterbearers,
and in other ſuch like meane callings; others to returne home into their Countries,
and there to be either chargeable to their friends, or to follow husbandry and dayly
labour; others to depart the Realme to diuers remote parts in the world, where the
ſecrets of their Art are diſcloſed, to the preiudice of thoſe Artizans that remaine at
home; and others for lacke of imployment are fallen to idleneſſe and begging, and
betake themſelues to other euill courſes, to the great ſcandall of the gouernment of
this Commonwealth. And if the Petitioners ſhould not in ſome meaſure get worke
from the Drapers of London, they might for the moſt part of them periſh for want
of food.</p>
            <p>That diuers complaints haue bin made as well to his Maieſtie and to the Lords of
his Highneſſe moſt honorable priuie Councell, as to the Lord Maior and Aldermen
of London, for ſome courſe to be taken for their reliefe and imployment, who haue
ſhewed a great deſire and willingneſſe to relieue them, and taken much paines to
effect the ſame.</p>
            <p>That the Lord Maior, Aldermen and Common Councell in London, taking into
conſideration that one principall cauſe of the miſery of the Petitioners, was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of exceſſiue number of Apprentiſes, and the too ſpeedy ſetting vp of Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neymen:
wherefore at a Common Councell holden 24. <hi>Septembris, 16. Iacobi Regis,</hi>
an Act of Common Councell was made, containing diuers wholeſome prouiſions
for the remedy thereof, which doth not produce that good effect which was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by reaſon that diuers obſtinate perſons will not conforme themſelues thereunto,
vnleſſe the ſame be confirmed by authoritie of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Petitioners do further ſhew, that of late time a great number of the petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and their families were relieued by the rowing and ſhearing of Fuſtians made
within his Maieſties Dominions; but now by reaſon of the tranſportation of great
quantities of Fuſtians vnrowed and vnſhorne, the miſery of the Petitioners is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and they are thereby depriued of a great part of their maintenance.</p>
            <p>That the Petitioners haue exhibited a Bill in this preſent Parliament, as well for
confirmation of the ſaid Act of Common Councell, as alſo for the redreſſe of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
other inconueniences; The which Bill they do moſt humbly pray may be enacted
and eſtabliſhed by this moſt honorable Aſſembly, to the reliefe of ſo many thouſands
that depend vpon the welfare of the Petitioners.</p>
