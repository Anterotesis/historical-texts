            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iuerse, and verie weighty haue been the motiues (right Worshipfull) to induce mee to the Dedication of these my Labors in this kinde vnto your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9123:3"/>
The first is, because my first calling from the Vniuersitie, to employ my Ministerie for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the Saints, was by the Gouernors of your famous Citie, to succeed that painefull and profitable Teacher Maister <hi>Harrison,</hi> who was thence called by the Kings most Excellent Maiestie, to be one of the sixe Teachers to those barren and needefull places of the Country of <hi>Lancashire.</hi> And therefore, hauing both kind intertainment among you; and by some of you beeing furthered to a more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Pastorall Charge in that Countie, I could not but leaue some memoriall of my thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse vnto you herein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, my free admission to that Pastorall Charge, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the singular proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in directing my
<pb facs="tcp:9123:3"/>
Ministerie for the informing and reforming of that ignorant People, who neuer before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed any constant Ministerie, as also his admirable protection and deliuerance of me from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable men, that vsed all their force and cunning to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the proceedings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ.</p>
            <p>As these are specially, which I can neuer sufficiently remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and glorifie Almighty God for, so haue I thought it good to leaue this Testimonie vnto you of my thankefull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance hereof; who were, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, acquaynted with the good hand of my God vpon me in this behalfe; especially seeing by an especiall occasion at the North-wich, by a child afflicted by the power of Sathan, and (as it was conceiued) through the
<pb facs="tcp:9123:4"/>
confederacie of some Witches thereabout. It pleased the Lord to minister some experience vnto mee, both of Sathans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and stratagems in decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnstable soules, and also of the power of God confounding the wisedome of the world, and taking them in their owne craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse, did I not then vow to communicate my Experience for the good of the Church? and hath not the Lord giuen this gracious occasion thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</p>
            <p>And shall not this mercie of my God bee had in euerlasting remembrance, That whereas I come from the Vniuersitie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though furnished happily with some outward helpes, and not without some true desire of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing soules. It pleased God to turne the oppositions of Satan,
<pb facs="tcp:9123:4"/>
&amp; contradictions of men to the bettering of my knowledge, and quickening of my zeale for the common good, though in great weaknesse and corruption: shal not this be a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of my thankfulnes to those worthie Magistrates, M. <hi>Warbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of Arly, M. <hi>Marburie</hi> of the Meare, &amp; others of that parish, to quicken and incourage them in their zeale and loue vnto the Gospel?</p>
            <p>And seeing it pleased God lately to call mee againe into those parts, &amp; to employ me by means of some other Worthies in that shire in this special argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>discouery of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Witch-craft;</hi> could I doe lesse then satisfie their iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires heerein? and are not they fittest to haue some of the fruite (whatsoeuer it is) of my Labors
<pb facs="tcp:9123:5"/>
and obseruations heerein, who were speciall occasions and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers thereof.</p>
            <p>These are some of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues (Right worshipfull) which haue preuailed with mee at this time, hauing now leasure and opportunitie (by Gods mercie) to publish my poore endeuours in this kinde, and so to dedicate the same vnto your Worships. For other speciall reasons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing me hereunto, I referre your Worshippes vnto the first chapter of the Treatise ensuing.</p>
            <p>Beseeching you not to stay in the Porch and Entrance, but to take the pains to view the whole inward buildings, and furniture of the house. And if you finde any thing therein to informe your consciences in the truth of this Doctrine. Let it be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue against the secret A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme
<pb facs="tcp:9123:5"/>
that fretteth like a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and threatneth to care out the life and power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to direct your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the sifting and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this mischiefe.</p>
            <p>If you finde the subtilties of Sathan any whit herein discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who in the afflictions of the bodie hunts after the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soule, and by this tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with Witches, to afflict the outward man seekes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne himselfe in the heart and conscience aboue all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God: let this also be a means for the better securitie of your Soules, in the discouerie of the good Witches, and renouncing their dangerous helpes: Let it prouoke you in generall, as you <note place="margin">2 Booke.</note> are taught heereafter to labour by all meanes the planting and the countenancing of a setled
<pb facs="tcp:9123:6"/>
and powerful Ministery among you, that thereby Satan may fall like Lightning, his power and policies may be discouered and confounded. For the effecting whereof as my heartie Prayers vnto the Almightie shalbe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made manifest at the Throne of Grace for you and yours: so I doe most heartily commend you all vnto his gracious prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his sonne Christ Iesu.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Generall are:</hi> Because the wise and glorious God by his speciall <note place="margin">Generall reasons mouing to this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</note> prouidence in these daies, requireth an especiall account of our Faith in this Truth: And that in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That we should in thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, <hi>acknowledge his great power and mercy,</hi> That hath so honoured and iustified the Reuelation of the <hi>glorious Gospell of his Sonne Iesus,</hi> by which this <hi>Mysterie of Satan</hi> which in former ages hath beene either smothered, or peruerted, to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther erecting and maintaining of the Kingdome of darknesse; is now gratiously and cleerely, not onely discouered, but further also reformed to the true vse thereof, and so wee rightly enformed how to deale therein: And so by the power of God, the <hi>Magistrate</hi> enabled to take such course therein, as may best

serue to the demolishing of the Kingdome of Anti-christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> seeing the Power of the Gospell is thus able to discouer and confound the kingdom of Satan, may not this <hi>condemne our vnprofitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing thereof,</hi> who still maske it in our sinnes, and will not come out of them, whereas the very deuils giue testimony thereunto? If they <hi>beleeue</hi>

                  <hi>and tremble,</hi> if they cannot endure the glorious light of the Gospell, if they forsake their holds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their Proselites, being forced to discouer them by the power of the Word, and so <hi>to be the executioners</hi>

And doth not Satan most cunningly and dangerously shroud himselfe vnder this Art? as <hi>concluding particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar certainties</hi> out of generall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and coniectures, which the curious Student coueting after, as being ashamed to stagger in his skill; while he cannot therefore finde this in his Art, is therefore the-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

baited by Satan to seeke this skill from him, who will not now faile to tender his helpe for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of proud curiositie, and that by such meanes as are not likely to bee refused.</p>
               <p>For whereas flesh and bloud would bee afraid to encounter Satan <hi>in his owne likenesse</hi> at the first, vnlesse it were further deluded and hardned in the Trade; therefore behold the dangerous cunning of Satan to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice these nouices to his lure, and that by the appearance of contrarie semblance.</p>
               <p>To this end he appeares first <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angell of Light,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his willing subiection to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>idle and worthlesse Characters and Names of God,</hi> whereby he deceiues his nouices two waies.</p>

               <p>For the further confirmation of this delusion, behold in this point <hi>another pollicie of Satan;</hi> that whereas man, through pride, desires Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignety &amp; Dominion, therfore now (in the second Place) Satan offers himselfe vnto this Nouice, as a <hi>Slaue and Vassaile,</hi> seeming to be <hi>commanded</hi> by him, whom he now labours to enthrall for euer, And therein nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gulling the ambitious spirit with this conceited Emperie: What canst thou desire more then to preuaile with God, then to leade hell captiue in this triumphant manner, then by these meanes to preuaile with men?</p>
               <p>Thus are <hi>Yong Schollers</hi> puffed vp with knowledge, and the Pride of knowledge exalts them aboue that

               <p>Surely, the Lord bee blessed that awakens this secure age daily by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued tokens of his power and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure: And seeing wee will not obey his Word, but reiect the power of it, vouchsafeth yet to Preach vnto vs by his wonderfull workes.</p>

               <p>Who although hee naturally hate God, yet in the Pride of his heart he seekes to imitate him in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that so he may more desperately execute his malice both against God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9123:32"/>
in disgracing his prouidence, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man in furthering his destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And therefore, as God <hi>Satan his couenant</hi> with man: so will Satan haue a <hi>speciall couenant</hi> also with his seruants.</p>
               <p>As the Lord hath his <hi>Ministers</hi> to exeeute his wrath vpon the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: namely, <hi>the Magistrate,</hi> so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than will haue his <hi>badde Witches</hi> to execute against the sonnes of men. Yea,</p>
               <p>As the Lord hath his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>faithfull ministers</hi> to relieue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his distressed people: so Sathan will haue his <hi>good Witches,</hi> to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster helpe to such as seeke vnto him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as the wise and mercifull God, because wee are not able to heare him, if he should himself speak vnto vs, doeth therefore conuey his will into <hi>earthen vessells 2. Corinthians</hi> 4. 7. causing men, like our selues, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the same infirmities with vs, to deliuer his councell, and prepare vs to the obedience thereof: euen so
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9123:32"/>
dealeth <hi>Sathan the god of this world,</hi> with the children of disobedience. That whereas by reason of Natures guilt and infirmitie, they could not endure his terrible and personall presence: therefore hee tendereth his will vnto them, by certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and <hi>Familias charmes,</hi> yea by <hi>Witches his vassales</hi> insinuateth himselfe into vs, colouring his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and sleights by some shew of outward holinesse, as by <hi>abusing of holie Names, Prayers, Reliques, &amp;c.</hi> that so hee may the better winne from vs an approbation of his help; and so the more dangerously ensnare vs in his cruell pawes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly also this is manifest from the consideration of <hi>our owne cursed nature.</hi> And that not onely because wee are <hi>Sathans slaues</hi> naturally, and so are led captiue at his will, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to further our owne condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the condemnation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VVItch-craft is a wicked Art seruing for the working of wonders by the assistance of the deuill, so farre forth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Art</hi> (I say it is) because it hath it <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Obseruations</hi> whereon it is grounded: especially the <hi>Couenant with Satan,</hi> and the <hi>circumstances</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of these Rules is <hi>Satan</hi> the <hi>Prince of darknesse</hi> raigning in the children of disobedience, &amp; therfore by his knowledge of diuine duties
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9123:41"/>
and malice against God and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, framing these Rules, to draw them from the seruice of God, to the seruice of the Deuill.</p>
               <p>And conueying these Rules vnto the <hi>Witches his chiefe Schollers,</hi> that they might more easily and familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach the wicked, then if Satan himselfe should personally appeare vnto them.</p>
               <p>And therefore it followeth that it is a <hi>wicked Art,</hi> as proceeding from so fearefull a Teacher, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to so wicked ends. As</p>

                  <hi>God;</hi> to the compassing whereof, what more colourable then to work wonders? Thus did Satan preuaile with our <hi>first Parents,</hi> and thus hee workes vpon their gracelesse poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as being incouraged daily here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by our naturall corruption: And, that especially discouering it selfe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>By selfe loue,</hi> and high conceipt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9123:41"/>

               </p>
               <p>This selfe conceit staies not here; but as outwardly it affects to bee as a God among men by honour and promotions, so doth it also <hi>inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect and desire</hi> some such meanes, whereby it may raigne in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men.</p>
               <p>And to this end, knowing men to affect nouelties, doth it therefore in <hi>Curiositie,</hi> search after <hi>knowledge and hidden Mysteries,</hi> which being not

supplyed by nature and ordinary meanes, are therfore not vnwillingly sought by this forbidden skill: And that the rather because hereby being enabled to confirme such new-found knowledge with strange &amp; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Curiosity</note> euents, by this meanes doth more strongly bind the conscience, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in obedience: Although all is done by no other meanes; but</p>

               </p>
               <p>These are such as are <hi>wrought by the power of God simply,</hi> either <hi>aboue</hi>

And therefore, if the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles</hi> haue done any such wonders: It hath beene, 1 <hi>Not by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prophets &amp; Apostles how they wrought Miracles.</note>

               <p>Nay though the <hi>Son of God in his</hi>

                  <hi>Man-hood</hi> did many miracles, yet this was not <hi>by the Manhood wholy,</hi> though thereby the worke being wrought, was dispensed &amp; acted in such &amp; such a visible manner; yet the work it selfe being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to nature, was effected only by the power of the God-head: as in the raysing vp of the dead, the man-hood vttered the voyce, but the

God-head fetched the soule from heauen and put it in againe vnto the body, yea giues life and power to heare the voyce vttered to rise, come forth: <hi>Ioh. 11. Math.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And therefore seeing <hi>Christ as man onely,</hi> could not work these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, It followeth that whatsoeuer are wrought by men are deceitfull and counterfait, And being won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and strange effects are therefore effected by the subtiltie of Satan, as <hi>being able to doe strange things</hi> aboue the ordinarie course of nature, though not simply contrarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which ordinarily the wit of man cannot possibly produce: And that</p>
               <p n="1">1 Because he being a <hi>spirit,</hi> is of <hi>extraordinarie knowledge</hi> and <hi>capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> to search into the secrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and there to frame strange and wonderfull things: And that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because</p>
               <p n="2">2 He is <hi>ancient and full of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and so hath encreased his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and profited his practise,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9123:43"/>
which man by reason of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and forgetfulnesse, want of opportunitie cannot possibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe: And this</p>
               <p n="3">3 The rather because Satan to his knowledge and experience hath <hi>great power</hi> sufficient euen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all inferiour creatures if the Lord did not restraine: And withall</p>
               <p n="4">4 Is <hi>exceeding nimble</hi> and readie in exequution, being able to conuey himselfe and other creatures in a trice euen from farre distaut pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="1">1 And so by vertue of skill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to apply <hi>Creature to creature</hi> and the <hi>efficient causes to the matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And that speedily aboue the ordinary course of nature how can he but effect admirable things:</p>
               <p n="3">3 Especially if we consider that the Lord permitting, it is possible for Satan to conuey <hi>himselfe into the substance of the creature,</hi> without any penetration of dimensions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the creature although it bee neuer so solide, he can worke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9123:44"/>
not onely according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the nature thereof, but as farre as the strength and abilitie of those principles will possibly reach and extend themselues.</p>
               <p>By this it is manifest, that <hi>Satan can worke wonders,</hi> and these accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his seuerall <hi>Qualities,</hi> are of <hi>two sorts.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Senses</hi> are deceiued, when wee thinke that wee see, heare, feele, and what indeed wee feele not: How Satan doth this, see heereafter in the Sect: of <hi>Iugling: Galatians 3. 1. 1. Sam.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mind</hi> is deceiued, when a man thinkes that of himselfe which is not true; as when men thinke they are <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Christ, Elias, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Reall Workes</hi> are such, as <note place="margin">Reall Workes.</note> are indeed what they seeme to bee: which though to men that know not natures secrets, may seeme strange and admirable; yet are they no true

So can Satan appeare in the shape of a man, not deluding the sense, but by assuming a true body, and therein vtter a true voyce.</p>
               <p>And yet he cannot <hi>Change one creature into another:</hi> As a Witch into an Hare and Cat; This is a meere delusion of the sense, though the like was done by the mightie power of God, <hi>Genesis 19. 26. Lots</hi> wife.</p>
               <p>As for that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 4. It was no change of his substance, but onely of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and qualities of his minde, <hi>Verse</hi> 31.

                  <hi>So farre forth as God in Iustice suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:</hi> Implying thereby:</p>

THis is according both to the <hi>Times</hi> wherein hee workes, as also the <hi>seuerall condition and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of the persons vpon whom hee workes.</p>
               <p>You haue heard how Sathan dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, to prepare the wicked to this Art: Now let vs consider the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> how he sets vpon them, to <hi>enter</hi> them heereinto: Which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</p>

               <p>It is not long but he keepes touch with them, remembring them of their greeuances, reuiuing their hopes for helpe, kindling their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to seek it from him: and so gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing to some particular terms, what they must doe in requitall againe; Namely,</p>

               <p>And so happily for that time also hee doth proceede no further with them.</p>
               <p>It is not long but he meetes with them againe, and then proceedeth to <hi>binde</hi> them to his allegeance, by <hi>entring into a solemne league,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with them.</p>

Secondly, <hi>vsing vnlawfull meanes:</hi> such as are offered by Satan for helpe in extremitie, as to <hi>goe to Blessers,</hi> to <hi>scratch,</hi> to vse <hi>spells,</hi> &amp;c. wherein if wee be <hi>conuinced with the truth,</hi> that these haue no proper vertue to doe such things, and yet shall vse them; This is an other dangerous bond of this secret Couenant.</p>
                  <p>So that though all that vse these things are not brought to this Trade of Witch-craft, to <hi>hurt the bodies of others:</hi> yet are they <hi>hereby bewitched in their soules,</hi> and so proue spirituall deceiuers, to enthrall the souls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to perpetuall perdition.</p>
                  <p>A third marke of this secret Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, is an ordinarie taking of Gods name in vaine; especially in blessing of Cattell, which although the ignorant and vnbelieuing world hath taken vp of custome, yet the <note place="margin">And blind charitie.</note> first tutors hereunto haue beene the Witches, thereby to colour their sorceries, and draw more Proselites to their deuotion.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it were to bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9123:53"/>
that we were more exceeding carefull in the sober and reuerent vse of the name of God; especially, when wee thinke or speake of these outward things, lest Custome breed profanenesse, and profanenesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and despight of GOD and godlinesse. And so, although at the first Sathan enter not into vs, yet by degrees at the length he may so farre preuayle, as first to draw vs to make charmes of these holy names; and so secondly vpon the effect answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Infidelitie, wee be further drawne to vnlawfull desires, and to be contented to submit to Satan for the obtaining thereof, and so at the length become practitioners in this, Art.</p>
                  <p>Vses of these Diuers Couenants.</p>
                  <p>By this it is apparent, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the caueats of Atheists and profane persons against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Witch-craft: That certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are Witches, as appeareth by this Couenant betweene them and Sathan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:9123:53"/>
And seeing infatiable desires are an especiall cause of the making this League with Sathan: Therefore we are taught secondly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To set bounds to our vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full desires; 2 to be content with our estates; 3 to prepare our soules to afflictions; 4 to enlarge our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires for heauenly things; 5 to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse our vnruly affections of euery anger, and especially 6 to cast our care vpon God in Iesus Christ, and 7 to haue our persons accepted of God in him: that so we may not be ensnared with Sathans baites.</p>
                  <p>And seeing the wicked are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to make open profession of their homage and allegeance vnto the Diuell: and therefore much lesse ought wee to be abashed to professe our Faith in God, to giue a reason of our hope and confidence in him: If Satan will haue reall promises and verball contracts, not contenting himselfe only with the heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man: Then surely ought not we to content our selues with good
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9123:54"/>
or bare purposes, but wee must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to confesse with the mouth to saluation, as wee beleeue with the heart to righteousnes, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. If Sathan will haue deedes as well as words, then let vs also not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers onely, but also doers of the will of God, lest wee deceiue our selues.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, seeing Sathan is growne so cunning, as to content himselfe with priuy signes and circumstances, not exacting of all sortes publique and expresse bargaines: shall not this teach vs, not to content our selues with bodilie seruice, and outward deuotion: But especially, to labour for trueth in the inward man? Shall not this winne vs to watch seriously ouer our thoughts and secret purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? Shall it not send vs vnto Christ, for the daily purifying of our hearts by faith in his precious bloud? shall Shall it not still round vs in the eare, to take heede of hypocrisie? lest this be of al other the most sure bargaine with the Diuell, seeing of all other, the hypocrite is first to goe to hell, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9123:54"/>
making a mocke of heauen. They shall haue their portion with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: of all other the hypocrite shall drinke deepest of the cuppe of vengeance.</p>

The maine matter is, <hi>that she must giue her selfe vnto him bodie and soule.</hi> But this is coloured, first, by the Time, he will not haue it presently; because yet she hath not made vp the measure of her <hi>sinne:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>he deceiues her,</hi> that she may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of her bargaine,</hi> God may change her minde, &amp;c. and so drownes in securitie.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>HE hath further diuerse ceremonies accompanying this couenant which tend very fearefully to the confirmation thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these are:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As the <hi>Lord hath a speciall Seale</hi> to bind his seruants vnto his obedience; namely, the seale of Baptisme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. So when Satan hath once obtained this absolute promise of his Prentices, to yeeld themselues wholy to his deuotion, then his manner is, to <hi>set his seale vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> thereby to appropriate them vnto him.</p>
               <p>And this is commonly <hi>some sure marke vpon some secret place of their bodies,</hi> which shall remaine sore and vnhealed vntill his next meeting with them, and then for afterwards proue euer insensible, howsoeuer it be pinched by any.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:9123:61"/>
To assure them thereby, that as therein he could hurt or heale them, so all their ill and well-doing must depend wholy vpon him: And that the <hi>Intollerable griefe</hi> they feele in that place, may both serue <hi>to seale vp vnto them their eternall damnation;</hi> And so <hi>to awaken and giue them no rest</hi> till the next meeting againe, that so they may hasten the vengeance that now they haue tasted of.</p>
               <p>This shall appeare the better if wee consider the <hi>next meeting,</hi> and such <hi>circumstances of place and actions,</hi> that are performed therein.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>When <hi>Satan</hi> the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that ruleth in the children of disobedience, hath once entangled this <hi>Nouice</hi> within his snares, and set his <hi>Priuie Marke</hi> vpon her, thereby to bind her vnto him more surely, That she may bee yet further giuen

vp by the fierce wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie to his power: he hath yet many other <hi>Policies</hi> to effect the same.</p>
                  <p>As first,</p>

                  <p>And heere</p>
                  <p>Vsually, these things are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their order.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Satan</hi> blasphemously <hi>occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the <hi>Place</hi> whence the <hi>holy Oracles</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology.</note> are deliuered, doth thence:</p>
                  <p>First, require of his <hi>Proselite</hi> an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of her couenant,</hi> causing <note place="margin">1 Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> her vsually in her owne person to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate the forme thereof: <hi>As IN. do here acknowledge, that vpon such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I haue giuen my selfe vnto Satan to bee disposed of him at his pleasure:</hi> And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when this <hi>acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is made, in testimoniall of this <note place="margin">2 Kissing of backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts.</note> subiection, Satan offers <hi>his back-parts</hi> to bee kissed of his vassall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:9123:62"/>
Thirdly, this being done, he then <note place="margin">3 Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the rules and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Art.</note> 
                     <hi>deliuers</hi> vnto his <hi>Proselite,</hi> and so to the rest (for many are conuened at this meeting) <hi>the Rules of his Art,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them in the manner of <hi>hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>helping,</hi> &amp; acquainting them with such <hi>medicines</hi> and <hi>poysons</hi> as are vsuall herevnto.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Taking also account of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4 Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for profite.</note> 
                     <hi>proceedings</hi> of his other Schollers, and so approuing or condemning accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, for their further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <note place="margin">5 Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> he yet enioynes them <hi>another ceremonie:</hi> Namely, <hi>to compasse about the Fount diuers times,</hi> there solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Renounce the Trinitie,</hi> especially <hi>their saluation by Iesus Christ,</hi> and in token thereof to <hi>disclaims their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and in further <hi>token</hi> of <note place="margin">6 Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their bloud.</note> their subiection vnto Satan in yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp themselues wholy vnto his deuotion, behold yet <hi>another ceremony</hi> heere vsually is performed: namely, <hi>to let themselues bloud</hi> in some appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant place of the body, yeelding the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9123:63"/>
same to be <hi>sucked by Satan,</hi> as a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> vnto him, and testifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the full <hi>subiection</hi> of their <hi>liues</hi> and <hi>soules</hi> to his deuotion.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, to gratifie them somewhat for this their dutifull seruice, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <note place="margin">7 Carnall and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing with them.</note> their new Maister oftentimes to offer himselfe familiarly vnto them, to <hi>dally and lye with them,</hi> in token of their more neere <hi>coniunction,</hi> and as it were <hi>marriage</hi> vnto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These are vsually the ceremonies wherby Satan binds his Proselites to keep couenant with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And his <hi>Policies</hi> heerein are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: both in regard of the <hi>Witches</hi> themselues, as also in regard of <hi>others</hi> that shall take notice thereof.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Witches.</p>
                  <p>His Policie in conuening them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church is:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Partly, to procure in them a <note place="margin">Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 1 in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Witches.</note> conceit of the <hi>lawfulnesse of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> (as being done in so holy a place) thereby to make them secure in continuing therein.</p>

                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:9123:63"/>
2 As also to encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hold out by reason of <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie where-with they meete,</hi> ready to hearten by presence and example.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And doth not Satan by this convening them into the house of God, and there presenting himselfe vnto them, procure in their minds a <hi>conceit of his Deitie and soueraigne Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that so they may yet better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of their dealing with him, and more willingly performe all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, seeing <hi>as God</hi> he requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his <hi>due, as God</hi> he will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi> with them to the full, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must not flinch from him.</p>

                  <p>A third thing in this description, is the <hi>End</hi> of this Trade, namely, <hi>To worke Wonders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It being the <hi>Pride of Satan</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance himselfe heereby as <hi>God,</hi> in the children of disobedience, and by these manifold trickes and glorious shewes, to detaine the miserable people in vile <hi>Ignorance</hi>

and <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and to hinder them from <hi>embracing the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ;</hi> practising to this end, by his instruments, sometimes true, as by <hi>Diuinations</hi> and <hi>Charmes,</hi> and otherwise fayned workes, as by <hi>Iugling,</hi> to <hi>puffe</hi> them vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with a vaine conceipt of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Power,</hi> thereby to secure them of their imaginarie happinesse, and so to draw them more secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eternall vengeance, by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them heereby to execute their seuerall lusts with greedinesse, and vsing them as dangerous instruments to deceiue others.</p>
                  <p>Such were <hi>Balaam,</hi> the <hi>Inchanters of Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor, Simon Magus, Bariesus, Elimas</hi> the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer,</hi> the <hi>Pythonysse</hi> at Phillipi, &amp;c. <hi>Actes</hi> the sixteenth, <hi>Numb.</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two, <hi>Actes</hi> the eighth.</p>
                  <p>By which description and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the first <hi>Question is resolued,</hi> namely, <hi>that men, as well as women, may be subiect to this Trade;</hi> seeing as both are subiect to the State of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9123:107"/>
so both are liable to Satans snares, who hath seuerall trickes and colours, in this <hi>Mysterie of iniquitie,</hi> to <hi>bait</hi> each according to their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall abilities and vses in the world, thereby the rather to fetch them ouer to this de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>estable Art.</p>
                  <p>For whereas man by <hi>Ordination</hi> is <note place="margin">How Satan baites men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly to this Trade.</note> fitter <hi>to command,</hi> and the <hi>woman to obey,</hi> therefore hath the <hi>God of this world,</hi> for <hi>ambitions and aspiring men</hi> so sutable a point in this Trade, as to lead him thereto, with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Soueraignety,</hi> that he shall <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>command the deuill,</hi> in a more secure and solemne manner, colouring the same by those manifold delusions, of <hi>Circles, Characters, &amp;c.</hi> to this end, as are vsually practised in that high skill of coniuration. By the which ceremonies and solemnities as <hi>Satan</hi> procureth in the minde of ambitious and curious man some higher conceipt of this soueraigne skill; so doth he thereby more deepely cozen him, as fetching him of more roundly heereby to the

entended bargaine, euen to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect his soule in hope of this power.</p>
                  <p>To this end we may obserue, that though the <hi>maine end bee one,</hi> in these <hi>Diabolicall Arts,</hi> euen to enthrall the soule in perpetuall bondage, yet hath <hi>Satan</hi> diuers meanes to attaine these ends, both answerable to the <hi>seuerall conditions of the world,</hi> and <hi>particular estates and qualities of men:</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which diuersitie, this Art, though it bee one in effect, yet hath it obtained diuers <hi>names, and fundry respects.</hi>

                  <p>Concerning <hi>the Times,</hi> as they haue obtained more or lesse light of the knowledge of God, so hath Satan fitted himselfe in his policies accordingly. When, and where, there hath beene <hi>none,</hi> or <hi>lesse reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Gospell,</hi> there hath <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>

                  <p>As <hi>Barbarousnesse decayed,</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie, by setled Gouernement, beganne to take place, &amp;c.</hi> so <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> was aduanced among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by grosse wickednesse was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what brideled, and morall honestie, for the common and priuate good sake, was now outwardly embraced; Herevpon Satan spinnes a finer thrid of more colourable idolatrie, and that by these meanes. <hi>Benefactors of Common-wealthes,</hi> and Deliuerers of

                  <p>As conquest brought forth <hi>Peace,</hi> so Peace yeelded <hi>libertie for knowledge</hi> and <hi>liberall studies:</hi> And Knowledge brought forth <hi>Pride</hi> to bee excellent therein, and <hi>Pride</hi> begetteth curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to search into hidden mysteries, and <hi>curiositie</hi> breedeth <hi>discontent,</hi> and restlesse disquiet: heereupon Sathan worketh: ministreth content to the minde by yeelding it that which <hi>Art</hi> could not reach vnto; so <hi>curiositie</hi> is satisfied, and <hi>pride</hi> nourished, and the soule through Pride enthralled to Sathan, and yet deluded iustly with the same colour of <hi>Art:</hi> vnder which Sathan hiding his <hi>secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts</hi> doeth eyther perswade them, that it is done <hi>by art,</hi> which is

Hitherto serued those <hi>Charmes, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Characters, &amp;c.</hi> by which Satan seeming to be bound, deluded them with a vaine conceit of his subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them.

                  <p>And so, because <hi>men</hi> were fittest for these ends, either to <hi>conquer King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi> or <hi>seeke after knowledge,</hi> so in these respects vsually the <hi>Male sex</hi> haue beene trained to this Art.

                  <p>Succeeding Ages gaue occasion to Satan to work more closely, &amp; yet to <hi>weaue his Idolatry</hi> with a finer threed.</p>
                  <p>For, together with the knowledge of humane Arts, and Sciences which resembled some sparks of <hi>diuine light,</hi> brake out also at length the <hi>day Star of Righteousnesse Iesus Christ,</hi> bringing with him <hi>sauing knowledge,</hi> and dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the more grosser mystes of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish</hi>
