            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Excellency
The Right HONOURABLE
HENRY
L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Viscount SYDNEY of SHEPEY,</head>
            <head type="sub">Baron of MILTON, Lord Lieutenant of their
Majesties Kingdom of IRELAND, Lord
Lieutenant of the County of KENT, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable

of the CINQUE-PORTS, One of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretaries of State, and One of their
Majesties most Honourable Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I have had the honour to serve
your Lordship in the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi>
I have been frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
what seasonable return of
gratitude I might make, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
I have receiv'd from your
Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58884:3"/>
But fearing, no production of my
own might be worthy of Your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
I am inclin'd to borrow some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of the common treasury of
learning, wherewith to pay my first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits
of duty and obedience.</p>
            <p>What I presume to lay before Your
Lordship, may not prove perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable,
since 'tis a small, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Treatise, of very great esteem
amongst the learned and judicious; and
does now justly implore Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Protection whether we consider
the subject matter it treats of, or the
places to which it relates; in both
which Your Lordship is at this time
very nearly and happily concern'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis an Historical discourse of the
<hi>Roman Ports</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> wrote
some years ago, by a very eminent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
publish'd; and therefore humbly
desires to be usher'd into the world
under the gracious Patronage of Your
<pb facs="tcp:58884:3"/>
Lordship; as being well assur'd, that
the same auspicious effects, which daily
attend both the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> and
County, from your great Wisdom and
Sagacity, will as certainly here ensue,
from Your Countenance and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Their Sacred Majesties, who know
best how to value what is really to
be esteemed, and to place those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the highest trust, whose
merits, and great accomplishments,
deservedly entitle them to such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
employments, have advanc'd
Your Lordship (of whose faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they have had so large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
to that noble Station of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which you happily preside
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which never stood in
greater need of such an able Patriot
and Protector.</p>
            <p>Our Annals inform us, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<hi>Ireland</hi> stood once before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to the matchless Wisdom and
<pb facs="tcp:58884:4"/>
Courage of one of Your Renowned
Progenitours, The Honourable Sir
<hi>Henry Sydney,</hi> Lord Deputy under
Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> who, for the space
of eleven years, gave admirable proofs
of dexterity and Conduct, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of that untractable people;
though he had little else to encounter
with, but obstinacy and Rebellion.
And, my Lord, whoever considers
those Great and Noble Endowments
of mind, with which Heaven has
enriched You, for the general good
and benefit of the world, may from
hence easily conjecture how extremely
happy at this juncture the <hi>Irish</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must needs be, under Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
present Lieutenancy; who seem
in all respects, both born and form'd
on purpose, to be the Tutelary Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of that distracted Island.</p>
            <p>To render this Tract, if possible,
a litle more grateful and inviting; I
have subjoyned a Catalogue, from the
<pb facs="tcp:58884:4"/>
most Authentic Historians, of those
Noble Personages who have been Your
Lordship's Predecessors in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stableship
of <hi>Dover-Castle,</hi> and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denship
of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> which
are both indeed Offices of as great
Antiquity as Renown.</p>
            <p>The learned Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> has
observed, that our Warden of the
Ports, did resemble the Officer,
whom the <hi>Romans</hi> established for
the defence of our Coasts, call'd
by them, <hi>Littoris Saxonici,</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
Maritimi Comes;</hi> who had then
the charge of nine Ports, as the Lord
Warden has now of five: and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there is no doubt, but during
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy, the Ports
were under the Regency of some such
sort of extraordinary Officer, as this
was; yet if the famous Antiquary
Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> may have any credit,
he tells us, that <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58884:5"/>
was the first, that imposed
upon the <hi>Limenarcha</hi> the name of
<hi>Warden,</hi> out of his own <hi>Norman</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
and Mr. <hi>Darell,</hi> in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of these matters, saith, that
<hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> created
<hi>John Fynes</hi> Constable of <hi>Dover</hi>-Castle,
which title of honour he settled, by
Deed of Gift, upon him and his heirs;
which may occasion a conjecture, not
alltogether improbable, that under
the reign of that Prince, those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
offices began first to be
united, in the person of one man:
however, 'tis certain, they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since been separated; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
great and eminent Persons
have been thus nobly Dignified, by
the grace and favour of their Prince,
their names stand now upon this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Roll of honour, in a successive se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to this present generation.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I consider that your
minutes are sacred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58884:5"/>
May your Lordship's great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and honourable Atchievements,
both for their Majesties and their
Kingdoms, make you still the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of Your Prince, the Glory
of your Age, the delight of your

<hi>Cinque-Ports:</hi> may You live long
and flourish, in an enjoyment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

Happiness; that so by the favour of
Heaven, I may the longer enjoy an
opportunity to pay my constant duty
to Your Lordship, and be more and

how much I am,</p>

Mr. SOMNER.</head>
            <head type="sub">To the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Mr. JAMES BROME.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE receiv'd the Transcript you
sent me of Mr. <hi>Somner's discourse
of the Roman Ports and Forts in
Kent:</hi> and I agree with you in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the publication of it would
do honour to our County, and service
to the learned world. And since you
have obtained leave of that <hi>Venerable
Body,</hi> to whom the Original belongs;
I am willing to assist in the Edition.
You judge right, that the life of the
Author is much wanting; and that
some notes should be affixt to this
Treatise, to explain what otherwise
might stop the Reader. From which
task I wish you had not excus'd your
self by a retir'd life, and want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to books, and other notices of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58884:7"/>
this kind. But since you devolve those
cares on me, I will take up one half
of the burthen; and commit the other
to our Friend Mr. <hi>Edmund. Gibson</hi> of
<hi>Queens College,</hi> a Person well verst in the
subject of Antiquities, and therefore
most fit to illustrate a discourse of this
nature with such cursory remarks, as
may adorn and improve the work. As
to the Author's Life, since you have
furnisht me with so many faithful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials;
I am content to tell the world,
how great a Man lyes buried, and
how much his memory deserves to be
reviv'd.</p>
            <p>In doing this, I shall treat him not
as a Courtier or a Patron, whose repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
must be rais'd by lines of flattery,
and artificial disguise; but as an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
and Antiquary, who is best repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the same truth and plainness,
with which he liv'd and wrote. There
is this religion due to the ashes of an
honest man, to let the Memoirs of
him be simple and unaffected, to lay
by all unnecessary shades and colours,
and only draw him like himself.</p>
            <p>William Somner, <hi>son of</hi> William Somner
<hi>and</hi> Ann <hi>his wife, was born on the 30. day
of</hi> March 1606. <hi>within the Parish of St.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58884:7"/>
Margatet's <hi>in the City of</hi> Canterbury. <hi>A fit
birth-place for an Antiquary;</hi> this being
one of the most ancient Cities in England<note n="1" place="bottom">Pref. Antiq. Canterb. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>And like a true Patriot, he prov'd his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection, and repaid his nativity
by giving it a new birth. He restor'd
the perisht ruines, and brought back all
its pristine glories.</hi> For his thoughts and
affections having ever much inclin'd him to
the search and study of Antiquities, he did
more particularly, as bound in duty and
thankfulness, apply himself to the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Canterbury. He hoped the better
acceptance of the work from the Author's
thankful intentions towards the place of
his birth, judging this a sufficient motive
why he should of all other places desire to
know the Antiquities and former stars
thereof<note n="2" place="bottom">ib.</note>.</p>
            <p>He was so well pleas'd with his lot

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58884:8"/>
Fashions he despised abroad, and
learning he would have at home. So
that here in studious content, he took
up his cradle, his mansion, and his
grave.</p>
            <p>He was descended of an honest and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
family<note n="1" place="bottom">Casaub. de Ling. Saxon. p. 141.</note>. His father was Registra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of the Court of <hi>Canterbury</hi> under Sir
<hi>Nathanael Brent</hi> Commissary. This name
had been eminent in other ages, and in
other Counties. <hi>Iohn Somenour</hi> of <hi>Multon</hi>
near <hi>Croyland</hi> was a Commoner of some
figure in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth<note n="2" place="bottom">Hist. Croyland. contin. p. 502.</note>.
There was a publick Hall or Inn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this University, that was called from
the first owner of it <hi>Hospitium Somneri,</hi>
or, <hi>Somenor shyn</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Hist &amp; Antiq Oxon. p. 158. b.</note>. And there is now a
gentile branch of this ancient name in
the County of <hi>Bucks.</hi> But let me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this for the honour of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Author; that tho' the knowledge
of Podigrees was one of his proper ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
yet in all his works he gives no
one hint of his own Parentage or name.</p>
            <p>When his forward years made him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of literature, he was committed to
the Free School of that City, then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58884:8"/>
by Mr. <hi>Ludd,</hi> which he after grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
remembers as <hi>the place of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. Canterb. Pref.</note>.
What his improvements here were,
I know none living who can attest, and it
shall not be my vanity to conjecture. Tho
perhaps he here imbib'd the inclinations
to Antiquity from the fresh memory of
the late Master <hi>Iohn Twine</hi> LL.B. who
dying 1581. had been very inquisitive
into former ages, had left a public
monument of such knowledge<note n="2" place="bottom">De rebus Albionicis, &amp;c. Lond. 1590. 8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>.</note>, and
had made particular <hi>collections of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities
of this City</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Somner Antiq. Cant. Pref.</note>: whose fame in
this part of learning might well incite
an emulous youth, and raise that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which carried him at last beyond
this great example. However, here was
our Author initiated in the elements
of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> among many rival
wits, of whom let me mention only
<hi>Peter Gunning</hi> son of a Clergyman
born at <hi>How</hi> in Kent, <hi>An.</hi> 1613. and
<hi>bred at this School to the age of fifteen,
when being remarkably ripe for the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
he was sent to Clare-Hall in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
               <note n="4" place="bottom">Wood Athen. Oxon. Tom. 2. pag. 577.</note>, and left his school-fellow
behind. Their acquaintance here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58884:9"/>
settled after into a sacred friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and there hapned good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to confirm it, by Mr. <hi>Gunning's</hi>
frequent visits to this City, and by his
Preferment to a Prebend in this Church,
<hi>An.</hi> 1660. But let the School be proud
of this honour, that at the same time
it instructed two of the greatest Men
of their age and nation, one of the best
of Divines, and one of the best of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries.</p>
            <p>When our young Scholar had made
such progress in years, and in his studies,
as qualified him for admission to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the two greater Schools of
Learning; then, either by the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his friends, who in tenderness
would keep him near themselves, or by
his own inclination to deal with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Records, he was plac't as Clerk to
his Father in the Ecclesiastical Courts
of that Diocese. And when the usual
time of <hi>apprehending</hi> was expir'd, he was
soon preferr'd to a creditable office
in those Courts by that true Judge
of men, Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> to whom
he after dedicated his first labours for
the public, and gratefully declares,
that <hi>the chief inducement whereby he was
animated to appear in that kind, was his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58884:9"/>
Grace's interest in the Author, as subsisting
in his place and profession, under God,
chiefly by his Grace's favour and goodness</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. Cant. Ep. Ded.</note>.
What made that great Patron of letters
to prefer him, was no doubt a sense of
his happy Genius, comprehensive of
past ages. For that wise disposer of
stations in the Church, made it his care
and his glory to select such persons,
whose abilities might best suit their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
employs. And being therefore
to entrust the many antient Records
of his <hi>Metropolitical Church,</hi> he would
provide a Man of that spirit, who
should with integrity preserve them,
and with industry apply them to the
service of the Public; as seems mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
acknowledged by our Author,
when he commemorates <hi>his Grace's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
care and cost for the collection
of Antiquities of all sorts from all parts,
crowned by singular piety and nobleness in
disposing them to the good and service of the
Publick</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. Cant. Ep. Ded.</note>. Believe me (friend) however
some narrow envious souls would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the merits of this glorious
Prelate, and represent him so, as if even
his memory were to be martyr'd: yet
no one Governour of the Church ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58884:10"/>
did greater things, or promoted greater
men. Where shall we find that spirit
to serve the Public? where that noble
zeal for Books and Scholars? Forgive
me these expressions. We of this place
had in him the most effectual Patron
of our studies. He endow'd us with
many admirable Manuscripts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
those that would search them.
Not that we now want an accession of
such treasure to our <hi>Bodley</hi> Archieves.
You will be pleas'd, I know, to hear
that in one year elaps'd, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<hi>sixteen hundred pounds</hi> in the
truest riches of the East, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of such <hi>Manuscripts</hi> as had been
imported from those parts by two
learned and judicious Men. Yet of these,
the greatest part were in effect owing
to the same Prelate; who supported the
travels of Dr. <hi>Pocock,</hi> and enabled him
to make that <hi>Return</hi> we now enjoy.</p>
            <p>But I hast to Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
the duties of his office with
prudence and integrity. <hi>An office</hi> (as he
calls it) <hi>laudable, and enough honourable</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Pref. Diet. Saxon.</note>.
And when he had <hi>any hours reliev'd
from the business of his called</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">ib.</note>, those he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58884:10"/>
devoted to his beloved search into the
mysteries of time: to which by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his profession, he seemed the
more determined; he himself observing,
<hi>that to the studie of Antiquities his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calling did in some manner lead
him</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. Cant. Pref.</note> He lov'd much, and much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
the <hi>Cathedral</hi> service; where
after his devotions were paid, he had
a new zeal for the honour of the <hi>House,</hi>
walking often in the <hi>Nave,</hi> and in the
more recluse parts, not in that idle and
inadvertent posture, nor with that
common and trivial discourse, with
which those <hi>open Temples</hi> are vulgarly
profan'd: but with a curious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
eye, to distinguish the age of
the buildings, to sift the ashes of the
dead; and, in a word, to eternize the
memory of things and Men. His visits
within the City were to find out the
Ancestors, rather than the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants;
and to know the genealogie
of houses, and walls, and dust. When
he had leisure to refresh himself in the
Suburbs and the fields, it was not meerly
for digestion, and for air; but to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the <hi>British bricks</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Antiq. Canter. pag. 6.</note>, the <hi>Roman ways</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">ib. p. 22.</note>,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58884:11"/>
the <hi>Danish hills</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi>

               <note n="3" place="bottom">Ib pag. 156 &amp;c.</note>
At the digging up foundations, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
descents into the bowels of the
earth, he came often to survey the
Workmen; and to purchase from them
the treasure of Coins, Medals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buried reliques, of which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, <hi>that many were found in almost
all parts of the City, some of which came
to his hands</hi>
               <note n="4" place="bottom">Ib. pag. 3.</note> Whenever he relaxt his
mind to any other recreation, it was
to that of shooting with the long bow,
which no doubt he lov'd as much for
the antiquity, as for the health and
pleasure of that manly sport. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
not <hi>to give a worthy commendation
of it,</hi> to confess himself <hi>grounded in a
good opinion of Archery; and not unwilling
to vindicate the undervaluing of it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men. He recommends to the Reader
a judicious Elogie on this</hi> England's <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
glory, by Mr.</hi> John Bingham <hi>in his
Notes upon Aelian's Tacticks, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Book was dear and scarce, he
presents a true copy of that whole passage</hi>
               <note n="5" place="bottom">Append. &amp; Antiq. Canterb. pag. 476.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58884:11"/>
This was his diversion: but his more
constant delight was in <hi>classic Historians,</hi>
in old <hi>Manuscripts, Leiger-books, Rolls</hi>
and <hi>Records.</hi> Which made him so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to be a man of use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Country, that upon the
great questions in descent of families,
tenure of estates, dedication of Churches,
right of tithes, and all the history of
use and custom, he was consulted as a
<hi>Druid</hi> or a <hi>Bard.</hi> While appeal to his
judgment and deference to it satisfied
contending parties, and stopt litigious
suits. This honour and trouble done to
him he modestly owns in the Epilogue
to his Countrymen, where he mentions
<hi>the recourse which some of them had to him
for satisfaction and information, rejoycing to
give content to them and others</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Ib pag. 510</note> And
truly I know no one part of humane
learning, that can render any Man a
more agreeable Companion, and a more
beneficial friend, than this knowledge
of places, times, and people. Whoever
is thus accomplisht, can never want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
to strangers, instruction to
neighbours, and a turn of diversion

as Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> was, the Oracle of his
Country.</p>
            <p>But the soul of our Author thought
it too narrow a Province to resolve the
doubts of private Men, and therefore
would satisfie the whole inquisitive
world. Hence when he had digested his
elaborate collections <hi>made for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that ancient Metropolis, and his

            </p>
            <p>This accurate performance is the
more laudable, because he could find no

way, but what he made. There had
indeed been two discourses of the like
nature, <hi>Spot's History of Canterbury,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by <hi>Bale,</hi> and <hi>Collections of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities
of Canterbury, by Iohn Twine,</hi> to
which he refers in his <hi>Comment de rebus
Albionicis;</hi> but both these were lost to the
use of our Author,<note n="1" place="bottom">Pref. to Antiq. Cant.</note> and we do not hear
they are yet recovered. So as he had
no one writer to transcribe or imitate,
but all the labour and glory were his
own. And indeed this difficult honour
is the reward of true Antiquaries, they
tread in steps unknown, and bring to
light the hidden things of past ages.

there is a natural reason for this effects a

Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> took a faithful transcript
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58884:14"/>
before the originals were thus eras'd,
all had been lost in ignorance and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.
The like providence has often
watcht over and preserv'd many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Antiquity, just before the
fatal ruine of them. The days of defo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
were coming on, when that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Antiquary, Mr. <hi>Iohn Leland</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a commission from <hi>Henry</hi> 8: <hi>An.
Dom.</hi> 1533. to authorise him to have
access to all the Libraries of Cathedrals,
Abbles, Priories, and all other places
wherein Records and ancient writings
were repos'd, for collecting and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
whatever pertain'd to the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Nation<note n="1" place="bottom">Woods Athen. Oxon. <hi>vol.</hi> 1. p. 67.</note> By virtue of
this power he transmitted the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of many Manuscripts, and other
evidences which might have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperst
by the dissolutions which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in the years. 1536. and 1537.
Thus the indefatigable Mr. <hi>Roger Dods<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
just before the late destructive
wars, transcrib'd most of the Charters
and other Manuscripts, then lying in
St. <hi>Marie's</hi> tower in <hi>York,</hi> which tower
was soon after blown up, and all those
sacred remains were mingled with the
common dust and ashes. Thus again
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58884:14"/>
the worthy Mr. <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> (after
honour'd and preferr'd for his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in these studies) search'd over all
the Manuscript Books, original Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
old Rolls, and other evidences
relating to the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in <hi>London,</hi> copied out the monumental
Inscriptions, and procur'd Sculptures
of the whole Fabric, and all the parts
of it, about the year 1656. when that
Mother Church was converted into a
stable, and ten years after to a heap
of rubbish. So that had not that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
drawn the image, as it were,
before the loss of the original, all had
been forgot, but what tradition had
most imperfectly convey'd to us. Thus
are Antiquaries, if not inspir'd, yet
guided by the counsel of Providence,
to remit to posterity the memorial of
things past, before their final period.
It was thus our Author recorded that
flourishing <hi>beauty of holiness</hi> in that cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
season; which had it been omitted,
the Church had soon been lost within
it's own walls.</p>

spread the glory of the <hi>English</hi> Church
and Nation, if among Divines addicted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58884:17"/>
to these studies, some one were prefer'd
to a dignity in every Collegiate Church,
on condition to employ his talent in
the History and Antiquities of that
Body, of which he was a grateful and an
useful Member?</p>
            <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> had searcht only
into the Latin writers, and such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Records, as had been penn'd
since the Norman conquest. But there
is a sacred ambition in the spirit of
Learning, that will not let a man rest
without new conquests, and enlarg'd
dominions. Especially in Antiquities,
every acquest heightens the desire, and
the wishes are those of the Eastern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
to have more than one old
world to bring into subjection. This
generous emulation invited our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to proceed, and attain the British
and the Saxon tongues. To acquire
the first, there were rules of Grammar,
explication of words, and other suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Memoirs, beside the living Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
to guide a man of industry and
resolution. But the Saxon language
was extinct, and the monuments of it
so few and so latent, that it requir'd
infinite courage and patience, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and prosecute the knowledge of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58884:17"/>
it. To this trial he was encourag'd by
the advice of his constant friend Dr.
<hi>Meric Casaubon,</hi> who gives this account
of it: <hi>that while he was lamenting the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
remains of that tongue, it happily fell
out, that he grew acquainted with Mr.</hi>
Somner, <hi>born of a creditable family, one of
primitive probity and simplicity. Being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
taken with his sagacious wit, and
observing his wonderful industry in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Antiquities of his Country; and
much approving his sharp and solid judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
temper'd with the greatest modesty;
he began earnestly to perswade and excite
him to the study of the</hi> Saxon <hi>tongue, as a
labour worthy his patient and ingenious
spirit, promising his own assistance if he
were able to give any, and to furnish him
with any materials, that might aid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
those studies</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Tractat. de Ling. Saxon. p. 140.</note>. Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> whose
humility of mind made him obsequious
to the counsel of his friends, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
to any motion of doing good,
complied with the advice of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Person, confirm'd by his own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
thoughts, being sensible of the
truth of what Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> had
found by his own experience, <hi>that the
knowledge of the</hi> Saxon <hi>language was so far
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58884:18"/>
necessary, as without it the Antiquities of</hi>
England <hi>be either not discover'd, or at least
imperfectly known</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Somneri Diction. Saxon. Ep. Ded.</note>.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> began this task,
give me leave to represent the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he labour'd under. When the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had made the Britains strangers in
their own land, then the language which
the Conquerors brought with them,
soon grew into contempt among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Even so early as the year 652.
<hi>Many out of this Island were sent to the
Monasteries of France for Education, and
to bring back the manners and language of
those parts</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Mon. Angl. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. p. 89.</note>. In the reign of <hi>Edward the
Confessor, by the great resort of Normans to
his Court, the whole Island began to lose
their English rites, and to imitate the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Franks; especially it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
a piece of breeding for all the lesser
sort to speak the Gallic Idiom, and to despise
the language and customs of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Histor. Ingulphi p. 62. sub an. 1043.</note>. This inglorious affectation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
by an Historian who liv'd in that
age. It lookt like an omen of being to
be shortly conquer'd by that nation, of
whose tongue and fashions they were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58884:18"/>
so industriously fond. The event was
so. Three and twenty years after came
in the Norman Lords, who threatned an
extirpation to that language of which
the Natives began to be asham'd. For
these new Masters <hi>hated the</hi> English, <hi>and
so much abburr'd their Idiom, that the Laws
were all administred in the</hi> French <hi>tongue,
the very children in Schools were kept from
learning to read their Mother language,
and were instructed only in the Norman;
the</hi> English <hi>manner of writing was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Ib. p. 71. sub. an. 1066.</note>
The ignominious marks of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
people. The same Author from
his own experience does again lament,
that <hi>the</hi> Saxon <hi>hand which had been us'd
in all writings grew into disgrace, and the</hi>
French <hi>hand, because it was more legible
and more pleasing to the eyes, did every
where obtain</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">ib. p. 85.</note>, so as in the very next
reign, <hi>the</hi> Saxon <hi>letters were so obsolete and
so unknown, that but few of the elder people
were able to read them</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">ib. p. 98. sub an. 1091.</note>. Nay in the year
1095. <hi>Wulstan Bishop of Worcester</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
when scarce any other thing was
objected against him, but that <hi>he was
an old</hi> English <hi>Idiot, who did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the</hi> French <hi>tongue</hi>
               <note n="4" place="bottom">Mat. Par. sub an.</note> It is true, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58884:19"/>
next successor <hi>Henry</hi> the first, gave a
Charter to <hi>William</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
confirming to him the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his See, in the Saxon language
and characters<note n="1" place="bottom">H. Wharton Auctar. Histor. Dogmat. p. 388.</note> This was but a single
instance, and perhaps done to oblige
his Queen of the Saxon line, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
himself with the <hi>English</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who might hope by this marriage
they had a better title in him. And
therefore it is a mistake in the learned
<hi>Mabillon</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">De re diplomat. p. 52.</note>, and some other Authors,
who assert the Saxon way of writing
was lost from the very time of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conquest. It was with the Saxon
characters as with signs of the Cross in
public Deeds, which were for the most
part chang'd into the <hi>Norman</hi> way of
seals and subscriptions, yet some Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were with the old form of Crosses.
The Saxon Dialect obtain'd no doubt
in Country Vills, with some borrowed
variation from the <hi>French,</hi> and some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of it did intermix with the Court
language. But the Barons and Knights
who were most of them <hi>Norman,</hi> were
so afraid of their children's talking the
old <hi>English,</hi> that in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58884:19"/>
the second, <hi>They sent them over into</hi> France
<hi>for education, to wear off the barbarousness
of the native tongue</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Gervas. Tilbur. de otiis Imper. MS. in Bib. Bod.</note> At the beginning
of the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Robert

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>there was
no institution of children in the old</hi> English,
<hi>but they first learn'd the</hi> French, <hi>and from

William <hi>the Conqueror, and to have ever
since obtain'd</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Rob. Holcot Lect. 2. super sapient.</note>. Tho from the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
of the Barons, and advance of the
Commons who were more of <hi>English</hi>
blood, the Country language grew
more into request, till at last the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, shewed so much of the
<hi>English</hi> spirit, as to represent to the
King <hi>the great mischiefs which would happen
to divers of the Realm, if that the Laws
were pleaded, shewed, and judged in the</hi>
French <hi>tongue, which is much unknown in
the said Realm, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which <hi>it was
ordain'd and stablished, that all Plees, &amp;c.
should be pleaded, shewed and defended,
answered, debated, and judged in the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<hi>tongue, &amp;c</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Pulton Stat. 36. Edward 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 119.</note>. Yet this law did by no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58884:20"/>
means restore the Saxon, either in the
Alphabet or in the prime Dialect: It
only redeemed the kingdom from an
old token of subjection, and did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the then compound language,
much vitiated by imported words and
phrases. And still there seem'd a dash
of the <hi>Norman</hi> spirit, which by the same
law provided <hi>that all such Pleas should
be entred and enroll'd in the Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were any conveyance of the
true <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, it was in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries;
but in those only which were
founded before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest;
for in such, interest did oblige them to
understand the language of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Charters. It was for this reason,
that in the Abby of <hi>Croyland, a Tutor
was appointed to teach Saxon to some of the
younger brethren, that in their old age they
might be more fit to alledge the Records of
their Monastery against their adversaries</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Ingulphi Histor. p. 98.</note>.
And it was no doubt for the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that in the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Tavistoke,</hi> which
had a Saxon Founder about 691. <hi>there
were solemn Lectures in the Saxon tongue,
even to the time of our Fathers, that the
knowledge of that language might not fail,
as it has since well nigh done</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:58884:20"/>
So that had Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> liv'd before,
or in the age of reformation, the way
of attainment had been less difficult.
Or had he been reserv'd to these lower
times, he had met with more of help
and conduct. For we have since had a
good part of the Scriptures more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
publisht, with excellent notes<note n="1" place="bottom">Evangel. Goth. &amp; Saxon. 1665.</note>.
We have had histories most correct<note n="2" place="bottom">Chron. Saxon. ab Edm. Gibson, Oxon.</note>,
But what above all facilitates the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and perfection of learners; We
have had methodical and accurate <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions

an active soul that would feel no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.

then refer'd. Besides, among all the

he never cites this by the title, under

There be some other loose papers on
that subject, which are now, Sir, in your
hands, and I know your spirit for the
public interest, will embrace any fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<hi>to do good and to communicate.</hi>
I doubt he set his last hand to that part
of the argument only which you now
publish, which really is a learned and
judicious discourse; there runs thro'
the whole such a vein of reason, and
such a force of authority, as is not easie
to find in any Authors, that write for
a party, or for any thing but truth. He
is singularly happy in fixing <hi>Limene</hi> or
the mouth of the river <hi>Limene,</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
at <hi>Romney,</hi> since turn'd another

Had he liv'd to supply and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodize
the whole, how would he have
corrected the remarks of all that went
before, and superseded the endeavours of
most that could follow after. For I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
it is your opinion, Sir, as well as
mine, that what <hi>Lambard</hi> and <hi>Camden</hi> did
before, might admit of emendations, and
considerable additions. And what Mr.
<hi>Kilburn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> did since, was
all modern and superficial. I wonder
these two last who were cotemporary
with our Author, should seem to have
had no recourse to him, nor any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his more complete design;
which could be only owing to their
own pride, or want of address to an
easie and communicative man. Mr. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot</hi>
did engage to write another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the <hi>Ports in Kent,</hi> speaking
less of the Cinque Ports, because <hi>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to publish a particular Treatise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating

just right to take cognisance of the fishery at</hi>
Yarmouth<note n="2" place="bottom">Villare Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum. p. 14. fol. An. 1664.</note>. This faith the writer
might have kept, for he liv'd to the

on a man who could afford to rob his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58884:25"/>

Let me observe farther in respect
and duty to my native Town, that
what Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> asserts of <hi>Dover,</hi> being
the place where <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> intended
and attempted to arrive, is from Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical
computation, fully demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the very ingenious Mr. <hi>E. Halley,</hi>
who proves the year, the day, the time
of day, and place, <hi>the Downs,</hi> where he
made his first descent<note n="2" place="bottom">Philosoph. Transact. <hi>for March, &amp;c.</hi> 1691.</note>.</p>
            <p>Let not posterity censure Mr. <hi>Somner</hi>
for this abortive design on the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of Kent,</hi> nor impute it to sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58884:25"/>
or change of mind, that he did
not complete the model he had so
long fram'd. It is a common infirmity
of those who write nothing, to reflect
on the delay of any one expected work:
As if it were no more to do, than to
talk of being done. Of the fatigues in
a great performance, none are sensible
but those who are engag'd in them.
Thought and reflections, searches and
reviews, remarks and collations, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and stile, and ten thousand cares,
all multiplied on the men of greater
fidelity and caution, retard the Author,
and protract his work: especially in
matters of Antiquity, to be in haste does
make the blinder birth. For those wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
cannot at one prospect get a view
of their design. Like the new improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Perspective, the scene opens
wider by longer looking on: that is,
the business multiplies on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker's
hand, and the burden encreases
on the weary Bearer. It is this has made
more Antiquaries fail of their proposed
attempts, than any other sort of writers.
Mr. <hi>Iohn Leland</hi> the first restorer of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Antiquities after the age of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
undertook so immense a task, <hi>that
the very thoughts of completing, did (as 'tis
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58884:26"/>
said, distract him</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Wood Athen. Oxon. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. p. 67.</note>. So as after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
some short and trivial essays, he
left his four Volumes of collections, <hi>fol.</hi>
his five Volumes of <hi>Itinerary,</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. and
some other monuments of industry in
Manuscript, for the most part indigested
without leisure, or without patience to
complete them. The next Antiquary
Mr. <hi>Robert Talbot,</hi> had a great genius
and an equal diligence, to gather and
preserve the fragments of time: but
designing <hi>Annotations on the Itinerary of</hi>
Antonine; and <hi>a Collection of ancient
Charters,</hi> &amp;c. he died with his thoughts
and his papers in confusion. With what
tedious application and gradual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
did the great <hi>Camden</hi> conceive
and nourish his fam'd <hi>Britannia?</hi> Had
his life and strength endur'd, no doubt
he had still been altering and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the glorious work. But he fell, and
left unfinisht this and some other of his
own, and the world's disappointed
hopes<note n="2" place="bottom">Gul. Camd. Vita à T. Smith. STP. p. 45.</note>. Mr. <hi>Roger Dodsworth</hi> fill'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
sixty Volumes with the most ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
collections; but was still hunting
for more, without the content of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
what he had. And therefore
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58884:26"/>
excepting the Charters inserted in the
two Volumes of <hi>Monasticon,</hi> which cost
him little other pains than finding, and
remitting to the press; he left nothing
but infinite materials for those who
would apply them better. Sir <hi>Simonds
D'ewes,</hi> a great valuer of History and
Coins, had laid a scheme for the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
and state of Britain,</hi> wherein he
pretends he would discover errors in

                  <hi>Epist.</hi> of Arch-bishop <hi>Usher. p.</hi> 496.</note>; but by death
he fell from his great and vain attempt.
Mr. <hi>T. Allen,</hi> Mr. <hi>B. Twine,</hi> Mr. <hi>W. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and many other Antiquaries of
this place, had the same ambition to

these instances of general designs, the
particular efforts on a History of single
Counties, (like Mr. <hi>Somner's</hi> on <hi>Kent</hi>)

            <p>Forgive me this digression, and think
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58884:27"/>
it less impertinent; because it serves to
justifie the memory of our Author, when
so many others have fallen short of the
like intentions: and the nature of such
attempts is more apt to absorb and
discourage the aggressors. In the mean
time, we should better accept and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
this remnant that is sav'd of the
<hi>Antiquities of Kent,</hi> and hang up the
little plank, as more sacred than the
whole ship.</p>
            <p>But it is a more just Apology for Mr.
<hi>Somner,</hi> that he did not devote his
whole time to this ineffectual labour;
but was all along employ'd in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duties to the public.</p>
            <p>He found it necessary, not only to
know the places and persons, but the
customs and tenures of his Country;
of which none so eminent, and so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar,
as that of <hi>Gavelkind.</hi> This the
Lawyers inform'd him to be the local
custom of <hi>Kent,</hi> whereby if the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
died intestate, all the Heirs male
did equally share in the inheritance of
lands, which had not been held <hi>in capite,</hi>
nor <hi>disgavelld</hi> by special <hi>Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</hi>
But this account would not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
so inquisitive a mind as that of
Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> for his aim was always to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58884:28"/>
understand properties and nature, more
than names: <hi>according to that end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by himself in all his researches,
which was to know things, not so much in
their present as primitive state, more in
their causes than effects</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Treatise of Gavelkind, Pref.</note>. And to this
enquiry he was the more induc'd, that
<hi>he might satisfie his Countrymen, and gain
excuse for delay of his County-undertaking.
For the more easie purohasing whereof, that
they and others might perceive he had not
been altogether idle, he pitch'd in his thoughts
upon the Kentish custom of</hi> Gavelkind, <hi>and
to some more than vulgar discourse thereof,
as a specimen and earnest of his farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
for the County.</hi> This discourse he
divided into five heads. 1. The <hi>true
Etymologis and derivation of the name,</hi>
where he refutes the continued fancy
of <hi>Lambard, Coke, Camden, Verstegan,
Cowell, Spelman, Dodderidge,</hi> and many
other Lawyers and Antiquaries, who
would derive it from the <hi>Saxon</hi> gipe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eal
cyn <hi>give to all kindred, or to all alike.</hi>
Whereas he proves the name is by no
means borrowed from the partible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the land; but from gapol or gavel
<hi>a tribute or customary rent,</hi> and gecynoe
<hi>nature, sort</hi> or <hi>kind;</hi> implying it to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58884:28"/>
land not held in fee, as <hi>Knights service;</hi>
but chargeable with such rents as made
it <hi>socage tenure.</hi> 2. He enquires into
<hi>the nature of Gavelkind-land in point of
partition,</hi> and proves it was neither from
the name, nor bare nature of the land;
but partly from the nature of the land,
and partly from a general custom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
thro the whole County in such
censual land. 3. He searches into the
Antiquity of <hi>Gavelkind</hi>-custom (in point
especially of partition) and why more
general in <hi>Kent</hi> than elsewhere. 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Gavelkind</hi> be properly a tenure or
custom? where he treats with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
learning of all feudatory right,
and all menial service. 5. Whether before
the statute of <hi>Wills</hi> (32, &amp; 34, <hi>Henry</hi> 8.)
<hi>Gavelkind</hi>-land in <hi>Kent</hi> were devisable
or not? which he resolves in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and answers all arguments of
those who hold the contrary. All these
points are discust with that variety of
knowledge, and that ingenuity of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as will make the Author and the
book valued, while learning and Law
are valued. At the end is an Appendix
of such Muniments, Charters, and other
Escripts, as were quoted in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
discourse. This subject led him
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58884:29"/>
thro a long course of Common Law,
and thro the sense of very many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes:
for which he was afraid he <hi>might
be thought too bold with the men of that
robe, too much medling with matters of
their peculiar science; but hopes they would
excuse him, being one that honour'd their
profession, and had an intent only in his
way to do them service, and their profession
right, by holding forth to public view some
Antiquities, tending at once to the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the one, and illustration of the other.</hi>
What esteem this treatise bears among
men of that honourable facultie, I
might suggest by this familiar hint. I
sought in vain for the book among
many Libraries, till it was lent me by
a worthy friend eminent in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
I hope in a short time a new
Edition may spread it into more hands.
But let me give you a farther history
of it. When Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> had drawn all
his thoughts and authorities into a just
discourse, he sent his papers to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
friend <hi>Arch-bishop Vsher,</hi> who
return'd them with this testimony: <hi>I
have perus'd this learned treatise of</hi> Gavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<hi>and judge it very fit to be published.</hi>
Ja. Armachanus. <hi>Apr.</hi> 7. 1647<note n="1" place="bottom">Treat. of Gavelkind, Append. <hi>p.</hi> 216.</note>. This
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58884:29"/>
approbation of so great and good a
man, was the best License that could be
askt, or given to the book. But there
were two reasons that hindred the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.
First, the distress and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the writer, which might take
from him the appetite and ability of
printing. Secondly, the ignorance and
affectation of those times, that hated
all Antiquity Ecclesiastical and Civil;
and doted on a new Gospel, and new
Laws: so that till the nation was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest
of this spirit, it was not fit to
cast the pearl before them. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
laid it up in his own Archives, and
imparted it only to the perusal of some
peculiar friends. Dr. <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> had
seen and read it, and in the year 1650.
told the world, that his friend <hi>had write
a just Treatise in</hi> English, <hi>upon that most
famous and most ancient custom in</hi> Kent,
<hi>call'd Gavelkind,</hi> &amp;c<note n="1" place="bottom">Casaub. de Ling. Sax. p. 142.</note>. The Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon occasion own'd the hidden
treasure, and pointed to it once or
more in <hi>his notes to the words of Lipsius,
An.</hi> 1650<note n="2" place="bottom">Not a adverb. Lips. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58884:30"/>
Episcopacy, and learning were restor'd,
then the Author brought forth the
things new and old, when the eyes of
men were opened. Yet still his own
modesty would have longer conceal'd
the talent, if the importunity of friends
had not prevail'd. For he confesses <hi>An.
1660. That the Preface and Treatise had
been written more than twelve years agon,
and had lain by the Author ever since, and
they had not now come forth but upon the
encouragement of some worthy and judicious
friends.</hi> At their request it appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58884:30"/>
               <hi>Feudum,</hi> &amp;c. wherein he is singular and
dissenting from all precedent writers,
with such a vein of modesty, and such
a strength of reason and authority, as
has yet satisfied all Readers, and silenc'd
all Critics. He has farther explain'd all
the different tenures <hi>In capite; Knights-service;
Fee-farm; Frank-almoign; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine-service;
Escuage certain; Burgage;
Villenage,</hi> &amp;c. with all lands denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Mol-land; Ber-land; Ware-land;

he supplies and corrects <hi>Littleton,</hi>
and his <hi>oraculous Commentator:</hi> He fills
up the defects of <hi>Spelman,</hi> and prevents
the industry of Glossographers, that
should follow after. And therefore the
diligent <hi>Du-Fresne,</hi> in explication of
most of these terms, barely translates the
<hi>English</hi> of this book, and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to it<note n="1" place="bottom">Du-Fresne Gloss. Lat. in vocibus <hi>Gavelkind, Gavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>By this one performance he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
shew'd himself an absolute Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
and a complete Common Lawyer;
stating all tenures and methods of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58884:31"/>
with exquisite judgment; and
examming the Writ <hi>de rationabili parte
bonorum,</hi> with that nice hand, as prov'd
him Master of more than he profest.
And in many of these disputes he could
have been a more final Arbiter; but
that his habitual modesty restrain'd
him; So that when <hi>many other points of
Common Law did offer themselves to his
discourse, yet being out of his profession, he
would not wade or engage any farther in
the argument; lest he should be censur'd of a
mind to thrust his sickle into another man's
harvest.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To obtain this knowledge in the
Laws of his Country, he had trac'd all
the streams of justice to their fountain
head; he had searcht back into all the
Institutions of the <hi>Norman</hi> and the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
ages. And having first diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
into the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the first,
and adorn'd them with <hi>Notes,</hi> and a
<hi>Glossary,</hi> as was before observ'd; he went
back farther, and reviewed all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings; a copy of
whose Laws had been first gathered up
by Mr. <hi>Alexander Nowell,</hi> (whom Mr.

by that stupendous Master of the

of Mr. <hi>Lambard's publishing the Laws

all that love the genuine Monuments of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
rather to embrace the old interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

               <note n="3" place="bottom">Iunii Catal. Lib ad Evang Goth.</note>. The same censure
was continued by the <hi>Annotators on the

the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle.<note n="2" place="bottom">E. Gibson Praef.</note>. Upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> did believe, that such
an elegant and paraphrastic way of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
old Records, was too much like
paint on the face of a wrinkled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
or a cap and feather upon gray
hairs. He resolv'd to take off the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise,
and represent the true venerable
aspect; <hi>by a new version plain and nigh
to literal, for the benefit of all who were
studious of the</hi> Saxon <hi>tongue; to which he
added some Laws that were omitted in
that collection by Mr.</hi> Lambard.<note n="3" place="bottom">Casaub. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

designing farther; that such Gentlemen
who would read only their mother
tongue, might not be ignorant of these
fundamental constitutions, he turn'd
them all to modern <hi>English,</hi> and has
left the Transcript thus entitled, <hi>The
ancient Saxon Laws translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</hi>
Neither of these versions has yet

               </gap> most worthy of it.
The first of them especially, will be of
great use to the next Editor of the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Laws. For Mr. <hi>Lambard's colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
might be now greatly improv'd,
as one, who best knows, assures the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58884:32"/>
world, <hi>that beside the Laws first publisht
by</hi> Lambard, <hi>and revis'd by</hi> Wheelock,
<hi>it was probable that many others lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
in the</hi> Bennet <hi>and</hi> Cottonian <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries,
which it would be good service to
send abroad into the world.</hi> And (says
the same great man) <hi>I have by me a
Transcript of the Laws of King</hi> Aethelbert,
Hlothare, <hi>and</hi> Edric, <hi>from the Textus
Roffensis, which</hi> Lambard, <hi>however dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in searching out these Laws, had not
seen before his Edition of</hi> Archaionomia.<note n="1" place="bottom">Hickesii Praesat. ad Gram. Saxon.</note>.
Let us not despair of a revisal and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of this Codex of <hi>English</hi>
Laws. Our Friend who has done so
much honour to the <hi>Saxon Chronicle,</hi> is
of abilities, and a genius fit for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
performance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let me observe,
that nothing would more facilitate and
perfect the studie of our Common
Law, than an application to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this kind. It is pity the young
Gentlemen of that profession should be
content to learn only the present pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Courts, and look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the original of judicial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods:
which alone can admit them to
the depth of reason, and the bottom of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58884:33"/>
a cause. There is indeed little hope of
this progress in those new measures, of
first learning the practic forms in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servience
to Attorneys, and bare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of names for a title to the bar.
But where men of parts are honour'd
with the more liberal education of
spending some years in one of the two
national Schools of learning, and thence
transfer themselves to the Seminaries
of the Law, to prosecute the Histories
of use and custom: from such we might
expect those degrees of knowledge,
that would accomplish the Advocate,
the Judge, and the Statesman; such
would be truest Patriots of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and would be the more unwilling
to have the Laws of <hi>England</hi> chang'd,
when they understood what they were
from the beginning. I dare not speak
more of my own sence; but I humbly
refer to the words of a wise man, who
when he has recommended ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
and original Laws, concludes
thus. <hi>This I thought good to say for the
sake of our young Gentry, who adorn the
Inns of Court, if possibly by my advice they
would not spare their pains to attain the</hi>
Saxon <hi>tongue, and run over the many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of venerable Antiquity in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58884:33"/>

Other Critics may suspend their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till they see this discourse of Mr.
<hi>Somner,</hi> which deserves to be fairly
publisht. The MS bears this title, <hi>A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of</hi> Portus Iccius, <hi>wherein the late
conceits of</hi> Chifletius, <hi>in his Topographical
discourse, are examined and refuted: the
judgement of</hi> Cluverius <hi>concerning the same
Port asserted and embraced, and the true
site thereof more clearly demonstrated, by</hi>
William Somner.</p>
            <p>Our Author's skill in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
tongue, oblig'd him to enquire into
most of the European languages anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and modern. For there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
in all learning, especially in
the knowledge of tongues, which draws
the student from one link to another,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58884:34"/>
till he has past over the whole chain
of dependance. This made him run
through the <hi>old Gallic, Irish, Scotch,</hi> and
<hi>Danish</hi> dialects; especially the <hi>Gothic, Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian</hi>
and <hi>German.</hi> Of his perfection
in the latter, he gave the world a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
specimen on this occasion. While
his Reverend friend Dr. <hi>Meric Casaubon</hi>
was employ'd in an essay on the <hi>Saxon</hi>
tongue, he hapned upon an Epistle of
<hi>Iustus Lipsuis</hi> to <hi>Henry Schottius,</hi> which
contain'd a large catalogue of old <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
words, in use with that nation, about
eight or nine hundred years before.
The Dr. thought many of them had a
great affinity to the <hi>Saxon;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being then at <hi>London,</hi> sent down
the Catalogue to Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and desir'd his opinion of them.
Who within few days return'd his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions,
and shew'd the relation of
the <hi>German</hi> with the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue.
But because they were too long to be
inserted by Dr. <hi>Casaubon,</hi> in the body of
his discourse; he plac'd them as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
under this title, <hi>Gulielmi Somneri

Ou the mention of it, I will put you in
mind of one mistake of a learn'd man,
<hi>Du Fresne Ld. du Gange,</hi> who in the preface
to his admirable <hi>Latin Glossary,</hi> reflects
on those Critics, who would derive the
modern languages from <hi>Greek</hi> originals:

                  </gap> Casaubon,</hi> who in
this <hi>Comment on the Saxon tongue,</hi> does
industriously refer it to the <hi>Greek,</hi> and
gives a long Catalogue of <hi>Saxon</hi> words
so deduc'd. Whereas Dr. <hi>Skynner</hi> does
indeed fetch the <hi>Saxon</hi> from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
dialects, and reflects on Dr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon</hi>
for being so fond of that other
conceit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These were the public services done
by Mr.</hi> Somner, <hi>till the year 1650. at
which time Dr.</hi> Casaubon <hi>reports,</hi> that
he would have printed all his useful labours,
and would have wrote much more: if that
fatal <hi>catastrophe</hi> had not interpos'd, which
brought no less desolation upon letters, than
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58884:35"/>
upon the Land.<note n="1" place="bottom">M. Casaub. de Ling. Saxon. p. 141.</note>. <hi>And he himself had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three years before declar'd,</hi> that
he had by him some other things in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
for the public, which should not, God
willing, be much longer retarded, if the
times permitted by the continuance of our
Countie's peace, peace that Mother of Arts<note n="2" place="bottom">Pref. to Treat. of <hi>Gavelkind.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>His next opportunity of doing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
good was this. It was an observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the learned, that no one nation
had so many various Histories of their
own affairs, as that of <hi>England:</hi> wrote
by <hi>Britains, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Normans;</hi> but
most of them in a manner dissolv'd
with the Monasteries, wherein they laid
and slept. Some of them had been
rais'd from the dust by <hi>Ioceline, Howard,
Parker, Camden, Savile;</hi> but many were
yet in chains of darkness; which it
would be justice and mercy to redeem,
and expose to view. The proposal was
made by that industrious Bookseller
<hi>Cornelius Bee,</hi> who about 1641. had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
Sir <hi>Roger Twisden</hi> to supply him
with materials of this kind for the press<note n="3" place="bottom">Twisdenus Lectori X. Script.</note>.
That worthy Baronet call'd in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of <hi>Arch-bishop Vsher</hi> and <hi>Iohn
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58884:36"/>

               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Amanuensis Lectori X. Script.</note>: by whose industry and
good affection to learning, ten writers
of the <hi>English</hi> history were transcrib'd
from the originals in the <hi>Bennet</hi> and
<hi>Cottonian</hi> Libraries, and faithfully col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with all different copies, by an
expert Amanuensis Mr. <hi>Ralph Iennings.</hi>
For the more elegant Edition, a new
fund of letters was neatly cast, and a
provision made of fine paper. To
adorn the work, Sir <hi>Roger Twisden</hi> was
to acquaint the Reader with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the book, and the conveyance
of those MSS from which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd.
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> was in a larger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to give account of the ten Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
and their writings. And Mr. <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
to subjoyn the various lections.
But still the Editors were sensible that
to complete the glory of the work, there
wanted a <hi>Glossary,</hi> or explication of
the more obscure and obsolete words,
which often occurr'd in those primaeve
writers. For this province, they knew
none so well qualified as Mr. <hi>Somner:</hi>
to him they commit the office, and he
discharg'd it with infinite integrity and
honour. So that when in 1652. this

Sir <hi>Roger Twisden</hi> gives the

Glossary, without which this work had been
imperfect and little useful. Vnderstand
Reader, it was compil'd for your sake by</hi>
William Somner, <hi>a man of primitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity
and candor, a most sagacious searcher
into the Antiquities of his Country, and
most expert in the</hi> Saxon <hi>tongue. If some
words are here glost upon, not found in these
writers; know, this was not done out of
ostentation, or the affected glory to appear
learned; but it was granted at the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
request of his friends, by a man of
the greatest modesty and ingenuity; that if
such terms occur in other Historians of our
nation, and by none that I know of explain'd;
you may from hence discover the sense of
them: our design being not to give trouble to
him, but satisfaction to you; such are</hi> Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertagium,

and others of that kind.</hi>

            <p>This key to recluse and antiquated
words, improv'd whatever of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

by Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> to his <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; the

of <hi>Io. Ger. Vossius;</hi> the <hi>Glossary</hi> of
Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> adjoin'd to his noble Edition
of <hi>Mat. Paris;</hi> and above all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Glossary of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi>
then only publisht to the letter N. Nor
has Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> like the former Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sographers,
confin'd himself to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
names of things; but with happy
learning has commented on the names
of this Island and several parts of it; to
which he has affixt such new and apposite
derivations, as delight and satisfie all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Readers. It is indeed a work
of that extent, as may serve for a <hi>cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to all other Historians, and to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.
Therefore when the learned Sir
<hi>Iohn Marsham</hi> wrote an <hi>Introduction</hi> to
the <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum, he refers the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58884:37"/>
Reader to this Glossary of Mr.</hi> Somner's,
<hi>where a barbarous word creates him any
trouble.</hi> And that living Author, (whom
I often mention, but cannot enough
commend) observes, <hi>That the Laws of
the</hi> Saxon <hi>Kings may be read with some
profit, as turn'd into Latin by</hi> Jo. Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,
<hi>if the incomparable Glossary of Mr.</hi>
Somner <hi>be consulted, wherein the more
obscure words are fully explain'd</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Hickesii praefat. ad Gram. Saxon.</note>. And
after calls it, <hi>a truly golden work, without
which, as Sir</hi> Roger Twisden <hi>writes, the
ten historians had been imperfect, and little
useful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How complete might this Glossary

the knowledge of all our Laws and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
improve, when these mighty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
come at last to be digested by
an able and patient hand?</p>
            <p>The Author himself intended to
publish more of this kind. For in his
<hi>Addenda ad Gloss. X. Script.</hi> he does
advertise the Reader, <hi>that if any other
difficult words occur, which he had not there
explain'd, (as omissions might be easie in so
long a work) and read over as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore,
he would be glad to be inform'd of
them, and would not fail with thanks to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
them in the best manner that he
could: at least in another Tome of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
shortly to be publisht.</hi> Sir <hi>Roger
Twisden</hi> in his Preface gives the world
the same encouragement, <hi>to hope for a
second Tome, if this first were well accepted.</hi>
But it was not allow'd to Scholars to be
so happy. The association of those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
was dissolv'd by the death of
<hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Vsher</hi> within few years.
Tho possibly the greatest impediment
was the ignorance and distraction of
the times, that could not enough en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58884:38"/>
Mr. <hi>Cornelius Bee,</hi> to whom Mr.
<hi>Somner</hi> gives this just character, that <hi>he
was a man who had deserv'd very well of
the republic of letters, by publishing, at his
own care and cost, many books of better note,
wherein he was so industrious, as literally to
answer his own name</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Praef. ad Dict. Saxon.</note>. He had indeed

no one Edition of Historians with that
exactness, and that grandeur. Nor can
we hope for any so correct and so au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,
till the same measures be taken,
of several hands joyning in the same
work. For any one undertaker has
either not opportunity to discover all

Editions, for want of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

It is by this mutual help, that

            <p>Mr. <hi>Somner's</hi> reputation was now so

when they had both searcht the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Cotton</hi> Library, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Archives; they invited Mr. <hi>Somner</hi>
to assist in that immense labour, who
return'd them the Charters of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi>
and St. <hi>Augustin's</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
with the ichnography of the Cathedral,
the draught of the Monastery, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sculptures: furnisht them with the
original Charter of King <hi>Stephen</hi> to the
Abby of <hi>Feversham,</hi> then in his hands;
and inform'd them in many other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
relating to the City and County:
and then accepted the office impos'd
upon him, of bearing a peculiar part
of the burden, by translating all the
<hi>Saxon</hi> originals, and all the <hi>English</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
from the <hi>Itinerary</hi> of <hi>Leland,</hi> and
other Records, into plain and proper
<hi>Latin:</hi> a necessary and useful ornament
to those admirable volumes. Which
service Sir <hi>Iohn Marsham</hi> commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in his learned <hi>Propylaeum; There
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58884:40"/>
assisted in this work a man of the greatest
knowledge in our Antiquities,</hi> William
Somner <hi>of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>who has rendred
into latin all the</hi> Saxon, <hi>and the</hi> English
<hi>of</hi> Leland. <hi>To whose Glossary, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
with the</hi> English <hi>Historians, the
Reader is refer'd, if any barbarous word
creates him trouble. The same person is
now preparing for the press a curious</hi> Saxon
<hi>Dictionary.</hi> The first Volume of this
<hi>Monasticon</hi> was publisht, <hi>London,</hi> 1655.
The book which now stands in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
of the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> has
inserted after the <hi>Propylaeum</hi> a printed
leaf in folio, containing six copies of
verses made by <hi>Kentish</hi> men, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of Mr. <hi>Dodsworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> who are there said
to be the joint collectors of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
work. The second Volume was
deferr'd (as a punishment to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
world) to the year 1661. A
third Volume of Cathedral and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate
Churches, with Additaments to
the two former, was publisht <hi>An.</hi> 1673.
In these books are promiscuously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
the most Authentic, because most
genuine and inartificial, History of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
There be materials enough dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst
in several hands to complete a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58884:41"/>
fourth Volume. Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> recites the
title of many Charters, in the Archives
of the Church of <hi>Worcester, of which,</hi> he
says, <hi>none are inserted in the Monasticon</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Append. ad Sax Gram. p. 171.</note>.
I have seen many originals and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
of omitted Charters and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic
Annals, in the hands of men of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
and public spirit; who would
contribute their additions to such a
work, when ever men of industry and
courage dare to undertake it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Somner's</hi> friends knew, how far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to employ a useful man. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it impossible to cultivate any
language, or recommend it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of learners, without the help of
some Dictionary for a standing oracle
in obscure and dubious words. This
was yet wanting to the <hi>Saxon</hi> language,
and was the reason why so few were
masters of it. For men care not to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
without a guide in lands unknown.
This was a burden that wanted heart
and shoulders equal to it; but they
could impose it on none more able than
Mr. <hi>Somner:</hi> on him they lay the
mighty task, and adjure him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it. Above all, the Counsellor of
his studies Dr. <hi>M. Casaubon,</hi> us'd all his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58884:41"/>
interest of friendship to press him to
this labour; as he thus informs us:
<hi>When Mr.</hi> Somner <hi>by several essays on the</hi>
Saxon <hi>tongue, had sufficiently prov'd himself
a master of it; I ceas'd not then to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
him, that he would think of compiling
a</hi> Saxon <hi>Dictionary; by which work I did
assure him, he would best merit of that
language, and would receive infinite thanks
from all that were studious of it. But in
such unhappy times, what can the Reader
promise to himself, or what can I promise
for the Author? I leave all to his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">M. Casaub. de Ling. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Upon this hint given to the
public, many other of Mr. <hi>Somner's</hi>
friends, who knew his course of studies,
did themselves hope, and made others
expect, to see such a labour done by
him. <hi>Especially when by his Glossary and
Version of</hi> Saxon <hi>Charters,</hi> he <hi>had farther
serv'd the world: from that time</hi> he <hi>was
incited by the daily request and importunity
of many persons, to undertake and finish
that work; many of</hi> his <hi>judicious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
friends, considering his slender
fortune, and offering to contribute in the
charges of the impression: with assurance that
the book would be very acceptable both at
home and abroad, especially to all that were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58884:42"/>
studious of the</hi> Teutonic <hi>Antiquities, which
language was originally the same with the</hi>
Saxon<note n="1" place="bottom">Praef. ad Lector. Sax. Dict.</note>. But for a work that requir'd
so much time, and so great expence,
his friends were to contrive some more
competent support and reward: to
which Providence (that seldom fails
industrious men) ordain'd an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
The great Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi>
while he was at <hi>Cambridge</hi> with Mr. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy
Stephens,</hi> to search those Libraries,
and collect materials for his designed
Volumes of <hi>British Councils,</hi> finding very
many <hi>Saxon</hi> Manuscripts, and very few
that understood them; resolv'd to
found a Lecture in that language, to
restore and improve the study of it.
This generous act was soon done by
him, and he first conferr'd that office
on Mr. <hi>Abraham Wheelock,</hi> one that had
assisted him in some Transcripts of that
tongue; and for endowment settled on
him and his successors a sufficient yearly
stipend, with presentation to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
of <hi>Midleton,</hi> nigh <hi>Lin-Regis</hi> in
<hi>Norfolk</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Abr. Wheelock <hi>praef. ad ector. edit Bedae.</hi>
               </note>. By the death of Mr. <hi>Wheelock
An.</hi> 1657. the disposal of that Lecture
fell to <hi>Roger Spelman</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> son of Sir
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58884:42"/>
               <hi>Iohn,</hi> son of the founder, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to bestow it on Mr. <hi>Samuel Foster,</hi>
a learned and worthy Divine. But
Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> a friend to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
and Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> recommended
him to the Patron, <hi>that he would confer
on him the pecuniary stipend, to enable him
to prosecute a</hi> Saxon <hi>Dictionary, which
would more improve that tongue than bare
Academic Lectures</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Somneri</hi> Epist. Ded. ad Saxon. Diction.</note>. And herein that
Prelate was like himself, judicious. For
the endowment of public Lectures has
often met with this till success, to make
the Readers neglect, and the hearers
despise them. Whereas if the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
were given, on condition of
printing those Lectures, or publishing
some other remains of that Art or
Science: mens industry would be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the Republic of Letters much
better serv'd. This seem'd the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wise and pious founder Sir
<hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> in establishing this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
The words of his foundation
being <hi>to promote the</hi> Saxon <hi>tongue, either
by reading it publicly, or by the edition of</hi>
Saxon <hi>Manuscripts, and other books</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Wheeloci</hi> Praefat. Edit. Bedae.</note>.
Which last design Mr. <hi>Wheelock</hi> had
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58884:43"/>
most answered, by publishing <hi>the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
History of Bede,</hi> with the <hi>Saxon
Paraphrase of King</hi> Alfred. <hi>The Saxon
Chronology</hi> with his own latin version,
and Mr. <hi>Lambard's Saxon Laws,</hi> with
some additions. <hi>Cambridge 1644. fol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reason of the thing, and this
Will of his Grandfather, inclin'd Mr.
<hi>Spelman</hi> to comply with the advice of
Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> and to present Mr. <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
to the annual salary of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
Which this man of tenderness
and modesty would not accept, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the free consent of Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nominated to the place: who
prefer'd the public before his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> before himself.
Therefore content with the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
benefice, he left the annual por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mony to Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this reward, would not omit
the duty for it.</p>
            <p>He was enough sensible, that to make
a <hi>Lexicon</hi> in any tongue, was one of the
hardest and most servile labours. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if no foundations were before
laid; there to find materials, and to
build the whole structure, was more
tedious and expensive, than barely to
augment, or adorn. On reflection he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58884:43"/>
found those difficulties to press upon
him: some faint endeavours, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
promises, but no one public per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this nature.</p>
            <p>The first example was given by <hi>Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric</hi>
the Grammarian and Arch-bishop,
either of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cave</hi> Histor. Literar. p. 588.</note>, or rather of <hi>York</hi>

                  <hi>Whartoni</hi> dissertatio de duobus Aelfricis.</note>.
who flourisht about the year 1004. and
made two distinct <hi>Glossaries</hi> on this
tongue; one of which <hi>F. Iunius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
from a very ancient copy in the
Library of <hi>Peter Paul Rubenius</hi> of <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
and communicated to Mr. <hi>Somner</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Praef ad Sax. Dict. sect. 17.</note>,
who publisht it with the <hi>Latin</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
in <hi>Saxon,</hi> by the same Author.
This could be no great assistance to
Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> because short and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and indeed <hi>erroneous,</hi> and <hi>a little
barbarous,</hi> as the <hi>Editor</hi> himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<note n="4" place="bottom">Ib.</note>: and another expert in these
studies does affirm, <hi>when</hi> Aelfric <hi>expounds
the words in Latin, he is very oft mistaken</hi>
               <note n="5" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Skynner</hi> Etymol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in voce <hi>Bleak.</hi>
               </note>.
There is another <hi>Glossary Latin-Saxon,</hi>
by the same Prelate, (distinct from the
former) which he wrote as a Comment
on his Grammar; and is found at the
end of those copies of the Grammar
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58884:44"/>
which are now in the <hi>Cotton Library,</hi>
and in that of St. <hi>Iohn's Oxon:</hi> which
seems to have escap'd the knowledge
of Mr. <hi>Somner.</hi> This latter may be the
same with that <hi>Diction. Latin-Saxon:</hi>
which Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> recounts among the
Manuscripts of <hi>Aelfric</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Histor Literar. p. 588, 590.</note>. And therefore
a worthy Author is injurious to Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi>
in taxing him with an error, for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
this work among the Manuscripts of</hi>
AElfric, <hi>when it was publisht by Mr.</hi> Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note n="2" place="bottom">Auctar. Hist. Dogmat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Usher</hi> p. 377.</note>.
No, that work is still in MS. and
what was publisht by Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> is a
different Tract, which the Dr. had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention'd, as printed at <hi>Oxon.</hi> 1659.
One writer should be tender of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writer's reputation, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
mistakes, but where he is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of them.</p>
            <p>There were two other ancient <hi>Saxon</hi>
Glossaries by unknown hands, in the
<hi>Cotton</hi> Library, the one a thin <hi>folio,</hi> the
other a more thick <hi>octavo;</hi> what help
Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> had from these, he freely
owns, by referring to them. Since the
Reformation, Mr. <hi>Laurence Nowell</hi> spent
time in drawing up a <hi>Saxon vocabulary,</hi>
which he design'd to complete, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
But he dying in 1576. left the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58884:44"/>
Manuscript, which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
procur'd, and lent to Mr. <hi>Somner;</hi> who
seems not to have receiv'd it, till he had
in great part digested his own colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and implies it to be a deficient
work. <hi>F. Iunius</hi> after took a transcript
of it, the original and copy are both
with us. Next to him, Mr. <hi>I. Ioceline</hi>
Secretary to Arch-bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of that learned Prelate, made some
larger collections to the same intent,
which were transcrib'd by Sir <hi>Symonds
D'ewes</hi> Baronet, and remitted to Mr.
<hi>Somner:</hi> who farther mentions a report
that <hi>Iohn de Laet</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> a man
learned in <hi>Saxon</hi> letters, had projected
a work of this nature; but no perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
After all, Mr. <hi>Abraham Wheelock,
Spelman-Professor,</hi> did promise the world
that he would compile <hi>a Saxon Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;</hi>
but he either forgot the promise,
or death absolv'd him from it. It has
been the infirmity of great men, when
their first thoughts have laid the scheme
of any work, to take occasion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
their design; to raise and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the expectation of the world.
Prudence should temper this vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of glory. An imprinted promise is
a very sacred thing: and men should
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58884:45"/>
not engage their faith to the public,
unless they are sure to discharge it.
How often are men weary of a warm
resolution? How oft do second thoughts
correct the former: and when the scene
is laid, it must be took away? How oft
do mens labours encrease upon their
hands, till the undertaking prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their strength? How many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of business, sickness, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
may intervene? So as what wise
man would enter into obligation, when
it is such a hazard whether he shall be
able to pay?</p>
            <p>But this mention of the few <hi>Saxon</hi>
Glossographers, is only to do justice to
the memory of Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> by inferring
what small assistance he had in so large
a work. He had not that easy task of
adding to things invented, or improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an old book; but was to compose
all, and be properly an Author. We
have been taught at School to honour
the <hi>Lexicon</hi> of <hi>I. Scapula,</hi> and yet <hi>Vogler</hi>
has call'd him <hi>the Epitomator of Henry
Stephens</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Vogleri Introduct. Univers. p. 68.</note>: and another eminent writer
says, <hi>he cannot be absolv'd from the crime
of Plagiarism and concealment</hi>

phrase; with this only difference,
that those phrases are rendred in <hi>French</hi>
by <hi>Stephens,</hi> and in <hi>English</hi> by <hi>Cooper:</hi>
whose disingenuity is much the greater,
because in his preface and Dedication,
he mentions the <hi>Bibliothece</hi> of Sir <hi>Tho.

but speaks not a word of this other

he sent up his papers to <hi>Oxford,</hi>

age, and to posterity; for the perpetual
honour of Philologers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as a testimony of
the Author's grateful mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let none be offended, that so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a work was forc'd to be thrown
upon the public stock, and brought up
on common charity. Till the men on
curiosity encrease their number, this
must be the fate of the best books, that
they shall not bear the charges of their
own Impression. It is this has stifled
the conception of many glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
to see exquisite Volumes thrown
back upon an Author's empty hands;
while Plays and Pamphlets reward the
trifling writers. What else was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that most of our old Historians
were first printed beyond the seas; but
only, that cheaper methods, and quicker
sale, made the Editors to gain abroad,
what they must have lost at home?
What induc'd Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to burn

but only a fordid complaint, that
the first five books were a burden to

Spelman</hi> so long to suppress the second
part of his incomparable <hi>Glossary,</hi> but
this only; that when he offer'd the

Printer, for five pounds in books; that
light proposal was rejected, and he was
forc'd to make the Impression at his
own great charge?<note n="1" place="bottom">Editoris Praef. ad Glossarium. 1687.</note>? How could Dr.

was a credit to this work of Mr. <hi>Somners,</hi>

charity of public benefactors. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at a time, when the oppressed
Royalists were more tempted to write
for bread, than for glory; and were

for the support of themselves, and the

when all the Professors of true
Religion and good literature were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd

so order'd, that the loyal suffering
party did all that was then done, for
the improvement of letters, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

It is true, this first public essay on the
construction of the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, was
not so full and absolute, but that it is
now capable of additions, and great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.
For how indeed can any
works, but those of creation, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
when they are first produc'd? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a performance of this nature,
that depends on the variety of words,
and Author's various acceptation of
them: here the prime birth can give
no more than infancy: it is age and
education must encrease the stature,
and mature the strength. Besides, our
Author had this peculiar disadvantage,
that while the abundant sense of words
can be gathered only from a multitude
of writers in all different times, and all
different professions; he could procure
but few books, and those of a short
and ignorant age. This Apology I can
better represent in the words of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Etymologist. <hi>How small a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our ancient tongue, like a few planks
from a fatal shipwrack, has come into our
hands? What a slender stock of words can
be drawn out of three or four small Tracts?
If of Roman Authors, none had been left
to us but the Offices of</hi> Tully, <hi>and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of</hi> Salust <hi>and</hi> Tacitus. <hi>If of the</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58884:48"/>
Grecian, <hi>none but</hi> Herodotus, Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<hi>and</hi> Zenophon, <hi>how could</hi> Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
<hi>and</hi> Stephanus <hi>have swell'd their
volumes to so great a bulk? If you compare
our</hi> Somner <hi>to those giant Authors, tho
in diligence not inferiour to either of them,
you would see there a Hercules and a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops;
here a Hylas and a Pigmy</hi>

certainly, if we look back on the first
attempts of this kind, in all the ancient

the printed Authors, left corrected and

is this Lexicon of Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loose sheets, and the Grammar of

Another of these printed volumes was
in possession of Mr. <hi>George Davenport,</hi>
much noted and enlarg'd by the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
owner; and is now in other hands,
interleav'd, and much farther improv'd.
The want of a new Edition would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be superseded, could the world at

completed by <hi>F. F. Iunius</hi> in two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,

that most worthy Prelate Bishop <hi>Fell,</hi>

            <p>The last service of our Author was
to publish his <hi>Treatise of Gavelkind,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>An.</hi> 1660. which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
and need only add, that some
reflections were made on this discourse
by <hi>Silas Taylor</hi> Gentleman, in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of Gavelkind, with the Etymology
thereof,</hi> &amp;c. London, 1663. 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>. who, in
his Preface, does inform the Reader,
that <hi>he took occasion to publish his notes of
this Tenure, from the late printed Treatise
of that industrious Gentleman, Mr.</hi> William
Somner <hi>of</hi> Canterbury, that <hi>he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled
those first observations with these
Animadversions on his learned discourses:</hi>
that <hi>he entred not on this undertaking to
quarrel with him, or with a design to carp
at any thing, which he hath laboriously
written,</hi> &amp;c. This less accurate writer

of the name and of the custom
from the <hi>Saxons</hi> to the <hi>Britains;</hi> and to
prove it not proper to <hi>Kent,</hi> but of an
ancient use in other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
&amp;c. In all material points he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the opinion of Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> who
in other exceptions has made his own
defence in <hi>marginal Notes, on Mr.</hi> Silas
Taylor's <hi>Gavelkind History, correcting his
mistakes,</hi> &amp;c. And his own printed
treatise, when he was after conscious
of any omissions, or lighter errors, he
supplied and amended with his own
hand. Both the books so annotated are
now in the <hi>Canterbury</hi> Archives, and
will be of great use to the next Editor
of this very excellent <hi>Treatise of Gavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>

            <p>Tho' our Author publisht nothing
more in his own name; yet he was a
fellow-labourer in many other works.
Particularly in the <hi>second Tome of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>

in the margin amended the infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
He had before done the same
justice to the first Tome; of which he
publicly complain'd, that the version

of the Church; for which the
world will praise him, and may God
reward him. I have now done with the
works and more public services of Mr.
<hi>Somner,</hi> as an Antiquary and an Author.
I would only invite you to look back
upon his Loyalty to the King, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Church, and his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
to all the world.</p>
            <p>His Loyalty was firm and constant,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58884:51"/>
not depending on interest, which might
change; but upon a judgement, which
could not alter. He adher'd to his <hi>Royal
Master,</hi> and dar'd to suffer with him.
A man of his parts and acquaintance,
might have chosen his office from the
usurping state, and his portion of lands
from the dissolved Church. But he
would accept of nothing from those
who had no right to give; choosing
rather to suffer affliction. He could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
his whole family to the same
principles. Both his brothers were true
and zealous in the same cause. <hi>Iohn</hi>
who was afterwards <hi>Wood-Reve</hi> to the
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> a
Major in the Militia of <hi>Kent;</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
at the head of a party in the
last effort, which was made by the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists
in that County, 1648. engag'd
the rebels at <hi>Wye</hi> with very unequal
force: and tho' he might have safely
retir'd, or secur'd his life by asking, he
fought on, and fell with honour. Our
Author's profession and genius had less
adapted him for arms; but he was no
less zealous to assert the rights of the
Crown, and the Laws of the land, by
all the means which his capacity could
use. When no endeavours could stop
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58884:51"/>
the madness of the people, nor save
the effusion of Royal blood; he could
no longer contain himself, but broke
into a passionate Elegy, <hi>The insecurity of
Princes, considered in an occasional medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon the King's late sufferings and
Death. Printed in the year,</hi> 1648. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.
And soon after he publisht another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
Poem, to which is prefixt the
Pourtraicture of <hi>Charles</hi> the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and this title,
<hi>The Frontispice of the King's book opened,
with a Poem annexed, The insecurity of
Princes,</hi> &amp;c. 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>. He waited all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to serve his banisht Prince; but
it was the fate of the honest Gentry to
be disappointed in all attempts, and
draw down the greater persecution
upon their own heads. Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> had
his share of sufferings from the jealous
powers, and, among other hardships,
was imprison'd in the Castle of <hi>Deal</hi> for
endeavouring to get hands to petition
for a <hi>Free Parliament;</hi> which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
would restore the Church and
King. Within a month or two, this
method, blesst by providence, gave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to him and all the Nation.</p>
            <p>If we next consider his zeal and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> we
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58884:52"/>
shall find them arising from a sense of
conscience, that no threats or flatteries
could move. His own primitive spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
inclin'd him to the Doctrine and
discipline of true Antiquity; and made
him naturally averse to change and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.
He helpt to sustain the old
foundations, as far as his strength and
art could do: and when he found they
must be overthrown, he was content
to be involv'd in the common ruines. He
murmured not, but made a soft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that <hi>he was overtaken by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
storm, and necessitated to betake
himself to other thoughts; chiefly how he
might secure himself against the fury, in
warding off the danger,</hi> &amp;c. Yet his cares
were more for the public interest, than
for his own fortunes: as <hi>Keeper</hi> of the
<hi>Archives,</hi> he had been allway faithful
in the trust committed to him: But
sacrilege and rapine, when they had
devour'd the holy things, would have
embezled or destroy'd all the Deeds
and Records, that convey'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
them. This was the practice of
those blest Reformers. At <hi>Peterburgh</hi> in
<hi>April 1643. a Regiment of horse under
Colonel</hi> Cromwell, <hi>forc'd open the Church
doors, tore in pieces the Common-Prayer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58884:52"/>
books, took away the Leiger-book of the
Church, broke into the Chapter-house, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sackt
the Records, broke the seals, tore the
writings, and left the floor cover'd over with

and made it a greater beauty of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;

the conscience of a Christian. Men
may profess any faith, or adopt any
cause; but it is innocence and honesty
alone, that can prove it a belief, and
not a pretension. This proof was given
by Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> who in all his writings
had been so plain and sincere that he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58884:54"/>
would not dissemble a truth, nor sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
a false invention. His profession
was, That <hi>he loved truth (the end of all
science) for itself; and was all together an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biast

How do most Historians betray
a partial regard to their Nation, or
their party? How many pretenders to
Antiquity, have conceal'd the notice of
whatever oppos'd their own fancy: and
rais'd the apparition of Records, to
justifie the cause for which they wrote?
Especially, how do most describers of
their native soil, take pains to flourish
and disguise; and (like Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Embassador) think it even a merit
to lie for the honour of their Country?
Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> had a probity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of spirit, that made him abhor
all such artifice and guile. Let one
short instance serve. There were two
specious traditions, that seem'd much
to illustrate the credit of our County.
1. That the <hi>Kentish-men</hi> were the only
<hi>English</hi> who maintain'd their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
against <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58884:55"/>
under the conduct of <hi>Stigand</hi> Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and <hi>Aegelfina</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines,</hi>
march'd with boughs, and made
their composition at <hi>Swansco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 2. That,
of all Counties, <hi>Kent</hi> alone enjoy'd an
immunity from the tenure of villenage,
a priviledge continued to them by the
said Conqueror. Tho for the honour
of his mother County, he might have
been glad to defend these titles; yet
having found them false, he scorn'd
to appear an Advocate for them; but
refutes them <hi>as Monkish figments, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticly
devis'd</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Treat. of</hi> Gavelkind. p. 63, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Somner's</hi> whole life was like his
writings, void of prejudice and passion:
he had that civility, which <hi>Caesar</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to have been peculiar to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Kent</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Caesar's <hi>Comment.</hi> 1. 6.</note>; and that firm reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
which made our Country-men
claim an ancient privilege, of being
plac'd in the front of a battel<note n="3" place="bottom">Lambards <hi>Perambulat.</hi> p. 11.</note>. He
was courteous, without design; was
wise, without a trick: and faithful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a reward. Humble, and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
moderate, and equal: never fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his afflictions: nor elated by
the favours of Heaven, and good men.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58884:55"/>
It was his charity, and purity of heart,
that prefer'd him to the Mastership of
St. <hi>Iohn's Hospital,</hi> in the suburbs of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,
An.</hi> 1660. In which station he
did not substract from the pietance of
the poor, nor use any arts to rob the
spittle; but was tender of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and zealous of their rights. By
his interest and courage, he recovered
some parts of their endowment, of
which by the Commissioners on the
Stat. 37. of <hi>Henry 8. it had been fleeced,
at other like places, by the sacrilegious pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feries
of those ravenous and wretched
times</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">1. <hi>Antiq.</hi> Cant. p. 94.</note>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was for the same plain and
open honesty, that at the Restauration,
he was appointed Auditor of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> by the Dean and
Chapter, to whom he was a Father and
friend, more than an honorary servant.
He entertain'd them in his own house,
till their own were clear'd from the
Fanatic intruders, and made conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for them. He deliver'd back all
their preserv'd writings, inform'd them
of all their late alienated lands: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
all their Fines, and digested all
accounts to universal satisfaction.
This settled him such an interest in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58884:56"/>
that Body, and all the members of it;
that no private man had an equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and authority: which he never
employ'd, but to promote some act of
charity and justice. He was frequently
entrusted by the Dean and Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to supervise the public School, to
examine Lads, that should be elected
King's Scholar's; and, upon the like trial,
to judge who were most fit for removal
to the Universities: in which, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
were exact; and his favours were
impartial. His endeavours were to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the interest and honour of the
School, to as high a pitch, as while he
was himself a member of it: when his
master Mr. <hi>Iohn Ludd, some years before he
died, affirm'd, he had thirty seven Masters
of Arts of his own bringing up</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">England <hi>described by</hi> Edw. Leigh. <hi>p.</hi> 108.</note>. Dr. <hi>Tho.
Turner</hi> the worthy Dean, had a most
peculiar esteem for him, and paid him
the frequent visits of a most familiar
friend. All the neighbouring Clergy,
whom he knew to be of good principles,
and honest conversation, he assisted
with his knowledge, his interest, and
his free advice. I remember to have
often heard my Honour'd Father dwell
much upon the fair character of Mr.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58884:56"/>
               <hi>Somner,</hi> and represent him as a Patron
and protector of all the regular Clergy.
Of his resolute and incorrupted honesty,
there can be no greater argument than
this. Among all his temptations, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
offices, to high and arbitrary fees:
among the easy advantages to be brib'd:
and the just expectances to be rewarded:
among the many opportunities of shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Churches treasure: and
taking leases of their land: among the
most ready and effectual means to raise
an estate, and advance a family: He
left but a small competence, which if
not frugally manag'd, could never have
answered the support of his Widow,
and the education of his Children.</p>
            <p>By his last Will he gave several Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
to the poor, and a kind remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
to Mr. <hi>Stockar</hi> then Minister of
St. <hi>Aelphege. Canterbury.</hi> In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his last illness, he took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to tell his Wife, that through
his whole life, he had never been let
blood, nor taken any phisic, which is
a just argument, not only of his happy
constitution; but of his exact tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and sobriety. The day of his
birth was the day of his death, <hi>March</hi>
30. 1669. aged 63. years; according to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58884:57"/>
the account given by his Wife and Son,
who report it from tradition, and some
better grounds. But a Certificate from
the Register-book of St. <hi>Margaret's Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi>
under the hand of of Mr. <hi>Tho.
Iohnson,</hi> represents him to be baptiz'd
<hi>Novemb. 5th.</hi> 1598. by which, his age
must reach to seventy years, five months,
&amp;c. Which length of days had allmost
made him (as <hi>Queen Christina,</hi> said lately
of her self and <hi>Rome</hi>) one of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of the City. He was buried <hi>Apr.</hi>
the 2. within the Church of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet's,</hi>
where many of his Ancestors
lay interr'd. His grave is distinguisht
by no stone, or inscription on it. An
omission, that, I presume, was more
owing to his own modesty, than any
disrepect of his surviving friends. Yet
I cannot but admire and lament, that
such learned ashes should lye without
a letter on them: that he who rais'd
the memory of so many great names,
should himself sleep in a place forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
and after all his labours, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the tombs and epitaphs of others,
should have no such decent ceremony
paid to his own dust. Sure the time
will come, when some grateful monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be erected for him, either
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58884:57"/>
by some one of his family, whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
shall enable to pay that duty:
or by some one generous lover of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities:
or by that Capitular body, to
whom he did such great service, and
such great honour.</p>
            <p>He was twice married. His first wife
was Mrs. <hi>Elisabeth Thurgar,</hi> born of a
good family in <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> with
whom he liv'd in love and peace about
thirty years: and had by her four chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
three daughters, and one son, all
dead. His second wife was <hi>Barbara</hi>
daughter of Mr. <hi>Iohn Dawson,</hi> a <hi>Kentish</hi>
Gentleman, (a great sufferer in the long
Rebellion) by whom he had one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that died unmarried, and three
sons, of which two are now living:
<hi>William Somner</hi> M. A. late of <hi>Merton
Coll. Oxon.</hi> now Vicar of <hi>Liminge</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>
our worthy friend: and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises

late Vicar of <hi>Elham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His many well selected books, and
choice Manuscripts, were purchas'd by
the Dean and Chapter, who knew the
great value of them, and what a noble
addition they would make to the public
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58884:58"/>
Library of that Church: where they
now remain an inestimable treasure.
The catalogue of his <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> I will
subjoin to his life, in the same order and
words, wherein you have transmitted
the account, not doubting your care
and exactness in it.</p>
            <p>Many of his notes, and looser papers
were carried from his study to the
<hi>Audit-house,</hi> within the precincts of
<hi>Christ-Church;</hi> where they were unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
burnt, by a fire which hapned
in that place soon after his death. By
this and other accidents, his letters and
many memorials of his life are lost.
Had they continued to us, we should
have better trac'd his friendship and
correspondence, with most of the men
of honour and learning in that age.
From the obscure hints, that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
I shall mention some of them.</p>
            <p>First. <hi>Arch-bishop Laud, by whose favour
and goodness, he subsisted in his place and
profession</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">1. <hi>Ep. Ded. Antiq.</hi> Canterb.</note>; who made great use of him

of the <hi>Diocese</hi> and <hi>Cathedral,
An.</hi> 1636. For which dutiful assistance,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58884:58"/>
Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> was publicly charg'd by
those foreigners, as accessory to their
troubles<note n="1" place="bottom">Troubles of the foreign Churches in <hi>Kent.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>.</note>: and he bore from all Schisf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
parties, a greater share of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
and persecution, for being (in
the brethren's language) one of <hi>Laud's
creatures.</hi> The great esteem that Prelate
had for him, was not so much for his
faithfulness and dexterity in discharge
of his office, as for his profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Antiquities. For as no one
part of learning was unrewarded by
that <hi>Great Soul:</hi> so he had a most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
respect to <hi>Historians,</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries.</hi>

posterity, Iune</hi> 10. 1643. This was the
prudence and honour of that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to consider useful and beneficial
men; and should indeed be the spirit
of all Patrons, to respect such as can
serve them, and the public. For this
dependance, and these favours, Mr.

affront to the world: and often seems
a libel to the Author, and Editor of

of justice to the Author, and of

was and gave the occasion
of the place's first emergency, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and leaving that, which formerly

if happily that one inundation did it

               </note>
that at least a probable conjecture may
hence be grounded of its emergency by

shelf (the <hi>Goodwyn</hi>) although it were a
kind of shallow lying between the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
and the <hi>Flemish</hi> coast, yet until
so much of the water sound a vent and
out-let into the neighbouring parts of
<hi>Flanders</hi> and the Low-countries, was
allways so far under water, as it never
lay dry, but had such a high sea run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over it, as it no way endangered
the Navigator; the sea or channel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as safely passable and navigable
there as elsewhere. But so much of the
water betwixt us and them having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58884:80"/>
its wonted and ordinary current
and confines, and gained so much more
elbow-room and evacuation into those
drowned parts on the other side, (the
sea usually losing in one place what it
gains in another) this shelf (the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi>)
from thenceforth, for want of that
store of water which formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layd
it, became (what it is) a kind of
<hi>arida,</hi> a sand-plott, deserted of that
water's surface in which it was formerly
immersed.</p>
            <p>This (for ought I perceive) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
enough, and hath nothing that
I can see, to oppose or controul it, but
the name (the <hi>Goodwyn</hi>) which indeed

whether by the <hi>Goodwyn</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

wonder, that it held up so long, than
that it decayed no sooner, in regard
of the danger of the passage between,

(says he) <hi>having two goodly spiring steeples.
In the entring into the Quire is one of the
fairest and most ancient Crosses that ever
I saw, nine foot in height; it standeth like
a fair column. The basis is a great stone,
it is not wrought: the second stone being
round, hath curiously wrought and painted
the image of our</hi> Saviour Christ, Peter,
Paul, John <hi>and</hi> James: <hi>Christ saith,</hi> Ego
sum Alpha &amp; Omega. <hi>Peter saith</hi> Tu
es Christus filius Dei vivi. <hi>The sayings
of the other three were painted</hi> majus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis
literis Romanis, <hi>but now oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
The second stone is of the Passion.
The third stone contains the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
The fourth hath the image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
hanging and fastned with four nails,</hi>
&amp; sub pedibus sustentaculum: <hi>the highest
part of the Pillar hath the figure of a Cross.
In the Church is a very ancient Book of
the Evangelies,</hi> in majusculis literis Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis;
<hi>and in the borders thereof is a
Crystal stone thus inscribed,</hi> Claudia Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piccus.
<hi>In the North-side of the Church is
the figure of a Bishop painted under an
arch. In digging about the Church they find
old buckles and rings. The whole print of
the Monastery appears by the old wall;
and the Vicarage was made of the ruines of
the Monastery. There is a neglected Chappel
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58884:108"/>
out of the Church-yard, where some say
was a Parish-Church before the Abby was
suppress'd and given to the Arch-bishop of</hi>
Canterbury.</p>
            <p>And yet to do the place right,<note place="margin">Dignity of the Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Reculver.</hi>
               </note> for

until I have given some further

there, the Parson or Rector whereof,
when in being, and when petit Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical

as afterward and at this day the

purpose to the Rector there for the
time being, both from the Arch-bishop

            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58884:108"/>
Now for his Church; it was and is a
Mother-Church, upon which of old
depended four Chappels of ease, <hi>Hoth,
Hearn,</hi> and in <hi>Thanet, St. Nicholas</hi> and
<hi>All-Saints.</hi> Upon the three last of
which, for the Mother-Churche is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
honour and dignity, or <hi>in signum
subjectionis,</hi> (as the instrument runs) an
annual pension to the Vicar of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culver,</hi>
upon the founding of that, with
those other Vicarages of <hi>Hearn</hi> and
<hi>St. Nicholas,</hi> was imposed; the Vicar of
of <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> and <hi>All-Saints</hi> being
charged with <hi>3l. 3s. 4d.</hi> per annum, and
the other of <hi>Hearn</hi> with <hi>40s.</hi> per annum.
And as the Vicars of these dependant
or annexed Chappels were under this
charge and burthen to him of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
or Mother-Church, so the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners
and people of those Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelries,
however gratified and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
with Chappels of ease for les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening
their trouble, by shortning their
way to Church, whether for divine
service in their life time, or interment
after death; yet (as the law in that case
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58884:109"/>
requires, where no privilege or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
from it is indulged at or by the
first foundation or following prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption)
where it seems left as liable and
subject to the repair of the Mother-Church
of <hi>Reculver,</hi> as the peculiar and
proper inhabitants of the place, and
themselves, before the Chappels erected
by laws, were: a thing controverted
between them of <hi>Hearn</hi> and <hi>Reculver,</hi>
in Arch-bishop <hi>Stratford</hi>'s days, who
after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cognizance taken of the cause

seen under seal, whereof I have a copy
by me) in behalf of the <hi>Reculverians,</hi>
condemning and adjudging those of
<hi>Hearn</hi> to the repair of the Mother-Church.
Much contest and dispute
hereabouts have hapned afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the succeeding inhabitants, until
by a decree (which as I remember I
have seen) of Arch-bishop <hi>Warham,</hi> in
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's days, the difference
was, by and with the consent of all
parties, thus finally composed: <hi>That the
people of each Chappel</hi> (Hearn <hi>and</hi> St. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas)
<hi>should redeem the burthen of repairs
with the payment of a certain moderate
annual stipend or pension in money, payable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58884:109"/>
at a certain set day in the year, but with
this Proviso, that if they kept not their day,
but overslipt it, they were then laid open,
and exposed to the law, and must fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as full an obligation to the repairs of
the Mother-Church, as if that decree had
never been.</hi> At which pass (I take it) the
matter now stands, and so is like to do,

to alter it.</p>

about me, whilst I give the go by to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58884:111"/>
that Castle within the Castle, that
noble and goodly pile there called the
<hi>Kings-keep,</hi> with the wall or fore-fence
surrounding it; I rather chuse to think,
that which at present is, and for many
ages past hath been the Church or
Chappel to the Castle, either to have
risen out of the ruines of that Roman
fortress, or that at least the square
tower in the middle thereof, between
the Body and the Chancel, fitted with
holes on all parts for speculation, to
have been the very Roman <hi>specula</hi> or
watch-tower: at the same time with
<hi>Twine,</hi> conceiving that which at this day
they call the Divel's drop, a mouldring

I have ready by me (if occasion be)

            <p>
               <hi>Stonar</hi> then is but a contraction of

with<note n="1" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> grounds his opinion very rationally upon this foundation, that among the accounts of the <hi>Reditus de Walda,</hi> he had never seen any sort of services express'd, for which they pay'd their rents; whereas in the accounts of all the Tenants without the <hi>Weald,</hi> there is express mention made for what special, cause the same rent grew payable. From whence he infers that those payments (differing from others both in quantity and quality) could not be quit-rents for any service, as the rest were.</note> Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> in his opinion,<note place="margin">Quit-rents pay'd out of the Weald.</note>
that the <hi>Weald</hi> of old yielded no quit-rents,
customs, or services, as other
places; in regard I find the contrary
very often. And no marvel; for albeit
there were of old no Mannors in the
<hi>Weald,</hi> yet the lands lying there (when
once cultivated and manured) being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
to and depending on Mannors
elsewhere, the Tenants in respect of
and proportion to their holdings and
tenancies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be and were lyable to
the Lord of the Mannor, whereof they
held for services and customs, as other
Tenants elsewhere. For besides <hi>fealty,
