            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RIght woorshipfull, it is not vnknowne, that fundry means haue from time to time been offered and vsed, for the reclaiming and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of such as dangerously follow the spirit of errour, and dayly reuoult to the Romish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which hath beene aduanced by tyrany, defended by lyes, and is now sought to be restored againe by tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and rebellions. But notwithstanding the many meanes which heretofore haue beene wisely practised, we see of late the aduersaries of the grace of god as a pestilent brood of vipers mightily to increase and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, sending abroad swarmes of their Iesuites and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Priestes, not onely to infect the people of the land with the leauen of false doctrine, and to sow their darnel in the lords field, but to seduce them from their alleageance and to stir vp sedition: for the lessening of whose number and suppressing of their power, nothing is more necessary then to establish a godly and learned ministery in euery congregation. And howsoeuer whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lawes haue beene enacted, penalties increased, conferences with them vsed, disputations offered, their books answered, and sundry other wayes taken by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and ministers: yet we shall neuer attaine the ende of our desired hopes, vntill euery church haue a learned and painefull Pastor to be resident and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among them.

Hence it is that the Iesuits who haue gotten the dominion ouer the rest of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, spare no labour, refuse no paines, let passe no practise by word or writing, to effect their purposes.

And it is mine earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that all those, which were the daily auditors of this doctrine, would now afresh examine themselues, and take an account of their memories, to see what was long agoe forgotten, which heere again is newly published. Whereby we shall learne, how easily good thinges (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially such things as accompany saluation) doe slip from vs, and by the tentations of Satan become fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. Besides, the doctrine heer deliuered is after a sort a plant of your owne setting, and fruit of your owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring: so that it acknowledgeth it selfe due of right vnto your selfe, flying vnto you as to a sanctuarye and city of refuge, and seeking harbour against the barkings and bitings of the malicious and enuyous, of whom the wise Phylosopher speaketh  <hi>Male de te loquuntur, bene nesciunt loqui: faciunt non quod mereor, sed quod solent.

He gaue the <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 6, 14.</note> Arke to <hi>Noah</hi> and his sonnes, to confirm them in the promise which he made


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16298:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them, that they should not be drowned with the rest of the world. He added to <hi>Abraham</hi> (<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 17. 11.</note>) the signe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, as a seale (<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 4, 11</note>) of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of faith: and to the Israelites he gaue the Passeouer, <hi>Manna,</hi> oblations, purifications, the brazen Serpent, the Rock, and such like spirituall tipes, whereby he assured them of the promise, that God for the onely sacrifice of Christ vvrought vpon the Crosse, would giue to all that beleeue forgiuenesse of sinnes and euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>Now the world of God may fitly be resembled to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and euidences: and the <note n="b" place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t between the Word &amp; sacraments.</note> Sacraments to seales, which the Lord alone setteth to his owne letters. They are as a visible Sermon preaching vnto vs most liuely the promises of God: that as the vvord we hear doth edifie and instruct the minde by the outward eares, so doth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the eyes &amp; other senses. First then, that we may vnderstand the doctrine and nature os the Sacraments: we are to consider, what the word &amp; Sacraments haue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and how they agree one with another: then, what they haue peculiar and proper each to other, and how they differ one from an other. The agreement betweene them standeth in these points. First, both are ofGod, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the holy ghost vseth to this end, to make vs more and more one with Christ, and partakers of saluation: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that God needeth them, or that he is tyed vnto them (for as he can nourish without meate and drinke, so he can saue without word or Sacraments:) but because we neede them, he vseth them when he will, and as often as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him. The same which is published and promised by the word of God, is signified and sealed by the Sacraments. For they are not a deliuering of new promises and articles of faith, but seale vp such as are offered in the word. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, although god vse them as instruments of his grace, yet the especiall working and forcible power of them, is not in them, but dependeth on God alone: so that we must not thinke that whosoeuer partaketh them is partaker of grace, saluation, for giuenesse of sinnes, and euerlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16298:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the vertue of them floweth from him onely as from a fountaine. A man may heare the word and receiue the Sacraments al the daies of his life and be neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except God change the minde, open the heart, enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the vnderstanding, clense the conscience, and sanctifie the affections to his glory. Thirdly, as the preaching of the word profiteth nothing, vnlesse it be vnderstood, applyed, and receiued, but (<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 4. 1.</note>) tendeth to iudgement: so the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except we bring the hand of faith with vs, cannot giue vs faith nor grace, but tend to our condemnation. Yet, as the Gospel is alwaies the sauour of life vnto life of it own nature, and the (<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 4, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note>) word liuely and of comfortable opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, howsoeuer the vnfaithfull turne it to be the sauour of death vnto death: So the Sacramentes cease not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be true Sacraments, although they be administred by vnworthy ministers, and receiued by vnsaithfull people. For mans wickednesse cannot peruert, much lesse euert the nature of Gods ordinance. Lastly, as the best seede sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not vp and bringeth not fruite so soone as it is sowne, but lieth a time couered in the earth to take rooting: so the fruite reaped by the word, and benifit receiued by the Sacraments presently appeareth not, but groweth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth at the time appointed of God, who will blesse them in his elect, at what season himselfe hath ordained.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what the word and Sacraments haue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, both are instruments of the same grace, both haue their benifit, blessing, and force depending on God, both require faith to be mingled with them, without which they are vnprofitable, and lastly they profit not by and by at the same moment they are published, administred, heard, or receiued: but God afterward worketh often-times by them in his children to their great comfort, when all fruite to come by them seemed to be buried. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at the first vnderstood no more of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the vnbeleeuing <hi>Iewes,</hi> when he sayde, (3) <hi>Destroy</hi>

wordes hee spake vnto them. So when they saw Christ ryding to <hi>Hcirusalem,</hi> the multitude spreading their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the way, and cutting downe branches (<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 21, 8</note>) from the trees, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Thus much of the things that are common to the word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>In the next place let vs see <note n="m" place="margin">Difference betvveen the word and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> what they haue proper and peculiar, and so differ one from another. First, forasmuch as the Sacraments are appurtenances and dependances to the word, and are applyed to this end to seale vp our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, and our fellowship one with another: it appeareth that in men of riper yeares the teaching and hearing of the word preached, and the open confession and profession of faith did go before participation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>Math.</hi> 28. (<note n="n" place="margin">Math. 28, 19</note>) <hi>Go, teach all Nations,</hi> that is, make them disciples of Christ, gaue them to the faith (as the <hi rend="sup">o</hi> worde signifieth) and then Baptize them. Thus Phillip <note place="margin">Matheteusate.</note> taught the <hi>Eunuch</hi> before he baptized him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. to whom when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> said, (<note place="margin">Acts 8, 36</note>) <hi>What letteth me to be baptized?</hi> Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip answered, <hi>If thou beleeuest with all thine hart, thou maiest:</hi> and he said <hi>I beleeue that Iesus Christ is the sonne of God. And act. 10 Can any forbid water</hi> (<note n="q" place="margin">Acts. 10, 47.</note>) <hi>that these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy ghost as wel as we?</hi> In deede touching chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens baptizme, there is another especiall respect to be had, of which we shal speake <note n="r" place="margin">Booke. 2 Chap. 6, and 7.</note> afterward. But touching others, this is in difference between them, that where as the worde was offered euen to such as were out of the Church not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard of the name of Christ, and none excluded or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the hearing of it, whether beleeuers or (<note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor 20, 24</note>) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16298:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
holy, or prophane. 1 <hi>Cor. 14. No person being an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer or infidell, was euer admitted to the Sacraments, although he shuld offer himselfe</hi> (for that had bin to <hi>giue</hi> (<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 7, 6</note>) <hi>that which is holy to Dogs, and to cast pearles before Swine</hi>) but such onely as were instructed in the faith, &amp; had made publike confession therof as members of the church. An other difference is in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, end, and vse of the one and of the other. The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word is the ordinarye meanes and instrument of the holy ghost to beget and beginne faith in vs (except God doe deale extraordinaryly, which of vs is not to bee looked for) and none hath entrance to Christ but by faith: so that men, if they will be saued, must heare it. But the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes are of another nature, they cannot ingender faith in vs: we must bring faith with vs, least wee partake them vnworthyly, so that hee which beleeueth, and could not come to the Sacramentes, is yet partaker of saluation. Wherefore the necessity of them is not simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely so great, that without exception a man cannot be saued without them: for it is the contempt, not the want of them that bringeth danger and damnation. Thirdly, it may sometimes fall out, that in a visible Church, the worde preached may bee founde (as an essentiall note of the Church) without the Sacraments, and yet be a true Church of God: so that the worde may bee without the Sacramentes, but the Sacramentes cannot be without the worde, as a writinge may be without a seale, but not the seale without the writing. Set a seale to a blanke, and is it not vaine, voyde, and vnprofitable? Last of all, the Preaching of the word rouseth and affecteth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye one of the senses, to witte, the eares, wee fee it not, wee touch it not, wee handle it not, onely wee heare the sound thereof: but the Sacramentes are offered to the eyes as wel as to the eares, so that we do euen behold Iesus Christ as it wer crucified before vs, nay they moue &amp; stir vp the rest of the senses, wherby we may vnderstand what they bring &amp; how they auaile vnto our faith, making vs after a sort to handle christ with our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, to see him with our eies,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16298:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to tast him and touch him with our whole body. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they do <note n="4" place="margin">How the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all then the Word.</note> more seale vp then the word, not that God is more true of his promise when hee worketh by signes, then when he speaketh by his word: but in respect of the manner of teaching and receiuing, because by his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he representeth his promises as it were painted in a Table, <note n="a" place="margin">Horat. lib. de arte poeti. Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius irritant animos, demis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa per aures, quam quae sut oculis subiecta fidelibus, &amp;c.</note> and setteth them forth liuely as in a picture before our eies, that we may not only heare, but see, handle, touch, tast, and euen digest them. Again, the promise of the Gospel is more effectually declared and sealed vp by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then by the bare worde, not for the substance and matter it selfe, but for the manner of working, which is heedfull, perfect, and more effectuall: so as that which we perceiue and receiue by many senses as hearing and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is more sure and certaine then that which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Hitherto of the agreements and differences betweene the word &amp; sacraments, and we haue shewed that so soon as god gaue his word, immediately he seconded the same with his Sacraments. The vses which wee are to make heereof are <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> these. First, seeing God contenteth not himselfe with the worde onely, but addeth the Sacraments in all Ages and times of the Church, which proceedeth partly through his owne goodnesse, and partly from mans weakenesse: we ought to be so farre from d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>spising the Sacramentes, that contrary-wise vve must confesse the benifit, vse, and worthynesse of them can neuer be sufficiently magnified, and commended, nor they with sufficient reuerence be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. We are dull to conceiue his promises and slovv to remember them, we are full of doubting and vnbeleefe: we are like to <hi>Thomas</hi> (<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 20. 25.</note>) one of the disciples, we will not beleeue them vntill in some sort vve see them, and in some measure feele them in our hearts. Wherefore God hath ordained these misteries and holy actions, to keepe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall memory his great benifits bestovved vpon man, to seale vp his promises, and as it were to offer vnto our sight those things which inwardly he performeth to vs, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16298:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by strengtheneth and increaseth our faith through the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his spirit in our soules. Seing then the word is not sufficient, but the Sacraments were added for further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: we must in this behalfe consider the great goodnesse of God toward vs, who doth not onely giue vs faith by his word as by his sauing instrument, but hath also added to his word, Sacraments or seales of his promise and grace, that by the lawfull vse of them he might vphold and strengthen our faith through his blessed spirit. For in asmuch as the Lord not only sent the blessed seede, for the redemption of mankind, for the remission of our sinnes, and for the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Serpents head, but ordained for vs Sacramentes to be pledges of his promises, testimonies of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and remedies of our distrust: wee must confesse and thankfullye acknowledge the bottomlesse depth of gods endlesse mercy toward vs, who vouchsafeth to be our God, to be reconciled to vs being vile and miserable sinners, to make a league and couenant with dust and ashes, and dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers his onely sonne to suffer the shamefull death of the Crosse for vs. And withall we must labour more and more to feele our own blindnesse, distrust, infidelity, and peruerse nature, we would easily forget this mercy of God, vnlesse it had beene continually represented before our eies.</p>
               <p>Againe, seeing nothing is offered and giuen in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> which is not published in the Gospell, seeing they cannot bee where there is no worde, and seeing the same Christ with all his benifits is propounded in both: it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with a common corruption and lamentable practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many professors, that desire and craue, especially in sicknesse and extremety, often to come to the Lords table, but esteeme little of the preaching of the word, and that seeme to languish with a longing after the Sacrament, but neuer mourne and lament for want of the word: which is as great an errour and madnesse, as if one should euer looke vpon the seale of his writings, but neuer regard the conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his estate. Is there not one God, the author of both? Is there not one spirit, that sealeth vp his promises by both?


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16298:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is Christ diuided; that speaketh euidently vnto vs in both? How is it then, that many desire the Sacrament of the Lords supper and seeme to pine away through want therof, who neuer wish or regard the preaching of the Gospell, which is the foode of the soule, the keye of the kingdome, the immortall seede of regeneration, and the high ordinance of God to saue those (<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 1, 16 and 10, 14.</note>) that beleeue? And whence proceedeth it, but from palpable ignorance in the matters of God and their owne saluation, to be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that the Sacrament is not brought vnto them, and yet neuer conet to haue a word of comfort spoken to them in due season. Let all such persons vnderstand, that as the minister (<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 15, 21 and 19. 4. and 2. 42, 46.</note>) is charged from God to teach euery saboth day, and to preach the word in season and out of season: to deale the bread to the hungry, and to gie vnto euery one in the family his portion: so is it required of all the people to desire the sincere milke of the word of God that they may grow thereby, which, howsoeuer it be to them that perish, foolishnesse; yet to such as are called (<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 24.</note>) it is the wisedome of God and the power of God. Wherefore, we must not make account that there is lesse danger in neglecting the word of God, then in neglecting the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his last supper: but we must take heede, that while we willingly desire the one, we doe not willingly despise the other. For we must carefully consider, that as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a visible word, so the word is a speaking Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and as God lifteth vp his voice vnto vs in the one, so he reacheth out his hand vnto vs in the other. We must as well heare when he calleth, as receiue when he offereth. Now, by his word preached, he calleth: by his Sacraments administred, he offereth his graces vnto vs: and, as wee must haue eares for the one, so must we haue hands for the other.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N euery treatise and discourse, it is necessary first to know <note n="a" place="margin">Arist. poster. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note> whether a thing be, before we consider what it is. We haue heard before, that there are Sacraments and euer haue beene in the Church of God. Now then let vs consider what they are, that <note n="b" place="margin">Cicero de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. lib. 1.</note> first the matter handled, may be defined. For in vaine we shall reason and speake of the Sacraments, vnlesse we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what a Sacrament is. But besore we set downe any discription of it, it shall not be amisse to speake some what of the word. The name in so many letters and silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is <note n="c" place="margin">The word Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> not indeede in the scripture, no more then the word Trinity, catholike, Consubstantiall, and such like: which being generally receiued are not to be reiected, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine contained vnder them agreeth with the Scripture, and nothing by them is added to the Scripture. Now as the fathers of the Greeke Church called these holy rites by name of Misteries, because the substance of them was onely knowne to the members of the Church, and hidden from others: so the ancient teachers of the Latine Church, called them Sacraments, in respect of the affinity and neerenesse betweene them and a Sacrament. For a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament properly is that solemne othe in Warre, by which Souldiers, bound themselues to their chiefe Captaine. Such a regard had the old Romaines in the discipline of their Warres, that it was <note n="d" place="margin">cicer. de of fic. Lib. 1.</note> not lawfull for any to kill an enemy, or enter into the battell to fight, vnlesse he were sworne a Souldier. So when we are partakers of these holy signes which God hath appointed in his Church, by which he


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16298:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bestoweth vpon vs spirituall gifts, <note n="e" place="margin">A Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t properly is the souldiers oth: metap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herically the churches ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d binding them to God.</note> we do bind our selues to him, wee professe openly his true religion, we vowe to fight vnder his banner against our enimies: so that they are testimonies and tokens of the couenant betweene God and vs, that he is our god, and we bind our selues to be his people, to serue him and no other god. So circumcision was a seale of Gods promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a seal of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> faith and obedience toward god. By them man is bound to God, and God vouchsafeth to bind himselfe to man. Wherfore, the word sacrament, being translated from the campe to the Church, from the soldiour to a christian, from a ciuill vse to an holy, let vs see in this sence and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification what it is. Now, the word being borrowed from warres, is <note n="f" place="margin">A Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t considered 2. vvaies.</note> taken two waies: first in a generall significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may comprehend al maner of signes, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, or myraculous, or voluntary, which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men to vse, to assure them of the vndoubted truth of his promise: as when he gaue to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden, the tree of life to be a pledge of his immortality, the Rain-bow to <hi>Noah</hi> and his posterity; sometimes he gaue them mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous signes, as light in a smoaking Furnace to <hi>Abraham;</hi> the fleece wet, the earth being dry, and the earth wet, the fleece being dry, to <hi>Gideon:</hi> to promise and performe vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory to <hi>Gedeon.</hi> In this large acception of the worde, we do not intreat of the Sacraments: we speak properly of those, which God hath left to be ordinary in his Church, to bee seales of our communion with Christ, and of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes which is by faith. A Sacrament <note n="g" place="margin">What a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is</note> thus considered is <hi>a visible signe and seale ordained of God, whereby Christ and all his sauing graces by certaine outward rites are signified, exhibited, and sealed vp vnto vs.</hi> In this description, we are to consider these 3. things. First the whole kind or general: secondly, the cause or author thereof: and lastly the vse of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deliuered. Touching the first, wheras it is said that a sacrament is a visible signe and seale, this is prooued and confirmed in sundry places of the scripture as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of circumcision, (he saith) <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 17. 11</note> 
                  <hi>It shall be a signe, of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:16298:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
betweene me and thee.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. speaking of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (he saith) <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>he receyued the signe of circvmcision as a seale of the righteousnesse of faith.</hi> Indeed a signe and a seale differ one from another, as the generall from the especiall: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seale is a signe, but euery signe is not a seale. A seale cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth, assureth, and confirmeth a thing: a signe only shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: but a Sacrament doth both. It is a signe to signifie and represent: a seale to ratifie and assure: an instrument to confer and conueigh Christ with al his benifits to them that truely beleeue in him: a pledge vnto vs of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: a visible word, and as a notable glasse wherein we may behold <note n="k" place="margin">Agust. de. doct. christ. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note> assured testimonies of Gods eternall fauour, &amp; of the riches of his grace which he bestoweth vpon vs. This teacheth vs to acknowlege, there is more inthe Sacraments then is seen with the eies, or felt with the hands: &amp; therfore we must not conceiue vnreueretly of them, nor come neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenly vnto them, making them meere carnal and outward things: but we must thinke reuerently, speake soberly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue humbly and penitently these holy misteries. Againe, heereby we are brought to beleeue the promises of god: for if the Sacraments be not only signes of his fauour but seales of our faith, can we doubt of his mercy and good meaning toward vs, hauing left such pawnes and pledges thereof with vs, that we might haue assured comfort and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assurance of saluation and eternall life. Is it not among men matter of assurance, and a note of true dealing, to haue a pledge left with vs? But behold God hath left vnto vs two pawnes of his promises, as it were an earnest-penny that our faith should not wauer. If then his alone word be al suffyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, hauing a noble addition of the Sacramentes, as of his seales, let vs beleeue his promises, and in all tentations rest vpon them with all confidence and consolation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is saide <note n="l" place="margin">Sacraments were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God alone.</note> a sacrament is a diuine ordinance. Not any Angell or Arch-angell, not any Prince or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, but onely God himselfe is the author and ordainer of the Sacramentes. This appeareth by many witnesses out of the worde of God, <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 9. 13. 14. 15.</note>

All these testimonies as a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses do confirm vs in this truth, that non hath power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tority in the church to institute a Sacrament, but God only. And the reasons are apparant. First, the Sacraments belong to the seruice &amp; worship of god: now it resteth not in man to appoint &amp; prescribe a seruice of God, but to retaine and embrace that which is taught by him, <hi>For</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>in vain they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, teaching for doctrines mens precepts.</hi> Againe; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall signes haue Gods promises annexed vnto them, confirming vs in the same, which they could not doe, but by the blessyng and benefit of him that promiseth: so that God onely is able to bestow grace, and he alone can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point true signes of grace. For as he only hath authority to seal the charter &amp; pardon, in whose iurisdiction it is to grant it: so likewise God giueth the pledges and tokens of his grace which sheadeth the graces of the spirit into our harts. Wherefore, the reuerent Sacraments of the Church, none can institute by his authority, but onely God: and hence it is, that the signes haue the names of the things signified. None but Christ himselfe could say of the bread, <hi>This is my body:</hi> none but he could say of the cup, <hi>This cup is the new testament in my blood:</hi> none but he, breathing on his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, could say, <hi>Receiue the holy ghost:</hi> none but he could make the water in Baptisme to be the lauer of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16298:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Let vs see what good and profitable vses arise from this doctrine. First, if the Sacramentes be the ordinances of <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> God, then they depend not one the worthynesse or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse, fitnesse or vnfitnesse, vices or vertues of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: but al the efficacy and force hangeth on the holy insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ Iesus. The ministers impiety &amp; wickednes maketh not a nullity of the Sacrament, neither hindreth the fruite of the worthy receiuer, no more then the piety and godlynesse of a faithfull minister can profit an vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuer. Indeede, the Church must indeuour, that the ministers thereof may be holy and vnblamable, according to the apostles <note n="r" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2. 3.</note> rule, but we must not mesure the profit of the receiuer, by the person of the minister. If a theefe doe steale a sack of corne, we see if he sow it, it groweth vp and bringeth forth increase, because the fault resteth not in the seede which is good, but in the sower which is euill: so doth the Sacrament profit the faithfull, howsoeuer he be vnfaithfull that doth administer it. We see if the seede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man haue foule, filthy, and vncleane hands that soweth, yet if the seede be cleane, sweete, and faire, it prospereth: so the holy things of God <note n="s" place="margin">

Thus we see, that whether the minister be good or euill, Godly or without Godlynesse, an heretike or a Catholike, an Idolater or a true worshipper of God, the effect is all one, the worthinesse of the Sacrament dependeth not on man, but proceedeth from God, and therefore all such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Sacraments of God for the Sacraledge of man, shall beare their condemnation whosoeuer they are. The two sonnes of <hi>Eli, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> were <note n="t" place="margin">1.

Sam. 3. 11</note> the whole land, and hee denounced such Iudgement to come vpon them, as whosoeuer shall heare thereof, both his eares should tingle. So then, the offence of the Priest,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16298:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was no defence of the people: but as the Priests gaue the offence, and the people tooke it, so God bound them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same Iudgement. So we must know, God will not beare the contempt of his ordinances vnder any pretence whatsoeuer of the ministers wickednesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthynesse, if his hand be corrupt, let thy heart be vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; though his sinnes be his owne, yet the Sacramentes be gods: he may minister comfort to thee, though he bring none to himselfe, as the workmen that builded the <hi>Arke</hi> prepared a meanes to saue other but were drowned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or as the belles though they moue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues yet serue to bring others to the exercises of religion, or as the Scribes that pointed the way to the wise-men, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vonchsafed not to step out of doores to enquire after Christ. The eares of corn do carry the corne with the chaffe to be purged and clensed in the barne, &amp; though the chaffe be vnprofitable, yet it profiteth the corne, as the Lanterne holdeth the candle to giue light vnto others that are the passengers. This appeareth by the words of Christ our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>Math. 23. The Scribes and Pharises sit in Moises seate:</hi>

This is that which the <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 3, 6. 7</note> Apostle teacheth 1 <hi>Cor. 3.

All Ceremonies therefore and rites <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As God onely can gratiously promise, so hee can onely effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what hee hath promised. Wherefore, we must condemne those as guilty of rebellion against God, that bouldly breake out either to deuise new Sacramentes, or to adde and detract from them that God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Wee are commaunded to rest in those that he hath appointed to the Church in his worde: for as well wee may deuise a new word, as deliuer a new Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee learne heereby, that they which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Sacramentes, and will not suffer them to be of <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> any force with themselues: and making small account of them doe esteeme them as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Let vs make vse of this point, and apply it to our selues. <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> First, is Christ the sum and substance of all Sacramentes? Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is heere condemned, that say we make the Sacraments bare and naked signes. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we shold say so, or make them to be so: they are the sure seales of Gods promises, heauenly tokens, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sigues, vnd autentike pledges of the grace, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of Christ giuen and imputed vnto vs. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and sacrifices of the olde testament were not bare signes. Circumcision was not <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 2. 28. 29.</note> a bare signe, as <hi>Rom. 2. This is not circumcision which is outwarde in the flesh but the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of the hart. And in Christ</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Col. 2. 11 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ye are circumcised with circumcision made without hands, by putting off the sinfull bodie of the flesh, through the circumcision of Christ.</hi> Euen so Baptisme is no bare signe, it were great blasphemy so to speake: it were verie great iniquity so to thinke. The grace of God doth worke with his Sacraments, and therefore the signes are neuer receiued in vaine of the faithfull and worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer. The water washeth not from sinne, the bread and wine feed not to eternall life: but it is the precious blood of Christ, that doth clense vs from all sin, &amp; purchaseth for vs all grace, which is the life and the truth of the outward signes.</p>
               <p>Againe, is Christ Iesus offered by God the Father in the <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> right vse of the Sacraments? then God doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or delude those that come vnto them. If anye that come to the Sacraments, depart without grace, without Christ, without fruite, the cause is in themselues, the fault is not in God, for <note n="l" place="margin">Christ is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all: but receiued onely of the faithfull.</note> hee offereth Christ to all, euen to the vnfaithfull, but they haue not hands to receiue him.

Prince should offer a rich present, and he, to whom it is offered, haue no hand to receiue it, he goeth away empty. When the Sunne giueth light vpon the earth, if men shut their eies and be wilfully blinde, they receiue no profit by it. When God offereth himselfe &amp; his graces to vs by his word and Gospell, it we stop our eares and harden our harts, it turneth to be the sauour of death to death: so is it in the Sacramentes when we come to them, God doth not feede our eies with naked, vaine, &amp; idle shewes, but ioyneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If we bring the hand of faith with vs, which openeth the gate of the kingdome of heauen for vs, Christ is both offered and giuen to vs. But howsoeuer the signe be alwaie, inseperably ioyned with the grace, that is signified, in respect of God: yet hence it followeth not that both of them are of all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For the outward signe is offered to the hand, to the senses, and instruments of the body, which because all bring with them, all are partakers of the outward parts. But Christ, who is signified by the signe, is offered to the soule and faith of the receiuer, <note n="m" place="margin">2. Thes. 3. 2.</note> which bycause many want, they lose the fruit of their worke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the right receiuers, receiue Christ, and with him all sauing graces needefull to eternall life: then the <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> presence of vngodly men, that come to the same Sacram. with vs and meete vs at the same Table, cannot hinder and hurt vs in our worthy receiuing. The vnbeleeuers and vnrepentant persons come indeede into the assembly of the faithfull, to heare the word of God read, preached, and expounded, and as they come without faith, so they depart without fruite: yet their company defileth not the sauing hearer. So is it in the Sacraments I confesse it were to be wished, that the church were pure without spot, and perfect without blemish, <note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note> and they euen cut off that trouble the same: yet sometimes it <note n="o" place="margin">Reuel. 2. 14. 20.</note> wanteth that good and Godly seuerity which is required, to seperate such as may infect with the leauen of their life and doctrine.</p>

Furthermore, as in an Army euery man hath his standing, so in the Church euery man hath his calling: it is not in the <note n="q" place="margin">priuat men are not to medle vvith the censures of the church</note> power of priuate persons, but of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church to draw out the censures of the Church against notorious offendors, and therefore in their slacking and negligence, the people must tolerate that which they cannot amend, or make a seperation or rent in the church, as the maner of some is, disturbing the peace and quietuesse thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if Christ be offered, giuen, and sealed vp to vs in the Sacraments: then the Sacraments must be holden of <note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> vs in great price and estimation, for their profites sake, not lightly to be regarded, but reuerently to be esteemed. They that respect Christ in whom the tresures of algraces are laid vp, must regard the Sacramentes of Christ: and such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them, reiect christ with all his benefites, which who so doth, sinneth against his own soule. Lastly, if they be signes <note place="margin">Vse. 5.</note> and seales of grace offered: then the Sacraments make not a christian, no more then the seal giueth the purchase or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. The faithfull and the children of the faithful are true christians, differing from Pagans and Heathen before they be baptized. And whosoeuer is not a christian before here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue baptisme, baptisme can make him none, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the seale of the graces of God and his priuiledges before receiued. The word of god and the Sacraments of god are both of one nature but the word is not able to confer grace, but only to declare and publish what god will confer, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to some it is the sauor <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> of death to death, therfore


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16298:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also the Sacraments of themselus do not confer and bestow grace, hauing it tyed vnto them, or shut vp in them. For if the Sacraments did actually and effectually giue grace, by inherent power and vertue in themselues: it would follow from hence, that euery person baptized is certainely saued and hath his sinnes remitted, or else that his sinnes remitted may returne and remaine and be againe imputed. But when God gratiously pardoneth sin, <note n="s" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 22.</note> he remembreth it no more. Againe we see <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified by his circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he was iustified by his faith, for <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 15. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham beleeued god, and it was imputed to him for righteousnes:</hi> and afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 4. 10. 11.</note> circumcision, to be the signe and seale of his iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

               <p>Now then as we haue seene the truth of the doctrine, let <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> vs consider the vses thereof. First, is the minister of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sacrament, and a principall part of Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution? Then he must consider, it is his duty, being autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised from God and by his church, to sanctifie the outward elementes and administer the same, to deliuer the outward signes and offer them to the receiuers. His workes therefore are to put a part and consecrate the signes to an holy vse, to open and declare the couenaut of God, to pray for his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing promised vpon his owne ordinance, to giue thankes for the blessed worke of our redemption, to offer, giue and deliuer a right the creatures so sanctified, in baptisme


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16298:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to sprinkle with water and washe the body to be baptized, and in the Lords Supper to deliuer the bread to be eaten and the wine to be drunke to the spirituall nourishment of the Church. So then the minister ought not to refuse to baptize such as are brought vnto him. Shall the seruant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do the worke of his maister? Or if the Lord keeper of the kings broad seale should proudly and presumpte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously disdame to set the seale to the Princes letters patents, were he not well worthy to be displaced and remoued? So if the minister, through enuy, or hatred, or any other sinister affection, shall refuse to put the seale to the Lords Couenant, and hinder little children from comming to Christ, he deserueth iustly to be displaced and to beare office no longer in the citty of God, but to be remoued for his contempt, <note n="q" place="margin">1. king. 2. 35.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> put downe <hi>Abiathar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, is it a necessary point of the Sacrament that it <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> be ministred by a minister? Then, it condemneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Christ neuer gaue to priuate persons any such commaundement, he neuer committed to them any such ossice, hee neuer commended to their care these holy actions, he neuer called them to this honor, he neuer laid vpon them this charge, and therefore they haue no parte nor fellowship in this businesse. If, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these restrainings of authority from them, they wil runne and rush forward, where they should hang back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their sinne lieth at the doore, their punishment hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and their iudgement sleepeth not.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if the minister be an outward part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> we must beware and take heed we ascribe not to the minister that which is proper to Christ, and so rob him of the honour due vnto his name. The minister may offer the

Man indeede pronounceth the word, but God sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vp his grace in the heart: man sprinkleth the body with water, but God maketh cleane the soule by the blood of Christ: man may take away the filth of the flesh, but Christ must purge the conscience from dead workes, who is that blessed lambe of God that <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> taketh away the sinnes of the world.

If they do as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the church do, therein they rest and seeke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be able to warrant their owne worke.

This is a great and vnspeakable comfort to al Gods children, whether high or low, whether rich or poore. So then we ought to be much more careful and earnest to know throughly and vnderstand perfectly the will of Christ, then any naturall child is to search the meaning of the will of his naturall father.

to shew the end, vse, &amp; profit of them, and the purpose of God in them. This appeareth in all places, wher God gaue signes to confirme and assure the truth of his promises.

               <p>Lastly, those Sacraments are proued heereby to bee no <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> Sacraments, which are foisted and brought in without the warrant of the word.

Seeing therfore such signs &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments as haue not Gods commandement for their institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor promise of grace and saluation annexed vnto the vsing of them, are voide and nothing worth: heerby the imagined &amp; deuised Sacraments of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> are condemned, which deliuereth that it hath not receiued of the Lord, and imposeth that to be beleeued which it neuer learned in the word.

Also their confirmation hath neither word to institut the practise, nor eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to assure any grace, nor promise to approue any vse. True it is, they haue words to administer it, but they are words of men, not of God; vnwriten, not written: of tradition, not of scripture. The like might be saide of mariage, though we confesse

and acknowledge it to be an holy ordinance and <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 13. 4</note> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable institution of God, yet was it made no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hauing no word of institution, no promise of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and saluation annexed vnto all the faithfull vsers thereof: neither is it an instrument, whereby God apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ and his sauing benefits to the comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of his children.

For whersoeuer there is a Sacrament, there must of necessity bee a signe, such as water is in Baptisme, and bread and Wine in the Lordes Supper, not of their owne nature, but by the ordinance of God, which are sanctified by the especiall worde and praier.

First, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the signes and Sacramentall rites are outwarde partes: we must take heede wee ascribe not too much to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe, and so commit idolatry <note n="c" place="margin">We must not make the signe an Idol.</note> to the creature. For the Water in Baptisme hath not power in it selfe and force to wash away sin, but by the ordinance of God it is made a signe and seale of regeneration. Euen as the Water of <hi>Iordan</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized, was no better then the waters of other places and countries, neither had any strengthe and vertue to clense the Lepers that washed in it: yet by the bleising of God, <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">2. King. 5. 12. 14.</note> washing himselfe 7. times therein, according to the direction of the Prophet, was clensed and healed of his leprocie: so the water vsed in the Sacrament of Baptisme, is in nature and substance the same with ordinary and common Water, neither hath it vig our and vertue to clense the soule, yet by the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God it is appointed to seale vp the asturance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes.</p>
               <p>Not with standing, this confidence in the outward signe, which in it selfe is as nothing, hath since the fall of man rested and remained in his corrupt nature, flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and deceiuing his owne soule. This fond and salse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was in <hi>Adam</hi> immediately after his transgression, hee did attribute too much to the tree of life (which hadde in it selfe no more life then the rest of the trees in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) and therefore God would thrust him out of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 3. 22.</note> least he should beguile himselfe with that conceite and immagination.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>Israelites</hi> trust too much in the Arke, a signe of Gods comfortable presence and protection, attributing saluation thereunto, sayeinge, <note n="f" place="margin">y. Sam. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>It maye saue vs out of the handes of our Enemyes,</hi> therefore

               </p>
               <p>Againe, we are taught heereby, that the Sacraments that <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> haue no signe, no seale, no element to signisie, to strengthen, and to seale vp the promises of saluation. For as we shewed before, that euery Sacrament must haue gods word to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it: so must it haue an outward signe to approue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of it, and to signifie the spirituall grace offered by it. Herby we learn what to hold of transubstantiation, a doctrin teching that the bread and wine is turned into the very bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy &amp; blood of Christ, namely, that it is a very fable to mock fooles withal. For <note n="g" place="margin">Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation ouerthrown.</note> whatsoeuer ouerthroweth the nature and vse of a sacrament, is not to be admitted but omitted, neither to be receiued but reiected. But transubstantiation ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth and ouerturneth both the nature and vse of a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore not to be admitted and receiued into the Church. For touching the nature of a Sacrament it is confessed, <note n="h" place="margin">Iren. lib. 4. contr. haer. c. 34.</note> that it consisteth of two parts, the one earthly and the other heauenly: but if after the words of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the bread and wine are transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ, then the signe is taken away, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ouerthrowne, the materiall part is abolished, and consequently the nature of a Sacrament is ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And touching the vse of a Sacrament, there must be an analogy and propoition betweene the signe and the thing signified. As in Baptisme, the element of water washeth and purgeth the body, so the Holy-ghost through the blood of Christ clenseth and sanctifieth the soule. Like wise in the Lords Supper, as the substance of bread &amp; wine receiued, strengthneth and comforteth the body: so Christ <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 33.</note> receiued by faith norisheth &amp; feedeth the soule. The very true principall vse of this sacrament is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme our faith, that as surely as those earthly creatures taken and aplyed, feed our bodies to a bodily life: so the body and blood of Christ receiued and applyed by saith, feede our souls to eternal life. And do not al the faithful seel a swect comfort, so often as they come to the Lords table by this similitude and agreement, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider and know assuredly,


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16298:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that as the substance of bread serueth to nourish and doth feed our bodies, so Christ doth feede our soules? But if we must beleeue, that the substance of bread and Wine is changed and cleane gone, that nothing remaineth but accidents: where is this comfort and consolation? How can we be assured and strengthned, that as our bodies are nourished with the materiall elements, so in like manner our soules by feeding on Christ? Wherefore, while they take away the substance of bread which should nourish the body, the nature and vse of the Sacrament is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we are spoyled of the comfort of our hearts and strengthning of our faith, which we should haue by this notable comparison and resemblance of the partes. So then, if wee woulde receiue comfort in comming to this Communion, we must retaine the substance of the sign, as a staffe to stay vp our faith that it do no faile. And thus much of the third outward part, to wit, the signe.</p>

For no signe hath the substance and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Sacrament, vnlesse it be receiued. Though ther be a minister to administer it, a word to warrant it, a signe to represent it, yet vnlosse there be a fit person to receiue it ther can be no Sacrament. If the minister should sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle water, and alledge the words of institution wher ther is no party to be baptized, this were a prophaning, not a solemnizing of Baptisme: or if he should take bread and Wine with prayer and thanksgiuing, where none are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16298:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to communicate and receiue, this were to commit sacriledge, not to deliuer a Sacrament. Wherefore, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there be a body to be washed, &amp; except there be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to partake the Supper, there can be no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This appeareth by the words of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 17. 12.</note> giuing vnto him circumcision, saying, <hi>Euery male-child of eight daies old shall be circumcised.</hi> This also appeareth in the <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> words of Christ speaking of baptisme, and charging the Apostles to baptize the nations in the name of the father and of the son, &amp; of the Holy-ghost. Where he teacheth, that it is not sufficient to take water, but there must be a washing So. when he speaketh of his supper <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 26. 26. 27.</note> he saith, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye:</hi> so that there must not only be bread, but giuing, taking, and eating: there must not onely bee wine, but giuing, taking, and drinking thereof.</p>
               <p>This truth being euidently deliuered, let vs see how it <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> may be profitably applied. First of all, must the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments necessarily be receiued? Then it teacheth that the Sacraments without their lawfull vse are no sacraments at all: they are no signes of grace, if they be not vsed. This condemneth the keeping, reseruing, holding vp, and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about with pompe and ostentation the Lords supper, offering vp, kneeling downe vnto, and adoring a piece of bread: all which are horrible prophanations of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Sacrament, whereby the people isrobbed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of a precious part of their peace in Christ. The bread feedeth not the body, reuiueth not the spirits, strengthneth not the heart, by looking and gazing vpon it, by touching and handling it, but by eating, digesting, and feeding vpon it: so doth the sacrament strengthen faith, not by reseruing and keeping it, but by vsing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of it. For sacramentes are actions not dumbe shewes. Christ saide not, <hi>Heare ye, see ye, gaze re on, but baptize ye, eate ye, drinke ye, doe ye this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, are the receiuers an outward part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> Then the persons that are to receiue must know,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16298:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that diuers duties are to bee done and performed of them. The persons then that are to receiue, must ioyne with the Minister in prayer, in quickning their faith in the couenant and promises ofGod, beholding the former works of the Minister, blessing, breaking, pouring out, and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ratifieng them in their harts, and lastly by receiuing and applying to themselues the visible signes. For as we haue shewed, if the words of baptisme should be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer the water, and no person to be present to be baptized, it is no baptisme: so if the words of instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the supper should be spoken and repeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating, without drinking, without receiuing, it were no Sacrament. Wherefore, we must all learne to detest the <note n="e" place="margin">Bellar. de sacram. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. lib. 4. cap. 2.</note> absurd opinion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other procters of the Romish religion, which teache that the breade and Wine being once consecrate, whither they be receiued or reserued, whither they bee distributed to be eaten and drunke, or whether they be kept in boxes and vessels of the Church, for daies, moneths, and long times, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried solemnly in procession: are notwithstanding still the Sacrament of the body and bloode of Christ. Against which dotage wee spake in the former vse, and shall speake <note n="f" place="margin">Book. 3. ch. 6 Vse. 3.</note> more in the third booke following.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if the receiuing be an outward part then we are not to rest in the outward participation, for so farre went <hi>Iudas</hi> in the Passeouer: so farre went <hi>Simon</hi> that sorcerer in baptisme: and so farre went <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1. 2. 3. 5.</note> the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as the Apostle sheweth. <hi>They were all baptized vnto Moses in the cloud and in the sea: they did all eat the same spirituall meat, and did al drink the same spirituall drinke, &amp;c, yet with many of them was not god pleased, but they were ouerthrowne in the Wildernesse.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> said to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Saduces,</hi> when he saw them come to his baptisme, <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 3. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>O generation of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the anger to come, bring foorthe therefore fruit worthy amendment of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now our righteousnes must exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharisees, if wee woulde enter into the


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16298:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kingdome of heauen. Let vs all therefore haue this profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so often as we deale with the Sacraments and come vnto them: we must looke further then to the outward sight, we must consider more then the externall signe, otherwise as we approch without preparation, so we depart without edification. And thus much of the foure outward parts of a Sacrament, to wit, the minister, the word, the signe, and the receiuer.</p>

               <p>BEfore we proceede to the inward parts of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, answerable to the outward by a fit proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it shall not be amisse in this place to speake somewhat of the Consecration of a sacrament. First wee must consider what it is: for the truth being knowne, it will cast downe errour, as the light scattereth the darknesse. To consecrate then <note n="a" place="margin">What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration is.</note> is to take a thing from the ordinary and common vse, and to appoint it to some holy vse. This therefore is Consecration, sanctification, and dedication of the outward signes, to apply them to an holy purpose. This is done, partly by the minister, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the people, and partly by them both. The minister taketh the water in Baptisme, which signifieth the blood of Christ, and he poureth it on the person of the baptized: he taketh the bread in the Lords supper, and breaketh it, he taketh the wine and poureth it out, he deliuereth them both: the people take and receiue, they eate and drinke in remembrance of Christ: and both minister and people ioynein praier and thanksgiuing vnto God the father for the mistery of our redemption accomplished by Christ our sauiour, so that the sacrament is consecrated by the whole action of the minister and people together. This maketh the difference betweene common water and the water in Baptisme: this maketh the difference betweene

that bread and wine of the Supper, and the bread and wine which is vsed for ordinary meate and drinke. True it is, in nature, in essence, in substance there is none: but in the ende and vse. Common water we vse for the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our bodies: but the water in Baptisme is sanctified by prayer to an other vse, to be a signe of the clonsing of the soule. Bread and wine at mens tables in their houses are set before them for the nourishment of their bodies: but at the Lords l'able they are ordained of God to an higher and holier vse, euen to be signes of the bodye and blood of Christ. This is noted by the <hi>Euangelistes</hi> and by the Apostle <hi>Paule,</hi> that <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 26. 26. Mar. 14. 22. Luc. 22. 19. 1 cor. 11. 24.</note> the Lord Iesus before he brake the bread and gaue it, he blessed and gaue thankes to his father, that he had appointed him to be the redeemer of the world, and giuen him authority to institute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in remembrance of his death and passion. For wheras the <hi>Euangelist Mathew</hi> saith, <hi>he blessed:</hi> the other by way of exposition say <hi>Hegaue thanks:</hi> so that the blessing heere spoken of, is <hi>Giuing of thanks,</hi>

               <p>The knowledge of this point, serueth to cleere our <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> doctrine, and to ouerthrow sundry errors of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> First, it sheweth that we hold &amp; teach a consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, a sanctifieng of the water in Baptisme, and of the bread and wine in the Lords supper, by the word, by prayer, and by thanksgiuing. The bread &amp; wine are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not in nature, but in quality: not in substance, but in vse: not in essence but in the end: not by force of certaine words, but by Christs institution. We acknowledge and confesse a consecration, not a conuersion: a sanctification of the signes, not a transubstantiation of the substance into


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16298:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the body and blood of Christ. He blessed and praised his father as mediatour of the Church, for the mistery of the redemption of mankind: and hee <note n="g" place="margin">1 cor. 10, 16,</note> blessed the creatures, that they might be effectual signes, and serue for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and increase of our faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are taught, that consecration is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> charme and incantation by force of certaine wordes, as though these word, <hi>This is my body,</hi> being murmured and spoken ouer the bread, and <hi>This cup is the new testament in my bloud</hi> whispered ouer the wine, <hi>did fully finish</hi> a consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made the elements to be immediatly changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body and blood of Christ, without any other obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the institution. And hence it is, that the forme of Christs giuing of thanks is not set down by any <hi>Euangelist,</hi> because our corrupution and superstition is so great, that if we had the words, we would ascribe power &amp; force to the words, sillables, and letters, and therefore the manner of his thanksgiuing is pretermitted. This inclination of the hart is apparently seene in the <hi>Romish</hi> church, who ascribe efficacy &amp; operation to the pronouncing of certain words, which is a part of sorcery and a part of witch craft. Wheras we auouch, that the whole action of taking, breaking, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out, distributing, eating, drinking, praysing &amp; rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the institution of Christ, are the consecration, that is, the separation of these creatures to this vse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if after the Sacramentall actions, if after thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> to god, if after prayer, that we may vse the creatures to the confirmation of our faith, there do follow consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sanctification, and change of the elements to another vse: then the power, effect, and working of the Sacrament dependeth not vpon the intention of the minister, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <note n="h" place="margin">concil.

If a priest should read the Gospell at the table of prelates and religious men, and in reading should pronounce these words, <hi>This is my body, this is my blood,</hi> then all the bread and wine vpon the the table should be consecrate and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Christs body and blood: which is not so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his intent is wanting.

Let them speake plainely, let them tel vs directly what they hold. I thinke they will not say so: I am sure it is not so. For other things are wanting, that are needefull in this matter. We haue shewed, that a Sacrament is not made by bare pronouncing of certaine wordes, ascribing force to them after the manner of enchanters, but the whole institution of Christ must be obserued, <note n="k" place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minister.</note> there must be distributing and receiuing, there must be praier and thankesgiuing, and from the vse of these followeth Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: all which are wanting in the former examples &amp; suppositions, there is no taking, no breaking, no distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no pouring out, no receiuing, no praying, no thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.

outward receiuing. The first inward part is god the <note n="f" place="margin">The first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of a sacrament is god the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> father, osfering and applying Christ and his sauing graces to the faithfull. The minister offereth and deliuereth the outward signes to the receiuers, and can go no further: herein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth God the father, who offereth Christ to all, albeit the reprobate receiue him not. He doth not dally and deale falsly with vs, but truely offereth in the sacramentes Christ with all his giftes and benefits, if we haue handes to receiue him, he is giuen to vs.</p>
               <p>The vse of this doctrin is, first of al to distinguish between <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> God and the minister: the outward signes are giuen by the hands of the Minister, whether he be good or euill, but the truth and substance of the sacraments is giuen by God the father. Whosoeuer confoundeth these partes and workes, robbeth God of his glory, depriueth himselfe of the grace of Christ offered, and maketh flesh his arme. Wherefore, as the workes of God and of the Minister are distinct, so must these parts remaine distinguished, howsoeuer to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they are not separated and sundred, as in the publishing and preaching of the gospel, the Minister speaketh vnto the outward man, and the sound thereof entreth into the care, <note n="g" place="margin">act. 16. 14.</note> but it is God that openeth the hart and speaketh to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the faithfull hearer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it serueth to strengthen our faith and help our weakenes when we come to the sacrament. So often as we <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> see the ministers of God appointed by him, deliuering the signes and setting them a part to their ends for which they were ordaind: we must behold with the eye of faith, god the father offering his sonne to those that can receiue him. For if wee come aright, we may assure our owne heartes, that what the Minister doth outwardly, the same the sather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth inwardely, then which there cannot be a greater comfort. Let vs therefore behold with our eyes, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall rites: let vs heare the promises that God maketh vnto vs: God the father wil verifie them, who hath <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn. 6. 32.</note> sealed vp his sonne vnto vs. <hi>My father giueth you that bread from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Albeit the sacraments should be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by some hypocrite and wicked man: yet they haue as much force and as a great efficacy, as if they were ministred by faithfull and godly men.

                  </gap> therby. The signe is but a figure and token: Christ is the truth and substance. This we shewed before, <hi>Ch. 2.</hi> in the discription of a sacrament, that therein Christ and all his sauing graces are truely offered, sealed vp, and giuen to the faithfull that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So then, this is an euident, plaine &amp; manifest truth, confirmed by testimonies of the Scripture, that Christ is the matter and substance of a sacrament.</p>
               <p>Heereby, we gather great strength of faith. If Christ be <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> offered withal his merits, then let vs lay hold vpon him and


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16298:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not let him go: let vs stretch forth the hand of faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him into our harts. Wherefore, when Satan assaulteth vs, touching our faith in christ and assiance in his promises, perswading vs we are not elected, iustified, and indued with faith, &amp; therby seeketh to cut off our hand from aplying, or to blind our eie from looking vpon the brasen serpent, that is, <hi>Christ sitting at the right hand of his father:</hi> let vs run vnto him, let vs hunger and thirst after his righteousnes, let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be our wisdom, our rightiousnes, our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and redemption, and let vs looke for our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him and in him. What though our faith be frail and weak? What though it be as a graine of a Mustard seede, which is very little and small? What if it be but as the groth &amp; strength of a child, which is ready to fal except he be stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp? yet this weak, this smal, this little, this fraile, this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith, is able and sufficient to ingraft vs into christ. A childe taking a staffe in his hand, is able to hold it, as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though not as strongly as a man: so if we lay hold vpon christ by faith, though we doe it with many wantes, and much weaknes, yet it shal serue and suffice vs to saluation. For God looketh not so much to the perfection as to the truth of faith, neither so much to the measure as to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our beleeuing.

There is required a faithfull recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if wee woulde receiue Iesus Christ, faith must of necessity goe before, without this there is no iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, without this, there is no saluation, as Rom. 14. <hi>Whatsoeuer</hi>

Iudas</hi> executed the function of an Apostle, he was partaker of the Passeouer: yet he ceased not to remaine an Hypocrite, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and the child of perdition, <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 17. 12.</note> that the scripture might be fulfilled. Neither was he bettered or sanctified by that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or by the vse therof <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> his wife, <note n="d" place="margin">act. 5. 4. 9.</note> being in the number of Disciples, wer no doubt baptized of the Apostles, and had also receiued ofttimes the Lordes supper, yet they continued in their wickednes, lyinge, and hypocrisie, the sacrament did not take away their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor giue them a iustifying and sauing faithe, <note n="e" place="margin">act. 15. 9.</note> which purifieth the hart by repentance and woorketh newe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the soule. The like we haue said of Simon the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer, <note n="f" place="margin">act. 8. 23.</note> who albeit he were baptized, yet remained in the gall of bitternes, and in the bond of iniquity. Wherefore, the Apostle teacheth, that the worde profited not, <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>because it was not mingled with faith in those that heard it.</hi> If the signes be receiued without faith, they hurt: not that Gods giftes and ordinances hurt of themselues, but not being receiued aright, they hurt through our sin and default. As the worde not receiued by faith is an empty sound without force: so the sacrament is an vnprofitable and a naked shew without

substance. Wherefore, the Sacraments in regard of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers and vngodly are no Sacraments to them, because to them they are not seales of the righteousnesse of faith. True it is, they remaine Sacraments, in respect of God who offereth his owne sonne, but they lose their strength and force toward the vnfaithfull, that do abuse and contemne them, <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 2, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </note> as the Apostle expresly teacheth, <hi>Circumcision veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyts profitable if thou keepe the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become vncircumcision,</hi> the same Apostle speaketh of such <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 20</note> as vsed the Lords Supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true godlinesse and due preparation, saith, <hi>This is not to eate the Lords Supper,</hi> denying that to be, which was not done as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, seeing the right vse of the Sacraments is, <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> when such as are truely conuerted vse them aright, we learne diuerse instructions that flow &amp; follow from hence. First, that the reprobate (though God offer the whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to them) doe receiue the signes alone without the things signified: they haue the bare title without the thing, the vanishing shadow without the body, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter without the spirit, the empty box without the oyntment, and the creature without the creator. They are washed with the element of water, but not with the grace of regeneration. They eate the bread and drink the wine: but they are not partakers of the body and blood of Christ Iesus to saluation. They eate <note n="k" place="margin">Panem domi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ni, non panem dominum. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, hom, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 65,</note> the bread of the Lord, but they eate not the bread and the Lord: because the signe, without the right and holy vse thereof, is not an auailable Sacrament to the receiuer of it. Wee see therefore the wicked partake not CHRIST, although they partake the signes of Christ, <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh, 20, 6, 7,</note> as they that found his clothes, but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we see heereby, that the elect ordained to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> life, but not yet called and conuerted to the Lord, &amp; to the obedience of his will, though they come often to the sacraments: yet do in like manner receiue the bare signes without the things signified, because as yet they want faith


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16298:42"/>
and repentance. What then? Do they nothing differ from the reprobates? In this they differ not for the present time from the reprobate. Not with standing, that receiuing of the Sacrament which for the time present was vnfruitfull and vnprofitable, shall after in them haue his good effect, as the corne that lieth long couered in the earth, at the length doth come vp and florish. For the Sacrament recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before a mans conuersion, is afterward to the beleeuer and penitent sinner ratified, and so becommeth profitable: wherby the vse of the Sacrament, which before was vtterly voide and vnlawfull, doth then become lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, as we see in the word heard without fruit &amp; faith by an vnbeleeuer, is made a word of saluation afterward when he is conuerted. Lastly, the elect already conuerted <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> and sanctified by the spirit of God, do to their profit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and saluation receiue both the signe and the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified together: yet so, as that for their vnworthy receiuing thereof (which hapneth through their manifold infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and often relapses into sin) they are subiect to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishments for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus, <note n="m" place="margin">1 cor. 11, 30</note> 
                  <hi>For this cause many are licke and weak among you, and many sleeps: for if we would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged of the Lord.</hi> Where the Apostle teacheth, that God brought a iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne house, and punished this church with weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, sicknesse, and death it selfe, for their vnreuerent, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and disordered receiuing of the Lords Supper. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, many among them (no doubt) were elected, and all of them professed the Gospel of the kingdome: yet god visited their want of preparation &amp; reuerence with diuerse diseases and great mortality, <note n="n" place="margin">Leuit, 26, 14 15, 21 Deut, 28 15 16, 20, 21</note> according to the threatning annexed to the law, <hi>If ye will not obey me, nor do all these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caundements, if ye shall dispise mine ordinances, or your soule abhor my lawes, then wil I do this vnto you, I wil appoint ouer youfearfulnes, a consumption, and the burning ague to consume the eies and to make the heart heauy. And if ye walke stubbornly against me and will not obey me, I wil then bring seauen times moe plagues vpon you,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16298:42"/>
according to your sinnes.</hi> Wherefore, when we haue receiued grace to beleeue, and haue tasted the first-fruites of the spirit to the comfort of our soules, we must not be puffed vp in our knowledge, we must not grow secure, but stir vp the giftes of God in vs when they begin to wax faint: let vs seek to preuent his iudgments before they com, which we may do, by iudging our selus, by making inquiry into our own waies, and by searching the reines of our hartes, with purpose to condemne all ignorance, error, security, and vngodlinesse, and as it were to take punishment of our selues: then this would follow thereupon, we should not be iudged and punished of the Lord. This then is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to avoid the sin of vnworthy receiuing. A man thus visited with sicknes, weakenesse, and diuerse kinds of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and smitten with the stroke of Gods own hand, cannot possibly be restored by any creature in heauen or earth: &amp; yet behold the Lord hath not left vs without meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue them and take them away, to wit, by taking away the cause, that we may remoue the effects. The cause of these punishmentes is taken away by iudging our selues. Now a man in iudging of himselfe <note n="o" place="margin">What we are to do in iudging our selues.</note> must performe foure things 1. he must examine himselfe of his sinnes 2. he must confesse them, and himselfe to be guilty, as the poore priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that standeth at the bar. No denying of the fact, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of the fault, no hiding of the offence, no iustifieng of our person can procure our pardon: the way to haue for giuenes, is to acknowledge our own wickednes 3. he must condemn himselfe, and giue sentence against himself without partiality, 4. he must plead pardon for the remission of his sins, and neuer rest, vntil he giue him peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and restore him to the ioyof his saluation.</p>

               <p>HItherto of the parts of a Sacra. both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: now we come to the vses therof. For vnlesse we know the vse, and vnderstand the end why they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, it shal not profit vs to know the parts. Every thing must be referred to his right vses and propper endes: so must the Sacramentes be. The endes are especially


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16298:43"/>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Three chief vses of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</note> these three. First, to strengthen faith. Secondly, to seale the Couenant betweene God and vs. Thirdly, to bee a badge of our profession. Touching the first end, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments serue for the better confirmation of our faith, as appeareth. Where the Apostle hauing set down the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, and the preseruing of <hi>Noah</hi> by the <hi>Arke,</hi> he saith our baptisme <note n="b" place="margin">Pet. 3, 21,</note> directly answereth that tipe, which is a taking to witnesse of a good conscience, and sauing vs by the resurrection of Christ. So then, by faith confirmed in Baptisme, we haue an infallible assurance in the death of Christ of our saluation. Many indeed come to the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are present at Baptisme, are partakers of the Lords supper, that feele no strength of faith, no increase of Gods graces, no spiritual groth in the body of christ, so that they worke not saluation in them, but further their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the sacramentes (as we haue shewed) giue not grace, but more firmely, surely, and comfortably confirme faith, they apply and seale vp Christ crucified. The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot giue faith to the faithlesse, neither were they instituted to the end men should beleeue but because they do beleeue: as meat was not giuen that men should learne to eate, but that the eating might be nourished. Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede receiueth them, <note n="c" place="margin">august. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, dei, lib. 25, cap. 25,</note> and then they serue to nourish it. And they confirme not faith by any inherent power inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them, but the holy spirit applyeth Christ to vs, and frameth this comfortable conclusion in our hearts, All such as are conuerted and do rightly vse the sacraments, shal receiue Christ, and al his sauing graces: But I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted &amp; do rightly vse the sacraments: Therfore I shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue christ &amp; his graces. Thus doth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forter comfort al those that come rightly &amp; religiously to the Lords table.</p>
               <p>Now, if we would enquire and search after the reasons of this first end, we should find that one cause why they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme faith is, because god is true in his promises, he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and maketh good that which is gone out of his mouth. All the <note n="d" place="margin">2. cor, 1, 20,</note> promises of God in Christ are yea and are in him Amen, vnto the glory of God through vs. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Princes seales confirme their charters, assure


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16298:43"/>
their grantes, and make certaine their pardons: so do gods sacraments witnesse to our hearts and consciences, that his words and promises are true and are established to continue for euer. For as he declareth his mercies by his word, so he sealeth and assureth them by his sacraments. Againe, this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who first beleeued the promise, and it was imputed to him for righteousnes being yet vncircumcised, and afterward receiued the signe of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision as the seale of the righteousnes of faith, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note n="e" place="margin">Rom, 4, 5, 10, 11,</note> teacheth <hi>We say that faith was imputed vnto Abraham for righteousnes: How was it then imputed? when he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or vncircumcised? Not when he was circumcised, but when hee was vncircumcised, &amp;c.</hi> Where he sheweth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified in vncircumcision, but yet was afterwarde circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, that the gifte of righteousnes might be confirmed in him. The <note n="f" place="margin">Act, 8, 36,</note> Eunuche likewise beleeued before hee receiued baptisme, and therefore it sealed vp the increase of his faith and of Gods graces. And Act 2. <hi>They that gladlie receiued the wordes of Peter, <note n="g" place="margin">act, 2, 41, &amp; 10, 44, 47, 48 and 22, 16.</note> were baptized.</hi> And. as Peter preached to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and others of the Gentlies, <hi>The Holy-ghost fel on them all which heard the word,</hi> and he said, <hi>Can any forbid water that these shoulde not bee baptized, which haue receiued the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghost as wel as we?</hi> So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Wherefore, when the minister washeth with water, it representeth our buriall with Christ, into his death, and our rising again with him into newnes of life. As bread norisheth and strengthneth man: so the body of christ taken by faith, feedeth the soule. We take the bread and cup into our hands, we eat, we drink, we are refreshed: so we feed on Christ, whose flesh is meat indeed, and whose bloud is <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> drink indeed, and we are comforted. Let vs nowe come to the vses, as we haue seene the reasons. And first of all, do the sacraments serue to strengthen our faith? then let vs all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our failings and infirmities: Let vs labor more and more to feele the weakenes and wantes of our owne faith. True it is, if our faith were perfect and entire lacking nothing, <note n="h" place="margin">Chrisost in Math. hom, 83.</note> we should not neede the sacraments. We must not therefore abstaine from them for the weakenes of our


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16298:44"/>
faith, but for that cause come to God and to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, praying for strength and confirmation thereof, <note n="i" place="margin">Mar. 9, 23, 23</note> as that father did, whose sonne was possessed with a dumbe spirit when Christ saide to him, <hi>If thou canst beleeue, all things are possible to him that beleeueth</hi> he answered crying with teares <hi>Lord I beleeue, help mine vnbeleese.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. the Apostles <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 17, 5</note> say to the Lord, <hi>Increase our faith.</hi> Vndoubtedly he that neuer doubted, neuer beleeued: For whosoeuer in truth beleeueth, feeleth sometimes doubrings and wauerings of his faith. Even as the sound body feeleth oftentimes the grudginges of a feuer and distemperature of the body, which if he had not health he could neuer finde and feele: so the faithfull soule findeth sundry doubtings, which if his faith were not sound, he covld not diseerne. For, we feele not corruption by corruption, nor sinne by finne, <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 11, 21, 22</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when the strong man possesseth the house, all things are in peace: but we feele sinne and perceiue corruption in vs by a contrary grace of gods spirit. The lesser and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler measure of grace we haue, the lesser is our feeling: and the more grace we haue the more quick we are in feeling of corruption. What is the reason, that many haue no light of sinne, no feeling of their corruption, no tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no trembling, no terror, no feare of gods wrath, but wholly liue, lie, and dye in their lustes? Surely, because they are without grace, without gods spirit, and without his inward worke in them. But the faithfull, who are not led by the slesh but liue by the spirit, are often tempted, assailed, tormoyled, tryed, and prouoked to many euils, according to the <note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 22, 31, 32</note> words of our blessed sauiour, <hi>Simon, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, behold Satan hath desired to winnow you as wheat, but I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not, therefore when thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, strengthen thy bretheren.</hi> Asa man carried vp and set vpon an high to wer or on the pinicle of a temple, and ther fast bound in chaines of Iron that he cannot fall although he would, when he looketh down, feareth, and al his ioynts tremble, because he is not acquainted and accustomed to mount vp so high in the aire, and to behold the earth so farre beneath: but when he remembreth himselfe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16298:44"/>
himselfe fast bound and out of all danger, then he conceiueth constant hope of continuing, and casteth away all feare of falling: So when we looke down-ward vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our selues and our owne waies, we haue doubtings, wauerings, astomshments, horrors, terrors, tremblings, and feares: but when we looke vpwards, to be hold the sweet consolation which god hath promised, Christ hath purchased, the word hath published, the Holy-ghost hath sealed, and euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer hath tasted, wee feele our selues sure, and cease to doubt any more. For faith though assaulted with doub t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, may be certain. The Sunne alwaies shineth in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, though the clouds haue couered it, and the light appeare not. The tree hath life in it, though it be not in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discerned. So faith hath his assurance and perswasion, though it bee shaken with doubtings and assaulted with tentations. Wherfore, so often as we feele these doubtings and imperfections, let vs set against them the certainty of gods truth: let vs set before vs the vnchangablenes of his promises: let vs draw neere to the holy Sacraments, and therby seeke strength and increase offaith. Moreouer, was <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> this one end of the Sacramentes to strengthen faith? Then god refuseth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous hand can hold that which is offered vnto it, as wel as a sound and strong hand, albe it not so strongly: so is it with faith, though it be feeble &amp; as a grain of mustard seed, yet if it be vnfained, it wil aply christ effectually, which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes leaueth God in vs as a meanes to stir vs vp to go to the sacraments.

Let vs see then howe manie such visible signes and seales of spirituall grace in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, were iustituted of God to set forth the benefits of christ, for the continuall vse of the church. Many liue in the bosom of the church, hear the word, come to publick prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, take themselus to be goodly christians, offer themselues to the lordes table, and are made partakers of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16298:50"/>
who yet are ignorant how many sacraments ther are, &amp; what they are. None almost so simple but can number his sheep and cattel: he knoweth their marks. he knoweth their differences: but aske him how many commaundements of the law, how many Articles of faith, how many petitions of the Lords prayer, or how many Sacraments of the New Testament, he can answere nothing. Such haue their wits wholly exercised on the world, and on wordly things which iustle out religion &amp; the knoledge of heauenly things. If we haue eares to heare let vs heare what is the faith os the Church in this point, grounded vpon the infallible rule and rocke of the word of God. The sacraments of the church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Christ, to assure our communion with him are onely two: <note n="b" place="margin">christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted onely two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> baptisme, whereby we are receiued into the couenant of God in steed of circumcision: and the Lordes supper, whereby we are nourished, maintained, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, insteed of the Passeouer. For albeit the couenant be but one, yet the seales there of are two, to assure vs that by vnion with Christ, we are regenerated and shall be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished to eternall life. He hath deliuered vs a few sacraments insteade of many, he coulde haue instituted moe if he had thought it good for the benefit of the Church These are as it were the two eies wherby we see and behold the promises of God. These are as the two hands, whereby we after a sort do handle Christ crucified and lay hold on the graces of saluation. Christ hath appointed no mo sacraments, he hath laide on vs an easie yoke and a light burden.</p>
               <p>That these two, are the onely sacraments of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, may appear by these few reasons <note n="c" place="margin">Reasons why ther are only two sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> following. First christ taught no more to his Apostles, the Apostles deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no mo to the churches, the churches embraced no moe for many yeares. When the Lord Iesus liued on the earth, <note n="d" place="margin">Luke. 1, 76. and 3. 3.</note> he instituted baptisme by the ministery of <hi>Iohn baptist,</hi> who as he was sent to prepare the harts of the people, so he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the baptisme of repentance: Afterward the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus established it with his owne mouth, in the commission


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16298:50"/>
giuen to his disciples, he appointed and himself first admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred his last supper in remembrance of his deth, vntil his 2. comming againe with power and great glory. These two true sacraments of the church, to wit, baptisme and the lords supper were instituted and warranted by the mouth of christ himselfe, and none other beside these. These we receiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause christ ordained them: other we receiue not, because he ordained them not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> admonisheth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to beware of idolatry, not to slatter themselues, or to think themselues the members of christ, and therefore should es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the iudgment of God, because they had the sacraments: for the church of the <hi>Israelites</hi> had as great priuiledges as they, they had the same sacramentes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1. cor. 10, 1. 2. 3, 4.</note> the same baptisme, the same supper in substaunce and effect, yet God was not pleased with them, but ouerthrew them in the wildernes. If then the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had any moe then these two, they might haue iustly replied, we grant indeed, in respect of these they are equall with vs, but we haue other which they had not, wherein they are inferiour to vs, and we superiour to them, and therefore are preferred before them. If then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles reason conclude strongly, we may hence gather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, that there are onely two and no other Sacraments, because the Apostle mentioneth no moe, where hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to set forth the priuiledges of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and to make them equall with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Wherefore we must receyue two Sacraments onely, or else the Apostle hath reasoned weakely.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the same Apostle, 1, <hi>Corinthians</hi> 12. purposinge to shewe that manie members of the church are one bodie in CHRIST coupled by him as by ioyntes, prooueth this pointe by a full enumeration of the sacramentes, being pledges of our settinge into the body of CHRIST and continuall nourishment in the same, when he saieth, <note n="f" place="margin">1. cor. 12. 3,</note> 
                  <hi>As by one spirit we are all


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16298:51"/>
baptized into one body, whether Iewes or Gentiles, so we haue al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Moreouer, another reason may be framed, by comparing the Church of the Iewes with the churches of the christians in regard of their ordinary sacraments. There are no mo sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments deliuered in the Gospel, then were prefigured vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law: for their sacraments were <note n="g" place="margin">

Pet. 3. <hi>Our baptisme answereth the figure of the waters, representing the same that our baptisme doth.</hi> True it is, the sacramentes of the olde Testament were not <note n="h" place="margin">Iewish sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> figures of the sacraments of the new Testament, for then their sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be the sign, and ours shuld be the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and so there should be sacraments of Sacraments, which were foolish and absurd. Againe, the Iewish Sacramentes should be signes of things altogither vnknowne vnto them and not giuen them of God, for they were vtterly ignorant of Baptisme and the Lordes Supper. Besides, that auncient people should be saued by beleeuing baptisme and the lords supper to come: for doubtlesse they were saued by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that which their sacraments did signifie: but they were not saued by beleeuing baptisme and the Lords supper, but by beleeuing in Christ to come. Lastly, the old sacramentes should haue one signification, and the new another; for the old should signifie the new, and the new shold signifie christ and his benefits. Notwithstanding, the sacraments of the new testament succeede in the room of those of the old, and signifie the same thinges that they doe, baptisme <note n="k" place="margin">col. 2. 11. 12</note> came in place of circumcision, and the Lords supper is come in place of the Paschall lamb, as appeareth in that it was administred presently after it, <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 22. 14. 15.</note> to declare the abrogating of the one and establishing of the other. As then ther was the same faith and the same way of saluation by christ, <note n="m" place="margin">Reuel. 13. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>who was the lambe slame from the beginning of the worlde,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> he was yesterday and to day,


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16298:51"/>
and the same for euer: so had the Iewish rites respect to <note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 3 4</note> Christ, and all of them are reduced to our two Sacraments. Wherefore, as the Iewes had onely two ordinary <note n="p" place="margin">Exod. 12. 48</note> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, circumcision and the Passeouer, as appeareth. <hi>If a straunger dwell with thee, and will obseiue the Passeouer of the Lord, let him circumcise all the males that belong vnto him:</hi> so the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sacramentes of Christes church are baptisme and the Lords supper agreeing to the same. Now the 5. other sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments newly inuented, were not prefigured in the Law, they succeed not in the place of their ceremonies, they are not an swerable to any types of Iewish rudiments, therefore they are no sacraments.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, these two sacraments, baptisme and the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are altogither perfect and sufficient, not onely to enter and plant a Christian into the church, but also to retaine him in it: and therefore all other are friuolous, vaine, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, as superfluous braunches to be pared away. Now, that they are sufficient to these purposes, appeareth by the effects and vses of them. What other grace can we haue, then to be borne againe in Christ, to haue iustification, forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of sinnes, and all priuiledges of eternall life; and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be norished and kept continually in him. Al these are fullie represented and sealed vp to vs in these two: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up on it followeth, that christ, who ordained the fewest and best sacramentes vnder the gospell, appointed these and no moe. Thus then we may gather, that by the institution of christ, by the argument of the Apostle, by comparison of the Iewish ceremonies, and by the sufficiency of the two sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of baptisme and the Lords supper, that these are the onely two sacraments, the rest are forged and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait sacraments, they seale not vppe christ, <note n="q" place="margin">August, in Psal. 40.</note> they neuer flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed out of his side, <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 34.</note> from whence yssued onely water and bloud.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this number of 2. sacraments appeareth, not only by the testimony of ancient fathers, but by the confession of the aduersaries. For howsoeuer in many other controuersies, their wordes are many, and their argumentes probable and


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16298:52"/>
very specious: yet for the auouching of 7.

               <p>Now let vs come to the vses of this diuision.

               <p>Againe, heereby we may perceiue and conceiue the difference betweene the old and new testament, between <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> the Sacramentes vnder the law and these vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note n="k" place="margin">Difference betweene the Sacraments of the old Testament &amp; the new.</note> betweene those giuen to the Iewes and these retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among Christians.

Again, they differ in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Sacramentall signes and rites, as the cutting of the foreskin, the lambe of the Passeouer, iournying through the sea, sauing by the Arke, drinking of the rock, lifting vp the brasent Serpent, raining downe of <hi>Manna,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of their body, they had calues, sheep, Gotes, doues, bread, wine, Oyle, and such like: we haue onely water in Baptisme, and bread and wine in the Lords Supper. Thus the signes do greatly vary. Fourthly, they differ in easinesse. For the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> committed to the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were hard, combersome, painefull to the slesh, and some of them were administred with effusion &amp; sheding of blood, partly of man and partly of beastes.

For as the exhibiting of Christ Iesus in the flesh and fulnesse of time, and as it were in the old age of the world, is of more efficacy to moue vs then the expectation of him to come: so we haue better helpes and an holy aduantage to raise and rouse vp our faith to a greater assurance of grace and mercy, by how much the accomplishment is more then the promise, and the fulfilling greater then the foretelling.

Lastly, they differ in respect of the people to whom they were giuen, and for whom they were ordained: ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all people dispersed ouer the face of the whole earth (that are ingrafted into the church) wheras theirs wer tied to one Nation, to one people, to one place, to the posterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Notwithstanding these differences which are in signes and circumstances: touching the chiefe thing euen the matter and substance of the Sacramentes they are equall, <note n="m" place="margin">Wherein the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old and new Testament agree.</note> hauing the same end and the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and being of one esficacy, as also the word of the prophets and Apostles is.

This practise of the Apostles we finde, this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, this we approue and allow. But of any sacrament of confirmation we read not, and therefore allow not. Againe, it was a laudable custome (in the primitiue church) of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian parents, to bring their children to the Bishop, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined them in the principles and fundamentall points of religion, <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> he asked them a reason of their faith, he instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them farther in the misteries of godlines: and that this action might haue the more reuerence and dignity, they laid their hands vpon them, and prayed vnto God for them, that he would increase and continue the good things that he had begun in them.

Secondly, it hath no word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in the scripture, nor commaundement to continue the vse of it vntill the comming of Christ and end of the world, and therfore no sacrament. For the word must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the element, and so it is made a sacrament. True it is, they vse a forged and counterfeit forme in their confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I <hi>signe thee with the signe of the holie crosse, and</hi> I <hi>confirme thee with the oile of saluation, in the name of the father, and the son, and of the holi-ghost.</hi> These indeed are wordes, but no worde of God: they shew an intollerable presumption, and not to be excused.

that is, both forged. Thirdly, it wanteth an outward signe instituted by Christ. We read oftentimes that the Apostles vsed laying on of hands, but we read of no oyle or chrisme.

For wee confesse plainely and deny not, but some outward penalties and chastisements of the body may be vsed &amp; do please God, not of themselues, but because they are profitable meanes and good helpes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and forward true repentance. As for example, he that hath offended grieuously in surfetting &amp; drunkenes, and


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16298:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath great heauines of hart &amp; sorrow of mind that he hath sinned against so gratious a God and mercifull father: may prescribe &amp; appoint to himselfe without appearance of superstition, or error of satisfaction, or opinion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, some fasting or abstinence for a certaine time, that he may be better fitted to gods seruice, and further strengthned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those sinnes into which he is fallen. This doctrine we receiue as the doctrine of Christ, and agreeable to the prophets and Apostles, as appeareth, 2 <hi>Cor. 7.</hi> where <hi>Paule</hi> setteth downe the effects or fruites of true repentance.</p>
               <p>Now the question <note n="c" place="margin">Penance no Sacrament.</note> ariseth betweene the church of <hi>Rome</hi> and vs, whether this repentance which is a dying to sinne, and a walking in newnesse of life, and whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to the church and absolution from sinne be a Sacrament of the new Testament, institvted by Christ to assure his sauing graces to vs? Wee answere, it is not. First, it was in time of the old Testament from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mans fall and transgression: it was continually preached and published by the prophets, and therefore before Christes comming in the flesh, and cannot be a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the new Testament. Secondly, it wanteth an outward signe such as water in Baptisme, such as bread and wine in the Lords supper: now euery Sacrament must haue an outward element and signe to represent the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace: therefore penance can be no Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it hath no word to commaund it, no particuler promise of God which is the chiese stay and staffe of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth, that <note n="d" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de poenit. cap. 10.</note> Christ instituted the sacrament of penance when he breathed vpon his Apostles after his resurrection, and said vnto them, <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Receiue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, whose sinnes ye remit they are remitted, and whose sinnes ye retaine they are retained.</hi> And he saith, the words of absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the signe, and that remission of sins is the the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of grace which is signified. For answer to this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I would gladly aske this question, whether the apostles had this ministeriall power to forgiue sinnes to repentant sinnets, when they baptized to remission of sins? If this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16298:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were heere first instituted and giuen vnto them? Do they not by tying the authority of remitting finnes to this time, make their baptisme of none effect? Besides, we haue shewed, that it is not sufficient to haue a sound of wordes that may be heard, to make an outward signe: there must be a visible signe that may be seene, to warrant a sacrament. Now, to make a Sacrament without such a signe, were to make a sacrament without a sacrament. Lastly, as they take and vnderstand penance, it is neither sacrament, nor sacred: it is neither holy signe nor holy thing: it is neither an institution of God, nor any way of God. For they mean not thereby, amendment of life or inward sorrow &amp; griefe of minde for the life past, which is sometimes testified by weeping and mourning, by sackcloth and ashes, by fasting and humiliation: but they vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by penance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> external discipline, satisfaction for our sinnes to God by our owne sufferings: &amp; that wearing of sackcloth, sprinkling of ashes, chastising of the body, whipping of the flesh, putting on rough apparel, lying on bourds and hard places, abstaining from flesh, and aflicting our selues by such outward exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are a paying of the paines due to sinne, part of amendes made to Gods iustice, and meritorious before him. This punishment, this penance, these penalties we abhorr, as an horrible blasphemy against the blood of Christ, which is the onely satisfaction to God for sinne. For if we satisfie for our selues, then hath not Christ satisfied for vs, nor payed the price due vnto our sinnes. Besides, they charge God the father with iniustice, in that hauing laid the guiltinesse of our sinnes vpon his owne sonne, and punished them in him, they make him not satisfied with that punishment, but to exact the debt of vs againe, <note n="f" place="margin">Esa. 53. 5. 7</note> for which his sonne as our surety hath fully and sufficiently answered, as <hi>Esa. 53. He is punished for our transgressions, he is bruised for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the chastisement of our peace is lated vpon him, and by his stripes we are healed: the Lord maketh the punishment of vs all to light upon him.</hi> Likewise <note n="g" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 7 Reu. 1. 5.</note> the Apostle Iohn saith. <hi>The blood of IESVS CHRIST doth purge us from all sinne.</hi>

First, it was not instituted by Christ, but was from the beginning of the world, and therefore it was before the law and vnder the law, how can it be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new Testament? Againe, matrimony may be among infidels and vnbeleeuers, out of the Church and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the faithfull. For the matrimony of infidels is lawfull. God did institute it for all mankind. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement is generall, increase and multiply. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole teacheth, that if the vnbeleeuing woman will dwell with the beleeuing husband, <note n="f" place="margin">Grati. in dec. c. 28. qu. 1. Lumb. lib. 4 dist. 39.</note> he must not put her away for her infidelity: and mariage is honourable amonge all persons. Seing therefore it was before the fall of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the giuing of the lawe, vnder the gouernement of the lawe, and made honorable among all, it cannot be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of Christ and for the members onely of the Church. Thirdly, it is not common and commaunded to all the faithfull, for it is not needfull and necessary that all in the church should be married. <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 7 Mat. 19, 11 12</note> Euery one hath his proper gift, some one way some another. And albeit God haue not tyed grace to the sacramentes, yet they in some sort <note n="h" place="margin">How the Sacramentes are necessary for the church</note> are necessary for the Church, and to be partaked of the children of the Church, whether we respect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, who requireth them: or whether we regard our owne weakenesse, who stand in neede of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes and profitable helpes that tend to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith. Seeing then matrimony is not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to al, neither serueth to confirme faith, it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as a sacrament. Fourthly, the sacramentes are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of god aplying Christ and his merits to al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: but matrymony is not an instrument whereby God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Christ and al his benifits: much lesse is it a common


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16298:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
instrument of the common saluation and benefites that all haue in Christ Iesus. Furthermore, we haue showd how the <hi>Roman</hi> church is contrary to itselfe in this point: for ou: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries call matrimony a prophanation <note n="i" place="margin">Greg. Mart. d: s. Chap. 15.</note> of holy orders. And <note n="k" place="margin">Pigghius.</note> another saieth, it is more tollerable for a priest to keepe many Concubins, then to marry. If matrimony be an holy sa. how should the sacred order of your Priesthood be prophaned, polluted, and defiled therby? Lastly, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> no promise of saluation ioyned to it (as it ought to haue) thogh it be lawfull and vsed lawfully: in euery Sacra. there must be likewise an outward sign or element, as water in baptism, and bred and wine in the Lords supper, togither with a san ctisieng word to warant it: but in this supposed sacra. there is neither matter, nor word, therfore no sacra.

Again, the maried persons are receiuers of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and supposed Sa. so that they cannot be the matter or signe: For the signe and the receiuer are two distinct out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward parts of a Sa, so that they cannot be consounded or mingled together, as besore we declared, <hi>Chap 3.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be the receiuer: the receiuer cannot be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The thing receiued, cannot be the receiuer: the receiuer canot be the thing receiued. If then the persons matied be the receiuers, they cannot be the signe receiued. If any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obiect and say, Marriage is the signe of an holy thing, to wit, of the spirituall coniunction between Christ and his church: I answer, it was not instituted to confirm our faith in that point, but for other ends which we named before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if we should call al signs of holy things sacraments: we should treble the number of 7. for so many comparisons as we find in scripture, we should haue sacraments, &amp; then the stars, a grain of mustard seed, leauen, a draw-net, a shepherd a Vine, a dore, nay a theese, a murtherer, and infinite other,

things should be Sacramentes; which sometimes are made signes of holy things. This were not so much to increase the number of Sacraments, as to multiply absurdities. Lastly, the Sabbaoth was ordayned to the Iewes to be a signe between God and his people in their generations, <note n="n" place="margin">Hob. 4. 8</note> and signified the spirituall rest in Christ, yet was it no ordinary sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it were blessed and sanctified of God.

into the church for many yeares after Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. The new Testament as it doth acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacrificer and sacrifice but Christ, so it admitteth no priests, no priest-hood, but spitituall priests and a spirituall priest-hood to offer vp spirituall sacrifices of praise and thanksgiuing vnto God, <note n="f" place="margin">Reuel. 1. 6 1.

The Apostle would haue all the elders called: but one Masle-priest only with them bringeth the box, and annoynteth the sickman.

The Apostle speaketh of bodily health, of the guift of miracles, and of common oyle: they prattle of forgiuenes of sins, of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and continuall gift, of charmed and consecrate oyle, and balme (whereof notwithstanding can none be found) of bowing their knees and saluting it, saving, <hi>Hailholy oyle, haile holie oyntment, haile holy balme,</hi> nay which is more blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, their oyle they call <hi>The oyle of saluation,</hi> which is to renounce saluation by Christ, and to deny the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to sanctifie the people of God.

dumbe and deafe creature, not warranted nor founde in scripture, as the words of consecration in the true sacraments are: and therefore we cannot receiue it for a sacrament, but must account it an apish imitation and a popish tradition.

Lastly, the effect and vertue of a Sacrament is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace in Christ: but extreame vnction hath no spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace in Christ sealed vp: for the Apostle ascribeth <note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 5, 16</note> not the forgiuenes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And thus much of extream vnction and the other forged Sacraments, whereof some wanting the outward signe, some the spirituall grace signified, some the word of institution, some the promise annexed, and all of them the commandement of Christ, and testimony of the scripture: we cannot admit them for any Sacramentes; and so we conclude, that there are only two Sacraments of the Church vnder the Gospell, which are, Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lorde.</p>

First, in the natiue and proper signification, it signifieth to dippe, to diue, and plunge vnder water, as Mat. 3, 16. Iohn 3, 22, 23 Act, 8. 38, 39.

Where <hi>Apollos</hi> is said to be an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent man, and mighty in the scripture, knowing nothing but the baptisme of Iohn. Lastly, it is taken for the whole worke and action of the sacrament of baptisme, as Math, 28, 19. <hi>Go vnto all nations, teach and baptize them:</hi> and in this last sence we are now to speake of it.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore see <note n="b" place="margin">What bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is.</note> what this Sacrament is. <hi>Baptisme is the first Sacrament, whereby, by the outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the body with water once into the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the Holy ghost the inward clensing of the sonle by the blood of Christ is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</hi> This description of baptisme is to be opened and farther expounded vnto vs: <note n="c" place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of baptisme proued.</note> wherein fiue pointes are to be considered of vs. First, it is called the first Sacrament, both in respect of the other Sacrament of the Lords supper: and because when the nations were conuerted to the saith, and beleeued in the name of Christ, they were immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, as we see the practise of the church, <hi>Act. 2. 4. and Chap. 10. 47. and Ch, 8, 12.</hi> Where after embracing the faith, we see the partaking of baptisme, and the sealing vp of their conuersion.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is said there must be an outward washing of the body with water, because the <note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 5, 26 Tit. 3, 5 Mar, 1, 4.</note> Apostle declareth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the nature of a sacrament of baptism, <hi>Eph, 5. Calling it the washing of water through the Word:</hi> and it hath a iust propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or relation to the spirituall washing of our newe birth, Tit. 3, 5. being also called the baptisme of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and amendment of life for remission of sins. Dipping


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16298:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into the water is not necessary to the being of a sacrament: sprinkling of water is not necessary to the being of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but wetting and washing with water is necessary to the being of a Sacrament. Now whether the whole body should be washed, or the face only: and whether it should be done once or thrice, is not greatly materiall, but left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the church to decree and determine, what shal be thought fittest to be receiued and practised.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is added in the former description, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is once onely to be administred. For as in naturall generation, man is once onely borne: so it is in spirituall regeneration. And as circumcision was once only receiued in the flesh, whereby the fore-skin was circumcised: so is Baptisme once onely to be administred, not oftentimes to be repeated. Wherefore, the Apostle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. saith, <hi>There is one</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4, 5, 6</note> 
                  <hi>baptisme, one faith.</hi> Againe, Christ willed the Apostles to minister Baptisme, not Baptismes. Lastly, in baptisme the death of Christ is represented, and he died but once: so that as his death was not to be repeated, no more is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme to be reiterated. Fourthly, the forme and manner of doing, is said to be <hi>Into the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the Holy-ghost.</hi> Wherby is ment, that we haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God in three persons (as a wife hath with her husband, who passeth into her husbands name) to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to him, to obey him, to acknowledge and call vpon him, to worship no other god but the true <hi>Iehoua.</hi> This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be vnderstood onely of vsing the name of the Trinity in baptizing, but by it also is ment, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons baptized are receiued into the grace and fellowship of God, to become his people, and to be pertakers of his couenant to their spirituall comfort. Lastly in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before remembred, it is affirmed that the outward washing of the body, <hi>Representeth the inward clensing of the soule by the blood of Iesus Christ.</hi> This <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3, 27 Tit. 3, 5, 6 Rom. 6, 4</note> appeareth expresly Gal. 3. <hi>All that are baptized into Christ, haue put on Christ.</hi> And Titus 3. 5. 6. <hi>According to his mercy he saued vs, by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the Holy-ghost, which he shed on


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16298:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs aboundaintly through Iesus Christ our sauiour.</hi> So also the same Apostle, <hi>We are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> with him by baptisme into his death.</hi> These testimonies out of the word of truth do euidently teach, that this is the principall scope and end of Baptisme, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our consciences by externall washing, of the inward clensing of our soules by the blood of Christ for remission of sins. This being the discription of baptisme, let vs see what good vses may be made therof, and euery part in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as they haue beene laid before vs. And first, touching the <note n="h" place="margin">The vse of the first part of the descrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note> first point mentioned before in the description, that Baptisme is the first Sacrament. This teacheth that such as are gained to the faith, &amp; children of such as are in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note n="i" place="margin">act 18. 8</note> are immediately to he baptized. So was the <hi>Eunuch</hi> when he was instructed: so was <hi>Paule</hi> when he was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: so were the <hi>Iewes</hi> when they repented. And indeede this is a true saying, that <note n="k" place="margin">August. cont. Faust. lib. 19. cap. 11</note> men cannot be incorporate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any religion (whether it be true or false) vnlesse they be combined together by some communion and fellowship of visible Sacraments. Again, Is baptisme the first Sacrament of the new Testament? Then it followeth, that he which is not baptized, is not to be admitted to the Lords table: he that hath not receiued the first Sacrament, is not to bee made partaker of the second. As in the old testament, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was the Sacrament of entrance and admission, and none was admitted to eate the Passouer but such as wer circumcised, <note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 12 48</note> as we see <hi>Exod.</hi> so none hath this right and priuiledge to come to the supper of the Lord, vnlesse first they be entred, and the doore opened to them by baptisme. For a man must be knowne to belong to our family and houshold, before he presume to eat of the childrens bread, that belongeth not to strangers. Touching the vse of the 2. point, to wit, <note n="m" place="margin">Vse of the second part of the descrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note> that there must be washing with waters we learne that washing with water is of the necessity of baptisme. Indeed ther may be a washing without baptisme, but ther can be no baptisme without washing <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Eph 5, 26</note> 
                  <hi>washing of water through the word.</hi> So that this washing is necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the fit similitude that is between it and our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16298:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or new-birth. The water is apt to clense vs &amp; leaueth no silah behind: so is our iustification <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> sanctification repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the blood of christ, as shal be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered. Therfore such as vsed sand, or blood, or such like matter not fit for washing, did not indeed baptize, but horribly prophane the Sacra. of baptisme. The third point in the description is, <note n="o" place="margin">Vses of the 3. part of the description of baptisme.</note> that baptisme is once onely to be administred which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto vs these three vses. First, it sheweth a difference between it and the Lords supper. The Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the supper of the Lord saith, <note n="p" place="margin">1 cor. 11. 26 25. 23</note> 
                  <hi>As oft as ye shal eat this bread and drinke of this cup:</hi> and Christ our sauiour, <hi>Do this as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me,</hi> therfore it must be often receiued of the church. But baptisme once ministred, is not againe to be repeated. As we are once onely borne into the world, but after our birth are dayly nourished: so we are but once baptized, but there is continuall vse of the Lords supper, where at we are fed to eternall life. Secondly, this teacheth, that all rebaptizing is vnlawful, as we see by the examples of the Apostles, <note n="q" place="margin">act. 2, 42, &amp; 19, 4. 5</note> who baptized not the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and members of the church the second time. For <hi>Act.</hi> 2. it is noted, that such as beleeued the gospel, continued in the apostles doctrine, in fellowship, in breaking of bread &amp; prayer: but not in baptizing againe, or being baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And ch. 19. 4. 5. the disciples which were baptized, and had not receiued the gifts of the Holy-ghost, <hi>Paule</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed further in the doctrine of Christ, and doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize them, but laieth his hands vpon them, and they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue the visible gifts of the holy ghost. The reason is plain against rebaptization, because it signifieth and sealeth vp our once being born again, our once setting and setling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body of christ, <note n="r" place="margin">Ezek. 16, 8 Hos. 2. 19. 20</note> and our spiritual mariage once with him, who is the spirituall husband of his Church. Wherby we see, that such as haue beene baptized <note n="f" place="margin">Such as haue beene bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, are not to be rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> by heretikers or other wicked ministers, are not to be rebaptized. It came in place of circumcision: but none wer twice circumcised, therfore none to be twice baptized. Again, it is a Sacra. that representeth our spiritual incorporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the church: but it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t once to be ingrasted, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently sufficient


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16298:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue it once administred. This error of rebaptizing, arose vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on a corrupt vnderstanding and interpretation of the place. Act. 19. <hi>When they heard it,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">act 19. 5,</note> 
                  <hi>they were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> The difficulty of this place is taken away, if wee consider they be the words of <hi>Paule</hi> continuing his speech of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, not of <hi>Luke</hi> declaring what <hi>Paule</hi> did. But of this place we shall haue better and fitter occasion to speake farther in the chapter following, where it is at large expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Furthermore, if baptisme be administred once for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it sheweth that he which commeth to Christ once truely and indeed, shall neuer be cast away, <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh, 13. 8 Rom. 11, 29</note> whom Christ Iesus loueth once, he loueth for euer, because his graces and giftes are without repentance. What shall seperate vs from Christ, when we are by his working adioyned vnto him? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this outwarde washing, being not often repeated, but once onely vsed, doth effectually seale vp our once ioyning to God, who hath made an euer lasting couenant with vs, he shall neuer turne away from vs, to do vs good, we shall bee his people and he will be our God for euer. Indeede if we could cleane fall away, from the grace of God, we shoulde haue another regeneration and another baptizing to be the seale thereof: but because we are built vpon the brazen pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Gods election, the gates of hell shall not preualle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, for this foundation remaineth sure, <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim, 2 19 20</note> and hath this seale, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> This <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 51, 10, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> appeareth in <hi>Dauid, Psal. 51.

Heere then is a great comfort sealed to all Christians, in all tentations, against al the tetrours and feares of conscience, where with they are ready to be swalowed vp and ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This must strengthen and stay vs vp, that although we may fall greevously, yet we shall not fall finally from the state of grace. He that is once a sound and liuely member of Christ, can neuer be wholly cut off. True it is, sinne may les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son our coniunction and weaken our comunion with christ:

                  </note> we shall neuer be wholly seuered and fall from him, as 1, 10. 2. <hi>They went out from vs, but they wer not of vs, for if they had bin of vs, they should haue continued with vs, but this commeth to passe, that it might appeare, that they are not all of vs.</hi> Now if any man by falling into sinne, were totally seperated from Christ for a time, surely in his recouery and rising from sinne he were to be baptized the second time: for baptisme is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, initiation and ingrafting into Christ, and an vniuersall falling would require a new ingrafting. But it were most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to say, we should be as often baptized as we fall into sin: and therefore howsoeuer Satan may buffet, molest, tempt, and wound vs greeuously, yet he can neuer ouermaister vs wholy and ouercome vs finally, <note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 9</note> as the Apostle declareth, 1 Ioh. 3. <hi>Whosoeuer is borne of God committeth not sinne, for his seed remaineth in him, neither can he sinne, because he is borne of God.</hi> This assurance of our standing for euer in the couenant, is the roote of all courage and comfort in trials and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it helpeth vs to fight manfully against sinne, it preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs from securitie, it nourisheth vs in good works, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth in vs a care to please god, and lastly it confuteth the popish fancie of the forged sacrament of penance, wherby (they say) a Christian being cleane fallen from grace is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, finding no comfort in his baptisme: wheras the true beleeuer neuer falleth finally from faith, neither needeth an outwarde seale to assure his pertaining to Gods fauour and loue. Indeed euery christian that is fallen through infirmity, must rise vp, repent vnfainedly, and shew foorth the fruites thereof: yet the force and strength of his baptism is not lost, the fruit and comfort thereof remaineth for euer, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as well to the time to come as to the time that is past. So many therefore as asfirme, that the faithfull in thoir falles, haue remedie in penance, but no comfort by their baptism, do set vp themselues, magnifieng their owne dreames and deuises aboue the holy ordinances of God.</p>

This appeareth, 1 Pet 3 <hi>Where of the baptisme that now is, answereth that figure, which is not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but a confident demanding which a good conscience maketh to God, and saueth vs by the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Iesus Christ.</hi> Where the A postle teacheth, that sinne cannot be washed awaye by that outwarde water, but by Christs inward working which the outward baptisme doth shaddow. In like manner <hi>Mar. 1. Truth it is, I haue baptized you' with Water, but hee will baptize you with the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghost,</hi> where the baptise sheweth that hee baptized outwardly, but the force of it proceedeth from Christ who baptizeth inwardly. So Act, 2, Peter saide vnto them, <hi>Amend your liues and be baptized euerie one of you in the name of Iesus Christ for the remission of sinnes, and ye shall receiue the gift of the Holy-ghost:</hi> Where the A postle declareth, that in such as repent and beleeue, the vertue of the Holy-ghost is ioyned with outwarde baptisme. The outwarde partes therefore are one thinge, and the inwarde partes are another: that which is seene is one thing, and that which is vnderstood is another thing.</p>
               <p>This diuision of the partes of Baptisme, affoordeth <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> diuers good vses, and putteth vs in minde of sundrye holy duties.

For his meaning is not simplie to relate and set downe his office wherunto he was called, but by conferring it with his preaching: as if he should say, This is not the chiefe and principall ende of my calling and function to baptize, the high worke of my ministery is to preach the Gospel. Indeed they are both of them parts of the ministers Office, but this is the chiefest to labour in the word and doctrine, in regard of the greater giftes required, and of the fruite that floweth and followeth from thence to their hearers, it being the high ordinance of god to saue such as beleeue.</p>
               <p>That this is the Apostles mind and meaning, appeareth by the words immediately ensuing, where he reckoneth vp some whom he had baptized, which he would neuer haue done or attempted without a calling. True it is, the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; force of baptism dependeth not vpon the worthines or excellency of the Ministers thereof, but on the authoritie and institution of god, who onelie remitteth sinnes, and baptizeth with the Holy-ghost.</p>
               <p>This appeareth by the example of such as cast out deuils <note place="margin">Math. 7. 22 &amp; 23</note>

               <p>First, baptisme is a part of the ministry, which none may vndertake but such as are thereunto lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. God hath ioyned the <note n="g" place="margin">Mat, 28, xix Heb, 5, 4 Math, xix, 6,</note> ministry of the worde and sacramentes together: and what God hath coupled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let no man separate, Math 19. 6.

               </p>
               <p>Likewise, <note n="i" place="margin">Reuel. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> the Apostle reproueth the church of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> that it suffered a Woman to teach among them, and to exercise the publicke ministry of the word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to gods commaundement and the practise of gods people.

                  </gap> for imitation.</p>
               <p>The causes heereof are direct and euident. For to teach


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16298:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
publikely, is a token of authority and rule ouer others, in-asmuch as the teacher is higher in place and authority then he that is taught, as <hi>Paule</hi> was brought vp at the feete of <note n="l" place="margin">act. 22, 3</note> 
                  <hi>Gamaliell,</hi> and as the lesse is blessed of <note n="m" place="margin">Heb, 7, 7</note> the greater. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the woman should not be admitted to be a maister in <hi>Israell,</hi> a teacher and instructer of men, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, where the Apostle forbiddeth them to teach publikely, and to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe authority ouer the man, but requireth of them to be in subiection, not to chalenge dominion. Again, such is the <note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 7 Eccle. 7. 29. 30</note> frailenes and weakenesse of that sexe, that they are easier to be seduced and deceiued, and so fitter to be authors of much mischiefe being the weaker vessels: therefore <hi>Paule</hi> hauing set down the doctrine that women should not take vpon them to teach in the church, and so preach in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of men, presently alledgeth this reason, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Tim, 2. 13 14 Gen. 3. 6</note> that <hi>The woman was first deceiued of the deuil and was in the transgression:</hi> he made choise of her, and made her an instrument to be guile her busband.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the minister representeth Gods person in this holy worke, and theresore he onely can offer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer with power and authority the outward signe, which answeareth fitly to the inward matter. Shall priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vsurp to be the Lords messengers, to bring his letters and seales, not called, not alowed, not authorised? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without intruding of themselues and dishonour to God.</p>
               <p>As none can wash vs from our sinnes but Christ onely: so none can beare his person in the outward Sacrament of the inward washing, but he whom Christ himselfe hath appointed, if we will receiue the benifit of the holy seale of baptisme, for the assurance of our conscience <note n="p" place="margin">The people cannot with comfort as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Moreouer, this may yet farther appeare by a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (a forme of reasoning often vsed in the scripture) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring different actions of thinges done by a calling, with such as are done without a calling, wherby we shall see that to haue a lawfull calling to do a thing, giueth life, likinge, and allowance vnto the doing For we must, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what is done; but also who is the doer.

This truth is so plaine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the Heathen <note n="c" place="margin">Terent. in Adesp. ast. 5. sce. 3</note> poet doth acknowledge it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Duo cumidem faciunt saepe vt possis dicere</l>
                  <l>Hoc licet impune facere huic, illi non licet:</l>

                  <l>Not that the deed is differing, the doer is all in all.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So then, to say that a woman may minister baptisme in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of necessity, is all one, as if a man should say, that if ther be no iudge or magistrate at hande that will do his duty in executing iustice against murtherers and malefactors: that then a priuate man may take vpon him to draw the sword out of the sheath to strike osfendors. But as a priuate man, flaying a murtherer, hath himselfe committed murther, and not executed iudgement, because he had no calling or commission thereunto, so such as without any warrant haue taken in hande to baptise, haue made a prophane washing; and not administred any Sacrament of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if it be not materiall who baptise; then if the friends or neighbours meeting together after the birth of a child, should carry the childe to the church ro be baptised and solemnely dedicated to Christ that died on the crosse, if a priuate person preuenting their purpose cast water on the infant and with all vse the wordes of institution; the childe should by this imagination be baptised and be carried no further to the minister. Or, if no man of purpose poure on


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16298:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
water, but it dash at vnwares vpon the face of the child, or if a shower of raine fall from Heauen, and a priuate person speake the words of institution, it should likewise be baptisme. Nay, which is more vnreasonable and absurd, <note n="d" place="margin">calu. lib, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistot, Pag. 85</note> if it were ministred by a boy playing and in sport, if it were ministred by a foole or a mad man, if it were ministred by one that were not himselfe baptized, if it were by a Turke or infidell that is a sworne Enimy by profession to baptisme and to them that are baptised, yea if it were ministred by an <hi>Athiest</hi> that holdeth there is no God; yet it should be by this opinion a good, lawfull, and perfect baptisme. But seeing this cannot be so, we are not onely to obserue what is the deed done, but to consider who is the doer, and to prouide it be done by the minister warranted by the church and called of God thereunto.</p>
               <p>Before we come to the vses heereof, we will answere an obiection from the example of <hi>Zipporah</hi> the Wife of <hi>Moses,</hi> who in case of necessity circumcised her sonne, and God departed from pursuinge her husbande to the death for omitting thereof. To this we may answer, that we must liue by lawes, not by examples which haue no warrant. The question is not of the fact, but of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the fact.</p>
               <p>Againe, there is a difference betweene circumcision and baptisme. For this falling out before the law, was more lawfull, when circumcision was left more at liberty: yea vnder the law there was no speciall commaundement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the priestes to circumcise, which should tye it to the priesthood. But Christ in the gospell hath apointed the same persons to be preachers of the gospell and Ministers of the sacramentes. Moreouer, inasmuch as shee did it, <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 4. 24. 25, 26.</note> not in the absence but in the presence of her husband, and inasmuch as her hart was not vpright, but filled with Anger against GOD, with indignation against her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, with murmaringe and frettinge againste the institution of circumcision, castinge the fore-skin with


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16298:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great disdaine vpon the earth, regarding nothing lesse then to performe a good duty to God, railing vpon and reuiling <hi>Moses,</hi> the act cannot be lawfull or aproued. Furthermore it doth not appeare out of the scripture that <hi>Moses</hi> was sick (as some pretend) but it is most probaple and likely, that <hi>Zipporah</hi> wanting discretion but not presumption, through her boldnes and hastines preuented <hi>Moses,</hi> and aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the worke, before the prophet coulde prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto it. Neither may we by the sequell and successe conclude the lawfulnes of her deed, <note n="f" place="margin">Bellar. de sacra. bap, cap 7.</note> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, because the Angell ceased from vexing him, that therefore god was pacified, pleased, and appealed towarde him. For the Heathen man condemneth such as measure actions <note n="g" place="margin">Ouid. Etist. 2, careat suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessibus opto, quisquis ab euentu fact a notanda pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> by the euent, as by a false rule and deceitfull measure. We see oftentimes euill workes prosper, and euill workes speede well in this world; The <hi>Assyrians</hi> that halted in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and mingled his honor with Idols, were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered frow the <note n="h" place="margin">2 King. 17. 25.</note> lyons that deuoured them: yet their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and consused religion pleased not God. Wherefore, we conclude, that whereas this Woman administred cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, her example must not be drawn into imitation.</p>
               <p>Now, as the truth is plaine and euident: so the vse is profitable and comfortable. First, if the minister be one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> part of Baptisme, then he must be ready and carefull to performe his duty, which is, to wash the vncleane body with water in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the Holy-ghost, to call vpon God, and to follow the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, as it is left in the scripture for his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if there be the outward sign of baptisme as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacrament, if ther be a party to be baptized which is the receiuer, and if there he a minister to administer it: yet vnlesse he performe his duty, there can be no baptisme. So then we must knowe that the actions of the minister <note n="i" place="margin">What are the actions of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> are dubble: first, there is required of him a sanctifying of the water: Sccondly, a washing of the partie. The sanctifying of the water, is the seperation and appointing of it by the word and praier to this vse to signifie the bloud of Christ.


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16298:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The outward washing is a certaine pledge vnto vs of our inward washing by the blood and spirit of christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it be the ossice of the minister to baptize: <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> then this giueth direction and instruction to the people to whom to repaire and resorte when they haue any children to be baptized. It is required of them to haue recourse to the ministers as to the officers of god. We see in the asfiairs of the common-wealth, and in passing conueyances of houses, of lands, and of inhritances, how carefull and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect men are to passe them where they ought to be passed, and in such courts, and vnder such officers as are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised for such purpose, that there may be no error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the conueiance. For whatsoeuer is done and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before him that hath not his patent to warrant his practise, is held to be void and frustrate by maisters of that profession. In like manner it standeth vs all vppon, when a matter of an higher nature and of greater importance is in hand, then the sealing and assuring of temporall possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to looke carefully to the diligent performance of this speciall duty, that the signing of our infants and sealing them in the couenant, be made by the hands of such officers as are appointed by God for that purpose, and by no other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this condemneth the abuse and prophanation of the Sactament of baptisme in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where <note place="margin">vse. 3.</note> women, midwiues, and priuate persons without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, nay contrary to his word, take vpon them this part of the ministers office to baptize children, which they haue receiued from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Such then as vsurp this calling and approue thereof, neuer knew the force of our adoption in Christ, nor the strength of the couenant, nor that the elect are saued by the good pleasure and will of God.

And a man may

If then women may iustly be condemned, when they shal presume to sit down in the chaire of <hi>Moses,</hi> or to minister the Supper of the Lord: they cannot be iustified if they vsurp to minister baptisme. For, shall we make a shamefull and double diuorcement of those things that God hath coupled, betweene the word and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and likewise betweene the one Sacrament and the other? This is to great contumely and contempt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to baptisme, to allow it in those, that may neither pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely preach, nor lawfully minister the Lords Supper: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their warrant to practise the one, is no greater then to do the other.

These worthy examples of gods most feuere iudgements executed vpon the breakers of this ordinance, ought to strike such a fear into our harts, that we suffer not the sacred functions and offices of the church to be prophaned, and to teach vs that euery one meddle only with the approued duties of his own calling.

Baptisme is as it were a solemne othe taken in the sight of God and in the face of the congregation, whereby the person baptized bindeth himselfe wholly to God, three in persons, but one in substance.

teach, that at the baptisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the father, sonne and Holy-ghost were present. And as hee baptized with the same matter, why should we imagine he obserued not the same forme, that Christ eommaunded expresly to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles? Nay seeing in the baptisme of <hi>Iohn</hi> we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, there was the same promise, the same grace, the same vertue, the same signe, the same signification, which was in the baptisme of the apostles (as we haue proued before) why should we onely doubt of the wordes of institution? Wherefore, we conclude, that the Apostles would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing of the direct-and expresse wordes of their lord and maister, <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 28, 19</note> prescribed <hi>Math.</hi> 28, where he chargeth them both what to preach and how to baptize. For as hee enioyneth them to teach the nations, to obserue whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he commaunded them: so he willeth them to baptize in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghost. And as they altered nothing in the matter of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: no more did they in the manner of baptizing, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that as the doctrine they preached was the doctrine of God, so the Sacraments they deliuered were the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and they had no more leaue in the one, then liberty in the other. If then, any should baptize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then in the name of the Trinity, or should name the sonne to be vnequall to the father, or should deny the proceeding of the Holy-ghost, or should baptize in the name of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> and the Saints, this cannot be the Sacrament of baptisme instituted by Christ, but a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made voide and frustrate by our owne inuentions.</p>

               <p>The vse of this outward part, is three-fold.

If any demaund whether sweet waters and distilled may be taken and vsed, or mingled with common <note place="margin">Obiection</note> water, especially when children of such as are in high place are to be baptised &amp; sealed into the couenant, therby to note a difference betweene person and person, forasmuch as god hath listed vp the head of one aboue another: I answere, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom, 13, 1, 7</note>

               <p>Notwithstanding, all mixture of the water is mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and an human tradition which in GODS woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe is not to be admitted. Whatsoeuer is mingled with common Water, is a corruption, whatsoeuer the partie be that is baptised. The Apostle teacheth, <note n="d" place="margin">Eph, 4. 5</note> that the church


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16298:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath all one baptisme: not one manner of baptizinge the poore, and another of baptizing the rich. Besides, why might wee not allowe mixture of water with Wine in the Lordes supper, as well as the mixture of compound water with common water in the sacrament of baptisme? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if there might lawfully bee admitted a different manner of baptising the children of rich-men and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of poore men: then in the other Sacrament the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction might be receiued, and so a finer kinde of breade be prouided for the richer sort by themselues, and a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort for the poore by themselues, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor 11. 21 22</note> which seperation the Apostle reproueth in the church of <hi>

If a man were baptised with sande, with bloude, with wine, with milke, with snowe, with oyle, and such lickor, it is no baptisme at all, but a meere voide and ydle action: such a person must afterwarde be sprinkled or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with water, not that any should be rebaptized, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all persons should be once baptised, the former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being meerely frustrate. Although the forme of words be retained in the administration which our sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and the body be washed in the name of the three persons, the father, the sonne, and the Holy-ghost: yet if such an errour be committed in the matter that the signe be changed, and another foysted in, contrary to the precept of Christ and practise of the Apostles, ther is a nullitie of the whole work, the partie be-sanded, or be-bloodied, or oyled, is erroneously and vnlawfully, not truely and effectuallye baptised.

               <p>True it is, if all the other partes and actions be obserued, these inuentions and additions, which are so many abuses make not baptisme void, neither bring a nullity therof: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these beggerly ceremonies, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the testimony and aprobation of the first and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches, so they corrupt the pure, simple, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere institution of Christ None were vsed when Christe was baptised, neither gaue he any such thinge in charge to his Apostles, neither were they in vse in the Apostles times, neither did they deliuer them to the pastors and teachers which they ordained in euery citty.

               <p>Thirdly, if washing with water be an outward part of baptisme which pertaineth to the flesh; but teacheth not to the conscience, which toucheth the body, but clenseth not the soule: then the bare want of externall purification, cannot bring the danger of eternal condemnation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore children dying without baptisme are not reiected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want baptisme: for children that are elected are saued, though they dy before baptisme: and they that are not elected are condemned, though they be baptized.

               <head>Chap. 6. Of the forth outward part of baptisme.</head>
               <p>THe last outvvard part of baptisme is <note n="a" place="margin">The last outvvard part of bapt. is the body washed.</note> the body that is washed. For we haue shewed before, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes without their vse are no sacramentes. And albeit the word ioyned to the signe make a sacrament, yet this presupposeth a minister to administer it, &amp; receiuer to take it: and then the rule is most certainely to be admitted. Now whether the whole body should be washed, or a part of the body: whether it should be washed once, or oftner: whether it should be dipped, or sprinkled: we are neither curiously to enquire, nor seriously to contend, nor rashly to determine: but rest in practise of the church, and in the custome os the countrey, as in a thing in it owne nature indifferent. The dipping and plunging into the water vsed by <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and the Apostles in <hi>Iudea</hi> and such hote regions, are not a necessary rule to bee drawne into imitation, especially in these cold quarters and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>But let vs see who they are that haue right and interest in baptisme, and who are capable of this Sacrament. For not euery one without respect, without difference, without distinction, is to be admitted to this priuiledge, because they are not fit receiuers thereof. If a minister should take the outward element, and vse the word of institution, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the Holy-ghost: yet it can bee no Sacrament, vnlesse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16298:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue warrant and authority to receiue it. If he should baptize a stone, or an image, or a bruit beast without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and vnderstanding, these are no fit receiuers, heere is an apparant and flat nullity: where by appeareth farther, the truth of the former rule, that besides the ioyning of the worde to the outward signe, their is necessarily required a fitted person to be partaker of the sacrament, as is more at large expressed, book. 3. Chap. 3.</p>
               <p>To proceed, <note n="b" place="margin">Who are in the couenant</note> wee must know that the receiuers are such as are within the couenant and such as professe the truth, whether in truth or not, wee leaue to GOD, that searcheth the heartes and raines: <note n="c" place="margin">Rom, 14. 4</note> let vs not iudge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans seruant, he standeth or falleth to his owne mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. Againe, such as are borne in the couenant are of two sortes. First, men and women of yeares: secondly, infants that are the seede of the faithfull. For the faithfull do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for themselues and for others: as in bargaines they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Although children cannot be saide to be saued by their fathers faith, no more then to liue by the fathers soule, inasmuch as the prophet <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 2. 4 Rom. i, xvii Gal. 3 xi Heb. x, 38</note> teacheth <hi>That the iust shall liue by his owne faith:</hi> yet the faith of the parents maketh their children to be counted in the couenant, who by reason of their age cannot yet actually beleeue, as they that want all knowledge and vnderstanding, <note n="e" place="margin">Ionah, 4. xi.</note> not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the right hand from the left. Euery man liueth this temporall life by his owne soule: so euery man liueth the eternall life by his own faith. True it is, baptis me is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon seale.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this condemneth the blinde, ignorant, and <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> superstitious practise of baptizing belles <note n="p" place="margin">church of Rome propha neth bapt, by baptizing bellcs.</note> practised in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof now they begin to be ashamed, and seeking fig-leaues to couer their shame, they say they were not baptized, but onely hallowed and consecrated to holy vses, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> betaketh himselfe to this shift, as to a place of refuge, <hi>Lib. 4, de pon.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16298:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they haue God-fathers appointed vnto them as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue when they are baptized and confirmed: <note n="q" place="margin">Bellar. de sacra. bapt. lib. 1, cap. 27</note> they haue new garments put vpon them, as the persons bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed among them like wise haue: it is also permitted onely to the By shops suffragan, who exacteth great summes of money for the baptizing of belles: they ascribe to them a spiritual power against stormes and tempests, against thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, against windes and euill spirits: Lastly, they sprinkle them with holy-water, blesse them, crosse them, and so horribly corrupt this Sacrament of baptisme. Yea <hi>Durand</hi> a principall schooleman, not in the schooles of the prophets but of the papists (a fit teacher of such schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) setteth out solemnly <note n="r" place="margin">Durand. lib. 1 Enchirid cap. 4</note> the praises of belles, making them publike preachers and driuers away of deuils.

                  <hi>This kinde goeth not out but by fasting and prayer,</hi> as our sauiour teacheth.

Thirdly, we may see the great loue of God to all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> seeing he vouchsafeth not onely to bee their God, but the God of their seede after them, as God himselfe <note n="t" place="margin">Gcn. 17, 1, 2, 7,</note> promiseth to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. <hi>I will make my couenant betweene me and thee, and thy seede after thee in their generations, I will be their God: walke before mee, and be thou vpright.</hi> And ought we not to walke in the vprightnesse of our heart before this mercifull and all sufficient God, <hi>Who thus aboundesh in kindenesse toward vs, and the fruite of our body?</hi> Let vs returne vnto him loue for his loue, who loued vs first.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this teacheth that infants are to be baptized, and <note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> haue as great right and interest in this Sacrament, as they which be in yeares, able to make confession of their faith, Of which we will intreate in the chapter following, where we will proue this truth by testimonies of the scriptures, and maintaine it against the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks that condemne the same.</p>

               <p> ALthough it cannot appeare vnto vs, that infantes and new borne babes brought to be baptized, haue actuall faith, but rather is like they want the habit of faith which haue <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 1, 39 Luk. 1. 15. 44 Iohn. 4, 11</note> not the vse of vnderstanding, vnlesse God extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily work it, which lieth not in vs to iudge of: yet wee baptize them and admit them to this sacrament, which we doe vpon very good grounds and susficient reasons.</p>
               <p>First therefore, we wil proue by euident demonstration out of the scriptures, the doctrin of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s baptisme to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formable to the <hi>Iewes</hi> circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, agreeable to the practise

the Apostles, allowable by the wordes of Christ, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the custome of the primitiue church, reasonable in it selfe, profitable to the infants, auaileable by the ordinance of God, and very comfortable to all christian parents. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we will maintaine this assertion against the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and arguments of the Anabaptists and other aduersaries that haue crossed and contradicted this truth. Lastly, we will shew what euident and necessary vses may be gathred from hence, for the strength of faith, and the increase of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, that the baptising of infants is waran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word <note n="b" place="margin">Reasons wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranting the baptizing of children.</note> of God, I will make it appeare by sundry reasons. We see in the old testament, that all males by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commaundement were willed to be circumcised the <note n="c" place="margin">Gen, 17, 12 Leuit, 12 3 Phil. 3, 5</note> eight day. If God made infants partakers of cirumcision: why should we not holde the same of baptisme, being insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for vs in steed of circumcision, <note n="d" place="margin">col. 2. 11</note> there being the same promises in both, and there being the same ends of both? If then the couenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> remaine stable and stedfast, it dooth no lesse belong to the children of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at this day, then it did appertaine to the children of the Iewes vnder the old Testament: vnlesse peraduenture wee will say, that our sauiour Christ by his comming hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straind or diminished the grace and loue of his father, which were detestable blasphemy against the father, and an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reproach against the sonne of God. From hence then, we reason thus, if the infantes of the Iewes were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then the children of christians are to be baptized: but the infantes of the Iewes were circumcised: therefore also the children of christians are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Against this reason, sundry exceptions are taken by the aduersaries of this doctrin, which are not vnworthy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> They say, circumcision was a signe of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was tyed to be administred the eight day, and that women ought not to be baptised, if baptisme were like to circumcision, in asmuch as they were not circumcised. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, these obiections will easily appeare to be verye ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils

                     </gap>.</note> obserue, both wherein circumcision and baptism a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and in what points they differ. They <note n="e" place="margin">Wherein cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumcision &amp; baptisme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> agree, first, in one author of them both, that is, God himselfe, who firste appointed the Minister of circumcision, which was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and Iohn the Minister of baptisme, whereof hee was called the baptist. Secondly, in the chiefe and principall ends for which they were instituted, namely, to seale vp the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of grace by Christ. Thirdly, by both of them is wrought our visible receiuing into the church: the Iewes were receiued by circumcision, the christians are entred by baptisme. Lastly, by both of them our mortification, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, newnes of life, and iustification are signified. So then they fullie agree in the ends which they respect, and in the things which they signifie, to wit, in the substance and nature of the things themselues.</p>
               <p>Againe circumcision and baptisme differ <note n="f" place="margin">Wherein cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision &amp; baptisme dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> onely in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circumstances: first, in the forme and maner of doing, as circumcision was administred by cutting awaye of the foreskinne and effusiou of blood, but baptisme by washing and sprinkling with water. Secondly, in the outwarde signe, which is different in both. Thirdly, in the circumstaunce of time: for circumcision promised from God grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the <hi>Messias</hi> to come, baptisme in the <hi>Messias</hi> already exhibited. Fourthly, in the subiects or persons that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them: circumcision belongeth onely to the male children, but baptisme is common to male and female. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <note n="g" place="margin">How wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were after a sort</note> howsoeuer the bodies of the men children alone were imprinted, yet through them the women were after a sort made partakers and companions of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so that albeit God commanded onely the males to haue this signe in their flesh, yet the females were not excluded from being members of the church, nor accounted straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Couenants of promise. For as the man is the <note n="h" place="margin">1 cor. xi, 8</note> head of the Woman, so they were accounted as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the man, yea they were reckoned and numbred with the men, namely, the vnmarried with their father, and the


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16298:96"/>
married with their husbands. Now, their circumcision was thus comprehended in the men, so that it was vnto them in stead of circumcision to be borne of the circumcised, may be gathered by many places, as Luke, 13, Where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which Christ healed of a spirit of infirmity bounde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, is called <note n="i" place="margin">Luk, 13, 11</note> the daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to signifie that the priuiledge of his posterity belonged no lesse to her and all women that were faithfull, then to the males; and that she was as well his daughter, as they his sonnes. Likewise <hi>Gen.</hi> 34, the sonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> communing with <hi>Hamor</hi> after their sister was humbled and abused, said vnto them, <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 34, 14 15. 16</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot do this thing, to giue our sister to an vncircumcised man, for that were a reproofe vnto vs: but in this we will consent vnto you, if ye will be as we are, that euery man-child among you be circumcised, then we will giue our daughters to you, &amp;c.</hi> where these two are set as contrary one to another, our sister, and the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which teacheth that they were accounted as circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the males, so that it was enough to them to be borne of parents that were circumcised.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they differ in the setled time which is limitted for circumcision, being precisely and necessarily tied to the 8. day: but in baptisme it is not so, there is greater liberty left to the church: yet the Sabbaoth following would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vrgent cause be omitted. Sixtly, circumcision was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the <hi>Israelites</hi> that were the seede of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but Baptisme was instituted for all Nations that are willinge to ioyne themselues to the fellowshippe of the churches of Christ that professe his name, of whatsoeuer Lande and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they be. Lastly, circumcision was to endure onely till the comming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> but the body being come, the figure must cease, whereas baptisme is to continue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world <note n="l" place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, 20</note> as our sauiour teacheth <hi>Math,</hi> 28 <hi>Teach and baptise, and loe</hi> I <hi>am with you vntill the end of the world.</hi> Wherefore, the circumcision of the Turkes which liue in infidelity, and of the <hi>Moores</hi> which professe Christianitye vsed at this day is nothing worth, albeit they retaine the outward sign and ceremonie: because the institution of it


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16298:96"/>
was onely to indure the blessed times of the Gospell. Thus we see, that notwithstanding the differences betweene cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and baptism in circumstances of time and maner of doing: yet being in substance and effect the same, the Argument standeth stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and inuinsible, prouing the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of infants in the time of the Gospell, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of circumcising infantes in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p>Againe, <note n="m" place="margin">The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</note> let vs consider the practise of the Apostles and ages succeeding in this point. For albeit it be not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that any infant was baptized by the hands of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: yet we find in diuers places, that whole families and housholds haue bin baptized, in which no doubt were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infants and sucklings <note n="n" place="margin">act. 16, 13 33 1 cor. 1. 14, 16 act, 18, 8 &amp; 2. 37, 38, 39</note> as <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Lidia</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the faith was baptized, and all her houshold. And againe <hi>Verse.</hi> 33, of the same chapter, the <hi>Iaylor</hi> was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and all that were with him. So was <hi>Crispus</hi> the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue and his houshold baptised, and the houshold of <hi>Stephanas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, when <hi>Peter</hi> commaunded the Iewes, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerted to the faith of Christ, and hungring after sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in him whome before they had crucified, to be baptised: he addeth this as a reason, <hi>For the promise is made to you, and to your children, and to all that are a farre off, euen as many as the LORDE our GOD shall call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse will some say, we read not directly that any infants were heer baptized in these pIaces? But do we <note place="margin">Obiect. answ.</note> read that any wer excluded? And seeing the scripture expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth al the houshold, who shal dare to debar infants? Are not they a principall part of the house? Besides, if the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of children bee not to bee beleeued, because it is not named and expressed: wee might with as good reason shut out women from the Lords Supper (if any were as great an enimie to the communicating of Women as to the baptisinge of Children) seeinge wee do not expressely read, that they were not admitted to


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16298:97"/>
the Lords table in the apostles times. Wherfore, childrens baptisme is no humaine tradition, no apishimitation, no ancient corruption of this Sacrament: but is grounded on the vnblamable practise of the Apostles, which hath the force and strength of a commaundement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ by his owne example aloweth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth their baptisme as we see, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10, when the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples rebuked those that brought little chilren to Christ that he might touch them, he said, <note n="o" place="margin">Mar. 10. 13 14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>Suffer little children to come vnto me, &amp; forbid them not, for of such is the kingdome of God: verily I say vnto you, who soeuer shal not receiue the kingdome of God as a little child, he shal not enter therein.</hi> Wher we are to obserue, that he saith not, of these onely is the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but of such like infants, which shall be in all ages and times of the church. In this act of Christ embracing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants brought vnto him and sharply rebuking his Disciples thatforbad them: we are to consider that he commaundeth children to be brought vnto him, and addeth a reason, <hi>To such belongeth the kingdome of heauen.</hi> If any obiect, It is said, he embraced them, it is not said, he baptized them: or if <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> any reply and say that there is no agreement and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betweene baptizing and embracing: I answer, he <note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> layeth his hands vpon them, he prayeth for them, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth them to his father, and saith <hi>The kingdome of heauen is theirs.</hi> All this is a great deale more then to giue them the outward signe. For if reason require, they should be brought to Christ: why should they not bee receiued to baptisme, which is a signe of our vnion with Christ? If the kingdome of heauen belong to them: why should the signe be denied vnto them, wherby the doore of entrance into the church is opened? Why should we driue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Christ: whom christ calleth vnto himselfe? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any say, these children were of yeares and growne vp in age, able of themselues to come and repaire to christ: For the <hi>Euangeliste</hi> vseth such words as signifie such young infants as are babes and hang vpon their mothers brestes, <note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 2, 12, 16 &amp; ch. 1, 44</note> therefore, by comming in this place he meaneth to draw

               <p>Besides, heerto agreeth the practise and custome of the primitiue church: for no teacher so profound, no docter so learned, no writer so ancient, which doth not refer the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning heereof to the <note n="r" place="margin">Orig. lib, 5 comment. ad Rom.

Let the Anabaptists and aduersaries of this truth tell vs, who was the first author and inuenter of childrens baptisme, if they refer it not to Christ? who first administred it? What was his name, if they cancel, let them not hide it? Let them declare the time when it began? Let them shew the place where it was deuised? Let them name the child first bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, and in what assembly or church it was? If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe these or any of them, let them acknowledge the baptisme of children to bee the ordinaunce of God, and not of man: warranted both by doctrine of the scripture and practise of the church.</p>
               <p>Moreouer if there were no writer to auouch this ancient truth, yet is it in it selfe very right and reasonable. For doe we not see and behold daily verie babes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, or custome of the Manour of which they holde? They knowe not what is done: they perceiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what the Lord of the Manour or stewarde speaketh vnto them: yet we see among the wisest men in this world, this is not thought foolish, neither is such an admission cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into question, but they are afterwarde instructed what they haue done, what they haue vndertak n and taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, what seruices and duties they owe, what their Lord requireth of them.</p>
               <p>Thus they are admitted in their infancy to a temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and possession this they holde to the end of their life: and of the validity of such entrance no tenant maketh


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16298:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doubt. Why then shoulde it seeme vnreasonable to giue them baptisme, the signe of the couenant, being born heirs of the promise, that after they come to discretion they may make vse of it as the rest of the members of the church? They shall understand afterward that which they vnderstand not for the present: and yet if it please GOD to take them in mercy to himselfe from the miseries of the worlde, before they know the mistery of their baptisme, he worketh extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatily by wayes best knowne to himselfe the force of their baptisme in their harts, and sealeth vp their engrafting into Christ I esus. If then children haue the white wande deliuered vnto them to assure them of the inheritance which they holde: let none deny vnto them the partakinge of this sacrament, wherby they are assured of an eternal inheritance howsoeuer for the present time they are not capable of the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the priuiledges and prerogatiues of children are no lesse then those of elder yeares. For infantes are a parte of the Church of GOD, <note n="t" place="margin">children are christs sheepe and members of his body</note> they are the sheep of CHRIST, they are the children of the heauenly father, they are inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the kingdome of heauen, they are redeemed with the blood of CHRIST, and engrafted into his body: why then should they not beare the marke of CHRIST, seeing they are a principall part of his possession? If they be a part of the houshold, they ought to haue entrance into the house: if they belong to the Citty of GOD, who shall dare to shut the gates against them? Or if they be in the number of the sheepe of Christ, who shall presume to keepe them from the sheepe-folde? Or if they be sound members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of christ, who shall cut them off as rotten members? Wherefore then, <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 17. 7 act, 2 39 1 cor, 7. 14.</note> should they not receiue the seale where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the promise is confirmed vnto them, seeing they haue the promise it selfe of saluation? Why shoulde they not be pattakers of the outward signe, <note n="a" place="margin">math xix14</note> seeing they are partakers of the thinge signified? Why should they be put back from the figure, seeing they haue the truth itselfe? Why shoulde they not be partakers of the sacrament with the faithfull,


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16298:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seeing they are enrolled in the fellowship of the faithfull? And who shall depriue them of the seale of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, seeing they are partakers of regeneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes.</p>
               <p>Heereupon thus we reason, whosoeuer are in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant and Church of GOD, to them belongeth bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which is the seale of the couenant: but infants are in the couenant and of the Church: therefore to them belongeth baptisme which is the seale of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. Againe, to whome the promise appertaineth, they may and ought to bee baptized: but the promise was made euen to infants: therefore they may and ought to be baptised.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, to whome forgiuenes of sinnes and the Holy-ghost are promised and giuen, they ought by no meanes to bee denied the outwarde signe: but forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes and the Holy-ghost are promised to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes and giuen vnto them: therefore infantes ought not to bee kept from the element of Water, no more then such as are of yeares of discretion. Thus much of the first point, putting children into the right and possession of Baptisme, as if it were the right heires into their inheritance, from which they haue bene wrongfully and vniuftly dispossessed.</p>
               <p>Hauing now sufficiently prooued by the scripture, that children are to bee baptized: it remaineth that wee shoulde maintaine this assertion against <note n="b" place="margin">Obiections of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils of the Anabaptists. For as the former reasons, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon the euident demonstration of the worde, as vppon a pillar that cannot be shaken, may perswade vs to embrace the truth: so the weakenes and sophistry which appeareth in the Obiections of the aduersaries, ferueth to confirme vs in this perswasion. But let vs examine what is the strength of them.</p>
               <p>First they obiect it was neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that infants shold be baptized. I answer, vnblamable examples and practises <note place="margin">Obiection Answere</note>


                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:16298:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not contradicted, are in the nature of precepts. Againe, the will of God approuing and appointing childrens baptisme appeareth, <note n="c" place="margin">col 2. 11, 12</note> in that it came in place of vncircumcision, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is our circumcision.</hi> Besides we haue <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 28, xix i. cor x, 1, 2</note> a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, <hi>Go teach all nations and baptize them.</hi> And the Apostle saith, <hi>all were baptized in the cloud and in the sea.</hi> Christ saith, al nations, the Apostles saith all the <hi>Israelites:</hi> let them shew, where infants are excepted and exempted: for wee hold this as a certaine principle, that a generall commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement includeth the particular, and comprehendeth the same vnder it, as well as if it were by name expresled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they obiect, if infants may be baptised, then they may be admitted to the Lords supper: for why should <note place="margin">Obiection</note> not the supper be giuen to the whole church as well as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisine? I answere there is not the like reason and respect of both. There is great difference betweene these two sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For baptisme is a signe of our entrance and receiuing <note place="margin">Answere</note> into the church, so that the Supper is to be granted to none but to such as are baptised, and are fit to beare strong meat, being instituted for our confirmation and sealing vnto vs, that God hauing once receiued vs into the church, will also euermore preserue vs in it, that we neuer fall from it, nor forsake it, and will nourish and cherish vs by the body and blood of Christ. Wherefore, the Lord Iesus, to shew that his Supper was not for children but for men, would not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister it in the element of milke, which is for infants and for new borne Babes: but in bread and wine which are for stronge men that are of age.</p>
               <p>Againe, sundry conditions and considerations are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the supper which debar young infants, that although they are to be baptized, yet they ought not to be admitted to the Lords supper, seeing by their young yeares they are excluded. For it is required of all those that come to this supper, <note n="e" place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, xi, 26 28, 29</note> to shew foorth the Lords death, to discerne the body and blood of Christ, and try themselues whether they haue faith and repentance. But infants cannot doe these thinges, they cannot shew foorth the Lordes death they are


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16298:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not apt to discerne his body and blood, they are not able to examine themselues, and therefore infants for good causes are excluded from this Supper.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they obiect, <note n="f" place="margin">Mar. 16, 16. Math. 28, 19</note> that it is said <hi>Teach and baptize:</hi> and <note place="margin">Obiect. 3.</note> again, He <hi>that shall beleeue and be baptized shall be saued:</hi> where vpon they conclude, that such as beleeue not, are not to be baptized; inasmuch as Christ before baptisme commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth teaching, and afterward ioyneth baptizing with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing. But infants are not capable of doctrine, neither do they actually beleeue: therefore they are not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Again, <note n="g" place="margin">act, 2. 38</note> if repentance be necessarily ioyned as <hi>Act. 2 Amend your liues and be baptized:</hi> then infants must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and secluded, who cannot repent. But repentance is necessarily required: therefore infants are to be barred from the sacrament of baptisme. I answere, first, those <note place="margin">Answer</note> sentences are not generall to all, but belong onely to men of sufficient yeares and discretion to discerne betweene good and euill. By this fraud of extending, stretching, and falsely applying generall sentences of Scripture, a man might reare and raise many monstrous conclusions. If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would go about to proue that children are not to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and sed with coporall foode, because the Aposte would haue none to eate <note n="h" place="margin">1 Thess 3. x.</note> but such as labour, were he not worthy to be spitted at or hissed out of the schools, because he carrieth that indifferently to all ages, which is limited and restrained to a certaine age? So must we not rack and rent asunder the <note n="i" place="margin">Luk. xiii. 3. 5 Rom x. xvii. Mar, xvi, xvi Heb. xi, 6</note> generall sentences of scripture, <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall al perish: faith commeth by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word of God: he that beleeueth and is baptized, shal be saued.</hi> These belong onely to men of discretion, and are not to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to infants, whom they do not concerne. Againe, Christ in those words instructeth his Apostles, what order they should obserue in the conuersion of the Gentiles: first, they must instruct them in faith, then baptize them being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, and lastly guide them in true obedience being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, when he addeth. <note n="k" place="margin">Math 28, 20</note> 
                  <hi>Teaching them to obserue what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I haue commaunded you.</hi> Besides, if they strictly vrge


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16298:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and stifly stand vpon the wordes, as they literally lye in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: why may we not first baptize them before wee teach them, because it is said, baptizing them in the name of the Trinity, and teaching them to obserue what I commannd. But hee intreateth in this place of such as are growne vppe, which must first haue knowledge in the gospell, faith in Christ, and repentance from dead workes before they bee baptized: but infants are baptized by reason of the promise made to their parentes. Moreouer, we might oppose vnto these, the example of circumcision, which we know and they are not ignorant was giuen to infantes, who could not yet beleeue: so that such as bar them from baptisme, because they are not capable of faith and repentance, might in like manner exclude the infants of the Isralites from circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Baptisme is the sacra. of repentance and faith, though neither of these be in infancy, yet they are baptised to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith to come, which albeit they be not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed in them, yet by the fruites afterward they shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be in them. Lastly, if baptisme should be giuen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those that truely beleeue, it should likewise be denied to such as are of vnderstanding: for wee are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of these that they do truely beleeue, and certainely apprehend the promises of the gospel. Wherfore, if infants are not to be baptized, because they haue not faith and want repentance: neither are they of sufficient age to be baptized, of whom it cannot be directly and vndoubtedly said, they do beleeue. <hi>Simon</hi> the sorcerer mentioned <note n="l" place="margin">act, 8. 13. 20</note> in the Actes of the apostles was baptized, and yet remained an hypocrite. If they say, profession of faith is sufficient to make members of the visible church: I answer, our sauiour speaketh not of a bare profession of faith, when he saith <hi>He that beleeueth and is baptized shal be saued,</hi> for then al that professe faith should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 9</note> 
                  <hi>The reward of their faith,</hi> which is the saluationof their soules. Againe, profession of faith is for such as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, which agreeth not to the age of infants: as they cannot deny the faith before men, which they haue not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged: no more can they confesse the truth of doctrin,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16298:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which they neuer learned. Now, to be borne in the church and in the couenant, is infants in place and stead of an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all confession and reall profession. Such as are growne vp must beleeue with the heart, <note n="n" place="margin">Rom, 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in sinne my mother concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me.</hi> So the Apostle Paule, Rom. 5. <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moyses, euen ouer them also that sinned not after the manner of the transgression of Adam, which was the figure of him that was to oome: for as by one mans disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Wherefore, such as holde infants without all guilt of sinne, neuer knewe the greatenesse of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, of Gods iustice, of mans misery, and of Christes endlesse mercy.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they obiect, that Christ himselfe was not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <note place="margin">Obiect. 5.</note> vntill 30, yeares of age. I answer, no more did he preach <note place="margin">Answer,</note> before he was thirty: yet hence it followeth not, that none ought to enter that calling before that age. True it is, hee that desireth that worthye office must bee no new plant, no younger Scholler, none lately come to the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and gathered immediately from heathenish religion to the fellowship of the gospel: yet the office of teaching is not tyed to 30, yeares, the age may be lesse if the gifts be great,


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16298:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and fit for that calling. Againe, Christ stood not in neede to be baptized in respect of himselfe, being without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or actuall sinne to he washed away, and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> at the first put him back: <note n="r" place="margin">Math, 3, 15</note> yet he would be baptized for our sakes, to fulfill all righteousnesse, to sanctifie our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in himselfe, and that thereby we might know he was installed into his osfice. But we stand in neede to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, to seale vp the washing away of our sinnes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a great difference in this respect betweene Chrift and vs. Besides, the <hi>Euangelist</hi> doth testifie, that albeit our sauiour were baptized at thirty years of age, yet he was circumcised at 8. daies old. Now wee haue proued before, that the same which circumcision was to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> baptisme is to al christians. If then he in his infancy wer circumcised, then children in their in fancy may be baptized, and are not commaunded to waite thirty yeares: for baptisme is our circumcision as the Apostle teacheth: but Christ in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy was circumcised, <note n="s" place="margin">Luk. 2, 21</note> when the eight dayes were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished: therfore children in their infancy may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Furthermore, baptisme was not hitherto as yet in vse, it was not commanded to be vsed when he was a child, and therefore he could not possibly be baptized, vnlesse we will imagin he might be baptized, before baptisme was. So that wee see, as he would not haue his circumcision deferred one day beyond the time appoynted: so hee was presently baptized, so soone as baptisme was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and administred by <hi>Iohn.</hi> Fiftly, we are no more tied to this circumstance of time in christs baptisme, then we are to other circumstances of time, place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Supper: he ministred it in an vpper Chamber, and before his passion: we in churches, before dinner, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his resurrection. Lastly, when the time appointed came, that the promised sauior and redeemer of mankinde should manifest himselfe to the world, then he shewed himselfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, then he came to the preaching &amp; baptisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; began to publish the glad tidings of saluation, <note n="t" place="margin">Mar. 1, 15</note> and to exhort men to repent &amp; beleeue the gospel. These are the


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16298:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chiefest obiections against childrens baptisme, that carry any shew and probability of reason, which hitherto wee haue dissolued and discussed. And this is the second point before propounded.</p>
               <p>Now as we haue seene the truth proued by the scripture, and maintained it against all the ignorant cauils of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistes</hi> and other <hi>Arrians</hi> of <hi>Transiluania,</hi> that haue <note n="u" place="margin">Ministri. Transiluan. con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tra Trinit &amp; in carnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem domini.</note> oppugned this truth: so let vs come to see the benifit of this doctrine, and what profit commeth by baptisme of children that are without knowledge, without vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, without faith, and without repentance. What vse can there be of this? Much euery way, as well as by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising an infant of eight daies old. First, consider from <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> hence, a plaine and palpable errour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Lindan. lib. 4. panopl. Bellar. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo dei. lib. 4 cap. 9</note> that teach that the baptisme of children is by tradition, not by deuine institution, from their word vnwritten, not in the word of God written. But we haue confuted the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistes</hi> by the Scriptures, and conuinced them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of circumcision, by the tenor of the couenant, by the holinesse of their birth, by their redemption through the blood of Christ, and by the practise of the Apostles. This is better armour, these are stronger weapons, this is a sharper sword to cut in sunder the corrupt heresie of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistes,</hi> then the wooden dagger of humaine tradition which the church of <hi>Rome</hi> draweth out against them. The Scripture is all sufficient <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16</note> to proue all truth, and to beate downe all false doctrin that lifteth vp it selfe against God. Wherefore, we hold their traditions, to be superstitions: &amp; their vnwritten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Thirdly, if infants haue interest in baptisme, then hence it <note place="margin">Vse, 3.</note> floweth that all are conceiued and borne in originall sin, <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh, 3, 6 1 Cor. 15. 22, Rom 3, 23, 24, Eph 2, 1, 2</note> and whatsoeuer is of the flesh is flesh. So the apostle saith, <hi>As in Adam all dy, euen so in Christ shall all be made aliue.</hi> There is no difference, all haue sinned, and are depriued of the glorious kingdome of God: we must be iustified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ Iesus: by nature all are the children of wrath, and borne dead in sins and trespasses, infants not excepted. We learne therfore that whatsoeuer is begotten of man is sinfull and corrupt, it must be cut and pared away, we must be renewed and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the spirit of God, clensing vs from our sins: yea the children of the faithfull parents, whose corruptions are mortified, whose lustes are subdued, whose flesh is tamed and brought vnder the obedience of the will of God, are notwithstanding brought forth in sin, because they are born by carnall generation, and not by spirituall regeneration: as corne winnowed from the chaffe <note n="d" place="margin">August. de poenit. merit &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Eunuch, If thou beleeuest, thou maiest.</hi> Thus we see, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those that professe the faith, belong to the church of God: the children of <hi>Pagans</hi> belong not to the church of God: loe how great a difference there is betweene them. Heerby then, the children of the faithfull are discerned and distinguished from the prophane multitude of <hi>Atheists, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, Libertines, Arrians, Anabaptistes, Turkes, Sarazens, Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and other barbarous nations, <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 2, 12</note> which are without christ, without hope, without God in the world: wheras the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seede of all the faithfull belong to the church of God, and are reckoned in the company of the church. For this <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 11, 16,</note> cause, the Apostle calleth the whole posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> holy, that is, consecrated and halowed to God, <hi>If the roote be holy, the branches are also holy.</hi> Not that the children of the faithfull do want originall sinne, or that they gather any actuall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or inherent righteousnesse by carnall generation and propagation from their parents, but because by benefit of the couenant of God, and by force of his gratious promise, they are separated from prophane infidels, and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bosome of the church, as <hi>Noah</hi> was into the Arke.?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this doctrine setteth forth the honor and glory of God. For is not God greatly glorified, when he sheweth <note place="margin">Vse. 5.</note> himselfe true in his promises and hath mercy vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note n="i" place="margin">Deut, 7, 9 Esa. 59, 21 Exod. 20, 6</note> for a thousand generations?

               <p>Likewise so often as we consider how our children are by grace accepted, by baptisme consecrated vnto God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Oxe and Asse? Or if our chiefest care be to cloth them wel, and to apparrell them warme: what doe we <note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8</note> which the Turkes and infidels do not, as wel as we? Haue not they as great a portion in this, as we? but our obedience to the wil of God, and duty to our children must exceede theirs, if we will enter <note n="s" place="margin">Math 5. 20</note> into the kingdome of heauen. Whereby we see, that they are greatly deceiued, who when, they haue made honest prouision for the sustenance and sustentation of their children in this world, wil say they haue done their part, although they haue not taught them to know God, these haue the greatest and chiefest account to make for their soules. Now if this be a greeuous sinne, to neglect the teaching of our children the feare of God: then they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and double their iniquity, who by their corrupt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample do lead them into euil, and so murther their soules. For children in steade of godly and religious instruction, do oftentimes heare their fathers sweare, swagger, lie, raile, and slaunder: see them deale deceitfully and vniustly, and marke their walking in euery euill way, making their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as it were any mage and representation of Hell it selfe, by practise of all manner of abhominations leading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this doctrine is very comfortable to children themselus. For howsoeuer they cannot know or remember <note place="margin">vse. 8</note> their owne baptisme: yet they are to consider that they liue in a church and among a people, where infants are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily baptized, and sealed with the signe of the couenant of God. Besides, it is and euer hath bin <note n="t" place="margin">A laudable custome of the Church to haue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> of auncient time a laudable custome in the church to haue speciall witnesses (men of credit and estimation) of euery childes and infants baptisme, whome commonly wee call God-fathers and God-mothers. The steps of this truth may be traced out, if we consider <note n="u" place="margin">Esa. 8. 1, 2, 3</note> what the Pprophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>Chap</hi> 8, where he declareth that so soone as his wife had borne him a son, he gaue him his name (which was done at circumcision) and tooke two <note n="a" place="margin">Parents no. fit witnesles of their own childrens bap tisme.</note> faithfull witnesses <hi>Uriah</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> to testifie the circumcision of his sonne, and the solemne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16298:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to him of that name in the presence of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And howsoeuer <hi>Uriah</hi> walked not with a right foot, but turned aside from the pure worshippe of God to set vp the idolatrous Alter after the fashion of <hi>Damascus</hi> to seede the fancy of <hi>Ahaz:</hi> yet he was a man of reputation, whose testimony was sufficient to assure the naming of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets sonne: because the times to come woulde be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and full of many calamities. For their children were named, when they were <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 21, 3, Luk. 1. 59 &amp; 2 21</note> circumcised: as now our children are named, when they are baptized.</p>
               <p>So likewise the Church oftentimes lyeth vnder the crosse, and is subiect to persecution, as <note n="c" place="margin">Reuel. 12. 6</note> the Woman dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the Wildernesse, <hi>Reuelations</hi> 12, 6, and so the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of many members might many times be doubted of and called into question, (forasmuch as no impressiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in the flesh, as there did in circumcision) the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue thought it conuenient to require certaine men to bee as speciall witnesses of infantes their bringing to Christ and to the church by baptisme, and of their names giuen them in their baptisme.</p>

               <p>HItherto we haue handled al the outward parts of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme now we are orderly to proceede to the inwarde partes. The inward parts of baptisme are such as are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the outward. Those are <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 28. 19 20.</note> foure in number: first, God the father: secondly, the spirit: thirdly, Christ: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the soule clensed, as we see Math. 28, 19. <hi>Teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptizing them in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy-ghost: he that beleeueth and is baptized, shall be saued.</hi> Heer we see these foure inward parts <note n="b" place="margin">Foure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of baptisme</note> are named and expressed. This is also euidently proued <hi>Math,</hi> 3, in the baptisme of Christ, where the Trinity <note n="c" place="margin">Math, 3, xi</note> of persons was manifested.</p>
               <p>These inward parts do directly and fitly answeare to the outward. The father is represented by the Minister: the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit worketh by the worde: Christ is sealed by the water: and the soule clensed is signified by the body that is washed. Now, <note n="d" place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the outward and inward parts.</note> there is a notable agreement, a singular vnion, and fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene these partes, where the minister hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and reference to the father, the word to the spirit, the water to Christ, and the body dipped to the faithfull clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For euen as the minister by the word of institution, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and applyeth the water to the washing of the bodye: so God the father, through the working of the spirite offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and applyeth the blood of Christ, to the clensing of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Hauing seene the proportion of the parts between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, let vs consider of them particularly and in order. The <note n="e" place="margin">The first in vvard part of baptisme is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> first inward part is God the father, represented by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. The minister calling vpon the name of God, vseth the water to wash, and washeth the party baptized with the element of water, which sealeth vp gods incorporating and ingrafting <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> of the baptized into Christ, and our spirituall regeneration. Hence it is, that when Iohn baptized, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was present, as president of the worke, when loe, his voice came from heauen, saying, <hi>This is my beloued sonne in whome I am well pleased.</hi> Now let vs come to the vses.</p>

                  </gap> first of all, to strengthen our faith in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> of our fins, in imputation of Christs righteousnes, in


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16298:106"/>
mortification of sinne by the force of Christs death, and in sanctification through Christs resurrection. Wherefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Minister doth nothing, touching or towarde the clensing of the soule: yet in regard of Gods ordinance and our benefit, the ministery of man is somewhat, which whosoeuer despiseth, doth despise God the author of it. For whensoeuer the eye of the body seeth the minister pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the water, and washing the body: we must behold by saith god the father, offering the blood of his own son, to be water of life to our soules. And let vs all make this vse of the Churches baptism to the comfort of our own harts, so often as we see it administred: let vs not rest in it, as in a work done to another, and nothing concerning our selues, but euermore helpe our inward affection by the outwarde action: and alwaies as the eye of the body beholdeth the Minister, let the eye of the faith, be fastned firmely vppon the Father, who maketh the Sacramentall rites auaileable, which are openly done before vs for our edification.</p>
               <p>Again, it teacheth, that we must not rest in the outward <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> washing, nor in the externall actions of the Minister: but euer consider what is offered to our considerations therin, and when the father offereth to vs his sonne, let vs not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him. For, he that satisfieth himselfe with the outwarde work, is as he that catcheth after the shadow, and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the substance; or as one that maketh much of the garments, but respecteth little the body it self, which ought to be had in greatest price and estimation.</p>
               <p>Lastly, is God the father an inward part of baptism? then <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> we must take heed, we giue not that to the Minister which is proper to god the father, whereby hee is robbed of the honor and glory due to his great name. The Minister may wash the body and clense the flesh, but can goe no further: he medleth not with sanctification of the conscience from dead workes, which is not in the power of mortall man to do: so that god giueth the thing, and men giue the signe, yea while the Minister offereth the one, God the father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the other.</p>

               <p>THe second inwarde part of baptisme <note n="a" place="margin">The second inward part of baptisme is the holy spirit.</note> is the spirit of God, hauing relation to the word and promise of God. This <note n="b" place="margin">Math, 3, 11 16</note> appeareth <hi>Math, 3 11, He baptizeth with the holy-ghost and with fire:</hi> And verse 16, When Christ was baptized, the heauens were opened vnto him, and he saw the spirit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending like a doue, and lighting vpon him. So the apostle, 1 Cor, 6 saith, <hi>ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are iustified in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of our God.</hi> And chap. 12, of the same Epistle, <hi>By oke spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Iewes or Graecians, whether we be bonde or free, and haue beene all made to drinke into one spirit.</hi> And Tit, 3. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he saued vs, by washing of the new-birth, and the renewing of the holy-ghost, which he shedde on vs aboundantly, through Iesus Christ our sauiour.</hi> All these testimonies teach vs, that the Holy spirit of God is a necessary inward part of this sacrament, and that the baptisme of the spirit ioyned to the word, giueth force vnto it, who worketh in our soules that which water doth in our bodies, so that without the spirit it is nothing.</p>
               <p>From hence we learne, that it is not the dipping of vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <note place="margin">Vse. 1</note> or the sprinkling of vs with water, by the Minister that maketh vs partakers of Christ, but it commeth from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the spirit, who in time performeth what is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by outwarde signes, and promised by the worde.</p>
               <p>Againe we learne heereby, that the spirit is true God, <note place="margin">vse. 2</note> equall with the father and the sonne. For who is able to make the worde and Sacramentes auaileable, but onely God?</p>
               <p>Seeing then this is the proper worke of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghost, to open the heart, to teach the conscience, to seale vppe to the daye of redemption, and to helpe our infirmities in heating, in praying, and receiuing the


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16298:107"/>
Sacraments: he must needs be acknowledged to bee true God the <note n="c" place="margin">Icot. 12. 4 5, 8. 9, x, xi Reuel. 1, 4</note> giuer of these graces. So we see, that in the forme of the administration of this sacrament, the blessed spirit is named and rehearsed, <note n="d" place="margin">Mat 28, xix</note> and hath his order togither with the father and the sonne. This therefore is a principle of our faith, to be learned, confessed, and beleeued.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are heerby to take heed and beware, that we <note place="margin">vse. 3.</note> giue not to the word that which is proper to the spirit, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafteth vs into Christ, he keepeth vs that we fal not from Christ, he maketh the word and promise of the institution profitable vnto vs, without whome it shoulde be vnto vs as sounding brasse or a tinckeling Cymball. Wherefore, as GOD the father in mercy maketh the promise, so his spirite must assure it to the Consciences of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let vs learne whensoeuer we come to the Worde or sacramentes, to craue the gracious assistance of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">vse. 4.</note> spirit, to guide direct, and regenerate vs to eternal life, to sanctifie vs, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Iohn. v, 7</note> and to assure vs of gods endlesse fauour in Christs Iesus, as 1 Ioh 5. <hi>There be three which beare witnesse in heauen, the father, the word, and the holy spirit: and these three are one.</hi> The Holy-ghost by his grace and vertue worketh in vs steadfastly to beleeue the truth of Gods worde, and the gratious promises of saluation: as he is the author, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and begetter of faith in vs, so he increaseth it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs fit to receiue Christ, and to apply him with all his gifts vnto our selues, and sendeth vs into the full fruition and possession of Christ. He is our comforter to certifie vs of our reconciliation to god, and to make vs reioyce vnder the crosse, knowing that <note n="f" place="margin">Rom, 5, 3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>tribulation bringeth foorth patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the loue of god is shed abroade in our harts by the holy-ghost which is giuen vnto vs.</hi> He is the earnest and seale of our inheritance, by whom we are sealed vp to euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>Thus we see, that howsoeuer the increase and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

from the holy-ghost, who is vnto our faith as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row vnto the bones, as moysture vnto the tree, and as a comfortable raine vnto the fruites of the earth. If this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward maister and teacher be wanting, the sacraments <note n="g" place="margin">The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments profit not without the spirit.</note> can worke no more in our mindes, then if the bright Sunne should shine to the blind eies, or a loud voice sound in deafe eares, or fruitefull corne fall into the barren wildernesse. Wherefore, least the word of saluation should sound in our eares in vaine, and Sacraments ioyned to the word should be present before our eies in vaine; the spirit worketh in vs whensoeuer we come vnto them aright, he mollifieth the hardnesse of our heartes, he frameth vs to new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and assureth vs that God offereth to vs his owne sonne for our iustification and saluation.

foundation, and end of baptisme. Likewise, <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> the Apostle sheweth the same, 1 Pet 3, 21. <hi>Baptisme answering to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Arke, saueth vs by the resurrection of Iesus Christ.</hi> There is no more force in outward baptisme to saue, the whole vertue and force floweth from the streame of Christs blood, as the true materiall cause thereof, wherein the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of in ward baptisme doth consist. The truth being eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the pouring out of the blood of CHRIST is one of the inward partes of Baptisme, let vs see the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>The vse of this part teacheth diuerse pointes. First, that the outward washing with water, is not the washing away <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> of sins: for then whosoeuer were dipped in it should receiue forgiuenesse of sinnes, repentance from dead workes, and sanctification of the spirit, whether he beleeued or not: <note n="e" place="margin">act. 8. 22,</note> which is otherwise, as we see <hi>Act.</hi> 8, 22. Also, they should not, and could not be Christians, and eternally saued, which are not outwardly washed, but departing this life without baptisme, they should perish in the next world without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse or redemption, and so our condicion were worse then the <hi>Iewes</hi> their condition in times past, and the grace of God more restrained vnder the Gospell, then it was vnder the law, <hi>Moyses</hi> offering more mercy then Christ himselfe. So then, the washing with water serueth to ratifie the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Christs blood for the remission of our sinnes, and the imputation of his righteousnesse to our instification, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1, 7</note> as 1 Ioh. 1, 7. <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ his sonne doth clense vs from all sinne.</hi> So Reuel. 1, 5. <hi>He hath loued vs and washed vs from our sinnes in his blood, and made vs Kings and Priestes vnto GOD euen his father.</hi> And Col. 1, 14 the A postle saith, <hi>In him wee haue redemption by his bloode, that is, forgiuenesse of sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, when wee see with our bodily eyes the Water poured vpon the body of the baptized: we must behold <note place="margin">Vse. 2</note> and consider with the eyes of faith the blotting out of all our sinnes, as well originall as actuall, as well after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme as before baptisme, by the pretious blood of Christ,


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16298:108"/>
that wee may assure our selues it is no idle action. For wee must not behold the Sacramentall rites, as certaine dombe gestures or stage-like shewes without substance and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation but wee must make them serue to further our faith and edification.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it teacheth vs, not to be led by the outward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to measure the truth or to iudge of the substance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilme <note place="margin">vse. 3.</note> by the outward signe and visible partes: but to haue our faith fixed on Christ, crucified on the Crosse, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in baptisme. The infidell seeing children solemnely baptized in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the Holy-ghost, will rashly and ignorantly coniesture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bee there, but naked rites, and bare Water: but the faithfull and true Christian doth beholde the washing of the soule and clensing of the heart by the dearest blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>So in the Lordes Supper, to the vnbeleeuer appeareth nothing but Bread and Wine, because we see with our eies, wee receiue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

accounting it a foolish &amp; weak means to saue mankind, that life should spring out of death, glory come out of shame, power proceed out of weakenesse, and triumphant victory arise out of his contemptible sufferings: but the faithfull soule acknowledgeth in this mystery of Godlinesle, the high hand and vnsearchable wisedome of God.

               <p>HItherto we haue handled the parts of baptisme both outward and inward: now let vs proceed to the vses, the last point to be obserued in this Sacrament. The vses of baptisme are in number <note n="a" place="margin">Three vses of baptisme.</note> three: first to shew our planting, ingrafting, and incorporating into the body of christ: secondly, to seale vp the remission and forgiuenesse of all our sinnes: thirdly, to teach vs to dye vnto sinne and liue vnto righteousnesse and true sanctification. These endes <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 6, 3 4, 5, 6</note> appeare euidently by the wordes of the Apostle, Rom. 6. <hi>Know ye not that al we which haue been baptized into IESVS CHRIST, haue beene baptized into his death? We are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried then with him by baptisme into his death, that like as CHRIST was raised vppe from the dead to the glory of the father, so wee also should walke in newnesse of life. For if we be planted with him to the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of his death, euen so shall wee be to the similitude of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, knowing this, that our olde Man is crucified with


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16298:111"/>
him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serue sinne.</hi> In this place the Apostle setteth before vs the former ends of baptisme expressely.</p>
               <p>Touching the first vse, <note n="c" place="margin">The first vse of bapt. i. to shew our ingrafting in to Christ.</note> he sheweth that by it is signified and sealed our vniting, setting, <note n="d" place="margin">1 cor. 12, 13 Cal. 3, 27</note> and inserting into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, to remaine in him soreuer, as braunches in the vine, as 1 Cor, 12. <hi>By one spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be bonde or free:</hi> where he teacheth that by baptisme wee become one body with Christ.

               <p>Thus we see, we are seuered from the world to haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshippe with CHRIST, and are set once in him for euer, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2, 19 Rom 8, 33, 34. 35, 37, 38, 39</note> because he that commeth to CHRIST once, he casteth him not away, hee shall neuer hunger, he shall neuer thirst, he shall not be lost but hue for euer, as the Apostle saith, <hi>If they had been of vs, doubtles they had continued with vs,</hi> And paule to this purpose saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, <hi>Who shal lay any thing to the charg of GODS chosen? it is GOD that instifieth, who shall condemne?

So then the second vse of Baptisme is, to assure vs of the remission and pardon of our sinnes, that we may be vnblamable and acceptable to god. This is signified by the outward ceremony of washing and sprinkling, to wit, the sprinkling of our soules with the blood of Christ for the forgiuenes of all sinnes, <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2. 38, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Ye are buried with him through Baptisme, in whome ye are also raised vppe together through the faith of the operation of GOD, which raised him vp from the dead: and you which are deade in sinnes, and in the vncircumcision of your flesh, hath hee quickned together with him, forgiuing you all your trespasses.</hi> The meaning of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is not that, baptisme <note n="c" place="margin">Baptisme doth not of it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre grace</note> bestoweth or giueth forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16298:113"/>
but onely signeth, sealeth, and assureth our pardon: euen as remistion of sins and the righte ousnesse of faith were not in the old Testament by circumcision conferred, but confirmed vnto the faithfull. The grace of pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sinnes, is not attained but by faith in Christ, so that the worke of baptisme will not effect it. Moreouer we haue proued, that it is not lawfull to baptize such as are in yeares, vnlesse they make open profession of their faith in Christ, and repentance from the workes of the olde man: wherefore, they obtaine them not by the outward washing with water in baptisme. So then we are no lesse assuredly washed by the blood of Christ from the spots of our soules, then outwardly we are washed with water from the filth of the body. For the force of his death hath that effectuall working in clensing our soules from the corruption and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of sinne, which naturall water hath in washing our bodies. By the merit of his death we haue full forgiueneste of all our sinnes, not onely originall but actuall, not onely past but present and to come, whose blood is neuer drawne dry, but is euer fresh and full of efficacy.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the wordes deliuered by the minister in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme at the commaundement of christ, namely, <note n="c" place="margin">Math, 28. 19,</note> 
                  <hi>I baptize thee in the name, of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost,</hi> should alwaies be in our eares, euen vntill the last gasp, and by them we ought to be assured of the ful forgiuensse of our offences against God. For the blood of Christ, by which we are once washed, can neuer be drawne dry, but is euer fresh, full of force and strength, to the continuall clensing of our filthinesse and iniquities, so that they neuer come into the sight of God, neither are imputed vnto vs. Wherefore, it is like vnto a sealed charter, whereby is confirmed that all our sinnes are blotted out. We are all taught by our baptisme, that none of the enemies of our saluation shall be able to lay any sinne to our charge Art thou tempted to thinke, that Christs blood was not shed for thee? That thy transgressions are not pardoned? That thou shalt be brought to iudgement for them? Doth Sathan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And if Originall sinne were extinguished and vtrerly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in baptisme, then they which are baptized, shoulde sin no more: but we see they sin again after their baptism.

               <p>This also was taught in those <note n="c" place="margin">1 pet. 3. 20, 21</note> liuely types answering our baptisme, to wit, the flood that drownd the old world,

while <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were preserued in the Arke. Also the red sea in which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host perished, but the people of God. were deliuered. For as God destroyed in the waters and as it were buried in the flood the world, but saued a remnant of grace: so doth God, through christ, mortifie the old man, raise againe the new man, and seale them both in our baptisme.</p>
               <p>Likewise, as <hi>GOD</hi> deliuered his people out of the hands of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and opened them a way through the red sea, and drowned their enimies that they saw them no more aliue: so by baptisme, he assureth our deliuerance from the thral dome and bondage of sinne (which bringeth greater slauery and captiuity then any slaue is in, vnder his earthly maister) and the destruction of the flesh, that it shall not hurt or condemn vs. We are al <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 51. 7 Rom. 5, 12</note> born in sins and trespasses: we haue need of repentance and regeneration.</p>
               <p>We see then what vse we are to make of our baptisme, euen labor to attaine to the efficacy and fruit of it, that it may not be a bare and barren signe. <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets earnestly exhort the people of Israell, to shewe forth the force and effect of their circumcision, <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 10, 16 &amp; 30. 6</note> to cut away the fore-skin of their harts, and harden their necks no more, as we see, <hi>Deut, 10. 16. The Lorde did set his delight in thy fathers, to loue them, and did chuse their seed after them, euen you aboue all people, Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your hearts, and harden your neckes no more,</hi> And in another place, <hi>The Lord thy GOD will circumcise thine heart, and the hearte of thy seede, that thou maiest loue the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soule, that thou maiest liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So the Prophet</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Ier, 4, 4</note> Ieremy <hi>saith,</hi> Breake vppe your fallowe grounde, and sowe not among thornes: be circumcised to the Lorde, and take away the fore-skinnes of yonr heartes, ye men of Iudah, and inhabitantes of Hierusalem, least my wrath come foorthe like fire, and burne, but none can quench it, because of the wickednes of your inuentions.</p>
               <p>Circumcision was the thing wherin they bosted aboue al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>things: it was their glory wheros they bragged, to be a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people,

peculiar to God. Now the Prophets recall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them from trusting in outwarde signes and lying words, <note n="g" place="margin">Ier, 7. 8</note> that shall not profit: and stirre them vp to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and effect therof, not to rest in cutting off a thin peece of skinne, but to cut off quite and cleane their lusts and corruptions which rebell against the spirit. This the Apostle teacheth <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 2, 28 29</note> euidently. <hi>He is not a Iew which is one outward neither is that circumcision vvhich is outvvard in the flesh: but he is a Ievv vvhich is one vvithin, and the circumciston is of the hart in the spirit, not in the Letter, vvhose praise is not of men, but of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The outward Letter is of no moment with God, it must be the circumcision of the heart, otherwise the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the flesh is nothing. So, if we woulde haue God to take vs for his people and heritage, <note n="i" place="margin">We must all be baptized in hart</note> we must be all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in our hearts and our soules. What, will some say, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in soule, and in heart? What is that? Or how can this be? Can the water wash the soule? Surely, the Water cast vppon our bodies is nothing, if we haue not the truth of it. As then the apostle Paule maketh a difference between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumcision of the spirit, and outward circumcision of the letter, insomuch that if they would haue the true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision indeed, they must haue that which is within: so is there a great difference between the baptism of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of the letter, between that of the soul and the other of the body, betweene that which is outwarde, and that which is inward. Whosoeuer would haue the true baptism indeed, he must be clensed within, repent of his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, mortifie his imaginations, deny himselfe, renounce his affections, and offer vp his soule and body in sacrifice to God, that he may renew and regenerate vs: otherwise, it is a certaine thinge, we were neuer indeede and in truth baptized. For as the Iewes were charged to be vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, though the fore-skin of the flesh were cut off, and so they were circumcised in body: so, we may in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be charged to be vnbaptized, albeit we haue bin out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly washed with water.</p>

Yes euen to vs For we shall bee condemned for our vnclensed and vnsanctified heartes, not answering to the truth of our baptisme. For so much we profit by baptisme, as we profit in mortification.

Behold, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is the seale of GOD, which serueth, not to seale conueyances of earthly possessions as house and landes: but to assure vs, that wee are called to the heauenly life: and bringeth good assurance and warrant with it, that we be washed from our sinnes, by the blood of our Lorde I esus christ, and borne again by his holy spirit.

I am not ignorant that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers and times succeeding, haue giuen vnto it other names, and not vnfitly: but my purpose being not so much to alle age the councels or doctors of the church, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the simple and vnlearned, I wil content my selfe with expounding such termes and titles, as are penned in the word of God, and pointed out by the spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Now then, let vs render <note n="g" place="margin">Reasons rendred of the former names</note> the reasons of such names, as this Sacrament is entituled withall. It is called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion because we haue a communion &amp; fellowship with Christ, and <note n="h" place="margin">1 cor 10, 17</note> he with vs: both which are sealed vp the in this Sacrament. It is called the Lords supper, both because it was instituted by the Lord Iesus at is last supper, (which circumstance of time the church hath changed) &amp; because therin is offered to vs a spiritual banket in which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are spiritually fed and nourished. It is called the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, both because this is a necessary action vsed of Christ, not to be omitted, and because it representeth the crucifieng of christ and tormenting of his body: so that we should neuer be present at this significant ceremony, but wee must call to remembrance the sorrowes and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of CHRIST: now if Christ were thus tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for vs, surely wee ought greatly to bee griped and grieued for our owne sinnes, which was also shewed by

the <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 12, 8,</note> sower herbes of the Passeouer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12, 8. It is called the table of the Lord, because he doth feede vs at it, as this we know is the end and vse of Tables in our houses, to set our meates and drinkes vpon them prepared for our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and this is the scope and end of the Lords table: onely heere lyeth a plaine and maine difference, our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles serue for bodily nourishment, but the Lordes is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the spirituall nourishment of our soules. Lastly, it may be called the testament or will of Christ, because it setteth forth vnto vs asolemne couenant betweene God and vs, touching forgiuenesse of sinnes and eternall life: which couenant is racified &amp; established by the <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 9, 15</note> death of the son of god: so that heerin we find all things belonging to a full and perfect testament, as we shall see after ward.</p>
               <p>Out of these seuerall names and titles thus interpreted, arise most aptly and fitly sundry vses, which, in order, as they haue beene propounded wee will consider. The first title is the Communion: from whence wee deduct <note n="l" place="margin">The vses of calling this sacrament the communion.</note> these necessary conclusions. First of all, is the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ called a communion? And so called of our communicating together? Then hereby all the faithfull openly testifie, that they be all one body cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled <note place="margin">vse. 1</note> together in Christ Iesus, we professe him and all his benefits, we receiue him, we enioy him, we reioyce in him. God the father doth giue him, the holy-ghost doth assure him, faith doth receiue him: by this hand we are ioyned to him, and haue spirituall fellowship with him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, al beleeuers are made one by Christ: and this is not an vnion in imagination, but in truth and in deed: neither by transsusion of the properties of the God-head or manhood into vs, <note n="m" place="margin">1 cor, 6. 17 1 Ioh. 3, 24</note> but by one and the same spirit dwelling in christ and in all the members of Christ, as 1 Cor. 6, He <hi>that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, to the Lord, is one spirit.</hi> And the Apostle Iohn testifieth, that Christ dwelleth in vs and we in christ by the spirit, He <hi>that keepeth his commaundements, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and heereby we know that he abideth in vs, euen by the spirit which he hath giuen vs:</hi> so that the spirits of iust and perfect men

in heauen, and all beleeuers vpon the earth (how farre soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sundred in place) hauing one and the same spirit of christ dwelling in them, are al one in Christ their head.

               <p>Secondly, as this sacrament being a communion admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth <note place="margin">Vse. 2</note> that we are all one in Christ: so it teaeheth that it is to be receiued of many together in the church, not of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and therefore it ouerthroweth the priuate Masses of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where one partaketh all and the rest of the Church nothing at all. There is a flat opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two: so that the communion cannot be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse, and priuate masse cannot be a communion. That which is ordained and prepared for many, deliuered vnto many, and receiued of many, cannot stand with the Masse, where the priest prepareth for himselfe, not for the people: hee speaketh to himselfe, not to the church: hee receiueth himselfe alone, not with his bretheren: all which are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Apostles <note n="o" place="margin">1 cor. xi 33 vse. 3.</note> rule, <hi>Tary one for another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, if it be a communion, it teacheth that this is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of vnity and concord, and wee are there by put in mind to avoid discord and dislention. For christ neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth himselfe to the malicious man, <note n="p" place="margin">1 cor. xi, 18 20</note> as the Apostle teachech 1 Cor. 11, 18, 20. <hi>When ye come together in the church, I heare that there are dissentions among you, this is not to eate the Lordes Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, in that the people communicate of one and the same bread, of one and the same wine, it signifieth the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and agreement betweene all the faithfull in one body, where of Christ Icsns is the head: who loued vs decrely, and spared not his life for vs. Let vs ioyne our selues together in loue, according to the exhortation <note n="q" place="margin">Rom, xv, 5, 6</note> of the Apostle, Rom, 15, 5, 6. <hi>The God of patience and consolation giue you that ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For the Apostle hauing taught that the cup which we blesse, and the bread which we breake are the communion of the body and blood of christ, he addeth, <hi>We that are many, are one bread and one body, because we are all partakers of one bread:</hi> and therefore he saith, 1 cor. 11. <hi>When ye come together to eate, tary one for another.</hi>

Secondly, if this title were ment of Loue-feastes, to what purpose should the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle bring in the institution of the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, and largely handle the doctrin therof?

                  </gap> without this mention and remembraunce of the supper. Thirdly, to what end should these solemn feasts and bankets be called the Lordes supper, which were not instituted in the honour of Christ, but to testifie the mutuall loue of those that were members of the same body, hauing God for their mercifull father, the church for their tender mother, and Christ for their elder brother. These might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be called the supper of men, then of the Lorde, being feasts of charity, not of piety. Fourthly, the Apostles drift and purpose in this place is to teach, that such as norish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention and diuision partake the Lords supper vnworthily, and therefore willeth them when they come to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Lord, to shake out of their minds all vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table affections, as chaffe from good corn, that so they may assemble togither with profit and not with hurt.

               <p>The next title giuen to this sacrament is the breaking of bread: which offereth to our considerations, these vses not <note n="e" place="margin">The vses of calling this sacrament the breaking of bread</note> to be passed ouer. First, it she weth that the substance of bred remaineth after the words of consecration, and is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by any strange transubstantiation. For when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>This is my body</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 cor, xi. 24</note> 
                  <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> properly <note place="margin">Vse. 1</note> it cannot be vnderstood of the body of Christ which was <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. xix, 36</note> not broken, but of his crucifying and death, by a figuratiue speech taken from the substance of the bread, which christ brake to distribute it among his Disciples, and to represent effectually his suffering for vs. The accidents of bread can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken, as we shal see afterward, no more then they can feed and nourish.</p>
               <p>Besides, we learne heerby that tropes and figures are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">vse. 2.</note> in the Sacrament, contrary to the opinion and asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as wee make plaine by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and as we constraine the aduersaries themselues to confesse, as when it is said, <hi>his body was broken,</hi> where the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall sence cannot be retained, seeing a bone of him could not be broken. Likewise when it is saide, <hi>the cup is the newe testament: the rock was Christ: the bread is the communion of the body of christ,</hi> these and such like cannot be interpreted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a figure.</p>
               <p>Lastly, seeing of this one action, the whole sacrament hath his denomination, <note n="h" place="margin">act. 2. 42. &amp; 207</note> as appeareth in many places, Act ii, 42. and xx, 7. and 1 Cor, xi, xxiiii, we must hold, that as the Apostles and other Ministers of the church were wont in the administration of the supper to breake the bread: so must we follow their example, as they also followed the example of Christ. Neither must this be accounted and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted an as indifferent ceremony, to be admitted or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16298:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at our own choise and pleasure, seeing Christ Iesus the Lorde of this sacrament commaunded, the scripture hath commended, the Apostles haue practised, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters afterward obserued the same, <note n="i" place="margin">Cor. 10. 16</note> as the Apostle witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ?</hi> speaking of himselfe and the rest of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the church. Besides, it is an essentiall expressing and tepresentation of the passion and crucifieng of Christ, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the pouring out of the wine into the cup of the Lorde. Wherefore, they are to be accused and conuinced as hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous breakers of the high ordinance of Christ, as we see in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who omit this breaking of the breade as impertinent and vnnecessary, and as not significant. For Christ Iesus commaunded his disciples to eat that breade which he had broken, and this breaking pertaineth to the end of the sacrament: so that it cannot be passed ouer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neglect of the institution of Christ, and of the essence of the supper. The next title giuen to this Sacrament, is, <hi>the table of the Lord:</hi> and it is rightly so called, as by a verye fit name. For seeing it is a Supper, and a most heauenly ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, it is requisite there should be a table answereable vnto it, that as it is the supper of the lord, so there may be a table for the administration of it. From hence we conclude diuers good vses <note n="k" place="margin">The vses of calling this Sacrament the Table of the Lord</note> for our further instruction.</p>
               <p>First of al, it she weth that Christ and his Apostles in the celebration of the supper vsed a table, not an altar. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Apostle <hi>paule</hi> speaketh vnproperly of the table, and thereby vnderstand the heauenly meat and drinke which was set vpon the table for all the lords ghuests: yet withal he insinuateth and signifieth the place where on they were put, to wit, vpon a table. In like manner our fauiour Christ at the sirst institution of this sacra. sate downe at the table with his Disciples, he stood not with them at the altar. Now according to the example of Christ and his disciples, must be the practise of al churches, inasmuch as christ shedding his blood on the crosse, had abolished al altars: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Infidels did oftentimes reprooue and reproach

               <p>Furthermore, inasmuch as the sacrament of the body &amp; blood of Christ was accustomably administred on a Table, <note place="margin">Vse. 2</note> not an Altar: of woode, not of stone: made mouable, not immouable: We learne from hence, that it is a sacrament, not a sacrifice: An altar doth inferre and presuppose a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: and a sacrifice is referred to the Altar whereon it is offered. But we haue not now properly and sacrifice, for that were to account the al-sufficient sacrifice of christ as vnsufficient and vnperfect: therefore wee are not to bring Altars againe into the church. There is no vse of altars in the new testament, seeing the making of them togither with other types and ceremonies of the olde testament through the death of Christ is abolished, <note n="m" place="margin">1 cor. 9, 13</note> as the Apostles teacheth, 1 cor. 9. <hi>Do ye not know that they which Minister about holy things, eat of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers of the altars?</hi> And to like purpose, Heb, xiii, x. <hi>We haue an altar, wher of they haue no right to eat, which serue in the tabernacle,</hi> that is, such as retain the necessary vse of the ceremonies <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 4. 9</note> begerly rudiments of the Iews, are fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ. Whereby we see plainly and apparently, that sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Altars stood togither, and sell togither: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas they would conclude the sacrifice of Masse from the vse of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Lastly, we must obsorue that it is not barely called <note place="margin">vse. 3.</note> a table, but the table of the LORD: to teach vs to draw neare vnto it with all reuerence and regard. If we measure and mark our affection in earthly things, we see what care and curiosity is ofttimes vsed, when men come to the table

and presence of Noble men: howe much greater care and conscience should bee vsed of euery one of vs, when wee come to this table, where the King of kings and the Lord of heauen and earth is present. Wherefore, to stirre vs vppe to this duty and deuotion, let euery one consider and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thus with himselfe, I am this day to be the lords ghuest: I am inuited to his table: I am to eate of his bread and to drinke of his cuppe: I haue not in this businesse to do with man whose breath is in his Nostrils, but to deale with God in whose presence I do abide, who is both a beholder and iudge of all my actions, to whom I shall either stand or fall. If I come in hypocrisie, he will find me out, <note n="o" place="margin">Heb 1. 4. 13</note> before whom all things are naked and open: if I come fitted by faith and sanctified by repentance, I shall receiue Christ and all his merits to my endlesse comfort Thus much sufficeth to bee considered touching this title of the Lords table.</p>
               <p>The last title of this Sacrament remaineth to be handled, being called the new testament or will of Christ, <note n="p" place="margin">The vses of calling this Sacrament the testament or will of christ.</note> from whence wee may gather diuerse vses as good conclusions from this doctrine. For first it teacheth, that there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble testament and couenant of God made to his people, one of workes, the other of grace: one of the law, the other of the Gospell: as Ioh. 1, 17, <hi>The law was giuen by Moyses, but <note place="margin">Vse.

                  <hi>the Lords supper is the second sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wherein, by visible receiuing of bread and wine, our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all communion with the body and blood of Christ is represented.</hi> This description is plainly proued by the <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26. 26 27</note> institution of Christ, by the first celebration of it, and by other apparent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of holy scripture. <note place="margin">1 Cot, 10, 16 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First I say, it is the seconde sacrament, because such as haue interest in the Lordes supper, must be first partakers <note place="margin">1 cor 11, 24 25</note> of the other Sacrament: for Christ and his Apostles mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred it to those that were before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now, baptisme is the true bath of our soules to clense our sores, and an honourable badge whereby we are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the seruice of Christ, and haue interest in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of the church sealed vppe: being partakers heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wee come with comfort to the Lords supper.

Wherfore, it is not enough for vs once to be baptized and admitted into the number of the people of God: we must also be partakers of Christs supper. When as by baptisme we are brought into the church of God, we are afterwarde nourished by this heauenly banquet to eternall life.</p>
               <p>Again, I say in the former description, that by the bred and Wine the bodie and blood of Christ are represented. Heerein consisteth the substance of this Sacrament: he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>This is my bodie, which was giuen for you: this is the cup of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was shedde for you and for many for the remission of sinnes.</hi>

               <p>Now that the description of the lords supper is prooued, <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> let the vses there of in the next place be declared. Heereby we learn, first, that God doth not lie nor dally with vs, when we come to his heauenly table, but doth truely offer those benefits in Christ, which are represented, to al that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereunto: and therefore the Apostle said, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. x, 3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>they did all eat the same spirituall meat, and did all drinke the same spirituall drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeede, many of them did receiue onely the outwarde signes, and did refuse or neglect the spirituall grace so liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented and truely offered vnto them, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was their sinne, who laboured for the meat that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn. 6, 27</note> but reiected the meat that endureth to euerlasting life. Likewise, christ in the administration of his. Supper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26</note> 
                  <hi>take, eat, this is my body.</hi> When he biddeth vs take, doth he not giue? When he chargeth vs to eat and drinke, doth he not offer? When he commau ndeth vs to doe this, doth he not apply the thing signified? If then we come to this Supper, and depart awaye without christ and without comfort, the cause is in our selues, hee is come neere vnto vs, he standeth as it were at the doore knocking being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16298:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to enter: hee mercifully offereth himselfe vnto vs, but we refuse him, we will none of him, we bid him depart from vs, and shutte the entrance of our heartes against him.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee see heere the excellent price and preheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence <note place="margin">Vse. 2</note> of the Lordes Supper, howsoeuer to those, whose faith it doth not nourish, whose assurance it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and whose saluation it doth not further, it is turned into most hurtefull and deadly poyson: yet it is an holy banket for the Lordes ghuestes, an instrument of grace, a medicine for the sicke, a pledge of saluation, a comfort for the sinner, an assurance of Gods promises, a seale of our faith, an helpe for the weake, meate for the hungry, drinke for the thirsty, and a refuge for the distressed in time of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Is not this a worthy dignity? Is not this a great priuiledge? Is not this an high prerogatiue? So that wee must highly regard and reuerently esteeme this miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our religion, and badge of our profession, to the glory of God and our owne comfort. He that is not moued heerby to a reuerent regard thereof hath no sparke of gods spirit in hun, but lyeth in darknesse and discomfit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, heerby the aduersaries mouths are stopped, and they are put to silence and shame, who accuse vs, to deny the <note place="margin">vse. 30</note> blessed presence of CHRIST in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. We confesse and beleeue, that we receiue the body of CHRIST verily, truely and indeede, not a naked figure, not a bare signe, not an empty shaddow, but euen that body which suffered death vpon the Crosse, and that blood which was shed aud poured out for the remission of our sinnes.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16298:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his body and blood, is voide of life, of saluation, of grace and of christ himselfe. Wherefore, we shall shew <note n="i" place="margin">Chap, 10</note> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the difference betweene the church of <hi>Rome</hi> and vs is, not whether christ be present in his supper, but about the manner of his presence; for we say, and will neuer fly from it, that as the outward signes, of bread and Wine are deliuered and receiued, so they represent and seale vp to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery true beleeuer, God the father offering and giuing, the Church also taking, receiuing and applying christ crucified, with all the promises of his couenant ratified in him vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</p>
               <p>Lastly, is this the matter and substance of the supper, to offer, and apply Christ for our wholesome nourishment? <note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> Then we should often desire (if wee hunger after Christ) to sit downe at his Table, to come to his banket: to feede of his delicates, and to be present at his dainties. And why should any be absent that haue faith and repentance? Why should they not shew that they are one body <note n="k" place="margin">1 cor. 10. 17</note> by eating all of one bread? Why should not such apply christ to their iustification? We know the Apostles oftentimes prepared, offered &amp; deliuered the outward signs of the Lords supper, exhibiting christ to all the faithful, euen euery Lords day, or first day of the weeke, and the people receiued oftentimes the same, <note n="l" place="margin">act, 2, 41, 42</note> as we see Act. 2. <hi>There he addeth to the church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three thousand soules, and they continued in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of bread and prayers:</hi> And Chap. 20. 7. <hi>The first day of the weeke the Disciples came together to breake bread.</hi> And this was the order and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Church many yeares after the Apostles times.

For, it cannot be denyed, but it proceedeth from the shop and inuention of the Deuell (whosoeuer were the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16298:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to bring in this corrupt custome of once communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in the yeare, and that for the most parte for fashions sake.</p>
               <p>Now, to the end we might returne neerer to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Apostles, that the often vse of the communnion might be retained and maintained, and that the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the people might in part be redressed: it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Canons of many churches, that euery one should communicate at the least three times in the yeare, not that men should do it no oftner, but least otherwise they would not do it so often, or peraduenture do it not at all. And if a suruey and examination wer made, I feare it would be found to our great shame and beastly slouthfulnesse, that scarce the tenth person hath satisfied the law in this respect in many places, regarding no time of the yeare but Easter.</p>
               <p>But seeing it is so necessary a sacrament, let euery one consider of this holy mystery, how fruitefull, profitable, and comfortable it is to be partaker thereof, and how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to neglect and contemne the same. Is it not an vnkinde and churlish part amonge men, when one hath prepared with great coastes and charges a rich banket, killed his Oxen and his fatlings, furnished his table with all prouision, bidden his ghuests, and set all things in order and readinesse to entertaine them: were it not, I say, an vnkind and vncurteous parte for those that are called and bidden, vnthankefully and churlishly to refuse to come? Which of vs in such a case would not be moued, disquieted, and discontented? Who would not thinke hee had wrong and iniury done vnto him? Wherefore, let vs take heed, least by with-holding and withdrawing our selues, wee prouoke gods wrath and indignation. When he calleth, are ye not ashamed to say, ye will not come? When he saith, <note n="p" place="margin">Pro, 9, 4. 5</note>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16298:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Wilt thou lye still in thy sinne, as a man in a deepe pit, and neuer striue to come forth? Why doest thou not returne to God, and amend thy waies? Why doest thou continue in thy hordnesse, and heart that <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 2, 5</note> cannot repent, and so heapest vppe as a treasure to thy selfe, wrath against the daye of wrath, and of the declaration of the iust iudgement of God. Moreouer, if thou bee vnfit and vnworthy to receiue this supper, thou art <note n="r" place="margin">Cbrysost, in Eph. hom. 3</note> vnworthy to pray, thou art vnworthy to heare: vnlesse thou pray as a parrat, and heare as an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. Consider therefore seriously, and weigh earnestlye with your selues, <note n="s" place="margin">Numb. 9, 13</note> how little such fond, fained, and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excuses shall preuaile with God. When <hi>Moyses</hi> called <hi>Corah</hi> and his company to come vppe vnto the Lord, they answered presumpteously, <note n="t" place="margin">Numb, 16, 12</note> 
                  <hi>We will not come.</hi> When the King in the Gospell had inuited his ghuests, they began all with one minde, to excuse themselues, and some refused, saying, <note n="u" place="margin">Luk, 14, 20 24</note> 
                  <hi>I cannot come.</hi> So in these daies of sinne, albeit the supper be prepared, the ghuests called and the table couered: many men make light account of it: and what, with some that reply carelesly, we cannot come; and what with others that answer desperately, we will not come, the feast is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished, God is dishonored, the people are vnprepared, and all the exercises of religion are lightly and slightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. I say vnto you, that none of these men which were bidden shall tast of his Supper. Againe, another sort are as prophane as these, which stand by as gazers and lookers on vpon them that do communicate, &amp; yet communicate not themselues. What is this else, then a further contempt of God? Truely, it is great vnthankfulnes to depart away: for these depart away from the Lords table, they depart from their bretheren, they depart from the heauenly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

First, to take the bread and wine into his hands after the example of christ, who did it to shewe that himselfe willingly giueth himselfe for his church, which serueth to strengthen our faith and perswasion of his loue toward vs: in whose imitation the minister dothit, to represent the action of God the father giuing his son vnto vs for our full redemption The second action is blessing and giuing of thankes, that is, by prayer, by thankes giuing, and by rehearsal of the promises of God, together with the institution of christ, actually to separate the bread and wine so taken from their common vse to an holy vse Whereby we are giuen to vnderstand, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward creatures are reuerently to be vsed, calling vpon the name of God, and crauing his assistance to vse his ordinance as we ought to do: and that we should ioyfully praise God, for the gratious worke of our redemption by Christ. The third action, is breaking the bread &amp; pouring out the wine, which are necessary rites, to be obserued, hauing respect and and relation to the vnspeakable torments of christ for vs, who was pierced, crucified, and made a curse for vs vpon the Crosse, <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 22, 16 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:16298:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So then, we see that whole bread is not to be deliuered, but that the bread is to be broken, and the wine to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, to be distributed among sundry communicantes. The last action of the minister is, to distribute the bread and wine, and giue them into the handes of the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. CHRIST did not offer them vp to God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> deliuered them to his Discipies. All these, being workes to bee done and performed by the Minister in the administration of this Sacrament, do note out the actions of GOD the Father, sealing vppe his sonne vnto vs, as wee shall see afterwarde when wee come to the inward parts</p>
               <p>Now, let vs enter into the consideration of the vses of this parte. Are these the actions commaunded in the <note place="margin">vse. 1</note> word, executed by CHRIST, and to be performed by the Minister? Then we see, that such as are set apart to deliuer this sacrament, are not consecrated and appointed priestes of the new testament, to offer vp an vnbloody sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifice for the quicke and dead, as the church of <hi>Rome</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and practiseth. They are commaunded as ministers of God to deliuer the outward signes to the people, not as priestes to offer them to God the father: they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preachers of the gospell, not priests of the law: which were to abolish the priesthood of Christ. Wherefore, we must detest the blasphemy of these shamelesse shauelings, <note n="f" place="margin">stella Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum. serdisc serm. 3</note> that teach the priest to bee the maker of his maker, and that he which made them, <note n="g" place="margin">creatur a vo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bis medianti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vobis.</note> gaue them power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thus these sacrificing priests are not ashamed to speake, and to bray aloud.

for, as we shewed, the scripture standeth not in wordes, <note n="m" place="margin">Hieron, Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tra Lucifer. &amp; in Cap. 1 ad Gal.</note> but in the meaning of the wordes: not in the reading, but in the vnderstanding: not in the outward shew, but in the inward substance. Christ in the new testament is called a lambe, a lyon, a way, a bride-groome, an head, a dore, a vine, a garment, a rock, bread, water, light, and such like: these words are easie and euident, yet must they be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood metaphorically, not properly: spiritually, not litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. So, to come to the wordes of institution, What did Christ take in his hand? bread. What did Christ command them to take and eat? bread. What did he call his bodye? Was it anie other thing then the same bread which he had taken, which he hadde broken, which he had giuen vnto them? Neither is there any other antecedent going before, whereunto it can be referred.</p>
               <p>Now, the bread and body of Christ are in nature <note n="m" place="margin">Disparata.</note> sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and diuers things, and the one cannot be spoken of the other, and verified of the other without a figure, as to say, one and the same thing should be both bread and Christes body, but if it be bread, it cannot be his body, if it be his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it cannot be bread. Wherefore, true bread is a true sign and seale of his true body. Neither is this figure strange or new, but common and vsual, when mention is made of the facraments: as Gen. 17, <hi>This is my couenant,</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Gen, 17, 10 11</note> speaking of circumcision: yet circumcision was not the couenant it self, but a sign and token of the couenant, as also it is afterward expounded, <hi>It shall be a signe of the couenant betweene me and you.</hi> The aduersaries cannot denie a figure in this speech.</p>
               <p>Now, what difference is there betweene these two spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>This is my couenant,</hi> and, <hi>this is my body?</hi> are they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and in like manner to be vnderstood? So <hi>Exodus,</hi> 12. 11 <hi>It is the Lordes</hi>

               <p>Likewise, the Apostle sayeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>That rocke was</hi>

Christ, whereas properly the rocke was not Christ, but the water flowing from it did represent him. Thus then we must vnderstand the words plainely, truely, and briefely, <note n="r" place="margin">a paraphrase vpon the words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</note> as if Christ had saide in this manner, This bread which ye haue seene me take, breake, deliuer, and distribute, and which I bid you take and cate, is a signe or sacrament of my true body, signifying and sealing vp vnto you, that my body, shalbe broken, crushed, and crucified for you, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase to you eternal life, let these sacramental rites and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions now performed by me and you, be heerafter put in practise by you and all faithfull ministers and professors, for the strengthning of your faith, by the remembrance of my death and by the applying of the benefit thereof, euery one to your owne selues. Likewise, hauing finished his supper, when he did eate the passeouer with his Disciples, hauing taken the cup and giuen thanks, he gaue it, being filied with wine, to his Disciples, and saide, drinke ye al of this, for this wine in this cup, is a signe and sacrament of my blood, by the shedding whereof, togither with my death following, the full forgiuenes of sins and perfect saluation (which I by my vnchangable wil &amp; decree do giue vnto you and al that beleeue in me) are assured to you and all beleeuers. Thus, hauing opened and cleared the interpretation of the words, we shal heerafter need to spend the lesse time in confuting the contrary doctrin: darkenes shal flie before the light, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror before truth, &amp; cloudy mists before the sun-shine of the day. Again, seeing the words of institution are variably and <note place="margin">Vse. 2</note> diuersly set down by the Euangelists and the Apostle Paul: we learne that euery change of the words, where the sence is nothing altered or diminished, is not to be condemned, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or vnlawfull: so that the alteration being in the forme and frame of words, not in the substance and sence of the matter, the sacrament is not destroyed. For if it had bene an heinous sinne to haue made any change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to haue missed of the tearmes or sillables of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: no doubt the Euangelists would haue consented in the words, and not haue swarued one from another, as we see they haue done. We see how the Apostles in the


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16298:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
allegation of sundry places of Scripture borrowed out of the olde Testament, do not euermore strictly binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the <note n="s" place="margin">Math, 2, 6</note> very wordes, as <hi>Mathew 26. Hebrewes 10. 5.</hi> and in sundry other: but onely to the sence, and therefore <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 4, 10</note> sometimes they adde as <hi>Mathew 4, 10.</hi> sometimes, they leaue out as occasion serueth.</p>
               <p>True it is, to alter any substantiall part, or to wrest the wordes to a wrong and contrary meaning, or not at all to expresse the sence of the wordes, maketh the Sacrament voide: but an alteration onely of certaine circumstaunces, <note n="u" place="margin">al change in the words of institution makes not the Sacraments void.</note> as of number, or person, of Letters or sillables, cannot make frustrate the whole sacrament: albeit we allow not any priuate and particular man to make any chaunge of his owne heade in such circumstaunces, or to bring in a new frame of wordes. So in baptisme, the Greeke church saith, Let the seruant of CHRIST be baptized in this Water, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and heereby nothing is detracted from the truth of the sacrament, because Christ Iesus hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely appointed, how many wordes the Apostles and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours of the Church shoulde vse in the execution of their Ministry.</p>
               <p>Not withstanding, the obseruation of the words I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thee, obserued in our churches, seemeth to drawe nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the commaundement of Christ, and to confirme more fitly and fully the faith of the baptized, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto the words of Iohn the baptist, <hi>I baptize with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Likewise, in the Lordes supper, whereas Christ saide, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, doe ye this,</hi> as speaking to many: the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not destroyed, when the words are particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, and specially applyed in our churches, saying, <hi>take thou, eat thou, drinke thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, seeing the wordes of institution are an outwarde <note place="margin">vse. 3.</note> part of the Sacrament, necessary to be knowne, read, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vnderstood, wherein the substance and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vse of the Lordes Supper consisteth: it followeth that they are to be published and pronounced openly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, plainely, not in a strange language, but in a knowne

To begin, we learne from hence to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a difference between baptisme and the Lords supper: in baptisme we haue one signe as the materiall part, in the supper we haue two signes, <note n="e" place="margin">Why we haue tvvo signes in the Lords supper and only one in baptisme?</note> partly to note out our whole, ful, and perfect nourishment in Christ, hauing whatsocuer is requisite for our saluation, and partly to shew, a fuller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death, for the wine which is a figure of his blood, doth as it were present it and represent it before our eyes. So then, albeit the same participation of Christ and the same washing away of sinnes by his blood, are sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp in baptisme and in the supper: yet the manner <note n="f" place="margin">Difference betweene baptisme and the Lords supper.</note> of sealing them in each is diuerse. Againe, baptisme is a signe of our entrance into Gods Couenant: the Supper is a signe of our abiding, and continuing in that couenant. Touching baptisme, it is sufficient for infants if they bee

borne in the church: in the supper, the condicion of examy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selues, and remembring the Lords death is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. They differ also in often celebration of them: bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is to be receiued but once onely in all our life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the promise once made, is alwaies firme and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to such as beleeue and repent: but the supper is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to be receiued, because an often renewing of that Couenant, and calling it to our remembrance is necessary, to increase and strengthen faith. They differ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the order which is to be obserued in the vse of them: for baptisme is to be giuen before the Supper, and the supper may not be giuen to any, except to such as haue beene first baptized, or reputed so to be.</p>
               <p>As first a child is borne, before he bee fed: so must Baptisme go before, whereby our new-birth is sealed: then the supper must follow after, whereby our dayly nourishment is declared and confirmed. Lastly, they differ in the signes, there is onely one signe in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which is the Water: but there are two signes in the Lords Supper, to wit, the bread and the wine.</p>
               <p>The second general vse is, that if Christ tooke, gaue, and <note place="margin">Gener. vlc. 2</note> deliuered the substance of bread and wine: then they must needes retain their former nature &amp; their proper substance, as well as their qualities, as fight, tast, smell, bignesse, whitenesse, sweetenesse, rednesle, roundnesse, and such like properties. But the Papistes turne all thinges <note n="g" place="margin">Against the bare shewes of bread and wine: and accidentes without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> vpside downe, matter into forme, substance into accidents, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into shewes, and subiects into things adioyned: they bring in new shifts and fables against all diuinity, phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, reason, sense, and experience, setting vp their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and building castles in the aire. Let them proue the annihilation and remouing of the substance of bread &amp; wine away, and the <note n="h" place="margin">Arist. phis. lib. 1, cap. 3</note> consisting of accidents without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which they are neuer able to doe. For as the water in baptisme remaineth in his nature and substance: so do the bread &amp; wine in the Lords supper. And albeit in both the sacraments, the signs be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to a special vse: yet are they

Wherefore, let vs leaue these doubtfull and deceitfull builders that go about to build without ground or foundation, which cannot stand.</p>
               <p>The third generall vse, arising from both the signes, is this: if Christ deliuered his last Supper in bread and wine, then <note place="margin">Gener. vse. 3.</note> these signes may not be altered, but must be <note n="n" place="margin">The bread and wine be-the matter of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may not be changed in the Lords Supper.</note> retained for the perpetual vse and comfort of the church. And howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be left to the choyse and liberty of the church, what bread or what wine they will vse: yet that it ought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily (as I take it) to be bread and the fruite of the vine, may appeare by diuerse good considerations. I will propound the reasons that draw me to this opinion, let the Church iudge of them, seeing the <note n="o" place="margin">1 cor, 14, 32</note> spirits of the prophets are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the prophets. First, the institution of the supper and the example of Christ himselfe, whom the Church is to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and follow, who said, <hi>Do</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">1 cor, 11, 25</note> 
                  <hi>this in remembrance of me.</hi> He said not, doe the like, or do what pleaseth you, and swarue from my example where you will, but do this which ye haue seene me do. Whosoeuer therefore change either the bread or wine, do not that which Christ commaundeth, but another thing then he appointeth. Againe, no other signes are so significant &amp; effectual as these are for this purpose, to strengthen and to comfort them that are in trouble, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the present <note n="q" place="margin">Psal 104, 14 15</note> estate of death, as <hi>Psal. 104.

True it is, circumstances may vary and be changed, as time, place, sitting, standing kneeling, and such like: but the essentiall parts may not be changed. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> take either of them away, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the sacrament, and bring in a nullity therof.

Fourthly, if the bread &amp; wine in the supper might be changed, and yet the sacrament in substance remaine: then in like manner, water in baptisme might be changed, &amp; yet be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And we see how the prophet <hi>Ioell</hi> threatning from God a dearth of corne, and wine, and of oyle, declareth also that the offerings shall cease, where he <note n="t" place="margin">Ioel, 1, 9, 19</note> saith, <hi>The field is wasted, the corne is destroyed, the oyle is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and wee will beleeue them. Lastly, it is confessed on all sides, that without consecration and sanctification, there can be no Sacrament: for without this halowing, the matter in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is bare water, the bread in the Supper is bare bread, the Wine is Common Wine. Now euery creature <note n="u" place="margin">1 Tim. 4, 5</note> is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer, as the Apostle teacheth 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and therefore we cannot assure our hearts, that god wil blesse any other creatures, as fish or flesh in stead of bread, water or beere in stead of Wine, seeing the word hath not sanctified these elementes for this purpose. They are sanctified by the worde for the ordinary nourishment of our bodyes, but they are not by any speciall worde sanctified for the vse of the Sacramentes. If then it be simply vnlawfull, to change any thing in the matter of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And as when a lawfull Minister is wanting, a pryuate person may not be taken: so when the matter appoynted for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of this sacrament is missing, an other may not bee assumed. For as well may wee change the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Sacrament into a pryuate man, as the bread and Wine (being the signes) into another matter. If the Sacraments cannot be had according to the precise and pure institution of Christ, they may lawfully be deferred or

First, that which Christ took in his hands, he brake: that which he brake, he gaue: that which he gaue his Disciples, he commanded them to eat, that which hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to eate, hee calleth his bodye.

Now if the bread had bene turned into the body, or the wine into the blood of Christ, and if the Apostle would haue spoken properly, he should haue said, As often as ye shall eat, not this bread, but this body of Christ vnder the forme of breade, the blood of Christ vnder the forme of Wine. And againe, he that eateth the body and drinketh the blood of Christ vnworthily. And againe, let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himselfe, and so let him eat and take in his mouth the very body of Christ his creator. But thus the Apostle


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16298:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath not spoken, neither could he so speake truely, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fitly: therefore we do truely, properly and fitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Thirdly, Christ speaking of the cup saith, Take, <note n="k" place="margin">Luk, 22, 17 19</note> diuide it among you, and of the bread he saith, he tooke it, and brake it. But if the substance of bread be abolished, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the body of Christ, and likewise the nature of the wine turned into the blood of Christ, there could be no true distributing or breaking: for the blood of Christ is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into parts, neither is his body broken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the strength or force of transubstantiation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon these words of institution, <hi>This is my body, This is my blood:</hi> then there can be no reall change before these words be fully finished, and pronounced to the end.

               <p>Fiftly, these wordes, <hi>This is my body,</hi> must be vnderstood, as the words following, <hi>This cup is the new testament:</hi> but the cup is not turned into the new testament, nor into the blood of Christ: therefore the other wordes must be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely vnderstood, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The sixt reason: Christ is said to giue to his Disciples that which he saide was his body.

               <p>The 8. reason: in baptisme the substance of water remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, though it haue words of consecration, and be made a sacrament of our regeneration: and therefore in the Lords supper, the bread and wine are not changed and don away vtterly.

               <p>The ninth reason: if bread be really turned into the body of Christ, and the wine into his blood: then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Christ are really <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The 10. reason: if the bread be turned into his body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede by force of a few words vttered by a priest: then the priest should be the maker of his maker, and so euery Masse-monger should be preferred before Christ, as much as the creitor hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The 11. reason: the bread in the Sacrament after the words of consecration, is subiect to as many changes and chances as it was before: the bread may mould, putrifie, and breede Wormes, <note n="q" place="margin">Hesych in Leuit. l. 2. c. 8 Humbert. cont.

But the precious body and blood of Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mingled with poyson, but is an excellent counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poison against the biting of the old Serpent and all infection ofsinne whatsoeuer; the body cannot mould or putrifie, the blood of Christ cannot become sharp or sowre, as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes may, therefore the substance of bread and wine remaineth. The 12. reason: there is something in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, materiall and substantiall, which goeth the way of all meates, according to that saying of our sauiour, <note n="t" place="margin">Math 15, 17</note>

               <p>The 14 reason: if there were any transubstantiation there shold be an actuall conuersion of the bread into the body of Christ; but this cannot stand.

               </p>
               <p>The 16. reason: if the bread were turned into the body of Christ and receiued in the mouth: it should go farre better with our bodies then with our soules, because our bodyes should really receiue the body of Christ, but our soules should not, being spirits: and bodies cannot be mingled and intermedled with spirits. Wherefore, we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and receiue this real conuersion of one substance into another. The 17. reason: if the bread be transubstantiated into the body of christ, and so receiued by vs: then either it is turned into our bodies, or vanisheth away into nothing, or returneth and departeth back into heauen. But it is not turned into our bodily substance, for then we should grow bodily and not spiritually, carnally not mistically, into one person with him: neither doth it vanish to nothing, for this were horrible blasphemy once to imagine and conceiue of the body of christ: neither doth it depart into heauen, for he was there before, and the heauens containe him to the end of all things. Therefore, the bread cannot be said to be turned into the body of christ, except one of these be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And thus also we may reason of the wine. If it be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the blood of Christ, it must necessarily passe into our substance, or vanish away, or returne to the heauens: for no fourth way can be imagined. But none of these can stand either with diuinity or phylosophy, either with faith or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, either with scripture or nature, and therfore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently transubstantiation must fall.</p>
               <p>The 18. reason: if the disciples had not vnderstood christ to call the bread his body sacramentally: they would haue beene greatly troubled (who often doubted of the least things) and demaunded the vnderstanding of them. As the hearers of Christ <hi>Ioh. 6,</hi> supposing he had spoken of a carnal manner of eating his <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 652, 60</note> flesh, were troubled and offended,


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16298:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
saying, <hi>How can this man giue vs his flesh to eate?</hi> And vers. 60, <hi>This is an heard saying, who can heare it?</hi> Wherefore, who seeth not, that they would haue marueiled and required farther, if they had vnderstood christ to haue changed the bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his body, and the wine into his blood? But they doubt not, they demand not, they maruaile not, they murmur not, and therfore beleeue not this iugling of transubstantiation, or turning of one substance into another. And if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued it not, how should we receiue it.</p>
               <p>The 19. argument: it ouerturneth sundry Articles of our Christian faith. Wee beleeue that Christ Iesus was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the father before all worldes, and borne in time of the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> this the Scripture teacheth, this the Creed deliuereth: this euery true Christian professeth and beleeueth. But if the bread be transubstantiated into the body of Christ, and the wine into the blood of christ: then his body is made and borne of bread and wine, and the priest after the words of consecration may say, a little pretty son is borne vnto vs, and newly made. Againe, we beleeue that Christ was crucified and died for our sins, that he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rose againe, ascended, and sitteth at the right hand of God the father almighty. But if the body of Christ bee made of bread as often as the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is celebrated, then Christ being on the Crosse might be elsewhere then on the Crosse: when he died, he might be where he suffered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: lying in the graue, he might bee out of the graue: yea hee might be in the graue after his resurrection and rising out of the graue: wherof notwithstanding the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels said, <note n="f" place="margin">Mat, 28, 5</note> 
                  <hi>he is not heere.</hi> Lastly, we beleeue that christ shall come from heauen to iudge the quick and dead, and that in the same manner he ascended, <note n="g" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 7</note>  whom we doubt not but men shall see, as Reuel. 1. 7. <hi>Euery eye shall see him, yea euen they which pierced him through.</hi> But if Christes body be made of bread, he shall stare and start out of the pixe, and not come from heauen, and that in another shape then when he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: nay, thus he shold come daily vnto vs, &amp; yet no man can see him, nor perceiue his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Al these deuises, ouerthrow


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16298:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foundation of faith, sauour of nouelty, and bring in heresie against all certaine grounds of true religion.</p>
               <p>The 20. argument: if by vertue of Christs words, transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftantiation were brought to passe, and the true body of christ were really present on the earth: then the bread should be changed into whole Christ, that is, into his body indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his magnitude, quantity, quality, colour, and all his dimensions. For Christ said not at his supper, this is the substance of my body without accidents: but <note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 21 16 1 cor. 11, 24</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you, and which is broken for you.</hi> Therefore, the body was visible and seene of them all, it was felt, it had all accidents agreeable thereunto, and the substance of Christs body alone without his qualities was not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on the Crosse, neither yet could be crucified. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we see not Christs body vpon the earth, nor any adioy nt thereof is perceiued or discerned. Where are they then? Are they in substance of christs body which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? And not in the substance of his body which is on the earth? Then they make Christ to haue two distinct bodies: for one and the same body cannot haue his properties and dimensions, and yet bee without them, which necessarily implyeth a contradiction, and consequently falsehood: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially considering how great a difference they make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the body of Christ in heauen, and this body that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and lurketh vnder the accidents and shewes of bread in their box.</p>
               <p>The 21. reason: it destroyeth the nature of a true body, it taketh away the defence vsed against heretickes, and bringeth in the heresies of <hi>Marcion,</hi> of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> and the <hi>Manichics,</hi> which <note n="i" place="margin">August, de quod vuit de.</note> denied Christ to haue a solid, and true humane body, &amp; held that he had only a phantastical body without any materiall flesh, blood, or bone, in appearance and sight some what, but in deed and substance nothing. For they teach that his body is in infinite places at once, &amp; those discontinued, voyd of quantity and quality, not circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, not visible, nor any way sensible: that being in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is really and corporally on earth, though not in the distance

                  <hi>The body of Christ is euery where, as God is euery where, and that if there were an host that filled all the world, the body of christ might be with euery part thereof when it should be consecrated.</hi> And <hi>Holcot</hi> treading in the same stepes of the schooles, not of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, saith, <hi>If there had beene a thousand hostes in a thousand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the same time, that christ did hang vpon the crosse,</hi>

               <p>The 22. reason: it taketh away iudgement from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and maketh the sacrament of truth to be a sacrament of forgery and falsehood: for the senses of seeing, of tasting, of touching, of handling and smelling, do iudge bread and wine to be in the sacrament, and not mans flesh truely and properly: neither can <note n="p" place="margin">arist. lib, 2 de anim. cap. 6</note> all the senses be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:16298:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The 23. reason: it is an horible act and vnnaturall cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for man to eate mans flesh, and for man to drinke mans blood: and therefore the papists are as humane as the <hi>Cyclops, Canibals,</hi> and other barbarous people. It is more brutish and barbarous <note n="q" place="margin">August. de doctr christ. lib. 3. cap. 16, cyril. anat. 11,</note> to eate mans flesh, then to kill a man: and to drink mans blood then to shed it. Thus they make christian people eaters of mans flesh and bloode suckers, which is beastly and horrible wickednesse.</p>
               <p>The 24. reason: the Apostle maketh an opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the table of the Lord, and the table of deuils, saying, <note n="r" place="margin">cor, 10, 20, 21</note> 
                  <hi>Ye cannot drinke the cup of the Lord, and the cup of deuils: ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of deuils:</hi> where he sheweth, that to eate the flesh offered to idols is to bee partakers of the idols. as the bread which we breake, is the participation and communion of the body of the Lord. Hence he concludeth, that they should not eate of those thinges which the Gentiles sacrifice to idols, because they haue fellowship with the diuils that eate of them, euen as they are vnited to Christ which partake of the bread in the supper. If then the flesh offered to idols be not transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated: why fhold the sacramental bread be turned into the body of christ, seeing it sufficeth to make vs partakers of the Lords body to eat of the bread, as it was sufficient to make them partakers of the idols, to eate of the thinges offered vnto them? The 25. reason: if the institution of Christ be a sufficient direction vnto the church what to hold in this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we shal easily giue this transubstantiation a fall. We see in the cases of matrimony that did befall, our sauiour bringeth them to the first institution, and therby dissolueth the doubts and difficulties that arose, saying, <note n="s" place="margin">Math, 19, 3 4, 8,</note> 
                  <hi>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not so.</hi> So when any controuersie ariseth about the Lords supper, the ordinance of Christ is able to take it vp, how great or grieuous soeuer it grow. Now, there is no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, no word, no sillable, no iot, no title in the discription of the supper, that fauoreth or sauoreth of transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or signifieth and insinuateth any such matter. True it is, christ saith <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 26, 26</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body,</hi> but to be doth not signifie to


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16298:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
transubstantiate: for then when he saith, <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 15, 1, &amp; 10, 7 &amp;. 14. 6</note> 
                  <hi>I am the true vine, I am the dore, the way,</hi> and such like, he shall be turned and transubstantiated into a natural vine, into a materal doore, into an high way, from whence would follow infinite abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and absurdities. Besides, if the word (<hi>is</hi>) in the institution fignifie, is transubstantiated, that is, changed from one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance into an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from bread into flesh, from wine into blood: then the change shold be made before all the words be vttered, so that hence it would follow, that it cannot be done by vertue of the words, which goeth before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the words. Last of al, the maintainers of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, as the builders of babel, haue their tongs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and their languages confounded: they cannot accord together, but vary and dissent one from another, <note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 14, 56</note> like the false witnesses that arose against christ. First, they knew not certainely, whether the bread bee turned into his body, or come in place thereof, the substance departing. Secondly, some alow not these speaches, <note n="b" place="margin">Thom. p 3 qu 75, art. 8</note> bread is Christes body, or bread is made christs body: but wil haue it said, christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is made of bread: <note n="c" place="margin">Canon. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertantur</note> others condemne this speach also, that bread is made christs body. Thirdly, they know not what is broken, whether bread, or accidents, or nothing: others say, the true body of christ is broken, Fourthly, they agree not, whether their water in the chalyce mingled with wine, be transubstantiated: some say it is, other say it is not: some more sober then the rest, are afraid what to say, <note n="d" place="margin">durand. lib. 4</note> and aske who is able to decide the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Others say it is turned into the humors of his body: others virknit the knot thus, that the water is turned into the wine, and then the wine into his blood, and therefore are circumspect to giue this cautel that a litle water be mingled, being afraid, least, if more water were put in then the wine, the wine should be transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into water. Fiftly, they cannot agree with what words their consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is wrought, whether accidents be without their subiect, whether the accidents norish no lesse then the substance of bread &amp; wine: likwise what the rats &amp; mise do eat: how &amp; sro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the worms are oftentims in gendred


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16298:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and so consume it: whether the shewes of bread be the body without the blood, and the shews of wine the blood without the body. It were infinite <note n="e" place="margin">see D. sutl. de Miss. lib. 5. cap 16</note> to note out all their contentions and contradictions: these may suffice to shew how the enimies of God fight one against another, and all of them with their own shadwoes. And thus much of the late doting deuise of transubstantiation, which is the soule and life of their popish religion: the deniers or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherof, they pursue with fire and sword more eagerly, then such as are enemies to the blessed trinity.</p>
               <p>The last generall vse is this: if christ deliuered both these signes, not onely the bread, but the wine also to his <note place="margin">Gener. vse 5.</note> disciples: then both kinds by the minister are to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note n="f" place="margin">christs peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the supper vnder both kinds.</note> and both kinds by the people are to be receiued, not bread alone, nor wine alone, but bread and wine: the bread in token of his body giuen for vs, and the wine in token of his blood shed for vs. This is the ordinance of Christ: this is a greeable to the scripture. Notwithstanding, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath decreed, that it is not necessary for the people to cómunicate in both kinds, and holdeth them <note n="g" place="margin">cone. Trident sess. 21, cap 2</note> accursed that hold it necessary for the people, to receiue the cup, có<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secraced by the priest. Thus it appeareth, they labor nothing more, then to take from the faithful the sweete comfort of the Lords supper. This is a sacrilegious corruption of christs institution, deuised by sathan, broached by Antichrist, published by his adherentes in the corrupt times of most palpable darknesse, as may appeare by these reasons.</p>
               <p>Frist, if none may drinke of the consecrate wine but the priest, then none should eat of the bread, but priests: so that they must either exclude the people from both which I trust they dare not, or admit them to both, which as yet they do not. For to whom Christ said, <note n="h" place="margin">Math, 26, 26 27</note> 
                  <hi>Take and eate,</hi> to those gaue he the cup and said, <hi>Drinke ye.</hi> Wherefore, the signes being both equal, all communicants must drinke of the one, as wel as eate of the other, there being the same warrant for the one, that there is for the other, and the let that would barre the one, will hinder the other: so as <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 19, 6</note>


                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:16298:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the thinges which God in his goodnesse hath ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, man without sinne cannot separate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when Christ instituted this sacrament, he said, <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 26, 27 Mar. 14, 23 1 cor. 12, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Drinke ye all of this:</hi> and by all he vnderstood of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants. And the Euangelist Marke addeth, <hi>They al drank of it,</hi> to wit, all that were present at his last supper, who had before eaten of the bread of the Lord. This also appeareth by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 12. <hi>They haue beene all made to drinke into one spirit.</hi> This commaundement of Christ being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, imposeth a necessity vpon the people, when he saith, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye, do ye this.</hi> These commaundements are perpetuall, vnchangable, and alwaies in force: not arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, not temporall, not repealed, but bind the conscience to the end of the world, against which no limitation, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation can be alowed, being the commaundementes <note n="l" place="margin">1 cor. 14. 37</note> of God, not of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the cup is a part of Christes will and testament. Now touching the nature of a testament or will, the saying of the Apostle is knowne, <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 3, 15 Heb. 9. 16, 17</note> 
                  <hi>If it be but a mans testament, when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate it, or addeth any thing therto:</hi> where he sheweth, that the dead mans wil may not be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nothing can be put to, nothing taken out without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and salsehood. This is the law of nature and Nations. But the Lordes Supper is a sacrament proper to the new testament, as Christ saith, <note n="n" place="margin">Luk, 22, 20</note> 
                  <hi>this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you.</hi> This testament the Lord Iesus made the night before he was betrayed, he sealed it by shedding his most precious blood,- he hath giuen Legacies, not of earthly and temporall, but of heauenly and eternall goods. And seeing he hath appointed the cup of this his testament to be deliuered and drunke of all those for whom his blood was shed: it is intollerable boldnes and presumption to take away the vse thereof from the greater part of the Church, and an infallible token of an vnshamefast and shamelesse harlot, to alter her husbands will, to defraud and defeat his children of that worthy portion which their father alotted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:16298:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fourthly, the blood of Christ shed vpon the Crosse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not onely to the pastors and teachers, but to all the faithfull that come to the table of the Lord, as appeareth by the wordes of Christ, <note n="o" place="margin">Math, 26, 28 Luk. 22, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my blood which is shed for you and for many:</hi> why then should the blood of Christ be denyed, or the cup of the Lord be barred from them? If then the blood of Christ were shed for the people, as well as for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: surely the cup belongeth to one as wel as to the other. If the people haue the greater, who shall keepe them from the lesse? If they haue their part in the thing signified, who shall deny them of the outward signe? For as the fruite and effect of the blood of Christ is common to the people with the pastor: so should the cup also, which is the communion of his blood shed for the redemptionof the peoples sinnes, be diuided indifferently betweene the pastor and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the <note n="p" place="margin">1 cor. 11, 23</note> Apostle deliuered that to the Church which he had receiued from the Lord Iesus: Now the Church ought diligently to obserue the written traditions and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Apostles, which are committed to posterity to be kept inuiolably. But he hath deliuered, how the Lord, after taking, blessing, breaking, and distributing of the bread, likewise tooke the cuppe, blessed, and distributed it among them, so saith the Apostle must the Churches do. If then he receiued this from the Lorde, to deliuer both kinds to the people; let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> consider with her selfe, from whence she hath receiued the contrarye, to withhold one of the kinds from the people: for both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from one and the same spirit of truth, which is neuer contrary to it selfe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, if all the faithfull that come to the Lordes Table, must shew forth the Lords death vntill he come, and this be done by them as wel by drinking of the cup, as by eating of the bread: then all the communicants must receiue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnder both kinds, <note n="q" place="margin">1 cor. 11. 26.</note> vntill the second comming of christ. But the faithfull must shew forth the lordes death by eating of that bread and drinking of that cup, as the Apostle


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16298:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
teacheth, <hi>As often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke of this cup, ye shew the Lordes death vntill he come.</hi> Therefore, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants must partake the sacrament vnder both kinds.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the Apostle giueth an expresse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> whole church, which al must obey that come wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to this holy table, <hi>Let a man examine himselfe,</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">1 cor, 11, 28</note> 
                  <hi>and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.</hi> Where he giueth a double commaundement, first to appeare reuerently, then to receiue worthily. Now, al that must proue and try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, are commaunded not only to eate bread, but to drink of the cup: but al must try and examine themselues: therfore al are commanded both to eat and drink at the lords table. If this be a commaundement to examine: then the wordes following of eating and drinking, are likewise commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There is no halting in these, let them admit both, or let them deny both. Eightly, if the faithfull take not the cup in the supper of the lord, the condicion of Christians vnder the Gospel, shal be worse then of the Isralites vnder the law. For the people of Israell in the wildernesse hauing the same sacrament in effect with vs, <note n="s" place="margin">1 cor. 10, 4</note> 
                  <hi>Did all drinke of the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ,</hi> as the Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. But out condicion is not worser and weaker then theirs: therefore all the faithful are to drink of the cup of the lord. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Souldan of the Romish Synagogue, <note n="t" place="margin">bellar. lib. 4 de euchar. C. 27</note> answereth thus, <hi>They drunke not water out of the rock when they did eate of the spirituall meate, but in another place, and at an other time.</hi> But this is an answearlesse answer which cannot satisfie. For albeit the sacraments of the Isralites as figures and types did represent the same graces that our Sacraments do: yet it is not necessary they should in all pointes answer each other, and in all respectes agree together. Besides, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at no time aloweth the people to drinke of the Wine, a seale of the blood of Christ: they keepe them from the cup of the Lord, both when they giue them the bread, and at all other times, and thereby make their estate worse then the estate of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Indeed, if they did at any time permit al the people to drink of the cup, they


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16298:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might pretend this example of the Israelites: but inasmuch as they vtterly deny them this part of the cup, they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw themselues in their malice, and yet in their blindnes they do not see it. Lastly, many of the fathers, did both eate <hi>Manna</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> water out of the rock, if not in the same place, yet at one &amp; the same time, <note n="u" place="margin">exod. 16, 21</note> inasmuch as they gathered thereof euery morning, and it ceased not, <note n="a" place="margin">Iosh. 5. 12</note> vntill they entred the frontiers and confines of the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. But they neuer alow without a toleration and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, the people in any place, at any time, vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and in any respect to tast of the cup in the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Ninthly, if the cup of the new testament may be taken from the Lordes people: in like manner the water in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme may be taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. For the blood of christ, whereby remission of sins is purchased and procured, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by the wine of the Lordes Supper, as well as by the water in baptisme. But the water in baptisme, without great sacriledge, cannot be omitted or neglected: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then should the cup be taken away.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if any part of the supper might be taken away from the people: then like wise the word of God may be taken from them, for in this point there is the same reason and respect of them both. A Sacrament is nothing else but a visible word, and a sealing vp of the word: and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence semeth to be the same, whether a man break the seale, or rent the writing. But the word cannot be withdrawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christian people, it being the instrument of faith, and the life of the Church. Wherefore it is the greatest wrong and iniury done to the people of God to take from them the cup of saluation. The answer to this reason must be, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the parts and yeeld the conclusion: forasmuch as by forbidding the people the reading of the Scriptures, they haue robbed them of the word of God, and taken from them <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. xi, 52</note> the key of knowledge, neither entring themselues into the kingdom of heauen, nor suffering those that would enter. No marueile then, if they take the cup of blessing from the people, who haue taken from them the free vse of


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16298:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the word of God. To conclude these reasons, it is Antichrist, who, contrary to the doctrine of christ, contrary to the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the supper, contrary to the practise of the Apostles, and contrary to the vse of the former churches, hath exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people languishing and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Hauing considered the truth of God by sundry reasons, grounded in the scripture, that the people haue good interest and title in the cup, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them: let vs answer the <note n="c" place="margin">Obiections for taking the cup from the people of god</note> obiections of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, made against the former doctrine. First, they pretend, that christ administred it to the apostles only, and not to any of the people: &amp; consequently the institution for taking the cup can be no general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement for al men: thus <note n="d" place="margin">

Neither doth it appeare that any remained, or was burned with fire, <note n="l" place="margin">Exod. xii. x</note> according to the institution of God, because the <hi>Euangelists</hi> declare, that so soone as the supper was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred and a psalme sung of thanksgiuing, <note n="m" place="margin">Math, xxvi 30</note> they went out into the Mount of Oliues. Why then should we not thinke, that christ added and annexed other to his family, seing his own disciples sufficed not, especially the blessed virgin his mother who was not long from him, <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 19 xxvi 27.</note> whom afterward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure, he commended and committed to Iohn, to be protected and prouided for, who from that time took her home to his house as his own mother. But to leaue these consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as coniectures, we answer the former obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in asmuch as christ deliuered both signs to the same, persons, they might bar the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread as wel as from the cup. For I would know why the bread is necessary, but because it was instituted by christ, and retained by his Apostles? Wherefore, the institution maketh the one as requisite as the other. Besids, if other heretiks should arise, as great enemies to the peoples partaking of the bread, as the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of the cup of the Lord: how might they better be repressed and refelled, then by alleaging the first institution of christ, and shewing the practise of the Apostles: so that the reasons brought to confute the one, wil serue directly to ouerthrow the other. Moreouer, the disciples at the first ministration of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, performed not the office of the minister, nor any part


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16298:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his duty, but of the people Christ was the minister therof, he took the bread, he blessed, he brake, he gaue the bread, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Likewise he tooke the cup, blessed, &amp; gaue the same, saying <hi>This cup is the new testament in my blood.</hi> On the other side, the disciples took it, did eat and drinke, which are the proper duties of all the people: Lastly, the Apostle saith not in the first person, we ate and drink, as speaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe &amp; other teachers of the church: but directing his speach to all <note n="o" place="margin">1 cor, 1, 2</note> that are called and sanctified in Christ in euery place (according to the inscription of the epistle) he saith, <hi>As often as ye shal eate this bread</hi>

               <p>Secondly, they object against the former truth, this out of <note place="margin">Obiect 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Act. 2, They continued in the apostles doctrine, and in breaking of bread:</hi> and Ch. 20, <hi>they came together to break bread.</hi> It is not said, to deliuer the cup vnto the people <note n="q" place="margin">act, 2, 42, &amp; xx, 7</note> but to breake bread: wherby they gather, it was ministred vnto the people in one kind onely, and not in both. I answer, by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, <note place="margin">Answer.</note> one part is put for the whole. For among the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> this phrase in scripture <hi>to eate bread,</hi> is to receiue whole nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment &amp; ful refreshing by eating and drinking: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by <note n="r" place="margin">Esa, 58, 7 Lam, 4, 4 Math, 15. 33 Luk. 24. 30 act. 20. xi</note> many places, wher mentioning only bread for food, it were madnes to imagine and gather that they drunk not. Besides, the Apostle putteth the other part, to wit, drinking of the <note n="s" place="margin">1 cor. 12, 13</note> cup, for the whole celebration of the supper, when he saith, <hi>By one spirit we are al baptized into one body, and haue been al made to drink into one spirit:</hi> where we see, as our sauiour added the vniuersal note <hi>drink ye al of this:</hi> and as the <hi>Euangelist Mark</hi> accordeth, saying <hi>they al dranke of it:</hi> so the Apostle doth not pretermit it, but saith, <hi>al were made to drink:</hi> as if the Lord Iesus, the Euangelists and the Apostles would preuent before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the corruption &amp; followed in the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherfore, seeing drinking of the cup, doth not properly note out the whole action, because no man was euer so grosly blinded, to suppose that the cup might be alone administred: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that by this member expressed, we must vnderstand the


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16298:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other, and by one part the whole. Furthermore, it is a ruled case among themselues, that it is flat sacriledge, if a priest consecrate not this sacrament in both kindes, but do it in bread onely. If then the former scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and ch. 20. proue the receiuing vnder one kind because bread onely is expressed, &amp; so the cup to be excluded: it wil likewise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they consecrated in one kinde, because the wine is not expressed: and therefore, by these places, neither priest nor people should take the cup, if they will not admit a trope or figure. Neither can they say, that <hi>Luke</hi> discribeth not, what the Apostles consecrated or receiued, but what they deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the people: for the Euangelist declareth <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 11. not onely that the Apostle brake the bread, but <note n="t" place="margin">Act. 20, 7</note> did eate thereof himselfe: so that they must confesse, that <hi>Paule</hi> also receiued in one kind, and consecrated in one kind, or else necessarily grant one part put for the whole: as likewise we say 1 Cor. 11, where he doth expresly touch and teach both kindes, <note n="u" place="margin">1 cor. 11, 26 27, 28, 29</note> to the eating of the bread ioyning the drinking of this cup: yet sometimes <note n="a" place="margin">1 cor. 11. 20 29, 33</note> he expresseth onely the one signe for shortnes sake, &amp; the church had receiued this vsual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking to call the Lordes Supperthe breaking of bread, as verse 20. <hi>When ye come together into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper:</hi> and verse 33. <hi>When ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eate, tary one for another:</hi> likewise verse 29. <hi>He discerneth not the Lords body:</hi> and yet in the sentence going before, hee saith that such as eate and drinke vnworthily, do eate and drinke their owne iudgement. Wherefore, as the Apostles alwaies celebrated the supper by conseeration both of the bread and of the cup: so the people alwaies receiued in both these kinds, to their great comfort and consolation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they alleage, that there is an vnion and coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each signe, that the body is in the blood, and the <note place="margin">Obiect. 3</note> blood in the body: that christ is wholly and perfectly vnder each kind, because now in his glorious body, <note n="b" place="margin">concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantia.</note> there is no separation of the body from the blood, or blood from the body. I answer, surely if this were so, it were a fault and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous <note place="margin">Answer.</note> thing to do that by more, which may be <hi rend="sup">c</hi> done by


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16298:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fewer, to vse two kindes, which may as well be done and is done vnder one, as a wise Philosopher teacheth. Besides, if one may reason in that soit, the whole supper might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, for we are made partakers of christ in <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 3, 27</note> baptisme, and he dwelleth in our hearts by <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 3, 14. 15 Eph. 3, 17</note> faith which commeth by the word ofGod. Again, were not Christ and his Apostles as wise as they? Were they ignorant of this vnion? Did they not knowe this accompanying of the body with the blood, and blood with the body? Is the present church of <hi>Rome</hi> wiser then he, in whom al the <note n="f" place="margin">Col, 1. 19, &amp; 2. 3, 9</note> treasures of wisedom and knowledge are hid? If they thinke so, let them tell vs plainly: if not, let them lay their hands vpon their mouth, and submit themselues vnto him who administred it in both kinds, and commaunded his Apostles to do the like. Moreouer, Christ would haue vs in his supper consider his blood separated from his body, and set his death before our eies, and his precious blood shed out of his side: so that, deliuering the cup, he said, <note n="g" place="margin">Math. 26 27, 28,</note> 
                  <hi>Drinke ye all of this, for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many,</hi> without which sheading, there is <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 9, 12</note> no forgiuenesse of sins, as the Apostle teacheth. Wherefore, seeing these two are contrary one to the other, and cannot stand together; to wit, the blood to be in the body and to be out of the body, to be shed sor vs and not to be shed, and that the sacrament leadeth vs to the consideration of the death, and especially of the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and pouring out of the blood of Christ: we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this <note n="i" place="margin">Concil. Trid sess. 3, can. 3</note> vnion of the body with the blood, and blood with the body, flatly crosseth and ouerthroweth the institution of Christ. And why I pray you, do their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing priests receiue the blood twice, and the body twice, drinking first the blood in the body, and againe eating the body in the blood? Nay, doth not this vnion deuised, alter the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of Christ, and confound the seuerall parts of it, making him to speake otherwise then the euangelistes expresse? For when he said, <hi>This is my body,</hi> they will haue him meane, this is my body and blood: Againe, when he said <hi>this is my blood,</hi> they will haue him meane, this is my


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16298:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blood and my body. Last of all, this late inuention, turneth and ouerturneth the nature of the partes, distinguished one from the other: while we eate the flesh they make vs drink the blood, and while we drinke the blood, they imagine we eat the body. Thus, to eat and to drinke shall be all one with them: for wee shal eate liquid and moift thinges, and we shall drinke dry and hard things. And is not this drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of flesh, and eating of blood, and inuerting &amp; euerting of the nature of things? But thus God striketh his enemies with giddines of spirit. For after they haue broken the pure institution of christ, and brought in a carnal presence of his body (one absurdity being granted, <note n="k" place="margin">arist. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And thus much of the general vses, arising from both the signs ioyntly considered. Now, let vs <note place="margin">partic. vse. 1</note> come to the particular vses offered vnto vs, in each of the signes. And first, touching the bread. Is bread simply consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the first signe in the lords supper? Then it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily required, that it be administred in vnleauened bread. For bread is oftentimes named and repeated: but the word (vnleauened) is neuer added. Wherfore as it is in selfe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whether the wine be red or white, &amp; whatsoeuer the kind or colour be (if it be wine:) so is it not greatly materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether the bread be leauened or vnleauened, so it bee bread. Which ouerthroweth the error of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; her fauorites, who hold it <note n="l" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4 de Eucha. cap. V,</note> neeessary, that the bread vsed in the Sacra. be vnleauened. They pretend the institution of Christ, who (say they) made the Sacra. of vnleauened bread, instituting it after he had eaten the passeouer, which was to be eaten with vnleauened bread <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. xii. 8, xviii.</note> according to the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> neither was there any leauen to be found in Israel 7. daies together. Thus they charge vs to breake the institution of Christ. But see heere the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, when it serueth any way to their purpose: but when the question is of matters of substance not of circumstance, as touching communicating vnder both kinds, touching the necessity of eating &amp; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of many receiuing together against their halfe com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munions, priuate masses, and reseruations, they cannot abide to be tyed and yoked to the institution. Indeed we deny not, but christ might vse vnleauened bread at his last supper, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing immediately before eaten the paschal lambe. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture is truely coniectured: yet no such thing is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the gospell, nor prescribed as a rule necessarily to bee followed. The Euangelists teach, he tooke bread: but make no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion or distinction what bread he took, nor determine what bread we should take, no more then limit what wine we shal vse, but leaue it at liberty to take leauened bread or vnleuened, as occasion of time, place, persons, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances serue, so we take bread, as their own <note n="n" place="margin">Gregor. i, in Registr.</note> prophets haue confessed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to consecrate in vnleuened bread is not of the substance of the supper, no more then to eat it at night or after supper, as christ administred and the apostles first receiued it. For if any would bring in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of that time, as wel as of that bread which christ vsed, we see as faire a warrant for the one as for the other: nay we haue a more certain direction for the time which is expressed, then for the kind of bread which is not defined. Besides, if Christ on this occasion vsed vnleuened bread: it was, because it was vsual, common, and ordinary bread at that time, as we also should vse that bread, which is vsual and common. So the Apostle speaketh of that bread which was daily vsed among the Gentiles, saying, <note n="p" place="margin">1 cor, x, xvi</note> 
                  <hi>The bread which we breake:</hi> he addeth, neither leuened nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuened, but vnderstandeth that in common and continuall vse.

For, whereas they hold that the wine must be mingled with water, and that the elementes after the words of consecration are transubstantiated, and remaine in their owne nature no more: I would aske this question of these <hi>Watermen,</hi> rowing in the troubled Sea of their owne decrees (who are neere of kinne <note n="a" place="margin">Papists are neere of kin to the old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

it is, then will they make Christ a watery body and elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: besides, it cannot be by vertue os Christes institution, where water is neither expresled nor included.

For, how can they shew the Lords death, or do it in remembrance of christ, vnlesse they take and eate? And as the paschallambe was not that passeouer, vnlesse it were killed and eaten: no more is the bread and wine a sacrament, except they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and digested.

So that, where Christ saith take ye, eate ye: these bread-worshippers haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it into, looke ye, gaze ye, worship ye, giuing his glory to dumbe and senselesse creatures. True it is, we confesse that the Sacramentes, as mysteries sanctified to an holy vse, as vessels of gods grace, and as instrumentes fitted to worke great things, are not to be contemned or refused, but to be receiued with due regard and to be vsed with all sobriety <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> yea we confesse that christ God &amp; man is to be worshipped euery where: we honor his word, we reuerence his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Notwithstanding, <note n="n" place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be adored.</note> we put a difference between God and the sacrament of God, the same honor is not due to the one that is due to other, and therefore we cannot adore the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with diuine worship, for many reasons. First, because christ in the institution of his supper said, take, eate, drink: he said not, worship, fal down, bow the knees before the Sacra. and call vpon it in time of need. We heard before in the case of vnleuened bread, they appealed to the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of cstrist: why do they now fly from it, turning eating and drinking into worshipping and adoring? Wherefore, is it not a great iniquity and wickednes, to omit what christ commaundeth, and do what he commaundeth not? Secondly, God only is to be worshipped with diuine honor, as <hi>Math. 4, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Math. 4, 10</note> 
                  <hi>only thou shalt serue.</hi> And <hi>Exod. 20. Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them.</hi> Now the sacrament is not christ, it is an institution of christ: it is not god, but an ordinance of God; for god is not visible, but the sacra. is visible, that al may know it, and see it with their eies: the sacrament is eaten, but God cannot be eaten and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of vs, <note n="p" place="margin">1 king. 8, 27 Acts. 7, 48, 49</note> whom the heauens and the heauens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens cannot contain or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend.

                  <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh 4, 22</note> 
                  <hi>they knew not:</hi> but the Papistes know not the body of Christ to be contained vnder the accidentes ofbread and Wine, for the scriptures haue not taught it, CHRIST hath not deliuered it, the


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16298:149"/>
Apostles haue not shewed it. Besides, they knew not the priests intent, whereon they say the essence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dependeth, so as if he had no purpose of consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they cannot deny themselues to be idolaters and bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshippers. Fourthly, <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn. 4, 24</note> the true worshippers must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in spirit and in truth, as Christ setteth downe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4, 24, that is, not according to our owne imaginations and diuises, but as God hath prescribed: but, to fall downe to the sacrament, is a bodily sernice, a new-forged worship, and an humane inuention. Fistly, without faith no man can please God: but saith commeth by hearing, <note n="s" place="margin">Heb: xi, 6</note> and hearing by the word of God, which yet they could neuer shew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: therefore, they can haue no assurance of pleasing God in their wil-worship. Sixtly, if this sacrament be to be worshipped, then it is vnited personally to Christ, because adoration should not be due to Christ as man, except God and man in the vnion of person were one Christ: but there is no personall vnion betweene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the sacrament of Christ: therefore not to be worshipped. Seuenthly, no man in his wits and right mind wil honor that with diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which himselfe may take in his hand, and eate with his mouth, and which may be deuouied by Mise, Rattes, dogs, Wormes, or other venime: for how shall that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored as God, that cannot defend it selfe from the teeth of men and beastes? As <hi>Ioash</hi> answeared, <note n="t" place="margin">Iud 6, 31, 32</note> 
                  <hi>Will ye plead Baals cause? If he be God, let him plead for himselfe against him that hath cast downe his altar.</hi> Lastly, seeing they adore Christ in the pixe, where the bread is; and in the chalyce wher the wine is, why do they not likewise worship him in the priest and in the faithfull people, and euery man in his brother, when they haue created and eaten him vp? The same Christ that was surely inclosed in the pixe, is by their doctrine, really contained in the body of priest and people, when they haue eaten and drunken their supposed sacrifice: Why then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore they not the flesh of christ, after that it is entred into the mouth of man, as well as in the golden boxe, or in the gilden chalice? Nay, why may he not be adored in the

bodies of mise and vermin by them, if it fall out that they eate vp their God? Shall he be any where without honor? Or wil they worship him wher they list, and ouerskip him where they please? Howsoeuer therefore Christ is to be worshipped, yet we must take heed we worship not a piece of bread in stead of christ, which is most grosse and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Moreouer, if christ command the bread to be eaten and the wine to be drunk then they are not to be <note place="margin">Vse. 3</note> offered vp to God the father, as is vsually wont to be done in the pageant of the Masse.

But for a mortall man, whose breath is in his nostrils, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume in the prid of his hart, vnder the formes of bread and wine to offer vp christ the son of God in the sacrifice to his father, and to dare to desire the father fauourably to behold and accept his owne sonne, is idolatry, blasphemy, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impiety, to be detested of all true hearted Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>Touching the originall of <note n="d" place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the word Masse.</note> the word Masse, it seemeth to come from an ancient custome of the church, sending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way such as communicated not. For the deacon was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to bid them depart, that were nouices in the faith, and such as by Church-discipline <note n="e" place="margin">polid. Virgil de inuent. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum lib. 5. cap 10</note> were remoued from the communion. This dimission of them was noted by the word Missa, signifieng a sending away and licensing to depart: and thus some of <note n="f" place="margin">sueton. in caling. cap. 25</note> the heathen vsed it. The name then being in it selfe not euill, is turned into an euill practise, and therfore as it is vsed and vnderstood of our aduersaries, we reiect both the name and thing it selfe, for these causes. First, no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, no man, no creature is of that dignity and worthinesse, that he may offer vp and sacrifice the sonne of God: for the priest is aboue the sacrifice: they therefore that will be the priests to offer christ, aduance and lift vp themselues aboue christ. Secondly, if christ be really offered in the Masse, then he is killed truely and indeed: for a reall sacrifice proueth a reall death, and when christ was sacrificed really, he dyed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as when the beasts were sacrificed, they wer killed.

               <p>Thirdly, new sacrifices are not to bee instituted by men, without commaundement of god, as <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth. <hi>Deut. 12.</hi> we must not do <hi rend="sup">h</hi> what seemeth good in our owne eyes,


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16298:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but take heede and heare all these words which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs. Now, Christ neuer saide, Sacrifice ye my bodie and blood to God. Fourthly, Christ tooke the bread and gaue it to his disciples, he did not offer it vp to God the father, he tooke the cup and bad them all drinke of it: he did not turne himfelfe to God, and desire him then to accept the sacrifice of his body and blood. Fiftly, if the bread and Wine remaine in their former substance in the Lords supper: then bread and wine onely are offered, not the body and blood of Christ, but they remaine: for christ deliuered <note n="i" place="margin">1 cor. x, 16</note> bread to his Disciples, and Paule teacheth that it is the bread which is broken, &amp; that as ofren asthe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde deliuered them both apart, but the bodye of Christ was neuer sacrificed without the blood, nor the blood without the flesh: for Christ offered vppon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the crosse the sacrifice of his bodie and blood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is the cause that he saide, <hi>Take ye, eat ye, drinke ye,</hi> not take ye to offer and to Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the Scripture teacheth vs one offering and Sacrifice for sin once performed and offered. <hi>Heb. 10.

                  <hi>more offering for sinne.</hi> If then we haue remission by the sacrifice of Christ, all other sacrifices are superfluous and abrogat his al-sufficient sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. So Rom, 6. <hi>In that he died, he died for sinne</hi>

Pet. 3. <hi>Christ also hath once suffered for sinnes, the iust for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst.</hi> If then this perfect offering were once onely to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, then he is not offered, neither can be offered againe in the Masse. And, if the onely oblation of Christ once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by himselfe be sufficient: all other oblations and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are vaine and superfluous. For how is that perfect, which is often repeated?</p>
               <p>Eightly, to make a lawfull sacrifice, there is required necessarily a fit minister lawfully called of God, for <note n="o" place="margin">Hebr. 5, 4, 5</note> no man taketh his honor to himselfe but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron:</hi> so likewise Christ took not to himselfe this honour to be made the high-priest, but he that saide to him, Thou art my sonne, this day I begat thee, gaue it him. But Christ is the onely priest of the new testament, his priesthood is immortall and eternall, he liueth for euer therefore the Popish priesthood is a plant neuer planted by the heauenly father the <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1, 2</note> true husbandman, and the popish priests were neuer called of God, to sacrifice the body and blood of Christ, he gaue vnto them no such authority, <note n="q" place="margin">Math 15, 13</note> &amp; therefore, in time shall be rooted vp. If they pretend the precept and planting of God, let them shew their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission that we may see it, and let them bring forth their charter that we may trie it, otherwise wee must take them for vsurpers, and counterfait Officers in the cittie of God. Ninthlie, the Apostle teacheth, that without shedding of blood is no <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 9, 22</note> remission: But in the vnblodie Sacrifice of the Masse, there is not effusion of blood, he doth not suffer, he is not killed, he doth not shed his blood, he doth not die: therefore in the Masse is no remission of any sins.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, if Christ be daily offered in the Masse, then hee doth dailie satisfie for sinne, for the end of his offering is <note n="s" place="margin">Roma. 4, 25</note> to make satisfaction, as Romaines, 4. 25. <hi>He was deliuered


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16298:152"/>
to death for our sinnes, and is risen againe for our instification.</hi> And Gal, 1, 4. He <hi>gaue himselfe for our sinnes that he might deliuer vs from this present euill world;</hi> But he doth not make satisfaction, for our sinnes, no more then now he dieth and riseth again, for then Christ would not haue said, <note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 19. 30</note> 
                  <hi>It is finished:</hi> nor the Apostle, <hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
                  <hi>He entered once into the holy place.</hi> Wherefore, no more sacrifice for sinne remaineth to be offered by such as iniuriously vsurpe the priesthood of christ.</p>
               <p>Last of all, all true christians are Priestes to offer vp their bodies an acceptable sacrifice to God, which is their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable seruice of God, and to offer vp a broken contrite spirit, as 1 Pet, 3, 9. <hi>Ye are a chosen generation,</hi>

He <hi>hath loued vs and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vs from our sinnes in his blood, and made vs Kings and priestes vnto God his father.</hi> These are the Priests that now remaine, this is the priesthood which we professe. Whosoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himselfe any priest of another order in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, abrogateth and abolisheth the Priesthood of christ, being after the order <note n="a" place="margin">Hebr, 6. 20. Psal. 110, 4</note> of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> who was both king and priest.</p>
               <p>Now then, as they commit sacriledge against Christ, that presume to offer him vp an vnbloody sacrifice to God the father, to make peace and attonement betweene God and man: so they adde another iniquity as drunkennesse to thirst, making their oblation not onely profitable to take away the sinnes of the liuing, but auaileable to clense <note n="b" place="margin">The Masse is no propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the dead.</note> the sinnes of the deade, that are come to the ende of theyr daies.</p>
               <p>Indeede we deny not, but the Masse may be beneficiall to the rabble of Friers and sacrificing Priestes that make it gainefull to themselues, who through their sale and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of Masses, dwell stately, goe sumptuously, fare delicately, drinke wine in siluer and gold, abound in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and heape vp great aboundaunce of all riches: shall we not now say, the Masse is profitable? But other profit of the Masses, then these to the Masse-mungers, we know none. We know, we find, we feelethem otherwise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16298:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
waies pernicious in themselues, dishonourable to God, and hurtfull to the people. For first the Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to no such end and purpose, as to helpe the deade, and to be a propitiation for their sinnes. For Christ sayde take and eat, this is my body: drinke ye, this is my blood: but the deade cannot take any thing offered vnto them: they can neither eate, nor drinke: wherefore, this supper being spirituall meat and nourishment for the soule, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not auaile the deade, who are neither fed nor nourished. Secondly, it profiteth as much to be baptized for the dead, as to receiue the Supper of the Lorde for the deade: for both Sacraments were instituted of Christ, and there is the same respect of both. But it can doe no good to baptize one for another, the liuing for the dead, therefore the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, comming to receiue the Sacrament of the Supper, cannot releeue the dead.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is no forgiuenesse of sinnes after this life, we haue forgiuenes in this life or neuer. Whatsoeuer is bounde on earth, is bound in heauen. Heere is the time, heere is the place, heere is the occasion offered to worke, as the wiseman teacheth, Ec, 9, <hi>All that thine hand shall find to do, do it with all thy power: for there is</hi>

Fourthly, it is vaine to offer for those that haue ended their daies, and are already come to the ende of their race, <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn, 9. 4 &amp; 11, 9. 10</note> whose estate can neuer be changed.</p>

But this is the state of all the dead, they are entred into iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are not subiect to any chang. Lastly, if the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Masse could wash away the sinnes of the dead, then the sacrifice of the Masse should surmount and exceede the sacrifice offered by christ himselfe vpon the Crosse. For this helpeth the liuing, it auaileth not the dead: and so we should haue other meanes to take away sinne then his obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and there should be another propitiation for the sinnes of the world. And thus much of the popish idoll of the blasphemous masse.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, did Christ deliuer his last Supper to all his Disciples that were present? Did none stand by, and gaze <note place="margin">Vse. 4</note> on while other receiued? Then heereby fall to the ground the priuate communions of the popish Church, where al <note place="margin">Against pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate mastes in the church of Rome.</note> is deuoured by the priest, nothing deliuered to the people. For whereas the ordinance of Christ and ancient order of the church was, for the minister and people to receiue the <note place="margin">Conc. Trid. ses. 22. cap. 6</note> Sacrament together: among them the priest accompanied with his boy to make answer, receiueth the sacrament him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone, without distribution made to others, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the whole congregation be present and looke vpon him, whereby God is dishonoured, the communion is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, the people of God are there by depryued and robbed of al comfort. How is this a feast which the priest prepareth for himselfe, not for others: receiueth by himselfe, not with his bretheren: he speaketh to himselfe, and not to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly: he vseth a strange tongue, and no man knoweth what he meaneth: the people is taught nothing, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nothing, they heare nothing, they receiue nothing; and a few childish, apish, foolish, and vnseemely gestures excepted, they see nothing: they tast nothing, they partake nothing, neither comfort of heart, nor memory of Christ, nor benefit of his passion. But Christ in his last Supper, did not eate vp all alone, but after the Disciples hadde supped as <hi>Mathew</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Math. 26, 26</note> setteth it downe, he tooke bread and blessed he brake and gaue it to them, saying, take ye, eate ye: neither did he drinke alone of the fruite of the vine, but taking the

cup he gaue thanks, and gaue to them all, saying, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> So then, albeit a certain number of communicants are not limited and determined: yet Christ in these wordes apoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>These words cannot be vnderstood of one perticular man, but necessarily import a greater number of men: nay, the Philosopher teacheth that the word (<hi>all</hi>) must be verified at the least <note n="h" place="margin">Arist. li. 1. de coel. cap. 1</note> of the number of three, which is the least and lowest number that would be admitted to this supper. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we read that so soon as one was gained to the faith, that the Apostles administred this Sacrament to him, much lesse would they minister to themselues alone, when none were conuerted in a nation or cittie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ expressely commandeth vs to doe as himselfe did, when he left this fare-well token and pledge of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to his Disciples, saying, <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 22, 19</note> 
                  <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> But he, after the wordes of consecration, did not offer a sacrifice to his father vnder shewes of bread and wine, but gaue the bread and cup to his Disciples, and left his owne example as a direction for vs to followe: so that the distribution and deliuerance of the signes is of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sacrament, as well as the breaking of the bread or pouring out of the wine, and it is not lawfull in any sort to change the testament of Christ, or to corrupt the meaning of the testator. Thirdly, the Apostle teacheth how he receiued from the Lorde that which he deliuered to the churches, that the people should eate of this bread and drinke of this cup: <note n="k" place="margin">1 cor. xi, 23</note> and proueth that the faithfull are made partakers of the Lords table, not by gazing or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on while others eat, but by eating: not by standing still while others drinke, but by drinking. as 1 Cor. x. <hi>Wee that are <hi rend="sup">l</hi> many are one breade and one body, because we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> Fourthly, the same Apostle reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16298:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which presumed to the Supper of the Lorde besore others, and did not tarry for their brethren when they came togither to be partakers of the sacrament, as we see, 1 Cor, 11. <hi>Euery man a hen they should eate,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">1 cor. xi. 20, xxi</note> 
                  <hi>taketh his owne supper afore, this is not to eat the Lords snpper.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>Wherefore my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tarry one for another.</hi> Now because the <hi>Corinthians</hi> brake this order and ordinance, he chargeth them to come vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, to receiue vnworthily, to eat and drink iudgment vnto themselues. Shall they then that are faithfull christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, patiently beare the iniury done them by these sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Masse-mungers, who neuer bid the Lordes ghuestes, nor call them to his table, nor tarry for them till they come to this heauenly banket, but like the priests of <hi>Bell,</hi> do eate and drinke vp all themselues.</p>
               <p>Fistly, the same Apostle willeth and warneth all persons which come to this communion, diligently to proue and examine <note n="n" place="margin">1, cor. 11, 28</note> themselues, and then to come to this supper, as we see, 1 cor. 12. <hi>Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eat of this bread and drinke of this cup:</hi> so that he would not haue any excluded from receiuing, which haue tryed their harts by examining, and are thereby rightly propared to this great worke. Lastly, the names giuen to this Sacrament, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nature thereof, doe affoord vs a good considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to strike through the heart of this priuate Masse, being called sometimes the supper of the Lord, and sometimes a communion among our selues. If it be an holy supper and spirituall banket, why are none bidden and called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? If it be a communion, why doth the Priest vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably swallow all alone? whereby they make it a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but without company: a supper, but without ghuests: meat, but without eating: drinke, but without drinking: a table, but without sitting downe: a participation, but without any that are partakers: a banket, but without seeding thereat, the people departing as hungery and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty as they came. Wherefore, as no man celebrated the Passeouer aright, or receiued profit thereby, but such as


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16298:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did eat the flesh thereof: so can none come to the supper of the Lord as he ought, though he looke vpon others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he eate of the bread and drinke of the cup, according to the commaundement of Christ, the author thereof. And thus much of the sole communions and priuate Masses brought into the church against the example of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vse of the Apostles, and against the name and nature of the sacrament it selfe.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue pulled downe the Heresies of the Church of Rome, and haue raked in the dirt and dungh ill <note place="margin">vse, 5</note> of their deuises, the sauour whereof hath annoyed heauen and earth: now let us obserue out of this last outward part of the sacrament, how we are directed and instructed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to further our knowledge and obedience. Did Christ commaunde the faithfull of his family to eate and drinke that which he deliuereth without laying any furder burthen or bondage vpon them? then we must vnderstand, <note n="o" place="margin">It is no precept of Christ to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fasting.</note> it is no precept of Christ to receiue the Lordes supper fasting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other meats and drinkes.</p>
               <p>True it is, the people, whose zeale goeth beyond their knowledge, make a great scruple of conscience in this point to come fasting <note n="p" place="margin">August. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <hi>118.</hi>
                  </note> which custom we do not condemn, but commend, so it be without superstition in themselues, and iudging of others. But howsoeuer many make as great a matter to communicate fasting, as to come in faith: yet this is no necessary rule or commaundement binding the conscience to the obseruation thereof. For, the Worde of God and institution of the sacrament are perfect directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the church, teaching all matters of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet they teach no such practise. And our blessed sauiour teacheth his disciples what they should do, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists deliuer what they did, and among all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we find not this precept of fasting. Againe, Christ administred it not fasting, the Apostles receiued it not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: not that we are bounde to celebrate the supper at that time: but to shew that Christ would neuer haue chosen to do it after Supper, if that time had bin simply vnlawful.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:16298:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Besides, the Apostle 1 cor. 11. reproouing the abuses crept into this Sacrament, and labouring to reduce it to the first institution, exhorteth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to tarry one for another, and if any be hungry <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. xi, 36</note> that he cannot tarrie, he must before hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue giuen counsell and commandement, if it had bin vnlawfull or vngodly to take some little repast and short refreshing before, in regarde of the present infirmity and weakenes of the body. Lastly, he teacheth in another place, <hi>That the kingdome of heauen is not</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 14. 17</note> 
                  <hi>meat nor drinke, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes and peace, and ioy in the holy-ghost.</hi> To conclude, as hee willeth that he which eateth, despise not him that eateth not, and he which eateth not condemne not him that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 14, 3, 5 19</note> so must it be in this indifferent practise, he that can take it, let him take it: but let not him that receiueth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, iudge him that fasteth not: and let not him which fasteth not, condemne him that receiueth fasting, he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or falleth to his owne maister.

creatures, is taken out of 1 Tim. 4. 4. <hi>Euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be refused, if it be receiued with thanks giuing: for it is sanctified</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1 Tim 4, 4, 5</note> 
                  <hi>by the word of God and prayer.</hi> These are the two meanes, the word and prayer, whereby the elementes are changed, though not transubstantiated, yet they haue a dignity and preheminence, which they had not before, they are no <note n="i" place="margin">Iust in. in Apol. 2</note> more common bread, common Wine, common meate, but a Sacrament of Christes body, a warrant of Gods promises, an holy Mystery, and seale of the couenant between God and vs. The first meanes of this consecration, and setting a part of the creatures to our vse, is by the word of God. If we haue the euident and expresse word to warrant our vse of the creatures of God, we may vse them for our necessity and comfort: if we haue no word to beare out the practise, they are not sanctified vnto vs. The tree of knowledge of good and euil, was not sanctified vnto. <hi>Adam,</hi> though it were good in it selfe (as all <note n="k" place="margin">Gene. 1, 31</note> creatures are) because he had a word of commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to eate of it, <note n="l" place="margin">Genes. 2, 17</note> 
                  <hi>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, thou shalt not eate of it, for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye the death.</hi> After the fall and after the flood, all creatures were not sanctified, some were accounted <note n="m" place="margin">Gene, 7, 2</note> vncleane, all might not be eaten, all might not be offered: as vnder the law, <note n="n" place="margin">Leuit. 11. 3</note> among the beastes, onely they were cleane that did chew the cud and diuide the hoofe: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fishes of the Sea, onely such as had skales and finnes were called cleane, the rest were vncleane vnto them, because the word did not allow but restraine the vse of them.</p>
               <p>So likewise for this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, not euery creature is sanctified, not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not any flesh, not any fish, not oyle: but onely bread and Wine. These two are consecrated, all the rest are cancelled by the word. The second meanes, whereby the creatures are sanctified, is by prayer. For albeit that God by the comming of his sonne into the world hath sanctified all meates and drinkes, that nothing of it selfe is vncleane, <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 14, 15</note> but to him that counteth


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16298:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it vncleane: yet something must necessarily be done on our partes, otherwise that which is holy, we may prophane: and that which is good, we may turne into euill: and therefore the apostle addeth praier, which is both a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to the Lord that he hath sanctified and prepared them for vs, and likewise a petition that they may bee healthfull for vs, and we thankefull for them, whereby our foode, our apparell, and all the succours of this life are sanctified to his glory and our comfort.</p>
               <p>These be the two meanes of consecration: if these or any of them be wanting, there can be no true consecration. If then in the time of the law they should haue eaten swines flesh, which indeed <note n="p" place="margin">Leuit. xi, 7</note> part the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but chew not the cud: they should haue sinned, because it was not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and therefore albeit they had prayed for a blessing all the day longe, and giuen thankes neuer so much, yet could it not make their practise lawfull, which the word of God had made vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>Or, if they had offered a cleane and holy sacrifice, and not made humble and earnest prayers to God to accept them and their oblations, it could not haue due effect, but the worde of God had beene hindred by their vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse. So, in the administration of the Lordes sacred Supper, we vse the word of God which warranteth vs to take the bread and Wine, out of this word wee alledge the promises of God to the true beleeuer: and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto wee ioyne prayers and thankesgiuing, that God would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> vs in the participation of his owne ordinance. Thus, albeit we haue no forged tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, wee haue a true consecration: if the word of God and prayer of the church can worke it, which are the meanes left vnto vs for this purpose: if wee be <note n="q" place="margin">Ierem. 20, 7</note> any way deceiued, it is the Scripture which hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now, to marke the vses of this point for our <note place="margin">vse. 1</note> farther instruction. If by vsing the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We pronounce the same wordes of consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that christ pronounced: we obserue the same thinges that christ obserued, and charged vs to do: we shew forth plainly the death of Christ as it <note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 3. 1</note> he were described in our sight and among vs crucified: we speak openly in a known tongue and the people vnderstand vs: we pray vnto God to accept vs, and render him thankes for the worke of our redemption: lastly, we take the outward elementes and ioyne the word vnto them, and thus they are made to vs a sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay,</hi> if to offer vp to God, our selues, our soules, our bodies, our almes for the poore, our prayers and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuinges vnto God the father for our redemption, be an oblatiou and a sacrifice: We haue both a Sacrament and a sacrifice in our Churchés, though we offer not vp Christs body, to be a propitiatory sacrifice for the quicke and dead, vnto his father. We offer vp as much as <note n="s" place="margin">we offer vp as much as christ coman ded vs</note> Christ commaunded vs to offer: but that sacrifice was once offered vp vpon the Crosse: he wasthe priest, hee was the altar, he was the sacrifice, there is no other sacrifice left to be offered for sinne: and he which presumeth to offer him againe, is an enemy to the Crosse of Christ, treadeth the sonne of God vnder his foote, counteth the blood of the new Testament vnholy, and hath renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced saluation by Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now if we, cleaning precisely to the institution of Christ, doe not consecrate: what may be thought of the Popish priestes, who whisper their wordes closely, that no man heareth: vse a strange tongue, that no man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth: bring in pryuate Masses, whereat none communicate: deliuer dry Communions, wherein no man drinketh: exhorte no man, speake to no man: and if they doe consecrate, they consecrate onelye for themselues, and not for others.

                  </note> it is not void of a spirituall effect, it is not without grace and sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.

               <p>Againe, are these signes sanctified and consecrated, that are deliuered and receiued: then heereby wee learne, what <note place="margin">vse.</note> is to be thought of the remnants and leauings remaining after the Lordes Supper. For who seeth not heereby, that the bread and wine of the holy vse and lawfull participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appointed, are not a Sacrament? They differ nothing from common bread and wine sold in other places, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in our houses. Therfore, <note n="a" place="margin">Hosich. in leuit. lib. 2, c. 8</note> among diuerse, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was accustomably vsed to be burned; <note n="b" place="margin">Euagri, lib. 4 cap. 8 Niceph. lib. 17, cap 25</note> among some it was giuen to little children that were in the schooles; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, they did eate in the <note n="c" place="margin">hieron. com. in, <hi>1, Cor.

Indeede euery creature of God in it seife is good, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift is holy: yet if we partake them without praysing the name of the giuer and creator, to vs they become vnholy, vncleane, and vnpure.

We see, when one maketh a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to another, with wordes onely betweene themselues, he beginneth to doubt (to whome the promise is made) of


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16298:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the performance thereof: if he adde an oath for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the promise is more assuredly ratified: but if he giue his hande writing, and seale it to the party, the matter is made out of doubt. Thus we doe reason and helpe our faith. We haue the promises of God, wee haue the oath of God, we haue the wordes and writinges of God, we haue the seales and Sacramentes of God, these are not reserued in the Lords keeping, but are put into our owne handes to see them, to keepe them, to vse them for our comfort and assurance. I speake after the manner of men, if wee haue a free promise from an honest man, penned fairely in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ratified vnder his owne hand and seale, and all giuen vnto vs to locke and lay vp, we doubt not of the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Now, let vs consider the Lords doing, and see what hee hath done for vs: who is not as man, that <note n="r" place="margin">Num, 23. 19</note> he shoulde lie, nor as the sonne of man that he should deceiue. God sent his sonne <note n="s" place="margin">Gai. 4, 4</note> into the world to take our nature vpon him, to be like vs, <note n="t" place="margin">Heb 4. 15</note> euen in his infirmities, hee named himselfe <note n="u" place="margin">Math 1, 21</note> Iesus, that is, a Sauiour, because he shoulde saue his people from their sinnes: after his death he sent his Apostles to preach the glad tidings of remission of sinnes and euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saluation: he ordained his last supper immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death to testifie and assure them vnto vs, not onely by sounding them in our eares, but by beholding, tasting, smelling, feeling, and feeding to seale them in our hearts, and also daily to be repeated and ministred vnto vs. Seeing then, we haue both his promises and oath, his worde and writings, his seales and Sacramentes in our keeping, what would we haue more? He would not make halfe so much adoin assuring his promises, if he loued vs not: he would not set such authentike seals to his deede and obligations, vnlesse he ment good earnest. His bare worde and naked promise is verie good paiment: but he respecteth our weakenes, whose mercifull kindnesse must not be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through our vnthankefulnes.

Supper</note> now follow the inward parts to be considered. For in Sa. we must consider not what they be of themselues, but what <note n="b" place="margin">august. cont. maximin. li. 3.</note> they signifie vnto vs, These inward partes are foure in number, to wit, the father, the spirit, the body &amp; blood of christ, and the faithfull. All these haue a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall relation to the outwarde partes, and declare the inwarde truth of them. The actions of the minister, are notes of the actions of God the father: the word of institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made effectuall by the holy spirit: the breade and wine are signes and seales, representing the bodye and blood of Christ: the outward actions of euery receiuer, do note out the inwarde actions and spirituall workes of the faithfull. Thus then the agreement answeareth aptly, and the proportion falleth fully betweene the parts, <note n="c" place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t between the outward and inward partes</note> As the Minister by the words of institution, offereth vnto the communicants the bread and wine to feed thereupon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally and bodily: so GOD the Father, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit offereth and giueth the body and blood of CHRIST, to the faithfull receiuers to feede vppon them spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>Now then, let vs remember the sencible and externall actions of the Minister, that thereby we may consider the spirituall and inward actions of God the Father. And first of all, the taking of the bread and wine into his hands, and the consecrating or blessing of them by reapeating the promise, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16298:161"/>
meates and drinkes then by such as <note n="m" place="margin">Deut, 8, 3 Math 14, 4</note> God hath appointed to this purpose, <note n="n" place="margin">Ezek, 4, 13 Lenit, 26, 26</note> as a staffe to sustaine vs: so is the soule fed by no other meanes then God hath before ordained. The cause of our saluation is in the loue of God toward vs, which is notably represented by the taking &amp; blessing of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements. He might haue left vs to our selues, to work out our own destruction: but his mercy is greater then his iustice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by these outward actions of the minister, wee must seeke confirmation and strength of our faith, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured <note place="margin">vse. 3</note> that God the father tooke his sonne, and appointed him to these endes. We must not wander and gaze about, and thinke we haue nothing to do, but when we take and receiue the bread and the cup into our hands: we must in euery sacramentall rite consider the thinges signified, and ponder in our hearts the fitnesse and agreement betweene them both. So then, as we behold with our bodily eies the minister (representing the person of the father) taking, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and separating the bread and wine to that bodily vse: so surely and certainely we must learne that God the father hath ordained and sent his only begotten sonne, <note n="o" place="margin">Math. 17. 5 &amp; 3. xvii</note> in whom he is well pleased, to bee the meditator for the pardon of our sinnes. Hence we see the infinite loue of God toward vs: and let vs labor to comprehend <note n="p" place="margin">Eph, 3. xvi: i xix.</note> the length, bredth, height, and depth therof, that spared not <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 32.</note> his owne sonne, but gaue him for vs all vnto the death: hence we see, that exceeding compassion of the sonne, that loued his enemies more then himselfe, and accounted not his owne life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to himselfe: hence we see the gratious and glorious worke of our redemption, wherin the mercy and iustice of God <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 85, 10</note> meete together, and kisse each other, teaching vs to take sweete delight and comfort in the meditation thereof day and night withal thanksgiuing: hence wee haue assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of saluation and consolation in all troubles and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: hence we see the greatnesse of our owne sinnes that could not be pardoned, but by the death of the son of God, and therefore we must hate them with an vnfained hatred


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:16298:161"/>
as our greatest, most dangerous and deadly enemies: and lastly, hence wee see, that if God the father thus loued vs, we ought earnestly to loue him againe, and to serue him in all duties of holynesse and true righteousnes: neyther ought we to loue him onely, but for him all our brethren, as the Apostle reasoneth, <note n="s" place="margin">1 Iohn 4. xi</note> 
                  <hi>Brethren, if God so loued vs, wee ought to loue one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we haue shewed, how the taking of the bread by the minister, signifyeth the fathers appointing of his sonne: the ministers blessing, the fathers separating and setting a part his sonne to his office: the minsters deliuering of the bread, the fathers giuing of his sonne. If then wee drawe neere to the Lords table with faith, reuerence, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nothing can be more sure &amp; certain to vs, then the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; receiuing of Christ, for when we receiue the bred from the minister, we with all receiue the body of christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the hand of God the father.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the breaking of the breade, pouring out of the wine, and deliuering of them both into the handes of the <note place="margin">vse. 4.</note> communicants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> these actions of God, his chastising of his sonne, and breaking him with sorrowes vppon the crosse for our redemption, offering him vnto all, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hypocrites, and giuing him truely to the faithfull with all the benefits of his passion. Indeed, the minister giueth the outwarde signes to all receiuers; but God giueth and applyeth onely to the faithfull, the shedding of Christes blood for their daily increase of their faith and repentance. But heere it may be obiected, that not a bone of him was <note place="margin">Obiection</note> broken. <note n="t" place="margin">Exod. xii. 46</note> as it was figured by the passeouer, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at his passion: the verifieng and accomplishment whereof we read Iohn, 19. 36.

                  <hi>My God my god why hast thou for saken me.</hi> Wherefore let these rights be rightly marked and obserued of vs for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and consolation: Let vs, when we see the breade bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and wine poured out, meditat on the passion of christ howe hee was wounded and torne for our transgressions.

and to open our heartes to receiue the promises. This truth being cleared, the vses offer themselues to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. <note place="margin">vse. 1.</note> And first of all, inasmuch as the spirite worketh these things in the harts of all the faithfull, from hence we gather, that such as neuer finde any chaunge or renewing of the mind, or reformation of life after the receiuing of the Sacramentes, may iustly suspect themselues, whether euer they had faith or not, and whether ever they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or not: and therefore ought to vse the means to come by faith and repentance. For, the worke of the spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth the outward worke in the elect of God, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we see in the hearing of faith preached, hee must open the hart that is closed vppe, before wee can receiue with meekenes <note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 1, 21</note> the worde that is grafted in vs which is able to saue our soules.</p>
               <p>Indeed, euery person present may heare the wordes of institution, may see the Wine poured out, may eate of that bread and drinke of that cuppe, as they may also hear the sound of the voice that commeth vnto them: but the whole force, effect, and power resteth onely in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of GOD, sealinge vppe the truth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of those things in the harts of all the children of God.</p>
               <p>Againe seeing these thinges are done and performed by the working of the spirit: they are confuted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced, <note place="margin">vse. 2</note> that thinke they cannot be made partakers of the bodye and blood of Christ, and be vnited to his flesh, vnlesse his body be shut vp vnder the accidentes of bread and shewes of wine, and so his flesh be giuen vnto vs carnally, that we may eate him with our mouthes, and conuey him into our stomackes. But we see heere, the Holy-ghost is the bonde of this vnion, hee worketh in vs faith, which pierceth the heauens, and layeth hold on Christ. It is saide of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, that <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 8, 56</note> he reioiced to see the day of Christ, he sawe it and was gladde. For as we cannot see him with our bodily eies, nor hear him with our bodily ears nor touch him with our bodily hands: no more can we tast


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:16298:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or eat him with our bodily mouths. By the hand of faith, we reach and apply him: by the mouth of faith we receiue and eate him. Let vs beleeue in Christ, and we <note n="e" place="margin">aug. tract. in Iohn 26. &amp; 27</note> haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Christ: let vs not prepare our teeth and our belly, but a liuely faith working by loue. Wherefore, albeit the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Christ goe not out of the highest heauens: yet we that liue vpon the earth are partakers of his bodye contained in the heauens, and his flesh and blood are communicated to vs as truely and effectually, as if he were <note place="margin">Obiection</note> there on the present with vs. If any say, How can this bee? can that which is absent from vs, be present with vs? can <note place="margin">Answer.</note> heauen be in earth, or earth bee in heauen? He ere vnto I may moste iustlye aunsweare, although this bee a great mistery and marueilous in our eyes, yet we must confesse and consider, that the Holy-ghost is the author of this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and as it were the conduit-pipe of this coniunction, who by his diuine power ioyneth togither things that are seuered in place, and begetteth faith in vs, which is the instrumenr and hande, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Ioh. 17, 20</note> whereby we receiue and applye Christ with all his gifts vnto our selues, as <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. <hi>Father, I pray thee for such as shall beleeue in mee, that they may be one, as thou O father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in vs.</hi> He ereunto commeth the saying of Paule, Ephe, 3. <hi>Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith.</hi> Like wise Act, 13. <hi>Byhim euery one that beleeueth, is iustified, that is, absolued and discharged,</hi> And <hi>Iohn 3. so many as beleeue in him, shall not perish, but haue euerlasting life.</hi> Thus we see our fellowship with christ, is from the spirit, and by our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We need not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any carnall and bodily presence of Christ to ioyne vs to him, seeing it is truely and certainely perfourmed by these meanes, whereby we grow to a perfect man in him. For, as the Sunne is more comfortable to the world by his refreshing beames and sweete influence being absent, then if his naturall body and compasle lay vpon the earth: so the flesh of christ being in the glory of his father, much more comforteth and refresheth our soules and bodies by his heauenly grace and spirituall influence, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Eleuenthly, if Christ be present in the Sacramant bodily and carnally: in what body shall he be present? Whether in his glorified body as he is in the heauens, or in his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body as he was vpon the earth? In one of these he must be present necessarily, if he be present fleshly. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they answer, they are taken onboth hands, &amp; are stroken downe as with a sword that hath two edges. Dare they saie he is thus present in his mortall bodie? This cannot be. For it is certaine, he hath not now a mortall bodie, but a glorified bodie: this corruptible hath put on in corruption, <note n="t" place="margin">1 cor. xv, 54</note> this mortall hath put on immortality, and death is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in victory. This the <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 6, 9, x</note> Apostle confirmeth, this the Scripture teacheth, this Christian faith beleeueh. Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more dominion ouer him: <hi>For in that he dyed, he dyed once to sinne, but in that he liueth, he liueth to God</hi> Like wise Heb. 7. 25 <hi>This man because he endureth euer, hath a priesthood which cannot passe from one to another, seeing he euer hueth to make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them.</hi> And chapter 9. of the same Epistle, <hi>he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into heauen, not that he should offer himselfe often, but he was once offered to take away the sins of many.</hi> These testimonies du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, he cannot be present in a mortal body. What then, will they be helped, to say he is present in his glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body? Then, he cannot nowe be present in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the supper, as he was present to the Apostles, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the table with them, and preaching vnto them of his death: he cannot be present in the same body that he did deliuer to his Disciples in the institution of his last supper. For the body of Christ was then mortall and not glorified, then he had not suffered death vpon the Crosle, he was not risen and ascended into the heauens, to sit at the right hand of his father: so that they must seeke another place then these wordes of Christ, <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 26, 26</note>

Besides, what a uniserable glorified body should this be, to be subiect to

the pleasure of euery priest, to come at his call, to stay till he commandeth, nay to suffer himselfe to be torne with the teeth of euery receiuer?

This lesuitical denise hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reason, but a tricke of euasion. For we speak not of the difference betweene Christs glorified and mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but of the meaning of the wordes this is my body: whether Christ vnderstand his naturall and mortall bodie wherein shortly he was to be glorified, or whether he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of his body glorified? Either it must bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the one, or of the other, or of both: or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of neither, except they wil haue the words taken and spoken one way to the Disciples, and another way to vs. Thus, the meaning of them when they were first vttered, shoulde be, <hi>This is my mortall body:</hi> but nowe spoken to vs, taken in another sence of vs to the end of the worlde, <hi>This is my glorified body.</hi> So then, the same words spoken to the Disciples should be false as we are to vnderstand them: and the disciples shoulde be deceiued, vnderstanding them as we do take them. What is this, but to bring vs back againe to the reproachfull comparisons and blasphemous asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note n="d" place="margin">Pighi.

These things before being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considred, we may safely conclude, that christ is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in his naturall body.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the presence of christ in his naturall body, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth the light of reason, and confoundeth the nature of

               <p>Now, as by these reasons and sundry other that might be alledged, the reall presence is sufficiently convinced: so the arguments brought to maintaine and vphold it, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily <note n="e" place="margin">Obiections alledged to maintain the real presence are answered</note> answeared.

               <p>Thirdly, they obiect the omnipotency, of God: that he is able to turne the bread into the body, and the Wine into his blood: he is able to make it really present in heauen and earth, and wheresoeuer Masse is said: he is able to make a body to be in many places at once, and yet not occupy a place. I answer, when all other reasons faile, they flye to gods omnipotency as vnto a sanctuary and place of refuge. But this will not proue a reall presence. For albeit God be omnipotent and almighty: must he therefore do al things, yea offer violence to his owne body, to maintaine their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and hereticall opinions of the reall presence and of transubstantiation? Must his power attend vpon their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and dreames? Cannot he be omnipotent, except their positions and assertions be graunted?

known: for God is not contrary to himselfe. Now then, it is not enough to proue that God can turne bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, vnlesse they proue he will turne them into his flesh and blood. We our selues can do many things, which we do not, and which we will not do: so we must know, it is with God, he could haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded winges to man, he might haue made many worlds, if it had pleased him.

For, if christs body be visible, how can it be inuisible? If it haue al the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perties of a naturalbody, how can it be without the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a natural body? If it be finite how can it be infinite? Lastly, if it be an inseparable &amp; necessary adioynt to a true body to be contained in one certaine place: how then can it be true, that his body is in ten thousand places without any circumscription?

For, is Christ the chiefe substance of this sacrament, and his body and blood giuen vs for the foode of our soules: a gift farre aboue heauen and earth? Then we are bound to hunger after him, to desire him with an earnest appetite and desire, as wee come to our meate and drinke. Hunger is a great thing, and we say it maketh men leape ouer a stone wall: he that is hunger bitten, will eate his owne flesh from his armes. In this corporall hunger then are two thinges that pine and pinch men: first, a paine in the lower part of the belly, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from emptinesse: secondly, an exceeding appetite to be filled and satisfied: such haue <note n="t" place="margin">Deut, 28, 53 57</note> killed, dressed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourd their own childen, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would starue: this paine hath beene so great, this longing hath beene so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. So must it be with vs in the spirituall hunger <note place="margin">2 King 6. 29 Lam. 4. 10</note> after Christ: we must be inwardly pained in soule for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer commeth to his ordinary meate without hunger, it were better not to eate: it ingendreh grosse and euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, aud bringeth a surfet to the body. So, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer desireth not christ with an hungry soule, earnestly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him, and crauing nourishment from him, cannot be filled with good thinges. The want of this hunger, is a

cause why so few receiue Christ, and profit not by the meanes ordained to that end, as the word and sacraments: these come to them of custome rather then with consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and for fashion rather then with faith: these men are not fit to be Christes ghuests, that hunger not after him.

But as you snatch after the leaues of the tree, and let go the fruit, want the profit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: so is it among many men in this worlde, who take the signe of Christ, but let goe Christ. Nowe, as <hi>Moses</hi> intreating of thinges <note n="e" place="margin">Leuit. 11, 4</note> cleane and vncleane, noteth out foure sorts of beasts, some onely chew the cud, and some onely diuide the hoofe, some neither chew the cudde nor diuide the hoofe, and some both chew the cud &amp; diuide the hoofe: or, as in the dayes of the Gospell, some were circumcised in heart not in flesh, <note n="f" place="margin">Gal, 2. 3</note> as <hi>Titus:</hi> some were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in the flesh not in the hart, as <hi>Iudas:</hi> some were circumcised neither in flesh nor in the spirit, <note n="g" place="margin">Bph, 2, 11</note> as the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and some were circumcised both in the flesh and in the spirit, <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 16. 3</note> as <hi>Timothy:</hi> so is there a difference among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, <note n="i" place="margin">

For the spirituall grace is not of necessitie tied to the outward signes, as if without them God cannot or doth not sometimes bestow the same.

                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company was sealed with the spirit of God before the receiuing of the outwarde sacrament. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise being stronge in faith, <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 4. 18, 10, 18</note> and vnder hope belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aboue hope before circumcision was giuen vnto him.</p>

               <p>Againe, other receiue christ onely sacramentally and not spiritually, who are partakers of the outwarde Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread and wine, and so receiue the bare signes of the body and blood of Christ.

Sixtly, we are charged to try and <note n="p" place="margin">2 cor. 13, 5</note> proue our owne hartes, whether Christ be in vs or not, that thereby we may discerne of our estate and standing in the faith, 2 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Lastly, the Apostle chargeth the Church of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> not to eate things sacrificed to idols in <note n="q" place="margin">1 cor.

Thus they make a deuorcement and a separation between Christ and his sauing graces, which can neuer be parted and deuided. For whosoeuer receiueth Christ, pertaketh the merits and graces of christe: and whosoeuer enioyeth the graces of christ, imbraceth withall christ himselfe. Besides, if christ be the signe, and the sanctifying graces of Christ the thing fignified according to the rule of the church of Rome: what shall we say of the accidents and shewes of bread and wine, whereunto shall they be reduced? what parte shall they act and play in this comedy? wherefore we hold it as a strong trueth, which we haue euinced by sundrie reasons, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are not made partakers of christ.</p>

For, we take the bread into our hands, and likewise we take the cup into our hands as christ commaunded, saying, <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26</note>

So christ, being eaten of the Godly by faith, is vnited to them by his spirit (as we haue shewed before) whereby they are made one with christ and he one with them. And as meate plentifully prepared, daintily dressed, and only seene vpon the table, doth not nourish the body, or take away hunger: so, if the gospell be preached and the sacraments admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, except we apply the promises of the gospel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that christ withal his gifts is ours, they prosit nothing towards our saluation.

As Christ, in the daies of his flesh, had a dubble kindred, one earthly and carnal kindred, the other spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that by faith receiued his worde, and beleeued in his name, of whom he said, <note n="f" place="margin">Math. xii, 44</note> 
                  <hi>Behold my mother and my Brethren; for whosoeuer shall do my fathers will, which is in heauen, the same is my brother, sister, and mother:</hi> so is it in this vnió and felloship with him, one is outward and bodily, which al mankinde hath with him, in that he is partaker of our flesh and blood, the other inward and spirituall, whereby we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of him and of al his sauing graces to euerlasting life. As Christ was borne of the Virgin Mary, and vnited our nature to him, taking vpon him, <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 2, 16</note> not the Angels nature, but the seed of Abraham, euery reprobate hath this vnion with him, in that he tooke vpon him the shape of a man: but there is a mysticall and marueilous vnion, whereby he dwelleth in vs by faith, whereby we are truely coupled to him, made partakers of him, deliuered from sin, and made heires of euerlasting life, quickning and sustaining vs, as food which preserueth the life of the bodie. If the arme ioined to the body haue no life, no sence, no benefit of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall spirits, it is no part of the bodie, though it be vnited to it: so the wicked liuing without faith, are as it were sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, they haue no forgiuenes of sinnes, no sanctification, no saluation, and therefore are no true members of Christ. If he poure not life and grace into them, they are not his members: if he kill not sinne in them, they are not vnited spirituallie vnto him, The bodily vnion with him, shall profit nothing: it is the spirit that giueth life.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the receiuing of the bread and wine which <note place="margin">Vse. 1</note> turne into our substaunce, teacheth the misticall vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and his members: we learne first from hence, that all the faithfull and godly are truly made partakers of


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:16298:183"/>
Christ and his graces, as the members receiue life from the head, and the tree moisture from the root. For, euen as the wife ioyned to her husband in marriage, is thereby made partaker of his body and goods, hath interrest with him in the commodities of this life, <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 20, 16</note> and loketh for norishment, food, fellowship, protection, and gouernement from him: so, being made one with christ, we are indued with his he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gifts and blessings. This must be our comfort in all dangers and tentations, in all tryals and assaults, to consider that we are one with christ, we are not only dear vnto him, but nearely ioyned with him, as members to the head, as the wife to the husband, and as the braunches to the vine, and therefore can neuer be seperated from him in life or death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this streight vniting of the faithfull to Christ, sheweth that the vngodly haue no part nor fellowship in <note place="margin">vse. 2</note> him and with his graces: though they be ioyned to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the same nature, and haue many common gifts of knowledge, and vnderstanding, yet Christ neuer dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in them with his sauing graces and with his spirite of sanctification, he possesseth not their harts, he worketh not in them a particular perswasion of their reconciltation to God, neither an hungring desire, aboue all things to bee at vnity and peace with him, neyther a distaste and dislike of sinne, neyther the comfortable spirite of grace and prayer: all which are in some measure in all the saithful. Wherfore, although they may bee cloathed with the flesh of Christ, they cannot be said to be couered with the grace of Christ: although they be like vnto him in regarde of this naturall body: yet they are not indued with his heauenly spirit, they haue many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. For the whole fruit of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment standeth in the right partaking thereof. The right manner standeth in preparing ourselues to come, and in examining ourselues before we come. No great thing can bee done well, without good care and endeuour. In all humane <note n="b" place="margin">Cicer. de offic. lib. 1</note> things of any importance, nothing is attempted or atchiued without some preparation more or lesse going before, according to the nature of the matter. Before men sit downe to eat or drinke their ordinary food, before they sleepe, before they wash, before they walke, before they work, some preparation goeth before. Before <note n="c" place="margin">Ierem. 4, 4</note> the ground is tilled, it is prpared. Before the <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 19, 10</note> law was deliuered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saboth was sanctified, before the sacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, before the Passeouer was killed, before the worde was receiued, before prayers were vttered, the heart was in some sort prepard. One of the greatest duties required of vs, is to dy well: whereunto all our life should be a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and euery day should be a meditation of death, that we may not be found vnready and vnprepared <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 25, 13</note> when the bridegroome shall come. So the Supper of the Lord being an excellent misterie and the food of our soules, whereby we receiue Christs body and blood: there is required of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, a trying, prouing, and examining themselues, least, seeking comfort by their comming, they bring vpon themselues iudgement through want of preparing. This trueth deliuered, hath the witnesse and consent <note n="p" place="margin">2 Chr. 35. 6</note> of many Scriptures for the confirmation thereof. The Prophet 2. Chron. 35. saith, <hi>Kill the passeouer, and sanctifie your selues, and prepare your Brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</hi> And the holy man Iob, when the daies of the banketting of his children were gone about, <hi>sent and sanctified them, and rose vp earely in the morning, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered burnt offerings according to the number of them all.</hi> Also the wiseman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of fooles, for they know not that they do euill.</hi> Likewise the prophet Ieremy, Lament. 3. <hi>Wherefore is the liuing man sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull? Man suffereth for his sinne: let vs search and try our waies, and turne againe to the Lord.</hi> To the same purpose the prophet Dauid saith, Psal. 4. <hi>Tremble and sinne not, examine your owne heart vpon your bed and be still:</hi> and Psal. 119. <hi>I haue considered my waies, and turned my feete into thy testimonies.</hi> The Apostle Paule is very direct in this point, as Gal. 6. 4. <hi>Let euery man proue his owne worke: and then shall he haue reioycing in himselfe onely, and not in any other.</hi> Also 1 Cor 11. <hi>Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup:</hi> where he speaketh of purpose of the Lordes Supper. So then, it is a duty required of all persons that come to the Lordes Table, or any other exercise of religion, to search their owne heartes and consciences narrowly, how they bee affected and disposed touching the discharge of this duty.</p>
               <p>And if wee would farther consider the necessity of this examination: we fhould finde it standeth vpon many suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <note n="g" place="margin">Reasons of this duty of Examination</note> reasons and causes as vpon certaine foundations that cannot be remoued.

Consider with me a little our own practise. We will not put our ordinary meates in a dish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washed, nor our common drinks into a cup vnclensed: and shall we put the signes of bread and Wine which are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen instruments to conueigh Christ vnto vs, into vnsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied soules, vnprepared heartes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the signes of the times?</hi> And if that vpper chamber, wher the supper was first administred, were trimmed and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: should not our hearts be prepared, into the which it is receiued? Shall Christ himselfe offer to come into our houses: and shal not we sanctifie our harts to entertain such a ghest? This were to great carelesnesse and contempt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, waigh with me the profit that commeth to our selues to moue vs to this examination. The comfort is great, the fruite is excellent, the benifit is vnspeakeable to those that partake the mystery of the Supper worthily, they receiue christ, they receiue remission of sinnes, they receiue saluation, they receiue assurance of eternall life. For, if the woman diseased <note n="k" place="margin">Math 9, 20</note> with an yssue of blood, loe twelue yeare, comming behind Christ and touched onely the hemme of his garment, was made whole: then assuredly the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all receiuing of the body and blood of christ shal not bring lesse profit, if the faith be equall, which notwithstanding is wholly lost without preparation. Ponder with me also how by neglect of this triall of our selues, not onely this profit is lost, but the Sacrament it selfe is after a sort defiled. For, howsoeuer it be in it selfe by the ordinance of God an holy and heauenly banket, yet to the vngodly, vnregenerate, and vnsanctified, it becommeth vnholy and wholly earthly, <note n="l" place="margin">Hag. 2, 14</note> as the prophet Haggai teacheth, Chapter 2. <hi>If a polluted person touch an holy thing, it shall be vncleane.</hi> The person must be holy that will haue sound profit by the holy thinges of God: the man that is vnholy, defileth every thing he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the polluted Person polluteth all thinges. For as, to <note n="m" place="margin">Tit. 1, i5</note> the pure all thinges are pure, but vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing is nothing pure, but euen their mindes and consciences are corrupted: so the prophane Person defileth all thinges, and turneth wholesome meate into noysome poyson.

Not that he is carnally and bodily present, but because the reproache which is vsed in the signes, toucheth the bodie and bloode of Christ signified by them.

a difference between baptisme and the lords supper. For baptisme is due to the whole church, and euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, whether old or young, to all infants, who are the children of faithful parents, that haue giuen their names to Christ, and are entred into the profession of the Gospell. And howsoeuer confession of faith &amp; fruits of repentance, are required of the elder sorte, (as wee haue shewed) yet touching infants it is susficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t if they be born in the church, of such as are members of the church. But the Supper of the Lord belongeth only to such as are able to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to try their owne harts, and to remember his death, which things cannot agree with children. As we see in the passe-ouer, not all the children of the faithfull were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto: but onely such as could enquire and require a reason thereof, <note n="b" place="margin">Exod, 12 26</note> and did desire to be instructed of their parents, and such as had learned to make the law a frontlet before their eies, and a signe vpon their hands, that so the doctrine of God might not depait out of their mouths.

                     </gap> de Euchar.</note> we shall plainely see the truth of this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. For, in Baptisme the action of the minister is to wash the body with water, which requireth not discretion in him that is to be baptized, fo rasmuch as we can clense and wash the things that are without reason, without vnderstanding, without sense, and without life. But in the sacrament of the supper, a reuerent giuing, an attentiue hearing, a certaine vnderstanding of that which is spoken, a wise receiuing and eating, and a carefull considering of whom to take, and what to take is required into the outward work: how much greater iudgement is required, to know that God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giueth the body and blood of his sonne to be receiued by faith? Thus then, this examination maketh a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene both the sacramentes of the new testament, and sheweth, that it is not necessary to the saluation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that they com to the Lords table.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, seeing no man must presume to come thither without a serious examination of himselfe: it <note n="d" place="margin">Fiue sorts of persons bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the lords supper</note> debarreth


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:16298:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Lords supper fiue sorts of persons, to wit, children, furious and mad men, ignorant persons, prophane persons, and all sorts of insidels. First of all, if there be a necessity of searching and trying our selues, it excludeth all infants and children in age, who vnderstand not what the holy spirit speaketh in this Sacrament, what God the father offereth, what the Sonne performeth, and what faith receiueth, they know not what it is to eate christ spiritually, and to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by him effectually. Secondly, all foolish, furious, and mad men, being such as want the vse of naturally gifts of reason, wit, descretion and iudgement, the defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whatsoeuer they are in age and yeares, maketh them as children in gifts, not being able to examine themselues, are to be separated. Thirdlyly, howsoeuer many haue yeares of discretion, and the common vse of naturall gifts of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: yet, if they neither haue the knowledge of God, nor the knowledge of themselues, nor the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the doctrine of the Sacramentes, and other funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of religion, they are not to be admitted but refused.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if they haue all these things, and want neither ripenesse of age, nor yeares of discretion, nor vse of reason, nor knowledge of the doctrine which is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse: yet if they remaine prophane, vngodly, vnrepentant, stubborne, malicious, reuenging, open contemners of God, of godlinesse, and of his word, idolaters, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, blasphemers, drunkards, and such in whom appeareth no amendment of life, these and such like are not interessed in this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it excludeth and shutteth out all such as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world, all <hi>Atheists, Insidels, Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Heretikes,</hi> all such as haue not yealded themselues to the Church of GOD, and haue not made profession, of their faith, and such as are worthily excommunicated from the Church by the power of the keies: Whereby we see, that al infants and children that want years, all furious and foolish persons that want the vse of reason, all blind and ignorant


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:16298:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
persons, that want the knowledge of God and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, all vnrepentant persons that bring not with them faith and repentance, all infidels and vnbeleeuers with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are out of the bosome of the church, are to bee kept backe from this Supper, being such as either cannot or will not submit themselues to this holy necessary duty of examination, thereby hauing no right or title to come to his table. For such as haue not the church to be their mother, cannot be nourished with this meate of the church, to wit, the Supper of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if all persons are to prepare themselues to this Sacrament: then none are willingly and wilfully to abstain <note place="margin">vse. 4</note> and refraine from comming vnto it. For as such sinne grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously, who present themselues vnworthily to this blessed communion: so do they greatly offend on the other side, that ofset purpose absent themselues from this spirituall banket prouided for them. God is dishonored both these waies, as well by receiuing vnreuerently, as by abstayning carelesly from this Sacrament. For he lyeth vnder an heauy <note n="e" place="margin">Ier. 48, 10</note> curse deseruedly, that doth any of the Lords works neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently. Euen as the patient, which being sicke maketh no account of the dyet which the Physition hath prescribed, is no lesse blame worthy, then he that abuseth it disorderly, in as much as both sorts do it oftentimes to their danger and destruction: so is he no lesse faulty, that maketh that recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the receit which the chiefe Physition of our soules the Lord Iesus hath appointed, then he that misuseth and misapplyeth the same, because both do it with great perill and hazzard to themselues. We know that such, as, being bidden <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 22, 7</note> by the King to the wedding of his Sonne, made light of it and refused to come, were destroyed as wel as he that, came without his wedding garment. We know when the word of God is preached, which is <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 1, 16</note> the power of God to saluation to all that beleeue, such as absent themselues from the hearing of it, perish iustly, as wel as they that come without faith and repentance. We know when the passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was celebrated, such persons as were negligent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue


<pb n="350" facs="tcp:16298:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and keepe the same according to all that the Lord had commanded <hi>Moses,</hi> were to be cut off from his people, <note n="h" place="margin">Num. 9, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Because they brought not the offering of the Lord in his due season, they shal be are their sin.</hi> In like manner such as neglect to come to this communion, and abstaine from it, for feare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating vnworthily, depriue themselues of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And this is the very cut-throat of al godlines and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For why doe they not, by like proportion of reason, refrain from inuocation and calling vpon the name of god, for feare of praying amisse? And why may they not absent themselues from hearing the word of God, fearing to hear amisse? So that if this pretence were a lawful warrant to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from the Lords Supper for feare of vnworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, we might bid all godlines farewel, in asmuch as it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth a gap for men to abstaine from performing all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety and godlines. Wherfore, let not such persons flatter themselues with vaine excuses and lying words that cannot profit, neither daube with vntempered morter, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we are vnworthy, we cannot come: rather let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to shake off their vnworthines, and to cast away <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 12, 1</note> euery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing that presseth down, and the sin that hangethso fast on, that so they may be worthy receiuers. Let them not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the commaundement of christ which saith, <hi>take ye, eate ye, do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Christ hath commanded, we must obey: he saith, come: shall we be so vnthankfull to say, we will not come? He calleth, shall we not answer? He biddeth his ghests, shall we make excuses? He sendeth his messengers and prepareth his feast, shall we not prouide and prepare to eate thereof? He offereth himselfe vnto vs, shall we contemne the blessed remembrance of his death and passion, euen the price of our redemption, and shut our selues from the communion which the faithfull haue with him and one with another? So that wee are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our owne hearts, that God is prouoked to anger, as well by negligence in abstaining, as by vnworthinesse in receiuing the Supper.</p>

               <p>AS we haue waighed the necessity of preparing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining our selues: so let vs consider the manner how it is to be performed. Such as will in an holy manner prepare themselues <note n="a" place="margin">Four points required in examination of our selues.</note> to celebrate the Lords Supper to the glory of God and comfort of their owne soules, must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently acquaint themselues with these 4. pointes, with knowledge, faith, repentance, and reconciliation to those whom they haue offended. It is required of all persons that come to this Sacrament, to know the grounds of religion, and vnderstande the doctrine of the sacramentes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to beleeue in christ, and to looke for saluation in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, inasmuch as there is no other name vnder heauen by which we must be saued. So then we must come with faith, which is the hand to apprehend christ. Thirdly, to abhorre and detest our sins, to hate them with an vnfained hatred as our deadly and most dangerous enemies, and to haue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow for them which may cause repentance not to be repented off. Lastly, to loue our bretheren truely and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerly, yea euen our enemies. If we find not these things in our selues, we must carefully vse al holy meanes appointed for this purpose, to begin them in vs: otherwise our estate will proue to be fearefull and dangerous. We must with al sincerity, conscience, and zcale, vse prayer, the word read and preached, conference, meditation, and such like helpes as may further them in vs. If we do find them in vs, though feeble and in great want and weakenesse, we are not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from the sacrment, but to come thereunto to seeke strength of faith &amp; encrease of obedience. Wherfore, <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 11, 28</note> our sauiour calleth such vnto him, <hi>come to me all ye that are weary and sore laden, and I will ease you: take my yoke on you, and ye shall find rest vpon your soules: for my yoake is easie, and my burden is light.</hi> And Chap, 12. <hi>A brused</hi>

                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:16298:191"/>
Touching the first, we are to obserue, <note n="d" place="margin">The 1. part of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of gods word.</note> that such as wil come aright to the lords Supper, must haue the knowledge of Gods word, which is the foundation and ground-work of faith. We must know what to beleeue, and must learne the doctrine of saluation out of the Scripture. Our Sauiour Christ, in that heauenly prayer which he made a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his passion, vseth these words to his father, <note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 17, 3</note> 
                  <hi>This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life to know thee to be the onely very God and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ.</hi> We must know how miserable all men are of themselues, that we are seperated from God, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath by nature as wel as others, and the very fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of hel. They that want this knoledge, cannot iudge aright of the partes and vses of this Sacrament, nor desire this heavenly meate which nourisheth to eternall life. So then, knowledge must necessarily go before faith: for it is the nature of faith to beleeue that which it knoweth, and therefore where there is small knowledge, there is a little faith: and where there is no knowledg, ther can be no faith: according <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 10, 17</note> to the doctrine of the Apostle Roman. 10. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge required of vs when we approach to this Sacrament, standeth in these two <note n="g" place="margin">What parti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cular pointes are necessary to be known of al that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> pointes: first in the knowledge of God, Secondly in the knowledge of our selues. In these two braunches standeth the first part of examinarion. And these two pointes are so neerely ioyned and knit together, that no man can throroughly know God, vnlesse he know himselfe: and no man can haue the perfect knowledge of himselfe, except he know God in whom <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 17, 28</note> he liueth, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and hath his being. Vnder these two heads, many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points are containd, necessary to be known of those that offer themselues to bee partakers of this sacrament. First, that there is onely one God, that hath made himselfe knowne in three persons, <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 5, 7</note> the Father, the sonne, and the Holy-ghost: Secondly, that God made man and all other creatures good, and gouerneth all thinges well: Thirdly, man did fall through the entisement of the Deuill, and his own wilful disobedience in breaking the commandements


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:16298:191"/>
of God: Fourthly there are ten commaundements diuided into two tables: where of the foure first commaundements concern our duties to God, the sixe last our dutyes toward our neighbour: Fiftly, we cannot keepe these commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor any one of them, but we breake them daily, in motion, in thought, in worde, and in deede: the breache where of deserueth <note n="k" place="margin">Deut 27, 26</note> the cursse of God, that is, all mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this life, death in the ende of this life, and Hell fire after this life: Sixtly, there is no meanes or remedy in our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues or in any creature, but onely in Iesus Christ the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal son of god, <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 1, 35</note> who is god &amp; man: God, that he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercom death: and man, that he might die for our sins. He hath pacified gods wrath, fulfild the righteousnes of that law, sanctified our nature, adopted vs to be the children of god, and maketh our duties (though weake) acceptable to his father. Seuenthly, all haue not deliuerance by him, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as beleue in Christ, <note n="m" place="margin">1 cor. 1, 30</note> whose obedience and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes is made ours by a liuely faith, whereby we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that through him our sinnes are forgiuen, and wee made the children of God: Eightly, faith is a gifte of God applying Christ and al his merits particularly to our selues, and teaching that he is a Sauiour vnto vs. Ninthly, beeing saued by christ thrugh faith, <note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 1, 74</note> we may not liue as we list: this vnspeakeable mercy teacheth vs to deny all vngodlinesse, and all worldly and sinfulllusts, to to liue soberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and godly in this present euill world, and to walk in newnes of life, <note n="o" place="margin">Ephe. 6, 5</note> because no vnrighteous person shal enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Tenthly this faith which bringeth forth a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med life, is wrought in our heartes by the Holy-ghoaste through the preaching of the word, being truely expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and profitably applyed with doctrin, confutation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, correction, reformation, and consolation: and it is encreased besides, by reading, praying, and receiuing of the sacraments. Eleuenthly touching prayer, we haue a perfect platforme left vs <note n="q" place="margin">Matth 6, 9</note> by Christ in the Gospell, which containeth sixe petitions, the three firste concerning the


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16298:192"/>
glorie of God, and the three last concerning the necessities of our owne bodies and soules, 12. the sacraments are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other help to strengthen and increase faith, which are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes and seales ordained of God, to assure vs that Christ&amp; all his sauing graces are giuen vnto vs. These are two in number. Baptisme, the Sacrament of our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and new birth, assureth vs by the washing of water, that our sins are for giuen by the blood of Christ, and wee borne a new to god. The Lords supper assureth vs, that by bread and wine giuen and receiued according to gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, Christ is giuen vs to be our spirituall norishment to euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>These grounds of religion must be knowne and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that we may learne how wretched and miserable we are by nature, and what remedy god hath ordained for our deliuerance. We shall neuer feel the sweetnes of gods mercy, vntill we find the greatnes of our owne misery. We cannot perceiue how greatly we stand in neede of Christ, vntil we knowe our owne woful and wretched estate by reason of sin. Such then as are ignorant in these necessary points of christian religion, and especially in the doctrin of both the sacraments, can neuer come aright vnto them, can neuer shew forth the Lords death, can neuer discerne his body, but blindly run on to the daunger of their owne soules. Wherefore it standeth all men vpon, to desire the sincere milke of the word <note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 1, 2</note> that they may grow thereby, to seeke after knowledge, as for siluer, and after vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as precious stones. A loathing stomack neuer wol digesteth the meat that is put into it: and he that is ful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the Hony combe. What is the reason, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine blind in the matters of god and their owne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as bruit Beastes in vnderstanding? Surely, because they desire not the waies of god, they regard not his fear, they contemne knowledge, as <hi>Esau</hi> did the blessing, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> did their <hi>Manna.</hi> For no man truely desired the knowledge of god and of godlines vn sainedly, but he had the meanes offred vnto him at one time or other. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>

Wherefore, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of vs, not onely to haue knowledge and vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the mistery of our redemption: but likewise a iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng faith, <note n="e" place="margin">What a true faith is</note> which is a wonderfull gift of God, whereby the elect doe apply Christ and the sauing promises of the Gospell to themselues particularly.

all sufficiency and ability is in him to saue vs, whereuppon we shall feele a sweet and comfortable resting vpon him, in whom God meaneth to saue vs. These are the handes whereby we apply Christ to our selues both by knowinge himselfe for our sins according to the will of God euen our father, and by relying on his al-sufficiency to perform that high worke of redemption, whereunto he was sealed and ordained.</p>
               <p>This faith is not borne and bred with vs, but is wrought in vs by the Holy-ghost, <note n="h" place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 2</note> who is therefore called the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of faith. Except he giue it, no man can haue it: it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to vs to presume on the one side, and to dispaire on the other side: but to beleeue (which is seated in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest) is supernaturall. To haue a dead faith commeth of our selues: but to haue a liuely faith, proceedeth from God, to whom we ascribe all praise and glory. Now the proper office and function of this iustifying faith standeth in apprehending, receiuing, and laying hold vppon Christ and all his benefits. Euen as the hand stretched forth, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold vpon a thing, and pulleth the same vnto it: so doth saith apply the sauing promises of the Gospell to the soule, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Gal. 3.

               </p>
               <p>It is the hardest thing in the worlde thus to beleeue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we respect Christ or our selues. It is an easie matter for a man, when he neither knoweth nor feeleth the burden of sin, to say he hath faith, and beleeueth in gods mercy: but when Satan shall fift him, when his owne hart shall accuse him, when sinne shall he heauy vpon his soule, when the vnsupportable and vnsufferable anger of God shall presse his conscience to the nethermost hell, and the flame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of consume his bones and turne his moisture <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 32, 4</note> into the drought of Summer: if then he can stand vpright, and build himselfe <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 7, 24</note> vpon the rock, when the floods come, when the winds blow and beat vpon his house, and when the ground shaketh vnder his feet, this man with boldnesse and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may truely say, and seale it vppe for an euerlasting truth, <hi>My sinnes are forgiuen me.</hi> For if then he can comfort himselfe in his God, and apply his gratious mercies to his owne fainting hart, and cry out <note n="r" place="margin">Iob. 13, 15</note>

               <p>This appeareth euidently vnto vs in the example of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <note n="s" place="margin">Roma 4, 17 &amp;c.</note> who beleeued that of his old, weake, withered, and as it were dead body, should spring children <note n="t" place="margin">Genes. 15, 5</note> like the sande on the sea-shore, and like the starres of heauen for multitude, and that he should haue a seede in whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and all the nations of the world should be blessed.

The weake faith, <note n="i" place="margin">what a weak faith is</note> is an earnest and vnfained desire to be reconciled vnto GOD in christ, which willing desire in vs GOD accepteth as the deede it selfe: hee accounteth the defire of faith as faith it selfe: the desire of reconciliation and forgiuenesse of sinnes by the death of CHRIST, shall be auaileable to worke out our attonement and redemption. The stronge faith is a full perswasion and assurance <note n="k" place="margin">What a stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g faith is.</note> of the mercyes of GOD, when the faithful can truely say with the Apostle. <note n="l" place="margin">Roma. 8, 38</note> Rom. 8 38. 39. <hi>I am perswaded that neither life nor death, nor thinges present nor thinges to come, neither Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, neither height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall separate vs from the loue of GOD which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the greatest measure and highest degree of faith: this is the top, strength, and full ripenesse of faith: heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wee are to striue and indeuour, and neuer to giue rest vnto our soules, vntill wee bee resouled and setled in our consciences, that all our sinnes are assuredly pardoned, and wee accepted to euerlasting life.

So is it with euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Man and Woman, first they are babes in Christ, and haue certaine seedes and beginnings of faith springing in them to eternall life: afterward they grow from strength to strength, from grace to grace, from degree to degree, <note n="p" place="margin">Rom 1, 17</note> and from faith to faith, vntill they come to a full perswasion and assurance without wauering, <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 23, 6</note> which ariseth after many experiences of Gods' manifold mercies and fauours in the course of our liues, as we see Psal. 23. <hi>Doubtlesse kindnesse and mercy shall follow me all the daies of my life, and I shall remaine a long season in the house of the Lord.</hi> Wherefore, let vs not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So our sauiour, when the <note n="u" place="margin">Luke. 17, 5, 6</note> Disciples had asked increase of their faith, declareth that if our faith be in quantity but as a graine of mustard-seede, it should be powerfull and effectuall, seeing he will not <note n="a" place="margin">Mark 2, 23</note> quench the smooking flaxe, nor breake the bruised reede, but cherish the least sparke and measure of grace giuen vnto vs from aboue.

               <p>For, it is an altering of our liues and conuersations to God, ioyned with a Godly sorrow and detestation of all sinne, together with an vnfained loue and desire of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.

whereof is knowledge, the body is faith, the fruite is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now to conclude, wee are to handle the last part, which is <note n="a" place="margin">Loue tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard their bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren is requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of al that come to the table.</note> loue toward men, and reconciliation of our selues to our neighbors, for iniuries, wronges, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces done vnto them, which are as poyson to this banket. For, in vaine we shall pretend knowledge, boast of faith, glory of repentance, if we faile in duties toward our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren. For, heere is the touchstone and tryall of all the rest, euen our obedience to the second table, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the duties of loue toward our bretheren. Heerevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to commeth <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 5, 23</note> the doctrine of Christ set downe in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist Math. 5. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the alter, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue there thy gift before the altar, and goe first be reconciled to thy brother, then come and offer thy gift.</hi> Where he teacheth, that he so appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth this duty, that hee will haue his owne immediat seruice cease, and giue place for a time, till it be performed. So, in the Sermon which he made to his Apostles, before he was betrayed to death, he did diligently beate vpon this point, saying, <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 13, 35</note> 
                  <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if ye loue one another. This is my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you: greater loue then this hath no man, that a man bestow his life for his frends: ye are my friends, if ye doe whatsoeuer I commaund you.</hi> This likewise the <note n="d" place="margin">Colos. 3, 12</note> Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that we may know him to be the scoller of the same maister, Coloss. 3, <hi>As the elect of God, holie and beloued, put on tender mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiuing one another, if any man haue a quarell vnto another, euen as Christ forgaue you, euen so doe ye: and aboue all these things, put on loue, which is the bound of perfectnesse.</hi> As euery one hath a comfortable experience in his own hart of Gods mercy toward him in the pardon of his sinnes which are many and great; so let him shew mercy againe, as he hath receiued mercy, and deale vnto others kindly, as God hath delt gratiously toward him. Our sauiour Christ auoucheth this Math. 18. in the parable of the lender that had many debters: he called them to <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 18, 23</note> take

an account of them, and forgiueth the debt hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on him that was not able to pay: but when he was departed, and had found one of his fellow-seruants which ought him an hundred pence, he laid hand on him, thrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and cast him in prison till he should pay the debt. Then the Lord called him and said, <hi>O euil seruant, I forgaue thee all that debt, because thou prayedst me: Oughtest thou not also to haue pittie on thy fellow-seruant, euen as I had pittie on thee?</hi> So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormenters, till he should pay all that was due to him. Then followeth the application of the whole, <hi>So likewise shall mine heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do vnto you, except ye forgiue from your harts each one his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their trespasses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, the Lordes supper was ordained of God for this end, that it might be a band of loue, and a chaine to vnite and ioyne vs togither among our selues, that if it wer pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible we should not breake from him: as Paule teacheth. 1 Cor. 10 <hi>We that are manie,</hi>

Behold heere, a chaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of many linkes to knit vs together, that wee breake not from God and our brethren. Do we not al come to the table? Do we not all eat of the same bread? Do we not al drinke of the same cup? Is not the same loafe compact of many cornes? Is not the same Wine pressed out of many clusters? Do we not all ioyne together in the same recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? Were we not baptized into the same baptism? What a shameful thing is this, full of infamy and reproach, to see the branches of the same vine, the sheepe of the same she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard, the children of the same father, the Seruants of the same maister, the fellowes of the same houshould, the heirs of the same kingdome, the ghuests of the same banket, the obtainers of the same promise, the partakers of the same hope, the members of the same bodye, and the professors of the same faith, to contend and striue one against another, to delight in brauling, fighting, quarrelling, and to norish

                  <hi>Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> if Brother be diuided against brother, if we bite one at another, let vs take heed least we be consumed one of another. The sonnes of God are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed into the image ofGod, to resemble their heauenly father in true holines, and doe all weare the same cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance and liuery. For the Sacraments are the marks of Ch. sheepe, whereby they are knowne and discerned: so that all our discentions, diuisions, railings, reuilings disgracings and defacings one of another, tend to the reproch and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of our common father, and do giue an heauy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony against our souls with God and his elect Angels. For how do we approach vnto God? how do we come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his presence? With what harts do we pray before him and vnto him? Are we not taught <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 6, 12</note> to aske forgiuenes of our sins, as we forgiue the trespasses done vnto vs? It then we be malicious and enuious, and carry the fresh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of wronges in our hearts, to pursue them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: do we not pray against our selues? Do we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech God to poure out vengance vpon vs? Do we not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our mouths to our owne destruction? For when wee vse our tongues to say, <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 11, 4</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, forgiue vs, for euen we forgiue:</hi> is it not asmuch as if we should pray, forgiue vs not Lord, for we do not, we will not forgiue others? Therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the forme of prayer giuen to the Disciples, Christ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>If ye do forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenly father will also forgiue you: but if ye do not forgiue men their trepasses, no more will your father forgiue you your trespasses.</hi> And as he exhorteth, that when they stand and appeare before the Altar, <note n="k" place="margin">Mark. 11, 25</note> they must forgiue: so when we appeare at the Lords table, we must forgiue, if we haue any thing against any man, that our father also which is in heauen may forgiue vs our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes. Now, if we woulde be directed to knowe whether this loue be is vs or not, wee may try our owne hearts by these <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 13, 4</note> holy properties and blessed effectes described by the Apostle, 1, cor, xiii, <hi>Loue</hi> (saith he) <hi>suffereth long, it is

bountifull, loue enuieth not, loue doth not boast itselfe, it is not puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp: it disdaineth not, it seeketh not her owne things, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger, it thinketh not euill: it reioyceth not in iniquity, but reioyceth in the truth: it suffereth all things, it beleeueth al thinges, it hopeth al things, it endureth al things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere we may see, what manner of loue ought to be in vs. Euery one of vs must indeuour, that all the parts of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription may rightly agree to euery one of vs, and truely be found in vs toward all men, euen our enimies, as we see Iesus Christ hath left vs an example of his loue, <note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 23, 35</note> when he praied for his enimies, that crucified and cruelly entreated him, <hi>father forgiue them: for they know what they do</hi> and this did <hi>stephen</hi> to those that stoned him, <hi>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</hi> This is the way, let vs walke in it: this was their practise, let vs follow it.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue shewed the necessity of examination of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues before we come to the Lordes supper, and declared the parts wherein it standeth, and the manner how it is to be performed. If we come furnished with these things, with sauing knoledg, with iustifieng faith, with vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with a louing and longing reconciliation towarde our brethren among whom we liue, hauing as much <note n="n" place="margin">Rom 12, 18</note> as is possible, <hi>Peace with all men,</hi> yea euen our enimies: let vs not abstaine from the Lordes table by reason of some frailties and infirmities in vs: for God couereth them, <note n="o" place="margin">2 chr. 305 18</note> and will not bring them into remembrance, as we see 2. <hi>Chron, 30. A multitude of people had not clensed themselues, yet did eate the passeouer, but not as it was writen: wherfore Hezekiah praied for them, saying, The good God be merciful toward him that prepareth his whole hart to seeke the Lord god, the god of his fathers, though he be not clensed according to the purification of the sanctuarie: and the Lord heard Hezekiah, and healed the people.</hi> Where we see, that because their hart was vpright and sincere, their wants and imperfections were not imputed vnto them. For God respecteth the truth of the inward partes, and pard oneth their sinnes that thus prepare their harts to seeke him. So

               <p>THe effect of that which hath bene deliuered hitherto in these Books, may thus be gathred into a short sum and abridgement. We haue <note n="a" place="margin">The summ of the 1. book</note> declared that God, in al times and ages of the church from the first being of our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, hath to his word and promises anexed sacraments as seales of assurance <note n="b" place="margin">Genes. 2, 9 &amp;c.</note> for the confirmation of them: therby magnifieng his owne mercy toward his people, shewing our weaknes and vnworthines, and condemning such as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes desire to come to the Lordes table, but esteeme little of the preaching of the word: whereas the word and Sacraments haue one and the same author, they are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the same grace, their whole force and effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on God, they require faith <note n="c" place="margin">Hebru. 4, 2</note> to be mingled with them, &amp; they profit not alway at the very moment of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and receiuing. Notwithstanding some differences wee find betweene them, as namely in the greater necessity of the worde, then of the Sacramentes: Infidels were neuer barred from hearing the word when they would become <note n="d" place="margin">1 cor. 14, 24</note> hearers thereof: and whereas the word affecteth one only of the sences, to wit, the hearing, the Sacraments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

to the eies as well as to the eares, and so in some sort become more effectuall then the word.</p>
               <p>Touching the worde Sacrament, it is drawne from martiall discipline, and properly signifieth the Souldiers othe, whereby hee bindeth himselfe to his Captaine: which worde being vsed by the olde Latine interpreter, is now become ordinary and common in the Church, which is not mentioned in so many sillables in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And howsoeuer the word be often taken in a large and generall signification: yet as we take it in these bookes, <note n="e" place="margin">What a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is.</note> a Sacrament is a visible signe and seale ordained of God, whereby Christ and all his sauing graces by certaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rites are signified, exhybited and sealed vppe vnto vs. This discription being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And this was the cause that <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 2,</note> Christ Iesus baptized none, but his Disciples baptized, that he might learne not to esteeme of the effect of the sacraments by the fitnesse or vnsitnesse of the Myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>

Lastly, we learne from hence, that the Sacramentes are not bare and naked signes of Christ absent <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor, x, xvi</note> but sure seales of Gods promises, and of the righteousnesse of Christ who is offered to all, but receyued onely of the faithfull: so that the presence of vngodlye men meeting vs at the same Table, cannot hurte vs in our worthye receiuing.

The last outward part is the <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 17. xii</note> receiuer: so that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without their lawfull vse are no sacraments at all, so long as the signes are reserued and not applyed.</p>

to receiue profit by the Sacraments: so that the reprobate, who are vessels of wrath, and the Children of perdytion, cannot receiue Christ, albeit they partake the signes of Christ. As for the elect, who are the Lordes, sealed vp to the day of redemption, before their conuersion and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the sheepefold of Christ, they also onely receiue the outward signe without Christ, inasmuch as they are without faith: but after they are called with an holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling effectually, and haue receiued to beleeue vnfainedly, they are partakers both of the signe and of the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

               <p>If these be the true vses and endes of a sacrament, then wee learne to take notice of <note n="h" place="margin">Mark. 9, 23</note> our owne failinges and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of faith; that GOD refuseth none for weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wauering of faith; <note n="i" place="margin">Rom 8, xv</note> that there is an assurance of faith to be attained vnto, in this life; that as God euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more keepeth his promise with his people, <note n="k" place="margin">Num 23, 19</note> who is not as man that he should lie, nor as the son of man that he should deceiue, so must we be careful to keep the articles of <note n="l" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 23</note> agree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment betweene God &amp; vs, namely, to beleeue his word, to loue our bretheren, to obey his will: lastly as our priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

               <p>Thirdly, seeing God hath giuen vnto vs two signes, and added two seals to his word and writings, we ought to haue the stronger faith in his mircyfull promises. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he doubled the signes, but that wee should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in faith, and as it were double our assurance of his graces?

Trent, and is now become the common doctrine of that counterfect church.</p>
               <p>For, besides baptisme and the Lords supper, which wee receiue, they <note n="u" place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of seauen sacramentes is false and forged</note> haue instaled into the number of sacraments Confirmation, Penance, Matrimony, Orders, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Vnction, contrary to the doctrine of the scriptures, contrary to the nature of Sacramentes, and contrary to the euidence of sundry reasons. And firist of all, <note n="a" place="margin">Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation cannot bee lifted vppe into the seate of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, or sit downe in this Chaire of honour, because it wanteth the institution of Christ, it wanteth an outward signe, it hath no word to warrant it, or promise of blessing: for howsoeuer <note n="b" place="margin">act, 8, 5, xiiii xv, xvi, xvii</note> the Apostles by imposition of hands gaue the holy ghost, those miraculous gifts are now withdrawne from the church of God. Lastly, they haue aduanced it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue baptisme, they administer it in a strange tongue, and halow the greazy oyle to purifie soule and body. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note n="c" place="margin">Penance is 1. 0 sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</note> their popish penance, instituted by bodily chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make satisfaction for sinne to God, is no sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new testament, nor any sacred thing being thus vnderstood. For we acknowledge no other satifaction <note n="d" place="margin">i Ioh, i, 7</note> for sinne, wherein God delighteth, and the conscience of man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but only the death and obedience of christ. Besides, true repentance hath beene preached and practised from the beginning of the world, after that sinne entred into the world. Furthermore their penance hath no visible signe as baptisme and the supper of the Lord haue. Thirdly, <note n="e" place="margin">matrimony is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, albeit it be a diuine ordinance, honourable <note n="f" place="margin">Heb, xiii 4,</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all estates, yet can be no Sacrament of the church of christ, because it was instituted before <note n="g" place="margin">gen, 2, xviii</note> the law, it is ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the infidels which are no members of the church, it hath no promise of grace and saluation ioyned to it, and albeit it be honorable in all, <note n="h" place="margin">i cor, 6. 7. 7, 37</note> yet it is not necessary in all. Lastly, the Roman church esteemeth it as an vnclean thing, a prophanation of holy orders, a liuing in the flesh: so that as with one hand they aduance it to a great dignity, with the other hand they cast it downe with great disgrace and


<pb n="382" facs="tcp:16298:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contempt, as vnworthy of the high and holy priesthood. Fourthly, orders come in the next <note n="i" place="margin">Orders no sacrament</note> place, which are the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and ministry of the church, but no sacrament, or sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the church. For then, according to the number of orders, we should multiply the number of sacraments. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they any outward element and visible signe. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are come to extream vnction, which we suffer not to <note place="margin">Extreame vnction no sacrament</note> maske vnder the name of sacraments, but pul off the vizard thereof, because the church had the vse of anoynting <note n="l" place="margin">Iames 5, 14</note> so long as it retained the miraculous gift of healing. Besides, it hath no word ofinstitution to warrant the continual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of it, vntill the second comming of christ. Wherefore, seeing the word of God teacheth the number of two sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely, and the church of Rome instructeth her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the number of 7. sacraments, neither moe nor lesse: they must pardon vs, if we harken rather to the scriptures, then to their traditions, rather to God then to man, rather to the truth then to the spirit of error.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue spoken of the Sacramentes in generall, of their parts, their vses, their number: now we <note n="m" place="margin">The summ of the 2 book</note> come to speake of them in particular, first of baptisme, then of the Lords supper. And howsoeuer baptisme hath sundry signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, yet as it signifieth that washing with water which serueth to seale the couenant of the new testament, <note n="n" place="margin">what b ap.</note> it is the first sacrament, wherein by the outward washing of the body with water once in the name of the father, of the son and of the holy ghost, the inward clensing of the soule, by the blood of christ, is represented. This descrption teacheth, that such as are not yet baptized, <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. xii, 48</note> are not to be admitted to the lords table: that albeit dipping be not necessary to the being of baptisme, yet washing with water <note n="p" place="margin">Ephe. 5, 26</note> is of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of this sacrament: that such as are once baptized, are not to be rebaptized, albeit they haue beene baptized by heretickes: and that whosoeuer is baptized, hath made a solemne couenant to professe the Christian religion. Now, <hi rend="sup">q</hi> wee are to consider in Baptisme (as wee did before generally in a Sacrament) these two thinges, his partes,


<pb n="383" facs="tcp:16298:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his vses. The partes of baptisme are outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>The outward partes <note n="r" place="margin">The outwa. parts of bapt are 4</note> are these foure: The first outward part is the Minister, as the Messenger of God. For bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is a part of the <note n="s" place="margin">Math. 28, 19</note> Minystry, and God hath ioyned the ministry of the word &amp; sacraments togither. Wherfore, the minister must be carefull and not carelesse in the execution of his osfice, who is to sanctifie the Water, and to wash the party: Moreouer, the people are directed, to whom to resort, when they haue children to be baptized. Lastly, the Church of Rome prophane baptisme, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point mid-wiues and priuate persons to baptize children. The second outward part, <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 28, 19</note> is the word of institution, which is as the forme of this sacrament. The third part is the <note n="u" place="margin">act. 8, 36</note> element of water, which is the matter whereof baptisme consisteth. Whosoeuer therefore baptiseth with any other liquorthen with water, as with blood, with sand, with snow with milk, or such like matter, doth frustrate Baptisme, and maketh it an idell ceremony. Againe, all Popish corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons added and annexed to this sacrament contrary to the simplicity of the gospel, as creame, crosses, censors, tapers, spettle, salt, <note n="a" place="margin">Bellar. de sa Bapt cap 26</note> and such like vnsauory trumpery, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: hauing also a superstitious opinion of holinesse and worship ioyned with them. Also, if water be an outward part, the want of washing with water cannot hinder the saluation of such as dye without baptisme. All perished not vnder the law, that died without <note n="b" place="margin">Iosh, 5, 5</note> circumcision: God is not more rigorous vnder the Gospell. This therefore is a bloody and discomfortable doctrine, to be abandoned and abiured of all parents, of all childeren, of all Christians. The fourth outward parte of baptisme is the body that is washed. Novv, such as are to be baptized, must be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Couenant: these are, <note n="c" place="margin">act. 8, 36</note> eyther men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of riper yeares, or else the infantes of such, vvho haue interest in Baptisme as vvell as their parentes. This condemneth the Romyshe practise of baptizing bels: and serueth to set forth the great loue of God to all


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:16298:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beleeuers, who vouchsafeth to be their God &amp; the god of their seed. Hence likewise it appeareth, <note n="d" place="margin">Infantes haue interest in baptisme as wel as their parents</note> that infants are to be baptized. For baptisme succeedeth in place of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the Apostles baptized <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 2. xi</note> whole houses, Christ calleth infants and sucklings <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 16. 15. 33</note> vnto himselfe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that to such belongeth the kingdome of Heauen: they are Christ sheepe and members of his body: Hence we learne, that the baptisme of infantes is no vnwritten tradition, but a written and diuine institution taught in the Scriptures. Consider also heereby, the difference betweene baptisme and the Lords Supper, <note n="g" place="margin">cor. 1, i4, 16 Mar. x. xiii, xiiii, xv.</note> and that all are conceiued in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne. Acknowledge also a difference between them and the children os Infidels, and let parents be incoraged, <note n="h" place="margin">Psal, 51, 5</note> to bring vp their children in the instruction and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the outward parts: now follow <note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 6, 4</note> the inward parts, which also are four in number. First, <note n="k" place="margin">The inward parts of bap. are foure.</note> god the father represented by the Mi. wherby our faith is gretly strength<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned. For whensoeuer the eie seeth the minister <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> water on the body, faith beholdeth god the father clensing the soule with the precious blood of his sonne Christ. The seconde part is the spirit <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 28. 19</note> of God, hauing relation to the word and promise of God: and therefore whensoeuer wee come to heare the word or to receiue the sacramentes, we must craue the assistance of the spirit to open our harts, <note n="m" place="margin">icor. xii. xii.</note> as he opened the hart of <hi>Lydia.</hi> If this in ward teacher be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the eare heareth and the hand handleth, but the hart is hardned. The third in ward part of baptism <note n="n" place="margin">Act xvi. xiiii.</note> is Christrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the water. This serueth greatly to confirme our faith, to consider with our selues, when we behold with our bodily eies the water poured vpon the bodie baptizd, <note n="o" place="margin">act. 2. 38.</note> the blotting out of all our sinnes by the blood of Christ Iesus. <note place="margin">i Pet. 3 xxi</note> The 4. inward part is the soul clensed, <hi rend="sup">P</hi> most liuely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualy represented by the body washed. For the washing of the body representeth the clensing of the soul. This tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that by nature we are corrupt and abhominable, <note n="q" place="margin">Eph, 5 26, 27</note> so that God must worke in vs both the will and the deede.


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:16298:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
These are the foure in ward parts of baptisme. The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene these outward and inward parts <note n="r" place="margin">The propov<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion betwixt the outward and inwarde parts of bapc.</note> is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident. For as the Minister, by the word of institution, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Water to the washing of the body: so the father, through the working of the spirit, applyeth the bloode of Christ, to the clensing of the soule.</p>
               <p>Thus farre of the parts of Baptisme, both the outward and the inward parts: now we come to the vses thereof, <note n="s" place="margin">Three vses of Baptisme</note> which are principally three. First, to shew our placing and planting into the blood of Christ, to remaine in him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. This coniunction with Christ is not bodily or naturall, but misticall and marueilous in our eyes: for we are made one with Christ, <note n="t" place="margin">1 cor 6: xvii</note> by the same spirit dwelling in Christ, and in all the members of Christ. So then, the saints trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in heauen, and al the beleeuers fighting vpon earth as souldiers in warfar, haue one and the same spirit of christ dwelling in them, and therfore are one with him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to assure vs of the remission of our fins, that we may bee able to stand in the presence of God, <note n="v" place="margin">Gal 3: xvii</note> hauing put on the garments of Christ, as <hi>Iacob</hi> receiued the blessing clad in the garments of his elder brother. This ouerthroweth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin or rather doting of the church of Rome, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that baptism abolisheth al sins going before it, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing that hath the name or nature of sinne. If this were a truth of god not a dreame of men, it is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but greatly to be desired, to haue baptisme deferred vntil old age, nay vnto the hower of death, that so we may depart hence in peace with greater assurance of Gods fauor in the pardon of our sins. Thirdly, <note n="a" place="margin">Marke 1: 4</note> to slay the old man, and to kil our natural corruption by the power of the death and burial of christ: besides, to raise vs vp againeto holines and newnes of life by his resurection. Hence it is, that the Euangelists call it the Sacrament of Repentance: admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing euery one of vs to expresse the strength and power of baptisme, as the Prophets of tentimes exhort the lews to <note n="b" place="margin">Deut x, xvi</note> circumcise the forskin of their harts, and to harden their necks no more. So we ought not to content our selus to be


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:16298:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
baptized in body, but must labour to be baptized in soul, by a daily proceeding in regeneration, by bringing foorth the fruites of sanctification, and applying Christ Iesus to our full iustification.</p>
               <p>Thus much of baptisme, the honourable badge of our profession and dedication to Christ that dyed vppon the Crosse, what it is, what are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and vses thereof. Now, wee come to <note n="d" place="margin">The summe of the 3. book</note> the Sacrament of the body and bloode of CHRIST, <hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is called by sundrye names in the new testament. Sometimes, it is called the <note n="f" place="margin">1 cor. 10, 16</note> Communion, teaching that we are one body coupled togither in Christ, shewing that it is to bee receiued of many togither, and admonishing vs of vnity and concorde among our selues.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, it is <note n="g" place="margin">1 cor, xi, xx</note> called the Lords Supper, hence we see, who is the author of it, no man, no Angell, but the Lord Iesus, leauing it for a fare-well token of his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs. We must also come with an earnest desire hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after Christ, that we may be satisfied with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Sometimes, it is called the <note n="h" place="margin">actes 2, 42</note> breaking of breade: this sheweth, that the substance of breaderemay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after the wordes of consecration, that figuratiue speeches are vsed in the Sacrament, and that this externall rite of breaking the bread, vsed by Christ, practised by the Apostles, obserued by the pastors of the church, ought not to be omitted and ouerpassed. Sometimes, it is called the <note n="i" place="margin">1 cor x, 21</note> table of the Lord: this teacheth, that christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, at the celebration of it, vsed a table not an altar; that it is a Sacrament, not a sacrifice, and that we ought to draw neere vnto it with all regard aud reuerence. Lastly, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the new testament or Will of Christ. This title teacheth that there is a double couenant betweene God and man, <note place="margin">1 cor. xi, 25</note> the one old, the other new: the one of the law, the other of the Gospell: the firste of Workes, the seconde of grace.</p>
               <p>Againe, it serueth to condemne the cursed sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the church of Rome, which addeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth,


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:16298:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
altereth and mangleth this sacrament at her own pleasure, and mingleth it with the leauen of her owne inuentions. This is a great comfort to all Gods children, to consider that all faithfull christians are the heires of Christ, to whom he hath promised saluation of their soules, and forgiuenesse of their sinnes.</p>
               <p>As we haue seene the seueral names of this sacrament, which shew the nature there of vnto vs: so now we will set downe <note n="k" place="margin">What the Lo: supper is,</note> what the lords supper is. The supper of the lord is the second sacrament, wherein by visible receiuing of bread and wine, is represented our spirituall communion with the body and blood of christ. Heere God is present, and sitteth as president at this table, he offereth vnto vs his owne sonne for our iustification, and therefore this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per must be reuerently regarded, and diligently frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of vs.</p>

               <p>So then, they are not consecrated to be priestes of the new testament, but preachers of the gospel, and ministers of the sacraments: and therefore priuate persons may not take this supper to themselues or deliuer it to others.

Thus the Scripture speaketh of <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 17, x</note> Circumcision and of the paschall Lambe. The third outward part are bread and wine, fit signes to signifie our spirituall nourishment by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the body and drinking the blod of Christ In Baptisme we haue one onely signe, but in this supper <note n="r" place="margin">Mar. xiiii, 22</note> we haue two, to note out our ful and perfect nourishment by Christ. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did christ deliuer the deceiueable shewes of bread and wine, or cast a mist before the eyes of his desciples to make them thinke it breade which was no bread, or wine which was no wine: but he gaue them true breade, and the true fruit of the vine, <note n="s" place="margin">1 cor. x, xvi</note> as the apostle calleth them, after the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, breaking, consecration. Hereby falleth to the ground the mystery of transubstantiation, the most misshapen mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that euer liued or was deuised. It bringeth in a false Christ, and turneth him into an idoll: it maketh Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without signes: it maketh Christ to haue an infinite body, who is like to vs in all things <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 4, 15</note> sinne onely excepted: lastly, it confoundeth heauen and earth together. Neither let any obiect that Christ hath now a glorified body, sitting at the right hand of his father, and therefore his body hath a great priuiledge aboue ours, to be in diuers places at the <note place="margin">Obiect</note> same time. For first, when the holy supper was instituted, the body of Christ was not glorified. Againe, glorification <note place="margin">Answer.</note> doth not take away the nature of a true body, but taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the infirmity and weaknes thereof.

faith in our hearts, <note n="k" place="margin">Hebr. xi, 1</note> which is the ground of thinges which are hoped for, and the euidence of thinges which are not seene. The thirde inwarde part of the Lordes Supper, <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 22, 19</note> is the body and blood of Christ, deliuered for vs vnto death. This conuinceth such of a spirit of errour, who make vnbeleeuers and reprob. partakers of Chr. bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood: thus his body should be prophaned, <note n="m" place="margin">Iohn 6, 54</note> and his sauing graces seperated from his person. But euen as, where Satan dwelleth and possesseth the heart, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies raigne the workes of darkenes and damnation: so the gifts of Christ accompanying saluation, are inseperably ioyned with the person of Christ. This also condemneth the reall presence and carnall eating of Christ, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many Christs, and reuiueth the Haeresie of Eutiches: it crosseth sundry Articles of the christian faith, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth faithfull men like the vnfaithfull Barbarians, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured mans flesh and drunke his blood. True it is, christ is truely present in the Sacrament, howbeit not carnally, and corporally, but spiritually and mistically. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen himselfe to be the foode of our soules, let vs hunger and thirst after him and lay hold on him to our saluation: for <note n="n" place="margin">iIoh. 5, xii</note> he that hath the sonne, hath life: he that hath not the sonne of God, hath not life. The last inward part is the faith full receiuer, who stretcheth forth the hand of faith, and so layeth hold on Christ and all his sauing graces. For no man can communicat with his body, but the same is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his benefits. Let vs all prepare the true and liuely faith <note n="o" place="margin">Titus i, i</note> of Gods elect, and assure our selues that Hypocrites and vnbeleeuers cannot possibly be partakers of the bodye and blood of Christ.

Thus much of al the parts of the Lords supper: now folow the vses to be vnfolded. The <note n="q" place="margin">The vseso the lords sup. are three</note> vses &amp; profit which we reap by the Lords sup. are special three. First, to shew forth with praise and thanks giuing, the death and the suffrings of chri. who his own selfe bare our sins in his body on the tree, by whose stripes <note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 24</note> we are healed: so that we haue the chiefe cause in our selus, which did crucifie christ Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly to teach our comunion wich christ, being made flesh <note n="s" place="margin">Ephe. 5, XXX</note> of his flesh &amp; bone of his bones. Hence we learn, that al the godly and be leeuers are made partakers of christ and his graces. This is matter of great comfort in our manifold trials and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we are ioynd to Ch. as members to the head, <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 8, 38</note> and therfore, neither life, nor deth, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor things to com, nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creatur shalbe able to seperate vs from the loue of God, which is in christ Iesus our L. But on the other side, the vngodly and vnbeleeuers haue no part or Portion in chri. and his graces, they are as branches <note n="u" place="margin">Iohn XV, 6</note> cut off which wither, and men gather them to cast them into the fire and to burn them. 3, to declare and testifie our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, fellowship, and <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. X. 17</note> agreement with our brethren, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together at the same table, and partaking togither of the same supper. Wherfore, seeing we haue not onely an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with christ, but a comunion among our selus, we are the seruants of the church, to serue one another in al duties of loue, to instruct them that are ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to raise them that are fallen, and to bind vp the broken hearted, to reconcile our selues one to warde another, and to keepe the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Hitherto we haue handled the doctrin of the Lords supper, declaring what it is, what are the parts and vses thereof; the preparation to this work followeth, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor xi, 28</note> consisting in the Examination of our selues, and trying our owne harts by the touchstone of the lawe of god. This duty is very necessary to be performd of vs, <note n="c" place="margin">Ierem. 17, 9</note> for the hart of man is deceitful aboue all things, and the secret corners of it past finding out. We haue to deal with god in this busines. Great is the profit which we reap &amp; receiue, if

And the <note n="d" place="margin">Hag. 2: 14</note> Sacrament it self is defiled, by vnworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing. This preparation principally standeth in these 4. points: in the <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh: xvii: 3</note> knowledge of god and of ourselues, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the whole doctrine of the sacraments: in a <note n="f" place="margin">2 cor: xiii: 5</note> liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith in Christ, seeing euery one receiueth so much as he beleeueth he receiueth: in repentance <note n="g" place="margin">Psa6. 26: 6:</note> from dead works: and lastly in <note n="h" place="margin">Math, 5: 23,</note> reconciliation towarde our brethren, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing peace <note n="i" place="margin">Rom xii: 18</note> with all men, and loue towarde our enemies.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue opened plainly, yet truely, the doctrine of the Sacramentes, deliuered in the Scriptures, and taught in the reformed churches. I haue disclosed some part of the mistery of iniquity and discouered and laid open the skirts of that great Idoll of the Masse, the reproach of christians, the scorne of the gentiles, the offence of the weak, and the occasion of ruine to many that stumble therat to their own confusion. The Lord god, high possessor of heauen &amp; earth, and preseruer of his people that call vpon him, put it into the heart of all christian princes and rulers of the earth, to pull downe this abhominable Idoll, that hath aduanced it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe against the kingdome of christ, and to deface this fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy monster that hath deceiued many, who trusted in it. The same Lord vouchsafe, to reueale his truth to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to establish them that are weake, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all obstinate enemies to his truth, to their prince, and to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for Iesus Christs sake, Amen</p>

is no strife: the difference is onely in certaine circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. First, we all acknowledge, that the holy signes haue not a bare signification but assure our consciences through the <note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwixt the reformed churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sa.</note> ordinance of God, that the things themselues are as truely and certainely giuen of God to all the faithful that come to his supper, as the outward signes are deliuered by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of God. Againe, we professe that the supper consisteth of two parts, the earthly, externall, and visible, which are bread and wine: and besides, the heauenly, internal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible, the true body and blood of Iesus Christ, together with al his gifts, benefits, and treasures, according to <note n="m" place="margin">Iren. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably nourished with the same vnto eternal life. Fourthly we beleeue, that the bread &amp; wine are not changed or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated into the flesh and blood of christ, but remaine true and natural bread and wine in substance as before: so that the bread is called his body and the wine his blood, not only because his body and blood are signified by these, and set before vs, but because so often as we eate and drinke them worthily, christ himselfe giueth vs his body &amp; blood truely to euerlasting life. Lastly, we al hold the vse of the supper in both kinds, and that without the right vse of the outward signes it is no sacrament, vnlesse the bread be eaten and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

particulars. First, one part contendeth that these wordes of christ, <hi>this is my body,</hi> must be vnderstood literally and as the words found (which yet that side doth not so vnderstand:) the other part holdeth that they are to be vnderstood sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentally and figuratiuely, according to the declaration of christ, the interpretation of <hi>Paule,</hi> and the infallible rules of our christian faith. Secondly, one part wil haue the body &amp; blood of christ essentially and bodily in, with, and vnder the bread and wine, and so to be eaten, as that together with the bread and wine they enter into the mouth and body of the receiuers: but the other part holdeth, that the body of christ which at the first supper sat at table with his disciples; doth not now continue with vs vpon the earth, but abideth in the heauens, and shal remaine there, vntil he break the heauens, and discend thence to iudgement. Lastly, one part will haue al communicants that come to the lords table, and partake the outward signs, whether they come worthily or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, whether they be beleeuers or insidels, whether godly or vngodly, tó eat the body and drinke the blood of christ corporally and with the mouth of the body, so as the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe eate him to life and saluation, the vnbeleeuers to death and damnation: the other side holdeth that the vnbe leeuers abuse the outward signs of bread and wine to their destruction, and that only the faithful can eat the body and drinke the blood of christ by a true faith, &amp; by the working of the holy ghost: wherby they are made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, being more neerely and firmely knit vnto him, then the members of our body are vnited to our head, and thereby drawing from him life euerlasting.</p>

               <hi>It is rashnesse to say that the body of Christ by the diuine power cannot be in the sacrament in any other manner, then by turning of the bread into him.</hi> Furthemore he affirmeth this, <hi>If it be graunted that the substance of bread and wine do remain, one dissioulty ariseth that two bodies are together, which may be answered: but the contrary being holden, many follow, namely, how accidsnts can nourish, how be corrupted, and how any thing can be ingendred in them, seeing there is nothing made but there is presupposed or thought to be a matter, &amp;c.</hi> Contrarywise commonly they hold, that the substance of bread is turned into the body of Christ: but about the manner how it is changed, they cannot agree.

know not what. For how shall the people haue a directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and path-way what to followe, when their teachers are not setled and perswaded what is the truth? Against al these confusions, vncertainties, contrarieties, blasphemies, and crossing one another, we teach the people what to hold and instruct them to make a diffe. between ch. body &amp; the <note place="margin">Difference betvvixt chri. body &amp; the Sacrament.</note> sacrament of his body. The sacrament is corruptible, christs body is glorious and free from all corruption: the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is beneath, christes body is aboue: the sacrament is on earth vpon the table, the body is in heauen the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment feedeth the body and outwarde man, the body of christ feedeth the soule and inward man: the sacrament is eaten as well of the wicked as of the godly, the body is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaten of the faithful: the sacrament may be eaten to death, but the body of christ is euer eaten to saluation. Wherefore, howsoeuer beastes may touch or eate the substance of the bread, which is the outwarde and corruptible element of the sacrament: they cannot eat the body of christ which is in heauen, and sitteth at the right hande of God the Father, which is receiued onely by a liuely faith.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they argue the case, whether the shew of breade be a signe of the bodie without the bloode, or whether it include the soule, humours, spirits, and the blood it selfe? <hi>Scotus</hi> saith <note n="e" place="margin">In repor, d. x, quest. 3</note>

This is a very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull shiste, and a marueylous sigure, passing all figures, whereby one thing is made two, and two are made one.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to draw to an end (where almost no end is) they


<pb facs="tcp:16298:220"/>
eagerly contend with what wordes their consecration or rather coniuration is wrought. Some say, christ consecrated when hee blessed. Others denying this, dispute how many words are precisely required to the forme of consecration. <hi>Scotus</hi> shrowdeth himself vnder his own ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; flyeth to it as to a place of refuge, saying, <note n="g" place="margin">In repor, di 8 quest 2</note>

Christ saith of his last Supper, when hee had taken, blessed, and broken the bread, <hi>This is my body which is broken, or giuen for you, do this in remembrance of me. In like manner he tooke the cup,</hi> saying, <hi>This cup is the new testament in my blood, this doe as oft as ye drinke it in remembrance of me.</hi> As if hee should say, this bread is a signe or sacrament of my body, which is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death for you and for your saluation. Christ tooke nothing but bread: he brake that which he tooke: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered that which he brake as the Apostle saith <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor, x, 16</note> 
               <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</hi> So touching the other part, when he saith, <hi>This cup,</hi> hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, this Wine in the cup is a sacrament of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of our reconciliation with God now to bee fulfilled, of our communion and participation of Christ with all his benifits. This interpretation is agreeable to the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the text, to the proportion of faith, and to the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb facs="tcp:16298:221"/>
of the ancient fathers, who call the sacrament a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, a remembrance, an image, a token, a signe, a figure and such like. But because our aduersaries can abide no figures, let vs heare what the Doctours of the Church teach, who thought it no heresie to expound the wordes of Christ by a figure. <hi>Tertullian</hi> one of the most auncient saith, <note n="o" place="margin">Tert, cont. Marcion li, 4</note> 
               <hi>Christ receiuing the bread, and the same being diuided vnto his Disciples, made it his body,</hi> saying, <hi>This is my body,</hi> that is to say, <hi>a figure of my body.</hi> And Chrysostome <note n="p" place="margin">Chrysost. in Mat. hom 83</note>

               <hi>Dicitur corpus christi, sed improprie, vt sit sensus. It is the body of christ, but vnproperlie: the meaning is, it is called Christes body, that is, it signifieth christs body. Gelasius</hi> saith in the same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Quod videtis, panis est,</hi> that is, <hi>the thing that ye see, is bread.</hi> He doth not say, it seemeth bread and is none, or it is the shew and forme of bread, but he speaketh euidently, it is indeede bread.</p>
            <p>Now our aduersaries, that can abide no tokens, no figures, no signes, no significations in the wordes of the supper, are notwithstanding driuen to make so diuerse, so doubtfull, so <note place="margin">Popish expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sitions of ch. institution</note> many, so monstrous, so mad and senseles expositions of the word of institution, as al the tropes, figures, metaphors, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, allegories, and rhetoricke in the world, wil not serue them to salue vp the braunches of their interpretations of these short and few words.</p>
            <p>First, they finde in the word, bread, a whole swarme of figures. They say the Sacrament is called Bread, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, because it was bread before: sometimes, because an Infidell taketh it to be bread: sometimes because the


<pb facs="tcp:16298:222"/>
accidents and shewes of bread remaine: sometimes, because the same accidentes nourish the body by a miracle, as if it were bread: sometimes, because it is that spirituall bread <note place="margin">How the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king in the supper</note> which came from heauen: and lastly, because the bread sometimes returneth againe after consecration. Againe, these words lying together, <hi>he tooke, hee blessed, he brake,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the words which Christ spake, are strangely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded on this manner, he tooke the bread: hee blessed, that is, he turned and changed the bread: he brake, that is, the accidents or shewes of bread: and sometimes they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, It seemeth to be broken: so that when the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists saith <hi>he brake,</hi> they say the meaning is, hee did not breake but seemed so to do.</p>
            <p>Touching the next word <hi>This:</hi> the pronoune demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue they say sometimes pointeth out the bread, as <hi>Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> 
               <note place="margin">what the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the pronovn this</note> deliuereth: sometimes they say it demonstrates not the bread but <hi>indiuidum vagum,</hi> that is, neither bread, nor any certaine determined thing else, but a thing left at randome, and at large in generality, but what thing particularly they cannot tell. Sometimes, they say, it demonstrates nothing, as <note n="a" place="margin">Ios, angl, de mist, mis, c 17 Durand lib. 4</note> 
               <hi>Iosephus</hi> Angles: and <hi>Durand</hi> misseth not much of that marke, when he saith that by (<hi>This</hi>) nothing is signified. Other say it demonstrateth the body, &amp; so they make christ to speake foolishly, <hi>This body is my body:</hi> and besides, by this interpretation, it shold be his body before the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as he confesseth the papists his good bretheren agree not in the sense of this word, so he inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a new and strange exposition neuer hard off before in the Church or out of the Church, in iest or in earnest, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned or vnlearned, that is, <note n="b" place="margin">Bel, de euch lib 1 cap, 11</note> 
               <hi>hoc edulium,</hi> that is, <hi>this food is my body, this drinke is my blood,</hi> and yet what foode it was, and what drinke it was, when that word was vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he dareth not to determine. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it more at large, with whom (<hi>This</hi>) is as much as <note n="c" place="margin">Thom lib 4 sent di, 8 ar, 6</note> 
               <hi>Hoc contentum,</hi> that is, <hi>that which is contained vnder these shewes. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius de Valentia</hi> after his fashion saith, <hi>Christ ment that which he tooke into his hands:</hi> yet he holdeth, he ment not bread: so


<pb facs="tcp:16298:222"/>
that by this reason without reason, Christ tooke not bread into his hands. <hi>Scotus</hi> vnderstandeth <hi>hoc ens,</hi> that is, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall thing that hath a being: but what it is when they should declare, they stick fast in the mire of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises. Moreouer, touching the interpretation of the next word (<hi>is:</hi>) they likewise muster an Army of many figures. Sometimes they expound it, <hi>this shall be,</hi> as <hi>Occam.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they vnderstand therby <hi>is made,</hi> as <hi>Bonouenture</hi> blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth at al aduentures. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> refelleth both these. Sometimes they meane, <hi>this shall be</hi> transubstantiated and changed into the substance of his body. Furthermore, the words following (<hi>is giuen</hi>) they vnderstand shalbe giuen: <hi>is broken,</hi> they expound shalbe broken: <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> they expound, sacrifice me in remembrance of me. Thus they roue and wander vp and downe as men that haue lost the right way, and yet will be going rather then stand still.</p>
            <p>Wherefore by these collections we see, that these words which stand in construction and order together, <hi>he tooke, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, brake, and gaue,</hi> they expound on this maner, he tooke the <note place="margin">A briefe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pish interpre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations.</note> bread: he blessed it quite and cleane away, and in place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of put an other substance: hee brake the shewes, appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and accidents of bread, &amp; then he gaue them his body. Behold in these words of christ, how many shapes, formes, figures, nay falsehoods they haue inuented, and so inuerted them? And yet they say, they must be taken properly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of figure. To conclude this point, I wilgiue a short, but most sweet tast of the popish diuinity, taught in schooles, in churches, in monasteries, in seminaries, and in al their meetings, by their schoolemen, canonists, doctors, prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers, and Byshops. When the Euange lists report, that christ hauing taken bread, brake it, blessed, and gaue it, saying, <hi>This is my body giuen for you do this in remembrance of me:</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christ according to their interpretation must bee this, <hi>Christ after his last supper tooke bread into his handes, but blessed it to nothing: hee brake onely certaine shexes of bread, and gaue them his naturall body, saying vnto them, This which I haue in my handes, whether it be bread or not you cannot tel, surely foode


<pb facs="tcp:16298:223"/>
it is, but be it what it may be, it is transubstantiated and turned into my body, and therefore take it and offer it vp an vnbloody sacrifice for quick and dead, and so sacrifice me in remembrance of me.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were there such fond and fantasticall figures heard off in the Church of God: neuer was such vanity inuented: neuer was there so great confusion of tongues at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Babell:</hi> How much better were it for them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake these fables and deuises of their owne, and to say plainely, euidently, simply, directly, and distinctly with <note n="d" place="margin">Scholiast Maximus.</note> the Greeke Scoliast, <hi>Zumbola tauta, alla ouk aletheia,</hi> that is, <hi>these be tokens, but not the truth it selfe.</hi> And with Tertullian, <note n="e" place="margin">Tertul. con. Marcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. lib. 4</note> 
               <hi>This is my body, that is, this is a figure of my body.</hi> The like wee finde in Chrysostome in many places speaking as cleerely, as when the Sun shineth at noone dayes, <note n="f" place="margin">chrysost, in epist, ad Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar. Monach,</note> 
               <hi>The bread before it be sanctified is called by vs bread: but after that it is sanctified by the grace of God it is thought worthy to be called by the name of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord, notwithstanding that the nature of bread doe still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in it.</hi> And in an other place he saith, <note n="g" place="margin">Chrysost in oper, imperf. homil, xi in Iohannem.</note> 
               <hi>If it be dangerous to conuert sanctified vessels to priuate vses, there not being in them the very body of Christ, but the mystery of his body, &amp;c.</hi> These things haue so clere euidence of truth taught in those times that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath no way to answere but to inuent this shift, that <note n="h" place="margin">Bellar, de Sacr, Euchar lib. 2, cap, 22</note> a certaine Disciple of <hi>Berengarius</hi> did insert and interlace it. But who it was, or when it was, or how it was disclosed and detected, he cannot tell, and therfore it may iustly be denyed, seeing ofhim it cannot be confirmed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this were an easie way to answere all allegations and authorities, to say they are corrupted by heretikes, if such counterfeit coine might go for good payment. Thus far of this matter. Now if so great variety and dissention bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in this one controuersie of the sacrament of the supper, to which we might adde infinite moe: what an huge heape of differences should wee finde among them, if wee should run ouer al the controuersies lying between vs. Let them therefore neuer obiect against vs our diuisions, or tell vs of the motes they espy in vs: let them rather reconcile themselues one to another, and pul out the beames out of


<pb facs="tcp:16298:223"/>
their owne eies, or else for shame hold their peace: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les among vs they shal neuer finde greater doubts and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, then haue been among the children and churches of God. Now for our further direction touching this point ofdissentionsin the church, lately &amp; largely debated by this enimy as the cheef obiect and subiect of his <hi>Warn-word,</hi> and <note place="margin">Foure profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> dilated through many chap. as welbecame a man of his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and learning: I wil insist a while vpon this point, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obserue with me these 4. things. First, that vnity is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of the Church. Secondly, that dissention is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Church. Thirdly, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been and is at this present ful of contentions. Lastly, that this discourse of diuisions in our church may bee taken vp of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and vsed against christ and christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so that while they seeke to giue vs a blow, they reach a sword into the enimies hand to cut the hart-strings of their owne cause. <note place="margin">Vnity often-times out of the church.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the first thing, all agreement among men, is no sufficient proofe of the goodnesse of the matter wherin they agree, inasmuch as all malefactors and enemies of the gospell haue a kind of agreement. There are agreements in idolatry, in adultery, in robbery, in conspiracy, in murthers, in mutinies, and in all mannet of impieties, which are al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to God, and hateful to men. When al the earth was of one tongue and language, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen, xi, 6</note> they all conspired in building the tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> They that worshipped the Golden calfe, saide <note n="k" place="margin">Exod, 32, 3</note> all with one consent, <hi>these are thy Gods ô Israell, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> So the Apostles out of Psal. 2. declare, <note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 2, 1, 2 cum act. 4, 26</note> that the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Romaines,</hi> the state ciuell and Ecclesiastical confederated together, did al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and conspire against God and against his anoynted. There was an agreement <note n="m" place="margin">Num. 16, xi</note> betweene <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> with their rebellious companies and consorts, ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and combined together against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> The ten tribes agreed in worshipping the golden calues in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell.</hi> The Priestes of <hi>Baall</hi> consented <note n="n" place="margin">King. 22, 13</note> together against <hi>Michaiah</hi> the true prophet ofGod.</p>
            <p>Al the people with <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 27. 22</note> one mind and with one mouth cried against christ, let him bee crucified. And <hi>Iohn</hi>

that great <note n="p" place="margin">Reue, 13, 16</note> and smal, rich and poor, bond and free should agree in following and worshipping Antichrist the enemy of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as vnity is oftentimes out of the church, so sometime <hi rend="sup">q</hi> dissention is in the church. The true members of the church haue not alwaies in outwarde thinges, nor in matters of faith one mind and meaning. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> louing God and beloued of God, <note n="r" place="margin">Gene. 13, 7</note> dissented in the things of this life, <hi>Iosephes</hi> bretheren hated him without a cause, and persecuted him almost vnto the death. The priests and Princes of the people did dissent from the Prophettes of God. Moreouer, in the houshould and family of Christ, <note n="s" place="margin">Luke 22, 24</note> ambition, enuy, and dissention raigned and remained, as Luk. xxii. <hi>there arose a strife among them which should he the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</hi> And Math. 20, 24. When the other ten <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 20, 24</note> hearde of the ambitious desire of these sonnes of <hi>Zebede,</hi> they disdained at the two brethren. So <hi>Paule</hi> withstood <hi>Peter</hi> to his face, <note n="u" place="margin">Galat. 2, xi</note> because he was to be reprooued, as <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did to <hi>Moses</hi> who was not to be reproued.

               <hi>they were so stirred, that they departed asunder one from another:</hi> which albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it fell out to the good of the church, to the gaine of the gospel, and to the glory of God (who is able to bring good out of euill, as he did light out of darkenes) yet it sheweth their weakenes and wantes, especially of <hi>barnabas,</hi> seeing the spirit of God assigneth the reason whereon <hi>Paul</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe touching his determination, but deliuereth not the reason of <hi>Barnabas</hi> his resolution. Besides, we see Act, xi, they of the circumcision contended against <note n="b" place="margin">actes 11, 2</note> Peter, because he did eat with the vncircumcised. As touching the Corinthians who were a true church, and sanctified in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the apostle saith, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 11</note> 
               <hi>It hath bin declared to me of you by them that are of the house of Cloe, that there are contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you:</hi> and chap, xi <hi>In this that I declare I praise you not, that ye come togither, not with profit but with hurt: for I hear that there are dissentions among you, and I beleeue it to be true in some part, for there must be euen Haeresies among you, that they which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly the church of Rome is so farre from the unity and agreement which they boaste of, that contrarywise it hath bene &amp; is full of contentions and bitter controuersies. If we would search the Histories of former times, we shall finde the contentions and quarrels between them to haue bin infinit and innumerable. Popes haue bin against popes, nay Antipope againste Antipope, when there were two Popes, nay three Popes among them at once: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, cursed, and banned each other to the pit of Hell. <hi>Onuphrius</hi> a popish chronicler, <note n="d" place="margin">Onuphr. in Chro.
