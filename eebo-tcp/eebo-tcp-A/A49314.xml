            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>NOtwithstanding the many, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved Reproaches cast upon Mankind, as if Man by Nature was a very Wolf or Tyger; yet I shall at present so far presume upon the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Scandals (hoping hereafter to prove that they really are so) as freely to expose this small Treatise to thy more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reception. I would willingly suppose thee, and the rest of Mankind, as good and gentle as possibly I could, so far as with Truth and Prudence I might do it; yet I do not here go about to flatter thee into good nature, or to impose upon thy Iudgment, by bespeaking thy Affections.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, if we consult the present state of Affairs, if we look into our selves at
<pb facs="tcp:104464:4"/>
home, or consider the Practices of the <hi>World</hi> abroad, we shall not find such an universal Love and Benignity to prevail therein, as the Poets describe in their Golden Age, or such as we might certainly have experienc'd, had Man continued in Innocence. But then, to assert Humane Nature in general, as the great Patroness of all Vice and Villany, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis now faln from its original perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and adulterated with some vicious mixtures, is just as if we should say, that there is no Gold in the mass of Ore, because mixt with greater quantity of Dross or Sand. That which I here design, in reference to Humane Nature, is Likeness, rather than Curiosity: So that I must not so far favour thee, as to represent thee without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or Imperfection; nor yet be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, as to draw both Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and thee in particular, so much like Devils, as some have gone about to do.</p>
            <p>I shall not here make any Apology for the publication of these few Papers, nor trouble thee with those many pretended Reasons, the commonness whereof makes <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m suspected, even then, when perhaps they may be real: If upon thy perusal thou canst find any tolerable ground of excuse for me, it will be more proper for thee to make, than
<pb facs="tcp:104464:4"/>
for me to plead in my own defence. And thus to thy own Candour I submit'em; nor do they go about to enter into compacts for their own security; nor are they so sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about their own preservation, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any one common Reader to transfer his Right of judging and condemning too, if he so think fit.</p>
            <p>As for those learned persons, from whom I differ in some particulars, I know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unless it be their Learning, is greater than their Candour and Ingenuity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I hope, they will not attribute this my freedom of declaring my own sentiments, to any spirit of contradiction, or to any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure I take in opposing theirs: But there can be no greater Friend to Truth and the Common-wealth of Learning than he, who with calmness and unconcernedness, far from Passion and Personal Reflection, seriously debates things of this nature: And though I may err in my Opinions, or mistake in my Reasonings, yet I will not be confident in 'em; so that I shall still reserve a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of changing my Mind, when either by any kind notice from others, or by my own maturer thoughts, I shall be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: However, I do not pretend to set
<pb facs="tcp:104464:5"/>
up for singularity; if I do err, I err with very good company.</p>
            <p>The Argument here handled has already been variously treated of by learned men, yet the Subject seems not so wholly exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, but that others yet may, with profit both to themselves and others, employ their Meditations hereupon.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of our selves, and of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, was always counted a good Foundation both of Piety towards God, and of Iustice and Charity towards Men; and 'tis probable, that a great many of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that have crept into Religion it self, have been occasion'd by the want either of the true knowledge, or due consideration of our Natures, as rational, and of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Obligations that lye upon us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; for the Scripture doth every where exhort us to the practice of Moral Duties, but doth not go about to explain the natures of 'em, as supposing that sufficiently known to us already.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of greater force, even if possible to patronize Vice and Error, than those powerful Names of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> thus those that have gone about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the one and oppose the other, have yet done it under the plausible pretences of
<pb facs="tcp:104464:5"/>
advancing both. Thus the <hi>Soicks,</hi> whose Tenents were the most contrary to Human Nature, rightly understood, yet did they prevail above, and grow more numerous than any other Sect, and that probably for no other reason than that of their constant boasting of living <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>according to Nature.</hi> Thus the Atheists of our Age op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Reason to Religion, and think they may justly reject the one, seeing they are such devout Proselytes, or at least such great Pretenders to the other. So that there seems to be nothing, wherein all sorts of men, tho' otherwise differing both in Principles and Practices, do more agree than in this, <hi>That there is a certain due Respect owing to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Nature and Reason.</hi> Of what great concernment therefore is it, rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand both these, lest the Devil and his Instruments make use of those very Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which GOD implanted in Man, on purpose to promote the Designs of Virtue and Piety, to the carrying on his own base Ends of Vice and Error.</p>
            <p>Thus we may be sure there is some falsity in the Citation, or some Malice in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, when the Devil quotes Scripture: And the like may be said, that some fallacy is in the Argument, when Reason and Nature
<pb facs="tcp:104464:6"/>
are made use of to patronize Vice and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>My Design then here is, to vindicate the Honour and Innocence of those great and worthy Names, <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> from the bad usage they meet withal, when challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by those unjust Pretenders.</p>
            <p>The nature of the Subject will necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage me in the examination of some of Mr. <hi>Hobbs's</hi> Opinions, which I shall do with as much fairness and impartiality as possibly I can. He has indeed made several ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Observations upon <hi>Human Nature</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but that wherein he seems very often to fail, is, either that he doth not carefully avoid those Faults himself, which he hath justly blam'd in others, or that he sometimes draws universal conclusions only from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular observations; and sometimes from the meer Fact he insers the <hi>jus</hi> of a thing; and from the more general practice of most men, he goes about to justifie that which is not in it self lawful.</p>
            <p>'Tis the <hi>Observation</hi> of a learned man, that a flight and superficial study of Nature and Natural Causes, may encline a man to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism; but a full and perfect understanding of 'em fixes him more firmly in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion and Piety. Thus 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb facs="tcp:104464:6"/>
that it was only Mr. <hi>Hobbs's</hi> superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial observation of Human Nature that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him into those mistakes and false no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it; if he had, by a profounder study and impartial search, enquired into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recesses of it, he would then have found Man not altogether so void of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles of Virtue and Goodness, as he has represented him.</p>
            <p>His political Principles seem to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon no better or surer grounds than the observation of the vicious Inclinations of some, and the prudent and cautious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of others, because some men are violent and injurious, and make no conscience of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrong; others are wary, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly arm themselves, as much as they can, against the receiving of any: From hence he would infer the State of Nature to be a State of War, and all the evil and false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences that follow thence.</p>
            <p>So that the approbation that his Principles have met withal in the World, was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of Mens vicious Inclinations, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proneness to believe such Opinions, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any solid Ground or Reason, on which they were founded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104464:7"/>It might perhaps be some mitigation of his fault herein, if by supposing men worse than they were, he hereby laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Humility and Amendment: But it has been well observed of him, that <hi>he supposed Men worse than they are, and made 'em worse than otherwise they would be,</hi> thus making 'em more the <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> than they were by Nature.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has well observ'd, <q>That Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments seldom work upon Men of Wit and Learning, when they have once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themselves in a contrary Opinion; and that, if any thing will do it, it is the shewing them the Causes of their Errors.</q> I shall accordingly here intimate some few things in general, and leave them to thy own consideration, whether they might not be some ways influential, either as Causes or Occasions of his Mistakes.</p>
            <p>And first, Has he not digged for Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples out of his own Fancy, without consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the universal Consent of Mankind, or the more constant received Opinions of the best and wisest both Moralists and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? For the true knowledge of Human Nature doth not consist only in the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our selves, but it also requires a full and perfect understanding both of Men and
<pb facs="tcp:104464:7"/>
Books. Thus we ought to consider what the best and wisest Men of all Ages have left upon Record concerning their apprehensions of it, and by our own Observations both of our selves and others, either more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, or prudently correct, what they have deliver'd. And though, 'tis true, there may be, as it were, a mechanical use of Books, an enslaving a Man's Reason to his Reading, without a due examination or just digestion of what we read, into our own Reason and Iudgment; yet there are some who have fallen into Mistakes, by being more conversant with their own Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than with other mens Writings: Or, if he hath been a great consulter of Authors, yet doth he not seem rather <hi>afferre quàm au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre sensum,</hi> doth he not come to 'em with Prejudice, and with a Resolution rather to elude, than fully to answer their Reasons? How doth he sometimes seem to march boldly into his Enemy's Country, and leave their greatest strength behind him, never regarding to answer the Reasons upon which the contrary Opinion is founded? Doth he not seem also to suit his Principles to the Times wherein he writ, rather than to the Truth of things, yet always in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, and pursuance of his own grand
<pb facs="tcp:104464:8"/>
Principle os <hi>Self-preservation?</hi> Seems he not sometimes to affect Novelty more than Truth, being perhaps more desirous to be the Author of a New Error, than the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Old Truth?</p>
            <p>In his Introduction to the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> he tells us, <q>That there is a Saying much usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of late, That <hi>Wisdom is acquired not by reading Books, but Men;</hi> consequently here upon those persons that for the most part can give no other Proof of being Wise, take great delight to shew what they think they have read in Man, by uncharitable Censures <hi>behind their Backs.</hi>
               </q> But doth not he himself here lye under his own lash? Doth he not seem to please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in uncharitable censuring of what he thinks (but without just grounds) he hath read, not only in Particular Persons, but in Human Nature in general? Here we may observe how, like the troublesome Fly, he is always busie about the Sores of Human Nature; not with an intent to cure 'em, but to make 'em worse. How much more worthy of a Man, a Philosopher and a Christian too, was <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> Advice, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Whensoever thou wouldst rejoyce thy self, call to mind the several Gifts and Virtues of those whom thou dost daily converse with,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>Industry of one, the Modesty of another, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of a third,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for nothing can so much rejoyce thee, as the Resemblances and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels of several Virtues eminent in those that live with thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we may also observe the many Straits and Difficulties he is sometimes put to in defending his Opinions, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of Notions and Expressions he is forced to use in making out his Assertions, or answering the Objections that are brought against 'em; so that sometimes his Notions seem to lye a-cross his Brains, as the Cudgels of his natural Statesmen did to each others Heads. Thus, when 'tis objected, <q>That if a Son kill the Father in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he doth him an injury; he answers, That we cannot at any time suppose a Son in the state of Nature, as being under the power and command of those to whom he owes his Protection, as soon as he was born.</q> But seeing we cannot suppose the propagation of Mankind any other way, than by Father and Son, and that there is a natural obligation incumbent on a Son to his Father, may we not with more reason say, That there never was, nor could be, such a state of Nature as he describes, rather than that therein there can be no Son suppos'd?
<pb facs="tcp:104464:9"/>
2. Tho' Sons be under the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of those to whom, under God, they owe their Beings and Preservations, doth this take away their Obligations, as Sons? Do they therefore cease to be Sons, because now they are also become Subjects? This way of reasoning cannot hold good, unless we suppos'd Men in the state of Nature to spring out of the Earth, like Mushromes.</p>
            <p>That which at present I would only infer from hence, is a great presumption, at least, of the falseness of such Principles, seeing Truth always lyes so plain and easie, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in things of this nature, so consistent with our natural Apprehensions, and with all other Truths, both natural and revealed, that it stands not in need of such perplexed ways and methods for its own defence.</p>
            <p>Nor is Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> the only man that hath made false representations of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; there are also some foreign Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who have been very obnoxious in this Particular. <hi>Cuperus,</hi> in his <hi>Arcana Atheismi,</hi> 9. &amp; 10. <hi>cb.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> denies all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledge of God, and all Natural Difference betwixt Good and Evil: And in his <hi>Proeme, p.</hi> 2, 3. he makes Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be <hi>ratiocinatio ex innatis homini affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctibus &amp; passionibus legitimè deducta:</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:104464:9"/>
this farther account he gives of these Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>Affectus &amp; passiones Iesu Christi mandatis contrarias, sive quae nos ad ea, quae ipse prohibuit, sectanda stimulant, per se &amp; suâ na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ non esse malas, nec expeccato originali ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>láve consuetudine ortas existimo.</hi> These seem but bad Principles for Human Nature to proceed upon: And as for right Reason, <hi>Rectam &amp; sanam rationem appello ratiocinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ex claris &amp; apud neminem controversis sacrae Scripturae sensibus, vel ex expressis verbis in scripturâ contentis vel per legitimam consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam elicitas.</hi> This indeed is true, but right Reason, in the just and full nature of it, is of larger extent than arguing meerly from Scripture. And <hi>P. Poiret,</hi> in his <hi>Cogit. ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. de Deo, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. makes all the Reasons of Truth and Goodness to depend wholly upon the Divine Decree; and that nothing is in it self either good or evil, but only as God has been pleased to make it so, and might also, if He had so pleased, have made it quite otherwise. These I shall make some short Reflections upon, and leave the fuller examination thereof to some abler Pen.</p>
            <p>I have not had recourse to Scripture, to prove my Assertions, because my design here is to speak of Man, as guided rather
<pb facs="tcp:104464:10"/>
by Reason than Revelation; and because those I have here to deal with, do more especially appeal thereto: Yet here I cannot but take notice of the strange Humour of some men, who reject some things for those very Reasons, for which they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'em: thus, when they are urg'd with Scripture, they look upon that only as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that would impose upon their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and oblige 'em to a blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as if it designed only to erect an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary government over the Minds of Men, without giving any reason of its Commands. But though they will not give these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the credit and authority justly due to 'em, upon account of their divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it would be unreasonable to reject 'em, and the things therein contained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have enquir'd into the Reasons, and credibility of 'em; which if they vouchsase to do, I doubt not but, as our Saviour said in another case, <hi>If ye believe not me, yet believe my Works:</hi> So here, tho' they believe not the Scriptures for their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet they will at least be convinc'd by the Reason contain'd in 'em. Thus a learned <hi>Prelate</hi> of our Church; <hi>Tho' sacred Authors have little authority with Atheists, speaking as meer Witnesses, yet when their Testimony is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:104464:10"/>
also with the highest Reason, those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be acknowledg'd and answer'd, though the Author be rejected.</hi> Nor do I here insist much upon the authorities even of Heathen Authors, being willing so far to comply with the Humours of some of the present Age, as only to appeal to mens unprejudic'd Reasons, whether what is here humbly propos'd to consideration be true or no; for, if what is writ by any one be not in it self reasonable, I know no authorities great enough to make it so: Only, if any think that the concurrent Testimonies of such Authors may add any strength to the things here handled, I doubt not, but they, who have been but moderately conversant in those Writers, may easily furnish themselves with such authorities from their own read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and observation.</p>
            <p>I shall here advertise the Reader one thing further, That whereas I have frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of making use of these words, <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> I there take 'em according to the acceptation of our old English Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in the sense wherein the ancient moral Philosophers formerly took 'em, that is, to signifie much what the same thing with Good and Evil, Sin and Duty, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing 'em founded upon something more
<pb facs="tcp:104464:11"/>
sixt and certain than the Custom of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or the Mode and Fashion of those with whom we do converse.</p>
            <p>I should have counted this a needless Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement, but that I find the ingenious Author of the <hi>Essay of Human Understanding, p. 158, 159, &amp;c.</hi> telling us, That <hi>the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of what is every where called and esteemed Virtue and Vice, is his Approbation or Dislike, Praise or Blame, which by a secret and tacite consent establishes it self in the several Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Tribes and Clubs of Men in the World; so that Virtue is every where that which is thought praise-worthy; and nothing else but that which has the allowance of publick esteem, is Virtue.</hi> And here he quotes <hi>Cicero, Tusc. lib. 2. Nihil habet natura praestantius, quàm honestatem, quàm laudem, quàm dignitatem, quam decus:</hi> Which he says, <hi>are all Names for the same thing.</hi> But here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that he puts <hi>Honesty</hi> in the first place, then <hi>Praise, viz.</hi> such as is consequent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; <hi>quàm dignitatem,</hi> that is, that Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature, which is the greatest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Man. The same Author of that Essay hath much better explain'd the sense of the old Heathen Philosophers upon this Subject, <hi>p. 17. If one of those had been asked,</hi> (here, I suppose, the Question should not
<pb facs="tcp:104464:11"/>
have been propounded, as before, Why a Man must keep his <hi>word;</hi> but rather thus, why a Man should not break his <hi>word) he would have answer'd, because it was dishonest, below the Dignity of a Man, and opposite to Virtue, the highest perfection of Human Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>the Dignity of a Man,</hi> I suppose, was here meant the same that <hi>Tully</hi> meant by his, that is, the Dignity of Human Nature, consider'd in it self, not with respect to the accidentally good or bad Opinion that Men might entertain of it. But he further tells us, <hi>p. 159.</hi> That <hi>the Exhortations of inspired Teachers have not feared to appeal to common Repute. Whatsoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 4. 8. But the Apostle doth not here appeal to common Repute <hi>absolutely,</hi> but with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain restriction and limitation, that Men do not confound the notions of Good and Evil, <hi>whatever things are of good report,</hi> with this Proviso, that there be any Virtue, or any such Praise as is <hi>virtutis comes,</hi> then we are to think on 'em.</p>
            <p>But then he says, That <hi>since nothing can be more natural than to encourage with Esteem and Reputation that wherein every one finds his advantage, and to blame and discountenance the contrary; 'tis no wonder, that Esteem and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit,
<pb facs="tcp:104464:12"/>
Virtue and Vice, should in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure every where correspond with the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rule of Right and Wrong,</hi> &amp;c. But then suppose Men should so far mistake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as to place their Commondation or Blame on that side that really deserves it not, (and such a thing may possibly sometimes happen) would this alter the nature of things, and make Vice Vertue, and Virtue Vice?</p>
            <p>Lastly, Tho' thou dost not find in these Papers that profoundness of Thought, that depth of Reasoning, that may be elsewhere met withal; yet, I hope, what is here offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is free and natural, easie and obvious, and therefore probably not less true, but more useful; for I never look'd upon Intricacy and Obscurity either as any certain sign of Truth, or any ways to promote the Benefit and Advantage of the Reader.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the</hi> Nature <hi>and</hi> Excellency <hi>of the Knowledge of a Man's Self.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE true <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Value</hi> of a Thing, consists either in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Nature, or in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it bears to us; either that it is in it self Excellent, or to us Useful: Now both these meet together in the <hi>Knowledge of a Man's Self;</hi> this being that which so nearly concerns us, that no one ought in Honour to be ignorant of it. Thus those whose ancient Families, or personal Merits, have Entituled to a <hi>Coat of Arms,</hi> do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally think themselves bound, at least, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to such a degree of Skill in <hi>Heraldry,</hi> as to be able to <hi>Blazon them.</hi> So would it be a Disparagement to a Man, as such, to be owner of so many and great <hi>Excellencies of Nature,</hi> and not rightly to understand them; not to be able to derive their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from their <hi>first</hi> and <hi>divine Original;</hi> not fully to know, and duly to consider that nobleness and generosity of Action, which even his Order obliges him to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104464:15"/>Now since there is no more effectual Way or Method to recommend a Thing truly Excellent, than only fully to explain it; I shall therefore shew wherein the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this <hi>Knowledge of a Man's Self</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his <hi>Introduction to his</hi> Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan, hath justly found fault with those, who so understand that saying, <hi>Nosce te ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, As hereby either to countenance the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous State of Men in power towards their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, or to encourage those of a low Degree, to a sawcy Behaviour to their Betters:</hi> But then whether he has been as happy in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing the true meaning of it himself, as he was in observing the salse Interpretation thereof in others, may be justly doubted: his Interpretation is this; <q>This, <hi>says he,</hi> teaches us, that from the Similitudes of Thoughts and Passions of one Man, to the Thoughts and Passions of another, whosoever looks into himself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders what he doth, <hi>when he thinks, reasons, opines, hopes, fears,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and upon what Grounds,</hi> he shall hereby read and know, what are the Thoughts and Passions of all other Men upon the like Occasions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104464:15"/>Now this Explication of his seems liable to this Inconvenience, that it makes each Man in particular the Rule and Measure of Humane Nature in general, by attending to the Grounds and Reasons of his own Thoughts aed Passions, to judge the very same of all others; so that according to this, Humane Nature must appear to the World, according to the false Notions or vicious Affections of those who represent it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the accidentally good or bad Dispositions of those who undertake to give an account of it. Thus, because the blood-shot Eye of one Man's mind repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents all things in red Colours; therefore must Cruelty be the immediate and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Dictate of Nature. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the very next Sentence he adds: <q>
                     <hi>I say,</hi> The Similitude of Passions which are the same in all Men; <hi>Desire, Fear, Hope, &amp;c.</hi> Not the Similitude of the Objects of the Passions, which are the Things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siŕed, fear'd, hoped, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For these the Constitution individual and particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation do so vary, and they are so easie to be kept from our Knowledge, that the Characters of Man's Heart are legible only to him, who searcheth the Heart.</q> But how can we possibly gather the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104464:16"/>
of other Men's Thoughts and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from our own, without any relation they bear to their respective Objects; for from the consideration of our Thoughts and Passions abstracted from their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we could only inser the Similitude of ours with other Men's, meerly as bare Acts and Operations of the Soul; that is, that the Soul in its respective exercise of its Thoughts and Passions, acts or suffers after the same manner in all Men: but now this would be nothing to his purpose. But surther, when he says, <hi>Whoever looks into himself, and considers what he doth, when he thinks, opines, hopes, fears, &amp;c. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Grounds.</hi> Now how can a Man consider upon what Grounds and Reasons he desires, or fears, without respect to the Objects of those several Passions; for Men desire or fear, either because the Things desir'd or fear'd, are really <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> for 'em, or at least apprehended as such: Nor can any just or full Account be given of our Passions abstracted from their Objects. So that Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> by his seemingly distinct stating of the <hi>Question,</hi> takes only the greater pains to blunder the whole Matter. But to return:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104464:16"/>This <hi>Knowledge of our selves</hi> includes in it these following Particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It includes the <hi>Knowledge of our selves,</hi> as consisting of two distinct Principles of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> together with a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Nature and Properties of both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A right understanding of the mutual Relations and respective Influences, that each hath upon the other by vertue of their Union: Hence are we taught not to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the brisker Motions of the Blood, or a more slorid temper of Body for the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the holy Spirit; nor the more black melancholy temper of Mind, sor a severe and religious Reservedness, with some; or for the Frowns of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> or the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of the <hi>Divine Displeasure</hi> against us, with others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It includes in it the <hi>true Knowledge of our Original Perfections,</hi> and how far they are impair'd by the Fall, both what God made us at first in the state of <hi>Innocence,</hi> and what we have now made our selves by our <hi>Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Knowledge of the right use of our Faculties,</hi> as also a due consideration of the <hi>Ends,</hi> for which God gave us such <hi>Souls,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104464:17"/>
and a due care of acting in Conformity thereunto.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               </p>
               <p>Now, that which further speaks the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Knowledge,</hi> is, That it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends not the ordinary Capacities of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Understanding, nor discourages us with the Difficulty, much less with the Impossibility of the Thing; the <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> so far as he has any ways <hi>made known himself to us,</hi> and the <hi>Knowledge of our Selves</hi> in the utmost extent of it: This God hath made our Duty, and therefore hath not plac'd it out of the compass of those <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> which he hath given us. Not but that there are some Things in this lesser, as well as in that greater <hi>World,</hi> which are above our <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104464:17"/>
viz. <hi>The Mode of the Union of our Soul and Body; whether our Souls praeexist, or no, &amp;c.</hi> But these few Things which are unknowable, ought not to discourage us in the search of those Things we may know, especially in Things of a more practical Concernment: only here we may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That those <hi>Natural Mysteries</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, if I may so call'em, may be made use of to teach us Modesty and Submission of our <hi>Understandings</hi> in Things of a more <hi>Divine Concern.</hi> Thus even <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> tell us, <hi>That God on purpose consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted some unsolvable Difficulties in Nature, to teach men not over-highly to value their own Understandings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Knowledge of our Selves</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon surer Principles, than any other Study Men commonly give themselves unto, particularly than those two <hi>famous Mistresses</hi> of most Men's Courtship, <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> and <hi>Philology:</hi> as for <hi>Philosophy,</hi> though, I believe, that it has arriv'd at as high a degree of Perfection in this Age, as in any known Age of the World; (and it is to no purpose to talk of what might possibly be in those other, of which we have no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, no Records remaining;) yet it may be justly question'd, Whether <hi>Truth</hi> it self
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104464:18"/>
was ever yet pull'd out of that Pit, in which the <hi>Ancients</hi> plac'd it, considering the several <hi>Hypotheses</hi> now extant in <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> each embrac'd with equal eagerness, and as their respective Followers think, with equal appearance of Reason: And <hi>Philology,</hi> that labours under these two Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, that it is commonly founded upon no better Grounds, than meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture and Probability; so that it must be <hi>great good Fortune,</hi> if its <hi>Archers</hi> chance to hit the <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Subject-matter of those <hi>Enquiries</hi> are many times of such small Concernment, that it is no great matter whether they do or no: only both these are then best em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, when they are made use of to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain</hi> or <hi>consirm</hi> some <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>divine Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Knowledge of our Selves</hi> doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally load us to the Knowledge, 1. <hi>Of the Being of God. 2. Of the Nature of God. 3. Of the Worship of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus we come to the <hi>Knowledge of the Being of God,</hi> in as much as at first he stamp'd such <hi>lively Characters of Himself upon our Minds,</hi> as speak their <hi>Author:</hi> Thus both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> tell us, <hi>That God did not leave himself without a Witness either in the greater or lesser World.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104464:18"/>
I know there are some, who deny any such Natural Notions or <hi>Idea's</hi> at all, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>this of God;</hi> but I hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereof, in the Sequel of the Discourse, will appear both <hi>piously</hi> and <hi>rationally cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</hi> God at first Created us after <hi>His own Image</hi> or <hi>Similitude;</hi> more especially in respect of the <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>moral Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Mind:</hi> Now this seems most naturally to suppose something actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent in the <hi>Soul,</hi> wherein this Similitude or Resemblance should consist, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a <hi>bare capacity</hi> or <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> afterwards.</p>
               <p>And by reslecting upon these, we come to the <hi>Knowledge of him, whose Image and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription they bear:</hi> Thus do we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more perfectly behold the <hi>Sun,</hi> by looking downwards into the Water, than we can possibly do with a direct Eye.</p>
               <p>I shall not here enter into a particular examination of that Argument; <hi>How far the</hi> Idea <hi>or Notion of God in our Minds doth prove his real Existence:</hi> This being already so excellently done by the <hi>Learned Bishop of</hi> Worcester, <hi>in his</hi> Orig. Sacrae, <hi>and by Dr.</hi> Cudworth <hi>in his</hi> Systeme, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Only we may observe, That since <hi>Moral Arguments</hi> do not, as <hi>Mathematical ones do,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104464:19"/>
force Assent; but suppose certain Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Subject, upon which their Prevalency doth in a great measure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: therefore I conceive, the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive force of this Argument, is greater to a sober and considerate Person within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, than perhaps it will appear to others: For that which is very apt to prevail with such an one, is to consider, how agreeable this Notion of a <hi>Deity</hi> is to all his <hi>Faculties,</hi> how consistent with all those Principles of <hi>Tru<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> which he any ways finds lodg'd in his <hi>Soul:</hi> So that from the Consonancy of these, how they mutually defend and support each other; nay, how there could scarce be any Notions at all either of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> without the supposition of a <hi>God:</hi> Hence a considerate and ingenuous Person is much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirm'd in the belief of the <hi>Thing.</hi> Thus <hi>D.

               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Knowledge of our Selves,</hi> we come to the <hi>Knowledge of the Nature of God,</hi> for we are conscious to our selves of some Actions; <hi>viz, Those of Cogitation, beyond
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104464:19"/>
the power of Matter to perform,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ascrib'd to some Being of greater <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi> than meer <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is capable of, that is, to a <hi>Spirit.</hi> Hence we infer, first, the <hi>Immateriality of our own Souls,</hi> and then the <hi>Spirituality of the Divine Nature;</hi> because what ever real and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Perfection</hi> we find in our selves, that in the highest degree must we <hi>attribute to God.</hi> Here I shall first prove the <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality of our own Souls;</hi> and then make good the Consequence; when from thence we infer the <hi>Spirituality of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 1. The <hi>Immateriality of our own Souls,</hi> or what is the same, that <hi>Matter</hi> cannot think; and this one would almost think a needless undertaking, to prove that which the common sense of <hi>Mankind</hi> doth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree in; that being a thing in a great measure self-evident, it will be the more difficult, by any other Argument, to prove it. The most effectual, if not the only way to do it, is to shew the strange and absurd Consequences that would follow from the contrary Assertion. There seems no greater Argument against the <hi>possibility of Matters thinking,</hi> than the <hi>unsuccessfulness of their Attempts,</hi> and the <hi>improbability of their Ways and Methods,</hi> who have gone about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104464:20"/>
it. First, They grant that <hi>Matter</hi> it self, unless so and so <hi>modify'd,</hi> cannot <hi>think;</hi> and it is altogether <hi>unconceivable,</hi> how ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>tenuity of the Parts,</hi> or the <hi>most vigorous Motion</hi> should add to it any <hi>principle of perception,</hi> which otherwise of its own <hi>nature</hi> it was destitute of: nor is it render'd the more <hi>intelligible,</hi> by placing, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> doth, the <hi>Nature</hi> of it in <hi>Re-action,</hi> this being only such a particular kind of <hi>motion,</hi> with respect to the terms <hi>à quo,</hi> and <hi>ad quem;</hi> as if <hi>Reflection in the Soul,</hi> which is an inward consciousness to our selves of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> was the same with, or could be any ways explain'd by <hi>Re-actoin</hi> or <hi>Reflection in Matter.</hi> I might as well argue thus, That because <hi>Angulus reflectionis est aequalis angulo incidentiae:</hi> Therefore if <hi>Matter</hi> cannot <hi>think</hi> in its <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,</hi> neither can it in its <hi>reflected motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it any ways conceivable, how sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Atoms should grow into greater Wits, only by jumping and running their heads against one another: nor will Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization any whit help the matter: for suppose a Company of plenipotentiary particles sent from the material Universe to the no less material Soveraign the Soul, to treat about some grand astairs of State;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104464:20"/>
these while they rid on briskly in a direct Road, might perhaps have their heads full of Intrigues, and Politicks: but then when they came into those many cross Ways, which they must necessarily meet withall in Organized Bodies, they will then probably either lose themselves, or forget their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; and when they came to Court, find their heads fraught with nothing, but some certain cross questions, which they pick'd up by the way.</p>
               <p>Further, It would be very hard, for the Patrons of this Mechanick Hypothesis to assign the respective Modes of action and re-action to the several modes of Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what kind of Motion it is that causes assent, what dissent; what kind of agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the particles is required to cause under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and how distinguished from that of the Will: and then supposing that after a great deal of ill plac'd pains, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass their designs, and be able to solve all the modes of cogitation, as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> has all the variety of Colours, only by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious motions, figures and disposition of the particles; besides the improbability of the thing, it can never arrive at greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that whatever way they pitch upon, we may, with as good reason, assign the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104464:21"/>
just contrary. Now seeing, according to this Hypothesis, Assent and Dissent, Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Negation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must consist in such a respective motion and agitation of the particles; how can any one secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or others, that a saction of the dissenting Particles (for Example) or such a motion, as causes dissent, may not rise up, when the nature of the thing requires the contrary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and by this means erect a <hi>Babel</hi> in Man, and bring all into confusion.</p>
               <p>Further, If Cogitation consist only in the various motion and disposition of the Atoms, then <hi>Phaeton</hi> might possibly produce a greater and more undoubted Deity out of his flaming Chariot, than that of his Father <hi>Phoebus.</hi> If this Hypothesis be true, then <hi>Ex quovis ligno fiat Mercurius,</hi> and the Chair may be as infallible, as he that sits, in it; and this perhaps might gratifie some Men in the World, all other methods failing, thus to solve Infallibility by mechanick Principles. Pardon me, if in a ferious argument I thus seem to trifle, seeing, those I have here to deal withal, first taught me the way. For herein they seem rather to give an Essay of their own extravagant Fancies, than to perswade others, that they themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their own Assertions. But to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104464:21"/>These Men must either assert, That there neither is, nor can be any such thing as Spirit in the World; or if there be, that it is impossible for such a being to cogitate; neither of which will they be ever able to prove. As for the being of a Spirit, they do indeed, with as much strength of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as weakness of Reason, tell us, that the Notion thereof includes in it a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; tho' this they do not as much as attempt to prove any other way, than first by supposing a material Universe, and that nothing but matter is contained in it. But this is to beg, not prove the Question.</p>
               <p>But the Essences of things being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, the Notion of a Spirit seems as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and intelligible, as that of matter: for we may as easily conceive of one thing, to which we attribute cogitation, as its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate property; as we do of another, to which we ascribe extension and impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. And then supposing a Spirit, Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seems the natural result of such a being; Tho' I do not here go about to explain the particular way and manner, how Spirits think; for it is hard to conceive, how their own Native penetrability, or the reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themselves upon themselves does any ways explain the manner of Cogitation. We
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104464:22"/>
must satisfy our selves with this which is as far as our most exact Searches will extend to, That first and immediate properties are not demonstrable of their Subjects, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to the things themselves, nor as to the modes.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Sharron,</hi> in his <hi>Book of Wisdom, lib. 1. ch. 7.</hi> tells us that Spirits and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <hi>according to the opinion of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and our greatest Divines, are corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real:</hi> Here he cites <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Basil, Gregory,</hi> &amp;c. The Names he mentions, but not their Assertions, or the Places, where they say so: But this being a general accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, we may as easily deny it, as he assert it. But as for those places which perhaps may seem to favour his assertion, I doubt not but they may, and have already receiv'd easy Solutions from one of these general considerations: 1. That either they assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the opinion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> who yet were no favourers of an universal corporei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> That Souls were never in a perfect State of Separation from all Body, but had certain etherial Vehicles; and so in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect might partake in some Sense, of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Nature. Or 2. He doth not rightly interpret those places of the Fathers, where perhaps sometimes body or matter may be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104464:22"/>
ascribed to the Soul or Angels: but then by Body, there, is to be meant nothing but Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or Essence. So that their Sense was good and orthodox, though their Expressions might be liable to exception: and yet, I think, it is only <hi>Tertullian</hi> that expresses himself in that manner.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Sharron</hi> goes on and tells us, That <hi>Whatever is Created, being compared with God, is gross, corporeal, material; and only God incorporeal.</hi> I would willingly here be so charitable, as to think that such was his aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful respect and veneration of the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that he would not easily grant any thing else to partake of the same generical nature. Far be it from me to speak any thing, that may in the least derogate from the excellency of the Divine Essence; only we may consider, that it is no honour done to that, to depress other things below that just Order wherein God has placed them. This seems but a piece of Will-worship, and something like the Opinion of those, who think they cannot sufficiently magnifie God's love to some, unless they absolutely damn all the rest: thus also, as if we could not sufficiently magnifie the Spirituality of the Divine Nature, unless we dispose all other beings into the rank and Order of Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104464:23"/>
2. Though I do not assert this, yet I would propound it to consideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not be possible for the nature of a Spirit to admit of degrees of excellence, <hi>as to the very Essence and Substance thereof:</hi> and not only in respect of its more accidental per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yet so, as that which we suppose of the lower order, to be perfectly Spiritual, and contain nothing of Corporeity in it: and perhaps the <hi>Logicians</hi> meant this, when they called God <hi>Super-Substantia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he says further, if it appear, <hi>That Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits change their place, the very change shows they are moveable, divisible, subject to time, and the successions thereof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which are all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Body.</hi> But here I would only ask, Whether the existence of a Spirit be possible, or whether God could have created such a being, or no? If he could, then his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves nothing: for supposing such a being, it must move, and be in a place just in such a manner, as we now suppose Souls and Angels to be and move: and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have the same force, if we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppos'd, or were on all sides assur'd of the actual being, that it has now. So that it either proves the impossibility of a Spirit, or else nothing at all to the purpose; this being only such an objection or such a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104464:23"/>
as would lye against an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth.</p>
               <p>I should now <hi>Secondly</hi> show, how from hence we justly infer the Spirituality of the Divine Nature. But I shall not need to spend any time herein: for though there have been some, who, granting the immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality of the Divine Nature, have yet assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Corporeity of the Soul; yet there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any, who granting the Soul to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, ever asserted God to be Corporeal. As for those who assert a material Universe, and a Corporeal Deity, they may perhaps <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ponere,</hi> but indeed they do <hi>re tollere Deum.</hi> For a Corporeal Deity is inconsistent with the Notion we have of God, uncapable of the Perfections we ascribe to him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perform such actions as do properly belong to such a being: But however those, who thus suppose a Corporeal God, do also suppose a Corporeal Soul.</p>
               <p>Thus from the <hi>Knowledge of our Selves</hi> we come to the Knowledge of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence also we come to the Knowledge of the true Nature of the Divine worship, that seeing we consist of Soul and Body, therefore must we offer both to God, as our reasonable Service for external So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; and outward performances are not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104464:24"/>
to be excluded out of the Divine Worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because those immoderate preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Spirituality are either the natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or necessary results of Enthusiasm and Fanaticism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By excluding those outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Testimonies of our inward Devotion towards God, we give occasion of Scandal to Heathens and those that are without; for they would be apt either to entertain low and mean thoughts themselves; or at least think that we did so, of that God, whom we, for ought they perceiv'd, did so rudely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But then on the other hand, we must have a more especial regard to the Soul, for without this, all our other performances are nothing but mere formality and hypocrisy.</p>

               <p>WHAT was the State and Condition of the Soul before its Union with the Body, whether it enjoy'd any State of Praeexistence, or was then first created, when

first put into the Body; or if it did praeexist, then in what manner, whether in a pure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from all matter, or in conjunction with an etherial Vehicle, is not my design here to examine: only 'tis observable, that in things of this Nature, where inclination rather than any cogent Reasons of belief take place; in things where Providence hath not thought fit to give us a certain or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate truth of things, there Men are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determin'd to this or that side of the question, by very accidental considerations (as in this case of Praeexistence) by the more or less favourable apprehensions they may have receiv'd of the Platonick or Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Philosophy; or by those previous notions they have entertain'd of Providence, to which they think this or that Opinion may seem more agreeable.</p>
               <p>Nor, <hi>Secondly,</hi> shall I consider Man in his Natural or Physical capacity; that which I here design being an Essay of Moral or Political, rather than of Natural Philosophy: I shall not here enquire into the more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable modes of Sensation or Intellection; much less shall I attempt to explain those natural Mysteries of Humane Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> The particular mode of the Souls union with the Body: being discouraged therefrom, by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104464:25"/>
the difficulties of the thing, and the unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful attempts of some who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to effect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claubergius</hi> hath a discourse particularly <hi>de conjunctione Anime &amp; Corporis;</hi> but whether he has left it any whit more plain and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible than he found it, I shall submit it to the judgment of those, who will take the pains to peruse it. His way is this, The Soul, says he, is united to the Body by those mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al actions, that pass betwixt 'em; but more especially by those more confused operations of sense, and by the less distinct perceptions of mind. And in his 37th <hi>chap.</hi> he tells us, that <hi>homo alius alio, &amp; idem seipso, diver so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, magis minúsve homo censeri debet:</hi> For according to him, the denomination of a Man, as such, consists chiefly in such an union of the Soul and Body, which is more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform'd by the operations of Sense. Now I see not, why that especially should denominate us men, wherein we come the nearest to the nature of Brutes: nor is there any reason why a Contemplative Person, one who enjoys a more quick and lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his higher faculties, why such a one should not be counted as much, yea more a Man, than he that lives more by sense. That the Soul doth make use more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104464:25"/>
of the Body and Bodily representations in these actions of sense, is very true; but if we enquire farther how it is joyned to the Body even in these more confused operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the difficulty would perhaps still return.</p>
               <p>Nor shall I here dispute, whether the Soul immediately upon the dissolution of the whole Frame, or of the more principal Parts of the Body, doth thereupon by its own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity quit its station, and launch into those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown Regions: or whether besides this, there be not also requir'd (which seems as probable) as immediate an act of God, to take it out, as there was to put it into the Body: only we may observe, that God, both by the light of Nature and his reveal'd Law, hath made the union of the Soul and Body so sacred, that it now becomes abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unlawful for us, by laying violent hands upon our selves, to separate those, whom God hath thus strictly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that whatever natural tye it is under, as to the Body, 'tis certain it ought not to quit its Station, without a lawful Warrant from its great Commander.</p>
               <p>I shall here rather state the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and show their several errors and mistakes on either hand: the one by ascribing too little to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104464:26"/>
Body, and too much to the Soul; the other by attributing too much to the Body, and too little to the Soul, in the Accounts they give of humane Nature. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> would make Man so wholly rational, that they will scarce allow him to be sensible, and would wholly exclude all natural affections and bodily passions out of humane Nature: and the <hi>Epicureans</hi> on the contrary, make all the most noble Actions of the Soul meerly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the designs of such Pleasure, as is really below the true happiness of the Soul. By the Body here I understand all those passions and affections of the mind, which belong to Men more immediately upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Body, all those motions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the inferiour appetites, so far as they are natural.</p>
               <p>The Design therefore of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> to root these Passions out of Humane Nature, is, <hi>First,</hi> impossible: <hi>Secondly,</hi> it would be prejudicial thereunto, were it feisible; for these when duly regulated, become the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of moral Vertue, and also add Vigour and Wings to the Soul in its pursuits of Vertue.</p>
               <p>Among the many charges brought against <hi>Stoicism,</hi> that of Pride and Arrogance seems the most obvious, and the most unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104464:26"/>
it naturally tending to beget such haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoughts of ones self, as are indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the State and Nature of a frail and depending Creature.</p>
               <p>What a prodigious thing do they make their Wise Man, far above any thing that is called Mortal, and in some respects equal to God himself. As for Repentance, they look upon that as a mean thing, far below the height of their attainments. Innocence indeed is better than Repentance, but for them to pretend unto it, argues a great deal of Pride, founded upon a bad understanding of their own State. But this description which they give of a Wise Man, is of some thing which perhaps they may fancy in their minds, but not of any thing really extant in Nature. These were their undoubted opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and apprehensions herein; but whether their own natural Pride of temper, was the cause of these their extravagant opinions; or whether some other false Scheme of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which they had entertain'd, had in some sort betray'd 'em into this excess of self-conceit, I shall not here determine.</p>
               <p>Tho' perhaps the ignorance of a future state of Rewards and Punishments after this life, joyn'd with their attempt to give an account of that great question, which so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104464:27"/>
much puzled the Heathen World, <hi>Cur bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis malè, &amp; malis bené.</hi> This perhaps might, in some measure, oblige 'em, being not fully assur'd of a future State, to entertain such false opinions of Man's self-sufficiency; so placing all things within his own power, that he needed not to be beholden to any other assistance, but from himself; or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny future expectations to make him happy.</p>
               <p>As for the calamities that befal Men here in this Life, they no ways alter the case in reference to happiness or unhappiness: for those, they say, only reach the Body, which, according to them, has no nearer relation to the Soul, than their Cloaths have to it.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Stoicks</hi> plac'd their happiness, where some sort of <hi>Phanaticks</hi> among us place their Holiness, meerly in the inward Man, without any regard to the outward: as if we could be either Happy or Holy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect at all to one of the essential Parts of our Constitution; as if the inward Man of the one could be holy in the midst of all outward Debaucheries; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man of the other happy in the midst of bodily torments. Thus tho' we grant the Soul to be the Soveraign, yet the Body may justly challenge the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104464:27"/>The other Sect of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who have erred in the other extream, is that of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who attributes too much to the Body: But this, may some say, is too favourable an expression; when as indeed he doth destroy both all Soul in Man, and excludes God out of the World. But my charge here doth not rise so high, it is sufficient for my purpose, what is generally granted by all, that in the account he gives of Man, the Body is too predominant; and the indolency of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, seems far to surpass the tranquillity of the mind. For it cannot be made appear, That <hi>Epicurus by his tranquillity</hi> meant that peace of Conscience and Serenity of Soul, which is the result of a Vertuous and Holy Life; but only that quiet of mind, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the disturbance of business; or those perplexities of mind, which may arise either from Bodily Distempers, or some secret fears and jealousies. Now if that peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good Conscience, in the sense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described, be not meant by tranquillity of mind; then tho' perhaps the word may sound well, yet indeed it falls short of the true and real happiness of the Soul, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses little higher than the concerns of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. We do naturally either make our selves, in some measure, like him whom we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104464:28"/>
or we fancy him, whom we worship, like our selves. Thus <hi>Epicurus</hi> placing the happiness of the Deity in an idle uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd freedom from business, did hence probably assert ours to consist in the same; or else being first strongly perswaded of the excellency of the thing, and being mightily pleased with the agreeableness thereof himself, did thence ascribe it also to the Deity, as that wherein all happiness both Humane and Divine did consist.</p>
               <p>It is indeed unreasonable and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to urge the consequences of an opinion upon the Author, when he does expressly deny those consequences to be his opinion: yet, I think, that he that in words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a God, and yet his Principles are such, as are generally embrac'd by real A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists; such an one is not capable of any just Apology. For there is not the same Reason of all consequences; some are next and immediate, others are distant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote: these of the last sort ought not to be urg'd upon the Author of the opinion, but those of the former may.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Epicurus</hi> did assert the Being of God, and entertained great and honourable thoughts of his Nature, is very certain, as appears out of <hi>Diog. Laertius.</hi> So that none
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104464:28"/>
so charge him with Atheism, as if he did not in words acknowledge a God: that which is here asserted is this, that that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, which flatters him with high and honourable thoughts concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his own intrinsick excellencies, his own happiness and immortality, which yet are but irrespective Attributes, such as bear no relation to us; and in the mean time to assert, that he no ways concerns himself at present, nor will hereafter take any notice to punish or reward Humane Actions. This notion of God lays no Obligation on a Man to holiness of Life, or Obedience to that God, whom in words he thus admires; and is such a Notion of God, as even an Atheist, provided he be not a perfect Mad Man, ought to assert: both because perhaps it may some ways tend to still and quiet the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of natural Conscience, and also as it is safe and customary in respect of those with whom he lives. For we never yet heard of a Kingdom or Common-wealth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, such as make it their business posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and openly to assert and defend the Opinion of Atheism.</p>
               <p>But here 'tis reply'd, That whatever his Principles were in themselves, or what ever bad use others might make of them; yet that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104464:29"/>
he for his part, was a severe practiser of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion. But it may be justly questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether the joynt belief of a Corporeal God and a mortal Soul had ever any good influence upon an holy Life. But suppose <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> in general to be a very Vertuous and Pious Person, and that those contrary impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Vice and Luxury were mere Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals cast upon him by the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> yet we must consider how far, and upon what grounds, and for what ends he thus led a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life: Now it doth not appear, that it was any further than only in order to a pleasant Life; and tho' 'tis true, that Religion and Vertue are the most proper means in order to this end; yet it is not probable, that he so understood his own principles, nor indeed were they capable of being so understood. For supposing that there lyes no obligation upon us to any duty any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as it promotes a pleasant Life, in that sense wherein he takes it; it is easily conceivable how some degrees of Vice may consist with these Principles, provided that they so partake of this days pleasure, that they do not incapacitate themselves for those of to morrow. And tho' he tells us, that the Gods are delighted with the Vertues of Men: yet this is but cold encouragement to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104464:29"/>
the practice of the more difficult Duties of Religion, seeing tho' they do so far take notice of Mens vertuous actions, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to delight themselves; yet not so far, as for the sake thereof, to reward the Men.</p>
               <p>So that if <hi>Epicurus</hi> was vertuous beyond these degrees, that we must impute to the Man, rather than to the <hi>Philosopher;</hi> rather to his vertuous temper, than to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: So that whatever he was, as to his own person; yet, I believe, his followers made but right consequences from his false principles, when they inserr'd, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can the particular excellencies of some of that Sect be any just vindication of any false principle or wicked practice in the first Founder of it; any more than <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's</hi> great Courage and Conduct in War can be made use of, as an argument to prove the truth of his Master <hi>Aristotle's</hi> opinion, concerning the Eternity of the World. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus</hi> was as great an example of all natural and moral excellencies in the Sect of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as any other could possibly be in the Sect of the <hi>Epicureans;</hi> and yet in respect of any ones particular endowments being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vindicate an error in his Founder, we may say here, as it was proverbially said
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104464:30"/>
of a desperate and ruin'd state, <hi>Ne Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus quidem.</hi>—</p>
               <p>And whereas 'tis said, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> took great satisfaction at his Death, by reflecting upon his Life <hi>and his</hi> (I suppose Physiologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) <hi>Inventions;</hi> the greatest invention that he seem'd remarkable for, was his solving the liberty of the Will meerly by the motion of senseless Atoms declining uncertainly from the Perpendicular: now this seems no such pious invention, as to take such solid comfort in at his Death.</p>
               <p>I shall here only add these two general Observations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That Vertue, according to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, must be founded on very weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain grounds and reasons, especially as to the more difficult duties of an holy Life; they being at present both unpleasant and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unrewardable. So that if the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> did give themselves to the practice of such Vertues, out of an absolute sense of Duty, or from the consideration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the thing it self; then were they the most Heroickly Vertuous, not only of any sort of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> but also of any other People in the world: for then were they vertuous without either hopes of reward, or fear of punishment. Besides, I know not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104464:30"/>
what motions such men can have, according to those principles, to return to the Practice of an holy Life; who, by a constant and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual course in á well regulated extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, have made such a degree of Vice ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy and pleasant to 'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Happiness, according to <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> is impossible: for he founds it in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible condition, in rooting out all fear of Death and all doubtful suspicions that may succeed it. Now the hopes and fears of future good and evil are anticipations so implanted in us, that the rooting them out, is a thing absolutely impossible: now he tells us, that we cannot attain sincere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure without Physiology; that is, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, such an Hypothesis of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy as his own, which excludes all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence out of the World, and takes away the immortality of the Soul; <hi>Ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desset aliquid humanam sibi parare securita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, cum superna, &amp; quae sub terrâ sunt, suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta essent;</hi> Diog. Laert.</p>
               <p>Now what the <hi>Stoicks</hi> were among the Heathens, that, in some resemblance, are the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> among Christians: and then as for the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> we have a sort of Men amongst us, who cannot be said so properly to resemble 'em, as really to be the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:104464:31"/>Now whereas the great design of the Gospel was to root out sin, and plant the most exemplary Vertue and Piety in the World; the <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> instead of this, make the design thereof, <hi>to consist</hi> in something, pretendedly, above it.</p>
               <p>As <hi>First,</hi> In a Pompous sett of high flown Notions, and speculative Truths, as if the Sun of Righteousness came only to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the understanding; but not either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Will, or warm the Affections: as if it was enough to be seraphical in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, tho' in the mean time our Wills be vicious and irregular. Though this is not so to be understood, as if it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different for us, what we believe, provided that we be careful and conscientious in the way we are in. For it is impossible for us to lead a truly good and holy Life, without a firm belief of the Christian Articles: but then we must not rest in a bare belief of Truth; for Truth without Practice, becomes not only useless, but of bad consequence to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> place a great deal of Considence in vain pretences to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; as if their Souls were the only Seats of the Deity, and as if they were the only Ministers of State here below, and Heavens great Privy Councellors:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104464:31"/>
As if God's written Word were only a dead Letter, unless enlivened by their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: all which, tho' different Comments, must be of greater Authority than the Text it self, not only when they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict that, but also one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> entertain such an imaginary Opinion of Perfection, as states 'em, not only above all Humane, but Divine Laws; as if their Wills and Actions were the only Rules of Right and Wrong, and that, what ever they did, was therefore good, because done by them: Thus are they grown such Giants in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as that they have baffled all checks of Conscience and Obedience to Laws, which they look upon, as mean and low dispensations, quite to be laid aside, when once Men arrive at this State of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Enthusiasm</hi> consists in an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Zeal, prodigiously Partial and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to those of its own perswasion; but Furious and Cruel to those, who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from 'em.</p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> pretended by their false Opinions of Humane Nature to be more than Men; So the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> by the like mistakes concerning true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104464:32"/>
pretend to be more than Christians: tho' indeed they both come short of what they severally pretended to.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly stated the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> I shall here further enquire, how far God makes use of the lower faculties of the Soul in the communications of himself to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. I shall not here go about to explain the manner, how God now under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel works upon the minds of Men by the gracious influences of his Holy Spirit; for these may be more happily experienc'd, than successfully explain'd: however I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it would be a very preposterous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to do it by beginning at the lower faculties of the Soul; for these are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and in the first place wrought upon, but by the mediation of an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Understanding, and a rectifi'd Will: and from those Fountains is Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness deriv'd into the Soul. Thus our Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is apply'd in a way answerable to our Disease, the Corruption and Depravation of our Nature: Now this consists more especially in these two things, in ignorance of the Understanding, and impotence and irregularity of the Will: answerably here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in the Restitution of Man; God first
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104464:32"/>
informs his Understanding, then assists and inclines his will by his Grace, and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys himself to his inferiour Appetites in a way suitable to their Natures, in bringing them under the Power and Government of Reason and Religion.</p>
               <p>I shall here rather enquire how far God made use of the Fancy and Imagination in the Communications of himself to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants under the Law by way of Prophecy: and this I shall rather do, because of the dangerous Opinions that some Men have of late vented on this Subject, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to undermine the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Divine Revelation, truly so call'd, For they think, if they can but once suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently disparage the manner of God's reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to the Prophets under the Old Testament, they will be hereby better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to reject all Divine Revelation under the New. I shall here therefore make some short reflections upon the Author of <hi>Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus-Theol. Polit:</hi> in his two first Chapters of Prophets and Prophecy. In Order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I shall premise, <hi>1st.</hi> God in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of himself to Mankind is not ty'd to any either Natural or Moral qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Persons he pleases to make use of; For what ever is wanting, either
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104464:33"/>
as to the vigorousness of the Fancy, or strength of understanding, God can supply the defects hereof some other way, or act more immediately by himself in absence of them all. <hi>2dly.</hi> Yet notwithstanding, God commonly makes use of Second Causes, and of Instruments duly qualified, in order to the effecting his Designs in the World, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Prophecy. According to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Opinion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors, there were certain previous preparatory dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in order to it, and these were of three Sorts, Natural, Acquir'd and Moral. 1. A good Natural Complexion and Temper of Body, a due mixture of the Humours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any predominancy of Melancholy, a Mind naturally Calm and Chearful, a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Active and Vigorous, an Understanding Clear and Strong, without any Crazedness or Inconsistency. 2. All these improv'd to the highest Degrees of perfection by Study and Industry. 3. To these must also be added a vertuous and well-disposed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Soul, free from all vicious habits and inclinations. Thus the <hi>Iews</hi> had their Schools of the Prophets, for the fitting and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Young Scholars, which they call'd, <hi>the Sons of the Prophets,</hi> for that imployment. Now this sufficiently shews, that something
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104464:33"/>
more than mere Fancy was required to the Nature of Prophecy; Yet this is not so to be understood, as if Prophecy was the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural result of any of these singly, or of all joyntly, unless God was pleas'd to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himself to some, as he saw fit. For all these who were brought up in the Schools of the Prophets, did not presently prophesie: Thus neither the absence of the usual quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications do incapacitate a Man for Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; nor doth the concurrence of 'em all make one actually a Prophet: Prophecy, in the formal Notion and Nature of it, being no ways in the power of Man, but wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the will of God. Hence we see, what little reason the soresaid Author had to say, that tho' God did make use of the Fancy sometimes in the conveyance of his Will to the Prophets; yet that Prophecy, <hi>Non nisi ope imaginationis persicitur, &amp; à solâ imaginatione pendet:</hi> and this he proves no other ways, than because they prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this is not to prove, but to beg the Question.</p>
               <p>He first makes an injust Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Natural Knowledge and Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, 1. In respect of the Name, and tells us that the one may be called Divine as well as the other, because they are both deriv'd from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104464:34"/>
the same Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> God. But thus by the same way of arguing he must, and indeed doth assert, That either there are no Miracles at all: or else that all the effects of Nature are such; because the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Divine Power, as well as that of Miracles. But in order to either of these, he should first make good one or both of these Positions, either that God hath not an immediate Power of Acting by himself, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the ordinary course of Nature; or else, that since the constitution of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Frame of the Universe, he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to himself a liberty of Acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Original Power: neither of which will he be ever able to prove.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppose Natural Knowledge may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be call'd Prophecy or Divine Revelation, in respect of it's Original; yet how can it be call'd <hi>aequali jure,</hi> as he says, Divine: because in other respects, both as to the manner of their conveyance, and largeness of extent, there is a great deal of difference betwixt 'em: however why should Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be call'd Divine Revelation, since Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and good Reason have justly affix'd them to several things? for he that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to unhinge the signification of Words, which Use and Custom has truly appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104464:34"/>
to 'em in Divinity, has probably no better design than he that removes the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Land-Marks in a common Field, <hi>viz.</hi> Injury, Disorder, and Confusion: Tho' this must be also granted, that Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth bring us under an Obligation to those respective Duties which it dictates, even antecedent to that of Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For we are first Men, and then Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and by both these ways God hath made known his Will, and claims our Obedience.</p>
               <p>He grants indeed that <hi>Humanae Naturae Leges, in se consideratae, non possunt ejus, i. e. Divinae Revelationis esse causa.</hi> Why he should thus mince the matter, as to insert these Words, <hi>in se consideratae,</hi> I know not; whereas 'tis certain, That the Laws of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature can be no ways the cause of Divine Revelation. I know, his meaning here is suspected by some to be this, that the Laws of Nature, <hi>consider'd in themselves,</hi> that is, without the supposal of a God, which is one integral part of the Universe; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they cannot be the cause of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: but then supposing a God so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the Laws of Nature, as that he shall be either really the same with, or very little different from the Universe and the Laws thereof, under this consideration,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104464:35"/>
how far the Laws of Nature may be the cause of Divine Revelation, that is, of that which he calls such, is the grand mysterious Question.</p>
               <p>The other thing wherein he compares Natural Knowledge with Prophecy, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of certainty, wherein Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he says, comes no ways short of Prophetical.</p>
               <p>If we consider the certainty the Prophet himself had of those things which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to him, we are now at a loss how certainly to determine this Question; for he only could fully assure us of the truth of these things, they relating to himself: Yet it seems very reasonable to believe, that the certainty of their Knowledge did not any way fall short of, but rather exceed that of Natural Knowledge; seeing we may casily suppose, that God may, by the secret influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit, &amp; by the more immediate applications of himself to the minds of Men, as fully assure 'em of the truth of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as they can be of any thing by any Natural Principles: and that it really and actually was so, may appear from hence, that those to whom God convey'd these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, have by vertue hereof underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the performance of such things, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104464:35"/>
arguments drawn from mere Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in all probability, could not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded 'em to.</p>

Upon the whole matter, one might almost be perswaded from hence to think, <hi>That by our Souls containing in it the Nature of God objectively, and partaking of the very same,</hi> that hereby he design'd, as it were, to melt down God and the Soul of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104464:36"/>
Man into an equal constitution, and both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts of a material Universe.</p>
               <p>Then he tells us, that <hi>Quicquid dici potest, ex Scripturâ solâ peti debet:</hi> What ever is said of things relating to Divine Revelation, ought to be fetch'd from Scripture alone. This in general is a very good Rule, yet it is to be understood with some certain limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as he himself acknowledges in the same Paragraph, unless we had rather say, that the latter part thereof contradicts the former: for he tells us, <q>That the <hi>Iews</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took any notice of Second Causes, but did generally recur to God, as the cause of all great and excellent things they had occasion to speak of. And therefore we must only take that for Supernatural Revelation, which Scripture expressly says is such, or what may be gathered to be so, from the circumstances of the Relation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I grant, that God may declare that again, which a Man either by Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or some other way knew before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When God makes any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Man, it is necessary, that he should make such a reduplicative Declaration as this, That this which I now speak, is Pure, Simple, unmixt Divine Revelation, such as exceeds the Power of Natural Causes to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104464:36"/>
make known? if so, then it may be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, Whether God ever made any superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation to Mankind or no; because we no where meet with any such Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as to the circumstances of the Narration, we can never, according to his Principles, from thence gather any thing to be truly Divine; because, as I intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he makes the Power of God and the Power of Nature the same; or however as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, that we are very much ignorant how far the Powers of Nature may extend. However we may make use of this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, against himself, that if we may argue from the circumstances of the Relation; then it is not necessary, that whatever is said concerning these things, should be fetch'd from Scripture only. 'Tis easily observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how this Author, by unsetling the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Words, and confounding the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things, designs to bring all into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: he argues much what at a rate with Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that is, weakly, and probably with the same design, that is, Wickedly. But Providence hath so ordered affairs, that a bad Cause should always be a weak one.</p>
               <p>He founds all Prophecy meerly in the imagination: hence, he says, it is that the Prophets conceiv'd all things parabolically,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104464:37"/>
and express'd spiritual things after a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real manner; because this agrees more with the Nature of Imagination. Hence it was, that those that were with Christ, <hi>saw the Spirit descending like a Dove;</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>as it were Tongues of Fire;</hi> and S.<hi>Paul,</hi> when he was Converted, <hi>saw a great light:</hi> because <hi>all these things did suit with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Imagination:</hi> As if either there was no Foundation in Nature for any such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but only the imagination of Men; or as if these appearances reach'd no further than the Fancy, without any Divine Influence, making any further impressions upon the minds of those who were concern'd herein.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It doth not appear that all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations in Scripture were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd one of these two ways: There are some instances where there is no mention
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104464:37"/>
made of either of these two; and to say, that one of these was made use of, tho' not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and contrary to his own Rule, That whatever is said of these things, must be drawn from Scripture.</p>
               <p>The instances, I mean, are those of <hi>Ioseph's</hi> interpreting the Dreams of the <hi>Butler</hi> and the <hi>Baker,</hi> and of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Dream concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seven Years of Dearth, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 40 and 41 <hi>chap.</hi> Now the Interpretation of Dreams, is as much Prophecy or Divine Revelation as the Dreams themselves; and yet here we do not find either any Voice or sensible Representation.</p>
               <p>Nor are his Reasons any whit more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than his Instances: for tho' he grants it possible for God immediately to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himself to Men, <hi>Attamen ut homo ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis solâ mente aliqua perciperet, quae in primis nostrae cognitionis fundamentis non continentur, nec ab iis deduci possant, ejus mens praestantior necessariò at<expan>

Reason and Religion obliges
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104464:38"/>
us to believe, That God doth convey his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Assistances, by which he both enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Understanding, and reforms the Will, without the mediation of the Phancy: and it is also very reasonable to believe, That God did many times, under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, convey the Intimations of his Will to Men, without either Voice or Vision: however this is certainly done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of Divine Grace to Christians, now under the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppose that God always made use of these imaginary Representations, in the Conveyance of his Will to the Prophets; will it therefore follow, <hi>ad prophetizandum non esse opus perfectiore mente, sed vividiore imaginatione?</hi> Will it therefore follow, that they did <hi>tantùm per imaginationem percipere?</hi> Will it therefore follow, that they did <hi>non nisi ope imaginationis percipere?</hi> Though God in the wise methods of his Providence, did make use of second Causes, will it therefore follow that the whole Causality must be ascribed to them? Could the Fancy alone, or the Fancy and Understanding together, rightly judge of the sense and meaning of those Representations, without the further assistance of Divine Illumination? to assert either of these, would argue him either a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104464:38"/>
bad Philosopher, or a worse Divine: so that it would be hard to conceive, how these imaginary Representations, without a more immediate interpretation of their sense and meaning, would be any thing better than idle shows and insignificant appearances.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of natural Notions of Truth and Goodness.</head>
               <p>THere is nothing that affords us more noble or more useful matter, whereon to exercise our Speculations, than a serious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the respective natures of Truth &amp; Goodness, which are things of so great Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in themselves, and of such near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, that it doth not become a Man, a Philosopher, or a Christian, to be ignorant of either. 'Tis observ'd by some, that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> immediately upon his propounding that Question to our Saviour, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> He went forth, not staying sor an Answer: yet Providence hath not left us in the dark in things of this nature; we have the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Guides of Reason and Revelation, as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104464:39"/>
much as God thought fit to impart to us, sufficient to satisfy all sober, though not over-curious Enquiries, sufficient to all the ends and purposes of this humane State. Truth, indeed both natural and reveal'd, hath ever since its first appearance in the World, variously suffer'd by the Ignorance of some, and the Malice of others; by the contrary and eager pretences of opposite Parties, by the weaknesses and follies of Men, and by the power and subtlety of the Devil; and especially by that universal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Sin and Wickedness, which both upon a natural and moral account, is very prejudicial to the concerns of Truth, both as Vice is naturally destructive of good Principles, and also as wicked Men are ready to believe (though never so false) what they think would be their Interest to be true.</p>
               <p>Thus if we consider the state of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile World in the first Ages, we shall there find a very bad face of things. For not to speak of the grossness of popular Errours, and the no less impious, than false appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the generality of the common sort; the most exact Enquiries of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers were often false, but always mixt with a great deal of uncertainty in their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104464:39"/>
Discourses, having commonly a contrary Sect and Company of Men, that whatever was asserted by one, was many times with as much vigour and equal probability of reason contradicted by another. So that a sober and serious Enquirer after Truth, though he might have reason enough not to profess himself a Sceptick, but to believe that there was such a thing, as truth; yet he might then see too much cause to despair of ever finding the certain way that led to it, among so many By-paths of errour and uncertainty.</p>
               <p>And even now in the Christian World, the many errours in Opinions, and the more fatal Heresies, of wicked practices, do suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently-testify, that Truth doth not enjoy such an undisturb'd Empire, as might have been hop'd and wish'd, since Christ's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Flesh. Now among all these disadvantages, under which Truth always labour'd, and even still labours, Providence hath more especially provided these two ways for the preservation of it. 1. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inscription upon the minds of men. 2. By after revelation for the further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration and confirmation of it. And these two are, as it were, the two Pillars, that have preserved it, both from the deluge of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104464:40"/>
Sin, and the violence of all other opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Natural Inscription. I hope, I shall not need to desire the Reader, not to impose any such gross sense upon this word, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the nature of an Immaterial Soul.</p>
               <p>I shall here therefore first briefly explain, what I mean by truth of first Inscription, or natural Notions: For the Defendant has always leave to state his own Question, and to declare in what sence he undertakes the defence of it: this I the rather intimate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some Men will put such a Sense upon these words, <hi>innate, imprinted</hi> or <hi>impress'd,</hi> frequently made use of in this Question, as none that I know of, go about to defend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I do not here assert the Opinion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> concerning innate Ideas, in all its circumstances: I do not here suppose the Soul to praexist; nor do I make all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have in this state, to be nothing but reminiscence or recollection of what we knew in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These natural Notions are not so imprinted upon the Soul, as that they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and necessarily exert themselves (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Children and Ideots) without any assistance from the outward Senses, or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104464:40"/>
without the help of some previous Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For thus reason it self, which yet, we say, is natural to a Man, is not so born with him, but that it requires some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient assistances, before it arrive at the true exercise of it self: and it is as much as I here contend for, if these notions be in the same sense connatural to the Soul, as reason it self is.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The use of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being first suppos'd; that is, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties labouring of no natural defect, nor depriv'd of those other advantages, that God and Nature have made necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then our Souls have a native power of finding or framing such Principles or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, the Truth or Knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no ways depends upon the evidence of sense or observation: thus knowing what is meant by a whole, and what by a part, hence naturally results the truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>totum est majus sui parte,</hi> without being any ways oblig'd to sense for it. Of this nature are those universal Propositions, the truth whereof doth not depend upon the actual Existence of any thing; as <hi>quicquid agit, est,</hi> &amp;c. Now, I suppose, we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discern a difference betwixt the Truth of such Propositions, as these, and those
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104464:41"/>
others, which are brought by some to vie with those natural Notions, <hi>viz. White is not black, Fellowness is not sweetness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I shall here 1. enquire into the grounds and reasons upon which Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in his account of the Platonick Philosophy, asserts Experimental Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the great Rule and Measure of Truth: And first he blames the Platonick Theology for resolving Knowledge into its first and fundamental Principles. But Knowledge is of a larger extent than that which relates strictly to natural Philosophy, or what is the object of sensible Experiment. There is also a Metaphysical Knowledge, a truth of Propositions, which no ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Observation; so that, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, when the Platonists spoke of resolving Science into its first Principles, they only meant such Knowledge as was capable of such Resolutions: They did not suppose us born with innate notions of such things, the Knowledge whereof depends upon Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and therefore we ought not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Truth or Falshood of many late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, by searching for the respective I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of 'em in our Minds. Indeed as to matters of natural Philosophy, it is a much more certain way of resolving such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104464:41"/>
so far as can be done, into the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Sense and Experience, than into any imaginary Principles of Speculation.</p>
               <p>But he tells us, <q>That the Mind from particular Observations doth make gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules, which after an exact Scrutiny, and comparing of every Individual, are justly admitted for proleptick and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Verities, and that general Axioms are only the results and abridgments of a multitude of single Experiments, and that from the plain experience of several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that we cannot look abroad, but we see the parts always less than the whole.</q> Hence we gather this Maxime, <hi>totum est majus suâ parte:</hi> this indeed is plausible popular Discourse, but not severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philosophical. For what if one should come and tell us, that in a certain place in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> he found the contrary to his observation to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the parts there were bigger than the whole: I know not what we could Answer, in this Case, upon the former Principles; for according to them, this Proposition, <hi>totum est,</hi> &amp;c. is true, only, with this his Proviso, so far as hath been yet observ'd. But now we find in things of meer Observation, some particulars to contradict what has been before generally
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104464:42"/>
receiv'd for true. Besides, I never heard of any general Council or Company of Men appointed to declare, when particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations had undergone a sufficient tryal and probation, so that they then might be admitted into proleptick and fundamental verities; and I conceive, no Man's private authority is enough to do it. It is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, if it all possible, to convince a <hi>Sceptick;</hi> yet are there more strong and probable ways of arguing with him, than this, which founds all truth upon experimental observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for thus the truth and certainty of any proposition can arrive no higher than this, That so far as is yet observ'd, 'tis true. Now this seems only a more ingenuous and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd piece of <hi>Scepticism;</hi> for the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate of 'em will grant truth of appearance, and tell you, That Snow seems white, but whether it be so or no, they know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to what purpose,</hi> says he, <hi>should God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print such obvious and evident Notions upon Mens minds?</hi> To this I answer, 1. That it must be granted, that it is at least possible for God to imprint truths upon the minds of Men: and if so, then it cannot be done any other way, than by making 'em thus plain and self evident; for we cannot suppose any other way, than by making 'em such, as do
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104464:42"/>
                  <hi>suâ luce patere.</hi> So that supposing this possible, and supposing God to reduce this possibility into act, and really and actually imprint 'em; yet the objection would lye still as strong against 'em, as formerly: So that this is only such an objection as would ly against an acknowledged truth, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly say, upon that account, is none at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He must give us leave to suppose these natural Notions, till such time as he has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd the contrary. Now in strictness of Argument, we ought not to urge the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness of imprinting such obvious and evident Notions, against those, who say that these truths do in a great measure, owe their clearness and evidence to their being thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed: they are indeed evident from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, and to us evident from the Nature and Constitution of our Faculties, that we cannot apprehend 'em otherwise.</p>
               <p>And as for Observation, that only claims in the Third place—<hi>sic à Iove tertius haeres.</hi> So that the needlessness of imprinting such evident Notions cannot be argued from their present clearness; because it is their being thus imprinted or thus connatural to our minds, that makes 'em so.</p>
               <p>If it be here reply'd, That however they would be sufficiently evident meerly by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104464:43"/>
It is not certain, that they would be thus sufficiently so, as was before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. However we have no reason to find fault, if God has given us more and clearer evidences, than perhaps were absolutely necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But suppose, says he, that we were born with these innate Notions, how shall we be assur'd, but that errour may be the natural Result of our Faculties?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here indeed is such a doubt raised, as I see not, how he either gives, or can give a satisfactory Answer to, according to his Principles. For supposing that the seeds of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour may be the natural results of our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that is, Supposing our Faculties may be false, I do not see, how their truth can be evinc'd by the most wary and discreet experience: and this, he says, is the only way, by which to do it. For if errour may be the natural result of my Faculties, that is, If my superiour Faculties be false, I may then justly suspect my lower: If I may be deceiv'd in what, by the most clear and distinct me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reasoning, I conceive to be true; I have then little reason to trust my Senses.</p>
               <p>Here I shall further do these two things, 1. Show that the Seeds of Errour are not the natural results of our Faculties. 2. If
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104464:43"/>
they were, the most wary and discreet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would not at all help us, in our searches after truth and certainty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not possible, that the seeds of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in those things, that we clearly and distinctly perceive to be true; and this will appear,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From the nature of Man, as he is a rational Creature: now rationality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it one or both of these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some certain and undoubted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are to be the Foundations of Truth and Goodness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. However a natural power or faculty of making right consequences, and drawing necessary Conclusions from true premises, which way soever we come by 'em. Now the possibility of our Faculties being false, is not consistent with either of these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This further appears from the nature of the divine Attributes: for consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the excellency and goodness of the Divine Nature, he could not give us such faculties, as should deceive us <hi>in clarè &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctè perceptis,</hi> as <hi>D. Cartes</hi> has well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd: for this would argue either weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or malice in God; either that he stood in need of such fallacious methods to bring about his designs, or that he did purposely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104464:44"/>
impose upon his Creatures. All that can be here pretended, is this, that indeed it would have reslected dishonourably upon God to have created us so at first, as that errour should be the natural result of our faculties. But then, what if by some offence, either of our own, or of some other in our stead, this be brought upon us as a just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the contrary sate to <hi>Cassandra,</hi> that as she always spake true, yet never was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: so on the contrary, we should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believe our faculties, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spoke true. But those that make this objection, do either believe the Scriptures, or they do not: If they do, then it must be the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> that had this malignant influence upon all Mankind. But then by the same Scriptures we are as fully assur'd, that the punishment hereof did not extend so far; as we are, that it did at all descend upon his Posterity. That our faculties are weakned, and we hereby become more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to errour by <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, is certainly true: but that our faculties are so corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we are become uncapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving natural truth, is that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures deny, and what the assertors of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, in its greatest latitude, do not affirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104464:44"/>If they be such as do not believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, yet the objection it self doth suppose a God, that is, a being infinitely Wise, Iust and Good. Now upon this supposal we may easily refute this unreasonable surmise. For this would introduce such disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion into the World, as would be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the nature of God, who is a God of Order, to suffer it. According to this supposal, we could never come to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of our fault, for which this punishment was inflicted: for if our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should any ways acquaint us with such a thing, what reason had we to think, that they should rightly inform us in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and be false in all the rest? Nor could we ever come to the certain knowledge of the means and methods of amendment; for according to this we ought to act contrary to our reason, in obedience to our Principles, as supposing the dictates of our faculties to be false: and several other such like absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities would follow hence, which would be unworthy of a wise and good Man to suffer in the World, if it was in his power to help; much more unworthy of an infinitely wise and good God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we should once suppose our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be false; I am afraid we should be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104464:45"/>
condemn'd to Eternal Scepticism; however beyond the power of the most wary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to relieve us. <hi>Lastly,</hi> he tells us, <q>That the only way to be satisfy'd of the truth of these notions, is to examine them by a wary and discreet Experience: and if so, to what purpose do they serve? for before I have made tryal, I cannot use them, because I have no reason to trust 'em; and Experience makes 'em useless, because Experimental Knowledge is of all others the most certain and most indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Answer, That suppose these natural Notions were not so certain in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but that they stood in need of some further confirmation by experience: yet would they not be altogether useless, both as they would encourage us in our Tryals with fair hopes of success; and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when we found the experiment fully to answer to, and agree with our former Conceptions, the concurrent testimony of these two Witnesses would more fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us in the belief of those things thus va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously attested: tho' indeed, it would be very hard to try the truth of some Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Experiment, such as this, <hi>Nihili nullae sunt affectiones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:104464:45"/>But here a little more positively to lay down my apprehensions herein, I conceive that God, from all Eternity, did see and know the natures of things, and the several Relations they either did, or possibly could bear to one another: and this is that which some call Ideas in the Divine Intellect, or objects of the Divine Understanding. Thus what God understands to be either true or good, that is necessarily so; as a Learned Man expresses it, the <hi>Divine Will and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence it self has no Dominion over the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Understanding.</hi> For if the nature of truth and goodness did wholly depend upon the meer positive Command of God, and the arbitrary determination of his Will, then could we not be so fully assur'd, but that the whole Scheme, both of Truth and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, might be changed, and that which is now Vertue, might afterwards become Vice; and so on the contrary: the very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility whereof is very unworthy of God, and inconsistent with that notion, which we have of him. Thus, I conceive, things are in respect of God. Now in respect of us, he hath communicated something of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ray, relating both to Intellectual and Moral Notices, into the very constitution of our humane Nature; something that is both a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104464:46"/>
light and a law unto us: and this the very Nature and end of such Creatures (as God design'd to make us, that is, Rational and Religious) did require.</p>
               <p>I know I must expect to meet with great opposition in the management of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am very conscious to my self of my own inabilities: but I thank God, I am not conscious of having said any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, but, as far as in me lies, to promote the designs of truth and holiness.<hi>—Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am petimus<expan>

               <p>
                  <hi>D. Carles,</hi> though he grant Eternal Truths, yet these he only derives from the Divine Will. <q>God, says he, is not only the Author of the Existences, but of the Essences of things: and as it was in his power whether any thing had existed or no; so also their Essences depended upon his free determination, <hi>Ep. 37.</hi> Part I. He tells us, that it was equally free sor God at first to have made this true, that the Lines drawn from the Center of a Circle to the Circumference, should not be equal.</q> But doth not this weaken the force of his own Argument, drawn from clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct perception: for we do as clearly and distinctly perceive that the lines in that case should be equal; as we do the truth of this
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104464:46"/>
Proposition, <hi>Cogito, ergo sum.</hi> If it be here reply'd, That supposing such a Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Natures, as at present we have, then things cannot be otherwise than now we apprehend them; but if either the srame of our Natures had been otherwise at first, or shall afterwards be changed, then the things also had been, or may be otherwise. But now the only way to consute such an extravagant Supposal, is to appeal to Men's more serious and impartial Thoughts: would not the very possibility of such a thing be very dishonourable to God? would it not introduce such a Fate into the World, as would also introduce a necessity of asserting an immoral Deity? Or should we be ever able to assert and desend the just Rights and Interests of Truth and Goodness upon this Supposal? So that as before I observed of Experimental Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That the highest degree of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we can arrive at, by that Principle, is only this, That such or such a Thing, so far as has been yet observed, is true. So here, though such or such a Thing (I speak now of such as we call universal Truths) be at present clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiv'd to be true, yet at first it might have been otherwise, and may, for ought
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104464:47"/>
we know, be so hereafter: And what he asserts of speculative Truths, the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he says of moral Notions of Good and Evil.</p>
               <p>Resp. 6. <hi>There's nothing, neither matter of actual Existence, nor reason of Truth and Goodness, but what depends upon God:</hi> If by depending upon God, he means dependance upon his Will; so that it was free for God to have made these Reasons just contrary to what they now are, which seems to be what he there means, then in this sense they do not depend upon the Divine Will: If by dependance upon God he means this, That there is nothing either of actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, or reasons of Truth and Goodness, but what owes its being to some relation it bears to God. This I grant, for even these <hi>Rationes veri &amp; boni,</hi> do owe their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences to the relation they bear to the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Sanctity of the Divine Nature; these were the proper and necessary Objects of Infinite Wisdom from all Eternity, and do there only originally exist.</p>
               <p>So that perhaps that which seem'd harsh to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> was this, That there should be any Thing that was absolutely indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of God, which no one here asserts; only we say, those <hi>Rationes veri &amp; boni</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104464:47"/>
upon, or consist in that relation they bear to the Divine Understanding, as the existence of other things of more indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, do upon his Will. Not but that these notions of Good and Evil have yet receiv'd a further impression of their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive obligations (to perform the one, and avoid the other) from the Divine Will, that though they were not only therefore good, because God will'd them; yet he hath made them now more absolutely and indispensibly so, by adding the ratification of the Divine Will to their antecedent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Nor can that place of <hi>Genesis, That God saw that all things were good,</hi> that is, says he, according to the determination of his Will; yet granting this, this place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any just reason, be extended fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the material Creation: so that though that was therefore good, because God will'd so to make it; yet it doth not therefore follow that those <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes veri &amp; boni</hi> were only so upon the same account: or if it be extended further than the material Creation, then why may not things be good, because God knew them to be so, before the determination of his will?</p>
               <p>I do indeed here suppose some kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104464:48"/>
betwixt the Divine Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Divine Will; and if it be here objected, that there is no such distinction of these in God, yet I humbly conceive, that we may, in obedience to our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect modes of conception, conceive of God according to our best and utmost Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; provided that we do not wilfully and maliciously derogate from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Nature. Now it seems more honourable to God, and more agreeable to those Revelations he hath made of himself in Scripture, to assert, that Good and Evil do not so depend upon his will, as that he can altar the fundamental Grounds and Reasons of them: though our highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions cannot answer the excellency of the Divine Nature; yet certainly we may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate upon God, without any danger of committing Idolatry, or dishonouring him in our Thoughts, provided that we act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best of our possibilities.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Camberland</hi> also, the present learned Bishop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> seems to be no great Favourer of these common or natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; though I humbly conceive, that the design of that great Man, in his Book <hi>De legibus Naturae,</hi> is not directly to oppose 'erm: as may appear, 1. if we consider the Persons
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104464:48"/>
against whom he writ, that is, the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> as he himself asserts in his 5th Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of his <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> against whom he thought that way and method would not be so Argumentative, seeing it was wholly rejected and dehy'd by 'em. Or, 2dly, The times in which he writ: thus in the 4th Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of his <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> he chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that method there made use of, <hi>Hisce saltem temporibus;</hi> that is, in an Age more Philosophically curious and inquisitive, in an Age that will-not believe any thing, but what comes fairly attested and sufficiently prov'd. And lastly, If we consider his own declaration of his Opinion, which he lays down with the greatest Candour; thus, <hi>Non impossibile est, ut &amp; nobiscum nascantur hujusmodi notitiae, &amp; ab extra denuò impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantur:</hi> So that we see, he doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely oppose these natural Notions, only he thought it more convenient, in respect of the Persons against whom, and the times and places in which he writ, rather to pitch upon another method. Thus his design in that Book, was to shew, That the universal practice of Vertue and Piety was not only our Duty, but our Interest, and so founded the Obligation of the Laws of Nature in that more universally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104464:49"/>
and more generally prevailing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of real advantage to our selves. Now this was a design suitable to the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Meditations, very agreeable to the Genius of the present Age, and indeed every way so noble and generous, that none that are Friends to Vertue, can with any reason oppose his undertaking; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering with what respect he treats that Opinion, which (though he doth not contradict, yet there) seems less to favour: Thus doth he streugthen Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there, where it seems the weakest, and not in the mean time to deprive it of any of its former assistances, he fortifies it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the new Assaults of its modern Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and resuses not to joyn issue with them in a way, wherein they think they have the most advantage. But yet that first part of his own Assertion, <hi>Non impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile est, ut &amp; nobiscum nascantur hujusmodi notitiae:</hi>] This I look upon as so great a Truth, that I shall beg leave a little further to illustrate it. As for his Opinion, that these Notices are again imprinted srom without, I shall not oppose it; only, I humbly conceive, there are such good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the former part, that of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born with us, that it ought not to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104464:49"/>
excluded: As 1. This seems more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the plain simplicity of former times, and to the less Philosopical Genius of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those places, wherein notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Laws of Nature were generally receiv'd and acknowledg'd: and seeing they were so, and that by those who had neither opportunity nor capacity to enquire more profoundly into the formal Reasons and Causes of them any further, than as they were conscious to themselves both of their truth and obligation; hence it seems very probable, that there was some other way by which they might and did attain to the Knowledge of 'em, without such Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Disquisitions. And indeed the very attempt to search into the Causes and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a Thing seems to suppose that we have at least some knowledge of the Thing before-hand, as to matter of fact: for Men would scarce go about to enquire into the Reasons and Causes of the Laws of Nature, if they had not some consciousness to themselves, that there were such Things in Nature; and we cannot, for the reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, say, that they then only first came to be known, when the Causes of'em were thus search'd into. And though 'tis true, that the whole Order of Nature
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104464:50"/>
duly consider'd, doth generally conspire to the confirmation of this Truth, that the doing our duty is the best way to secure our Interest; yet such is the intricacy many times of Divine Providence, and the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inequality in the distribution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments in this life, that without the Motives and Encouragements of some other Arguments, Men would hardly be perswaded to the practice of that, of which they did not see the present Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And though Vice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, especially in any high degree, do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tend to the prejudice of our Healths, and ruine of our Estates; yet if there were no other way to attain to the knowledge of our Duty, or of our obligation to it, we might perhaps sometimes with too much reasos plead ignorance thereof, and might pretend a liberty to be vicious, at least so far, as might be without any considerable prejudice to our Healths or Fortunes: not but that Rewards and Punishments are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally interwoven in the frame and order of the Universe without us, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of humane Nature within us; that so, though sometimes there may be an unequal distribution of outward Rewards and Punishments, yet that Vertue might
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104464:50"/>
always be sure, at least of a secret recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and Vice not altogether go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, even here in this Life. But though our duty be always our real Interest, and Honesty the best Policy; yet such is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confusion which Sin has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into humane Nature, such the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral depravation of Mankind, that the truth of these Propositions is not readily many times acknowledg'd by us: but Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, without any regard, either to the present nature of things, or their future consequences, do make Lust and Passion, and a mistaken Self-Interest, the Rule of all their Actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would here propound it to conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether our now being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve these Laws of Nature into their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Causes, as it is call'd, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their Obligations from reasons fetch'd from the Constitution of the Universe: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I say, this doth not depend upon that clearer Revelation, which God hath made of those things in Scripture; for hereby we come to a clearer Knowledge of the Nature and End of the Creation, how that the whole Universe acts, in subserviency to the glory of God, and to the promoting those noble ends of Providence, of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104464:51"/>
Vertue, and discouraging Vice in the World: hereby we are also more fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd of a future state of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. And these also must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the full and adequate Sanction of the Laws of Nature; for without these, the other of temporal Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would be found many times defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ineffectual, for what they were there design'd. Now these things being more clearly reveal'd, and sully confirm'd to us by holy Scripture, and the belief hereof, made habitual to us, by the long succession of many Ages, hence probably that method becomes now more evident to us, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it would have been; yet if this should be granted, that, at least, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that Proposition (<hi>studium commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis boni totius systematis agentium naturalium conducit ad bonum singularum partium, quo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra, velut partis unius, continetur foelicitas</hi>) doth in some measure depend upon some further Revelations made known to us by the Christian Religion; yet it would be no small or inconsiderable advantage hereby gain'd to Vertue, if it be prov'd, that that Proposition is of equal extent with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, both as to its Truth and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and both these methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104464:51"/>
being join'd together, seem an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Argument of the Divinity of these Laws; in that the God of Nature hath both made 'em natural to the minds of Men, which is that which I here mean by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; and hath also further added the respective Sanctions of rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereunto in the natural frame of the Universe.</p>
               <p>Not as if that other way of resolving these Laws of Nature into those natural Notions and Obligations resulting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, was destitute of its proper Sanctions of rewards and punishments; but then we say, according to this method, they are not resolv'd only into these penal Sanctions, but that the will of the Law-giver, being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd with an intent to be obey'd, is the intrinsick form of a Law, though it did not come attended with outward force, not but that these penal Sanctions do also further declare and inforce the Law.</p>
               <p>If it be here objected, that it is not easy to conceive the way and manner how these natural Notions are, or can be imprinted upon the minds of Men. I answer, there is no more difficulty in conceiving how these truths and obligations may be the natural results of our Minds rightly qualify'd at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104464:52"/>
first; than it is to conceive, how those Ioys and Torments, which ariso from the sense of our Innocence and Guilt, should be the natural results of our Consciences after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: which yet are acknowledg'd by those who make the objection.</p>
               <p>That a Vertuous and holy Life doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tend to promote the honour of God, and the good of all Men in general, and of our selves in particular, is readily granted, especially by those, who believe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion: but then this Proposition doth suppose, First, That we know, what it is to be Vertuous. Secondly, That this Vertuous and holy Life is a duty incumbent on us; and both these, in order of nature, before we understand, that these tend to the glory of God, and the good of Men: otherwise the <hi>Virtuoso's</hi> of our Age, those who pretend to be Philosophically Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, might perhaps plead this in excuse of their present Wickedness, that they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at present making an Experiment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vice may not as well tend to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, as Vertue: but as soon as they find the contrary by Experience, then they will become devout Proselytes to Vertue.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Tyrrell, p. 199.</hi> tells us, That though all Men do not ordinarily reduce the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104464:52"/>
Laws of Nature into that single Proposition of endeavouring the common good of all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings, or may not have an explicit Notion of it: yet it a Man be but thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd; that he is not made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone, that he doth truly observe the Laws of Nature towards himself, by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and rational Life, towards his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by observing the great Rule of doing as he would be done by; such an one, tho' never so ignorant in other things, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes his share to the common good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no doubt but he doth, but then may we not rather argue thus, that since Men do not ordinarily reduce the Laws of Nature into that one single Proposition, as indeed having no explicit notion of it, and yet do their Duties, both towards God, their Neighbours, and themselves; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have some other way of coming to the Knowledge of their Duty, without resolving the Laws of Nature into their proper Causes, as it is called.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Lock,</hi> the Ingenious Author of the <hi>Essay of humane Vnderstanding,</hi> has spent the First Part of his Book wholly against these innate Principles, relating either to Speculation or Practice. One great obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that he brings against 'em is this, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104464:53"/>
Children and Ideots have no apprehension of 'em, and therefore they cannot be any original Impressions upon the minds of Men; because if they were, they would soonest appear in such, these being suppos'd now to be in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> not tinctur'd with any adventitious prejudices of Art or Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and upon this account also there cannot be pleaded that universal consent, that is pretended to be given to these origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Notions, or common Principles; seeing thus perhaps one third part of Mankind do not assent to 'em. In Answer hereto, 1. I observe that those who make this objection, as I before intimated, will not give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant leave to state his own Question, and explain his own sense and meaning of it, but will put such a sense upon these words, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>••••••</desc>
                  </gap>l or innate notions more conditional things, depending upon the Concurrence of several other circumstances, in order to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104464:53"/>
Souls exerting of 'em. Thus the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Tyrrell</hi> has well observ'd of Mr. <hi>Hobs, that he only takes the measure of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from those Passions, which precede the use of reason, and as they first and chiesly shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Children and Fools and Persons unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd; where as according to the Opinion of the best Philosophers, we suppose the truer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man ought rather to be taken from his utmost perfection,</hi> viz. <hi>his reason,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 256. So here 'tis thought that the truer judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these natural notions ought to be taken rather from the most perfect state of Man, rather than as they either do, or do not show themselves in Children and Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots. And whereas 'tis asserted, that these general Maxims are assented to as soon as propos'd, and the terms rightly understood: to this the Ingenious Author Dr. <hi>Lock</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that then there must be an infinite number of innate notions, even those which no one ever yet pretended to be such, as, an Apple is not an Oyster, black is not white, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now these and such as these, he says, are more readily assented to, than those, <hi>quicquid agit, est,</hi> contradictories cannot be both true at once, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because Children and Fools will readily assent to the former: but these latter require more attentive-thought
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104464:54"/>
and consideration for the understanding of 'em. I shall not here mention that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the Logicians perhaps would make use of in this Case, of some things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more known in themselves, and yet not so to us; because I know not what credit now a-days may be given to Men of that old-fashion'd way of thinking. But the Ingenious Author himself doth assert these three ways of acquiring Knowledge. First, By intuition, thus we have the knowledge of our being, <hi>p. 318.</hi> Man also knows <hi>by intuitive certainly, that bare nothing cannot produce any real being,</hi> p. 312. The second way of Knowledge is by Reason. Thirdly, By Sensation. Now the Knowledge of these Universal Truths, or general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, I conceive, is by the first way, rather by intuition than by reasoning, or by the consent or dissent of the terms. For these Propositions, <hi>Cogito, ergo sum,</hi> or that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which this depends, <hi>quicquid agit, est, bare nothing cannot produce a real being:</hi> the truth of these Propositions doth not so much depend upon any consideration of the terms; but seems rather the summary result of the whole, which that Author seems very well to express by <hi>intuition,</hi> or <hi>intuitive certainly.</hi> But then as to those other Propositions,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104464:54"/>
wherein we deny one <hi>Idea</hi> of another, as, a Man is not an Horse, blue is nor yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The truth of these depends upon the actual existence of Things, and the <hi>consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus &amp; dissensus terminorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> the ingenious <hi>Author</hi> of the Reflections upon the foresaid <hi>Essay,</hi> of <hi>Humane Vnderstanding, pag. 20.</hi> doth not allow any such Things, as Mental Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions or Characters upon the Mind, what way soever they may pretend to come there: So that though he agrees with Dr. <hi>Lock</hi> in denying all natural and innate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Mind of Man; yet it is for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons than those which Dr. <hi>Lock</hi> goes upon, and upon a far different <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> his <hi>Reflections</hi> may be a sufficient Answer to Dr. <hi>Lock's</hi> Opinion, as it is defended by him, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the invalidity of the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon which he founds it: though in the mean time he agrees with him in the conclusion, in denying all Natural and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Characters upon the Soul. Which thing, says he, in the place above cited, <hi>Of Mental Impressions or Characters written upon the Mind, if it</hi> pretend to any thing <hi>more than Figure and Metaphor, I take to be meer Iargon and unintelligible Cant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:104464:55"/>But here, I humbly conceive, that when we speak of Natural Notions, or Native Impressions of Truth and Goodness made upon the Minds of Men, though perhaps there may be something of Metaphor in it; yet the sense and meaning of it, is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood: nor is there any danger, lest any one should hence conclude the Soul to be made of White-paper, and the Knowledge we find there to be written with Pen and Ink, Heb. 10. 26. <hi>I will put my laws in their hearts,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> or <hi>upon their minds will I write them:</hi> That is, says Dr. <hi>Taylor, Duct. Dubit. p. 4.</hi> You shall be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by the Law of natural and essential Equity and Reason, by that Law which is put into every Man's Nature; and besides this, whatsoever else shall be super-induc'd, shall be written in their Minds by the Spirit, who shall write all the Laws of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Tables of your Consciences. Now I do not see any need of any such curious Remark either upon the <hi>Text</hi> or <hi>Comment;</hi> that if this pretend to any thing more than <hi>Figure or Metaphor, then it is meer Iargon and unintelligible Cant.</hi> 2. Those who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert these Natural Notions, do not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them super-induc'd or imprinted upon the Soul, <hi>In esse completo;</hi> but suppose them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104464:55"/>
to be native Properties and Qualifications of the Soul, as it is such as God first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to make it; that is, Rational and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. Now it can be no <hi>meer Iargon</hi> to ascribe to a Subject its own natural and essential Properties, such as are the very essential parts of its Constitution. They do also suppose, with Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> the ideal World, or <hi>Idea's</hi> in the Divine Intellect, which are the Archetypal Forms or Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of all Truth; these they say, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Soul in a way and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion suitable to such a being; that is, they are made either the natural Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of its being, as such, or the necessary and immediate result of its Faculties, in the right use and free exercise of'em. But the <hi>Author</hi> in the forementioned place tells us, <hi>That he accounts for the mode of Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstànding after a very different way,</hi> viz. <hi>by the presentialness of the Divine</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>or ideal World to our Souls, wherein we see and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all things.</hi> So that denying all mental Impressions, not only innate Notions, but also those, which according to Dr. <hi>Lock,</hi> derive their Original from <hi>Sensation</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slection;</hi> he asserts all sensible, moral, and intellectual Objects are only seen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the <hi>Divine</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus in his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104464:56"/>
Book of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion, p.</hi> 85. This <hi>ideal World, this Essence of God consider'd, as variously exhibitive and representative of things, is no other than the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the second Person in the ever blessed Trinity; this I think,</hi> says he, <hi>is highly agreeable to Reason: for I know no</hi> Hypothesis <hi>that would so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly make out the Eternal Generation of the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Against this Opinion, I shall briefly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest these few Prejudices, which whether they be real or only imaginary, I shall leave to the Reader to judge. 1. I grant that every good Christian, so far as in him lies, ought to defend against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Mysteries of the <hi>Trinity</hi> from all palpable and down-right Contradictions. But then it is question'd by some, whether it be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther modest, or indeed possible to invent <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> which may, as the <hi>Authour</hi> speaks, <hi>Intelligibly make out</hi> these Mysteries; or whether the Eternal Generation of the Son of God may not as well remain, as indeed it is, an Incomprehensible Mystery, as thus explain'd, by making the ideal World and the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be one and the same thing. 2lv, Though the natural parturiency of the <hi>Authors own Mind, p.</hi> 185. of his <hi>Reason and Religion,</hi> did early pitch
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104464:56"/>
upon this Notion, of seeing and knowing all things in God, as easy and obvious, even before he had consulted any Authors herein; yet other Mens Capacities may be so dull, as not easily to apprehend the manner of it, even now after such an exact Elaboration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to his Hypothesis, there seems not a sufficient difference and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt natural Knowledge and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, seeing God must imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apply himself to the Souls of Men in both, and there is no natural ground or foundation in Man for one more than for the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It seems not so becoming that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found veneration we ought to have of the Majesty of God, thus to make the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it were, the Glass of every trivial perception of sensible objects.</p>
               <p n="5">5. May not his Hypothesis, of seeing and perceiving all things in God, seem to discourage or lessen the diligent use of our Faculties in the search of Truth? or may it not encourage Enthusiasm, by giving Men occasion to think, that the only way to Knowledge is, fantastically to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the Impressions of the Ideal World? These things I here propound to Consideration, though withal, I think that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104464:57"/>
it is more easy to oppose the particular manner of any Mans explaining humane Understanding, than it is to lay down a true one of his own.</p>
               <p>But lastly, That which seems of the greatest consequence is, that the Author dangerously forces some places of Scripture only to make 'em favour the peculiarity of his notion. Thus <hi>Io. 1. 3. all things were made by him, or according to him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> p. 89. Reason and Religion,</hi> and <hi>p. 90. Heb. 1. By him God is said to make the Worlds, that is, says he, according to the eternal exemplars or platforms in this ideal World.</hi> Now if the <hi>Arrians</hi> were justly blam'd for putting that interpretation upon those words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thereby to signify an Instrumental Cause, as if the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was only an Instrument in the hand of God, in creating the World, how much more then ought this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be rejected, which makes the second Person in the Trinity only an Exemplar or Platform, according to which God made the World: <hi>but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> with a Genitive Case in Scripture, generally signifies the efficient Cause:</hi> And however, I believe, he will no where in Scripture find it in that sense, which he there puts upon it: So that this ingenious Author seems not so successful in assigning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104464:57"/>
his own particular way of humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as he was in confuting that of Dr. <hi>Lock's.</hi> And here I would further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the considerate Reader, whether this way of seeing and perceiving all things in the ideal World, <hi>if it pretend to any thing more than Figure and Metaphor, whether it be not as meer Iargon, and unintelligible Cant, as the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anima est abrasa tabula, nihil est in intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu, quod non priùs erat in sensu.</hi> These, and such like Opinions, seem to owe that general reception they meet withal, rather to the Authority of their first Founder, than to any strength of reason, that would be found in 'em, did they once undergo a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Examination: this Opinion seems to tye the Soul to its particular Seat, or at most, gives it leave only to go a begging to the Cinque-Ports of the Senses, not only for all the Notices it receives from abroad, but also for all the knowledge it enjoys at home.</p>
               <p>That the Soul, by the very Laws of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was at first dependant upon the Body, and by the first transgression of the Divine Law, is now more deeply immers'd in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a greater Slave thereto than it was by nature, is certainly true: but then the Image of God, wherein Man was at first
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104464:58"/>
Created, did first more especially respect the Soul. 2. It consisted in the respective Endowments and Perfections of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Will, <hi>viz.</hi> in Knowledge and Righteousness. And therefore 3. Not in a mere capacity, or bare possibility of having this Pourtraicture drawn afterwards upon the Soul, by the assistance of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senses, but in something at first actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally existent in it self. And supposing this to be the true state of the Case before the Fall, it is proportionably the same since: for though the Fall did very much weaken our Facultics; yet it did not wholly alter or invert the method of acquiring, or retaining Knowledge. There are indeed some, who define an Idea to be nothing else, but the similitude or representation of a thing made in the Brain: which definition being so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly appropriated to meer sense and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they cannot conceive any Idea, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to reside any where else; and that we talk mystically and unintelligibly, if we suppose any other Idea, to which that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition doth not, or cannot belong. But tho' it may be justly question'd, whether the mode of sensation be yet fully and clearly explicated, <hi>viz.</hi> how the phancy can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent outward objects in proportionable simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104464:58"/>
to the superiour perceptive faculties, seeing perhaps it would be very difficult to demonstrate, that any thing, besides mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can be communicated to the Seat of the Soul; yet I shall at present grant, that the Understanding doth make use of the Representations of the Phancy for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending those things, which were there first impress'd: and thus I here suppose all material objects are apprehended by such sensible representations.</p>
               <p>But now the Question is, Whether the Understanding cannot frame right Notions or Apprehesions: of those things, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our modes of conception, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can be represented by the Fancy: Whether there be not some things knowable, both moral and intellectual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, relating both to Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which are not, and cannot be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Sense. So that whatever it is that terminates the Act of the Understanding, that may be properly call'd an <hi>Idea, Notion,</hi> or <hi>Conception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nihil est intellectu, quod non, &amp;c.</hi> This cannot be universally true, in that latitude wherein some would take it: For <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself grants a Power of judging, of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Consequences from particular Instances,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104464:59"/>
to the Understanding, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Sense; and this Power, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, will be granted to be something: and indeed it is most probable, that he did not extend that saying any further, than as it relates only to sensible and material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>One Argument commonly made use of, to prove the Soul distinct from the Body, doth also prove the Operations of Sense and Phancy, distinct from those of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: That Faculty of the Mind, say they, by which we reason and judge of Objects, is so far from being a Body, that it must withdraw it self from all bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, when it sets it self to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template more speculative and sublime Truths: for if the Soul should always frame its Notions according to the Notices of Sense, this would only betray it into Errour; but now when it abstracts from this, and with Reason corrects what may be there justly deem'd amiss, this evidently shews the distinction of these two Faculties, and the superiority of the one above the other.</p>
               <p>So that that opinion w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> makes the Soul so wholly to depend upon the representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sense in all its operations, seems to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104464:59"/>
have a bad influence upon the belief of its immateriality, or however, upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of its way of acting, by making it more subject to the Body, than God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ever made it.</p>
               <p>Those therefore who either from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the accidental bad use, that some Men make of the distinction of these two Faculties; or from the difficulty they themselves find in assigning the differences betwixt 'em, are therefore enclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is no difference at all. These Men like unskilful Artists, do rather cut then loose the knot: and like those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate Men, who from the difficulties and seeming irregularities of Providence; or from their own inabilities or unwillingness to take the pains to solve 'em, do take, as they think, this more compendious way to extricate themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> to deny that there is any such thing as Providence in the World.</p>
               <p>But it is here objected, that the opinion, which I here assert, lays a Foundation for Fanaticism and Enthusiasm, as it gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions for the Enthusiasts to think, that those Men are too much immers'd in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and too great Slaves to sense and fancy, who do not presently apprehend their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104464:60"/>
illuminations and mysterious non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense. I shall here therefore briefly show, wherein the nature of Enthusiasm doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly consist; and that this opinion, which I here assert, is no ways chargeable with giving any occasion or encouragement to it.</p>
               <p>But 1. we may observe, that God in the wise disposals of his Providence has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times plac'd truth upon the Confines of Errour; nor is it any disparagement to it, if sometimes, by reason of this Vicinity, it may accidentally give occasion to it. This should rather teach us the true exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of our Understandings, to distinguish betwixt the false glosses and plausible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Errour, and the realities of Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall not here go about to recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for to asperse other Men's Opinions is not to vindicate our own; for though they may be charg'd with as bad Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as those they cast upon ours, yet this will not make our own innocent, if they be in themselves obnoxious. I might perhaps with as much or more reason charge <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Opinion, <hi>Nihil est in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu, quod non prius erat in sensu,</hi> with giving countenance to <hi>Atheism,</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104464:60"/>
doth to <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth's</hi> 5th <hi>Chap. Intellectual Systeme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being briesly premis'd, I answer, That according to the most rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> which founds it only in some irregular and turbulent Motions arising from the Body, and acted more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon the Scene of Fancy: according to this, I do not see, how the aforesaid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath any more influence upon <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm,</hi> than it has upon any other Errours and false Opinions whatever.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> together with most other erring persons, do take their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken Fancy and false Apprehensions for the Dictates of Reason and Understanding: So that <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> seems rather sounded in the contrary Opinion, in not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt these two; and the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> of all others seems the least chargeable with this Errour (if it be one) of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the Phantasins of Sense and Imagination, and the Ideas of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: for, as such, he scarcely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges any higher Faculty in the Soul, than that of Phancy. So that that Opinion of distinguishing betwixt the Representations of Sense and the Idea's of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath not any natural tendency to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104464:61"/>
                  <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> unless we make it the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the first grand Foundation of all Errours and mistakes in general; for almost all erring persons do tell those that differ from 'em, that either they are not speculative enough rightly to apprehend their Notions; or that they are too much prejudic'd with false Opinions, readily to entertain them.</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:104464:62"/>But before I come more closely to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Opinion, I shall premise in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, 1. That it is very strange, that God who created <hi>Man</hi> after his own <hi>Image,</hi> in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> should yet as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the Methods of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> in Men, quite different from those of his own; we know the respect and relation that the Actions of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing bear to those of the Will in Men, <hi>viz.</hi> That the one, those of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, always precede those of the Will. But now according to his Way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it is quite contrary in God; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him God doth not know or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any thing, but what he first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to be so. I know not whether I may urge this in strictness of Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it seems at least a great presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the truth of his Opinion. 2. It is a plausible pretence of Piety, a seemingly profound Veneration and Respect for the absoluteness of the Divine Perfections, which seems either the chiefest Argument for, or the greatest Motive and Perswasive to his Opinion. This tender care for the Honour of the Divine Nature, is indeed a thing very commendable in it self, and very worthy of a <hi>Philosopher</hi> and a <hi>Christian;</hi> yet
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104464:62"/>
Men ought to be very careful and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate herein, lest they lessen and derogate as much from the excellency of the Divine Nature one way, as they seem to advance it another.</p>
               <p>Now in order to a more particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Opinion, I shall observe, 1. How in the Progress of his Discourse he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishes his own Principle, and limits the general extent of the question, as it was at first stated, so as that in effect he Answers himself; for he either doth himself tacitly, at least, or from his own assertions will be forc'd to acknowledge, That there is some truth antecedent to the Divine <hi>Placitum,</hi> or appointment.</p>
               <p>In his Answer to the first Objection, that God knows, what it is that he either will or will not appoint, so that his knowledge must precede his determination; to these Premises he returns no plain positive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but only holds to the Conclusion, and says, that they who assert this, do pre-sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that there is something different from God, <hi>quod ante Dei arbitrium seu placitum habeat veritatem &amp; possibilitatem à parte sui,</hi> which he says is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the grand original mistake: here he asserts, that God knows nothing to be true, nothing to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104464:63"/>
possible before his own respective determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of both: As to the first, I shall only return what Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> says, <hi>p.</hi> 646. of <hi>his Intellectual Systeme. This is to destroy the Deity, by making one attribute thereof to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and swallow up another, insinite will and power, insinite understanding and reason; for to suppose God to understand, and to be wise only by his will, is all one as to suppose him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to have no understanding at all.</hi> As to the other, the possibility of things, I would only ask him, whether or no, there was not a possibility in God of Creating or doing more things, than ever he actually Created or did; now this possibility must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and something which God knew he had in his power, antecedent to his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding he confidently holds to the Conclusion, <hi>non datur nec concipitur ullum quid ante Dei placitum:</hi> and in the very next words he tells us (and he doth not here suppose any Divine <hi>Placitum</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene) <hi>Absurdum est dicere,</hi> &amp;c. it is not much material to repeat what he there asserts. But how comes he to call any thing <hi>absurd</hi> in this Case: the thing perhaps may be so in it self, and may be counted so by others; but, according to his Principles, how can
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104464:63"/>
any thing be <hi>absurd,</hi> antecedent to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Placitum,</hi> or appointment? For an absurdity doth suppose Truth and Falshood, according to the agreeableness or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness to which rules, a thing is said to be absurd, or not absurd: but it is very hard for a man, who has undertaken such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, not sometimes to contradict himself. <hi>Res ipse nolunt malè determinari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He further grants, that there is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary truth in this Proposition, <hi>that a thing cannot simul esse &amp; non esse:</hi> that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that contradictories should be true at the same time: as may be seen at large, <hi>p.</hi> 133. for this would make God to be <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuens &amp; non statuens, volens &amp; non volens, ponens &amp; non ponens eandem operationem; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surda haec sunt,</hi> &amp;c. I am of his Opinion too herein. But then doth not this one conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion destroy his former assertion; for why should this truth only be exempted from the common fate of all the rest. I think, <hi>Des Cartes</hi> acted, at least, more consistently with himself, when he went thorough with what he had undertaken, and tells us, that if God had pleas'd, contradictories might have been true at once: nor is it sufficient for him to say, that this would be absurd; both for the reason before mention'd, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104464:64"/>
also because several other of his assertions might be thus answer'd, That they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. But he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 126. <hi>That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his opinion destroys both the unity and absolute perfection of God; for there would not be one, absolutely perfect God, if he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing necessarily true and immutable, habens similem secum radicitùs &amp; essentialiter proprietatem,</hi> besides himself. But then what will he say to his former priviledg'd Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>nihil potest esse, &amp; non esse simul.</hi> This will either be a sufficient Answer to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of this Nature, or else he must make it an addition of another Person to the Trinity, and make it God himself. But why should he be so sollicitous, lest, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these moral and intellectual truths to be necessary and immutable, they should thus derogate from the divine perfection; for it doth not thence follow that these truths have <hi>Similem cum Deo radicitùs &amp; essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialiter proprietatem:</hi> for these truths are only things of an intellectual nature, such as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the act of Divine Wisdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; but no body says, that they have any radical or essential propriety uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally equal, or like to God.</p>
               <p>But further, What inconsistency, or what unbecomingness would there be in the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104464:64"/>
if we thus conceiv'd of God, <hi>that he is an insinitely wise and Omnipotent Being, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Himself, and the extent of his own Power, that is, the Idea's of all the possibilities of things, together with all their several, either necessary, or accidental relations one towards another.</hi> So that according to this Scheme of things, these truths are but the necessary objects of Omniscience, or infinite Wisdom; so that it is impossible, that these necessary and immutable truths should any ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Divine Perfections, seeing we cannot suppose God to be Omniscient, that is, infinitely perfect without 'em: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would these truths be so absolutely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of themselves; for we can scarce suppose any moral good or evil, unless we first suppose a God, in Conformity, or Non-Conformity to whose pure and holy nature, and to his Will, acting always according thereunto, consists the nature of both.</p>
               <p>The second thing I shall observe from his management of this Question is this; that as to things which relate to moral goodness, such is the awful power of truth, such is the natural modesty of Mankind, that inward sense they have of, and profound veneration for these things, that many times they are asham'd openly to assert that which yet may
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104464:65"/>
be the natural consequence of some false Principles they have entertain'd. And this seems the Case of this Author in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: for it is observable through his whole Discourse, he no where plainly and expresly asserts (which yet according to his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will necessarily follow) that God might, if he had so pleas'd, have appointed a quite <hi>contrary</hi> Scheme of Morality, or a Set or Systeme of moral truths just <hi>contrary</hi> to what they now are. Indeed he does say, <hi>p.</hi> 126. that this Divine <hi>Placitum</hi> was of its own nature indifferent, <hi>vel ad haec statuenda, vel plane omittenda, vel diversa decernenda,</hi> and that God might have represented himself to the minds of Men, <hi>per alia, nescio quae, quam per naturas rerum quales jam sunt,</hi> p. 136. Yet these seem to come short of asserting the quite <hi>contrary</hi> way and method. But some perhaps will say, that this is too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an interpretation put upon his words; but suppose it be, yet I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther err on this side, than on the other: yet if it be but thus far true, it will be notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a sufficient confutation of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But give me leave only to suggest the reason of that my charitable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>viz.</hi> because he osten mentions a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain decency, which he seems to make the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104464:65"/>
Rule of Divine Actions, even antecedent to the Divine Will. Thus, <hi>p.</hi> 131. he says, that the justice of God did appoint things <hi>modo ipsum decenti,</hi> in a way becoming him, which would seem an impertinent expression, if all the decency that things have arise only from God's appointing 'em to be so: and immediately after speaking of God's liberty and freedom in making things thus or thus, he says, that he was indifferent, <hi>vel ad nulla statuenda vel ad alia stabilienda, quae aequè Deum decuissent:</hi> which words seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that there was something truly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, worthy of God, antecedent to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive appointment.</p>
               <p>But then let us see how he answers that Objection, that according to his Principles, the hatred of God might have been good, and the love of him evil, if he had so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Now this might either have been so, or not; if it might, then why did he not plainly say so? if it could not, then his Principles are false, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good or evil, antecedent to the divine positive appointment. But when Men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot, or will not return plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to a plain Question, it is a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that they ly under either some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or some moral defect; that their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104464:66"/>
either do not ly smooth and clear in their Heads; or else, upon some worse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, they thus purposely wrap themselves in Clouds. But he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 136. <hi>amor praesupponit mentis naturam, haec voluntatem sive placitum Dei sese hoc modo adumbrandi.</hi> But we must abstract, he says, from all these: but now to comply with him in his own way, I am willing to abstract as far as is possible for us to abstract; only he must not abstract us into nothing, he must suffer us to remain subjects capable of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting: and yet I believe after all these, he is not that hardy Man, as in plain words to say, That God might have made the lovc of himself a Sin, and the hatred of him a vertue. However it doth not seem any good Argument of the truth, or any great commendation of the goodness of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that we must abstract from every thing, that is, (at least at present) either rational or religious, before we can possibly frame any conception of it. And yet this is the opinion, which he is so fond of, and seems to value himself so much upon, that in his Appendix, <hi>p.</hi> 304. where he makes some reflections upon his former work, he particularly commends this <hi>10th Ch. de Dei dominio, cujus excellentiam, sine jactantiâ, ob
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104464:66"/>
ipsam rei veritatem &amp; utilitatem, non satis possum commendare.</hi> And yet this seems a truer Character of it, that it is in it self false, unworthy of God, and of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to Men.</p>
               <p>I shall only here clear one place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, relating hereunto, from a forc'd and false interpretation, which <hi>Cuperus p.</hi> 246. <hi>Arcana Atheismi,</hi> has put upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>the Gentiles having not the Law, do by Nature the things contain'd in the Law; these having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves.</hi> The Apostle here designs to assert that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge, which the Gentiles had of good and evil. But, says he, before this can be made appear, we must prove these two things. 1. That by the Gentiles are here to be understood the Pagan Gentiles, those who had neither heard of the Law of Christ, nor the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> 2. That the words <hi>by Nature,</hi> are not to be join'd with those going before, thus, <hi>the Gentiles having not the Law by Nature, do the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Law.</hi> But first he has no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from any Copy, or good Authority thus to place the <hi>Comma,</hi> and so to read it; now if Men may take that liberty to place <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> where they please, they may soon make the Scripture quite another thing.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104464:67"/>
But then further, it would not be worthy of the Apostles way of discoursing, to tell us, that the Gentiles had not the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> by Nature: for who ever imagin'd they had? Now he does not grant here any other Law, not so much as any Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but then he says, that it is false, that the Gentiles not believing in Christ, either did or could perfectly observe the Law; and who ever said they could? The Text only says, <hi>That the Gentiles not having the Law,</hi> that is, not any reveal'd Law, <hi>did by nature the things of the Law.</hi> Now he will needs make doing the things of the Law, to be perfectly to observe the Law: and further, if by Gentiles be understood those that believed in Christ, how can it be said, that these are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, seeing they had both the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Law of Christ to direct 'em? But from hence it will be obvious to observe, what hard shifts Men are commonly forc'd to make, when once they engage in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a false Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:104464:67"/>Some Reflections upon the Tenth Chapter of the Second Book of <hi>Cuperus</hi> his <hi>Arcana Atheismi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Position he there endeavours to defend, is this, That by the mere light of Nature, without Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it cannot be made appear, that there is any difference betwixt Vice and Vertue, although we were already assur'd, that there was a God, <hi>etiamsi nobis jam innotuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set esse Deum.</hi> Vertue therefore and Vice, in respect of God, can be nothing else, <hi>quàm religiosus numinis cultus.</hi> Vertue indeed may, but how Vice can be a religious worship of the Deity is hard to understand. Some would think such a stumble as this, in the very Threshold, was very ominous. Others, perhaps more agreeably to his Principles, tell us, that Vice and Vertue, in respect of God, are the same as to this particular; and that God, if he had so pleas'd, might as well have been worship'd by the one, as by the other. Now worship, he says, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily requires the certain knowledge of these three things. 1. That he, to whom
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104464:68"/>
we pay it, requires any such thing at our hands. 2. What it is that he does require. 3. Upon what conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he will give in case of observance, and what punishments he will inflict in case of neglect. Now he would seem to infer, that we have no natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any of these three. I shall here, once for all, remind the Reader, that in the stating of the question he supposes, not only that there is a God, but also, that we certainly know it: Now as to the first requisite, he grants that there is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship due to God, <hi>when it doth appear that we are his Creatures, p. 250.</hi> So that by his own confession, it doth appear, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this worship at our hands, unless we may know, that there is a God, and yet at the same time not know that we are his Creatures: which would be a strange posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Christian Philosopher to assert. And secondly, if we know that there is a God, then we know in general how and with what actions he will be worship'd. If God be a Spirit, then he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd with a pure mind, was a natural and easy consequence made by an honest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. This I say will follow, unless we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an Immoral God. But this, though
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104464:68"/>
it be both absurd and impious to do, yet I am afraid it will not be counted either by him. As to his third Requisite, we grant, that we owe it only to Divine Revelation, that God will reward our imperfect obedience with such degrees of eternal happiness: yet this even Nature teaches us, that holiness doth either entitle us to happiness, or at least to a freedom from misery. And as for what he says, That it cannot be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, whether, or how they will be served, unless they first openly declare it; the Argument is no ways conclusive, if it be apply'd to this case, because Men have no other way to make known their Will, but by outward Declarations: butGod has, <hi>viz.</hi> those natural Notions, which he inwardly inserted into the Minds of Men. But to this he answers, That since Men draw these things from natural reason, they must also by the same reason prove the existence of a God: but since that cannot be done, neither can there be any natural knowledge of good and evil, of Vice and Vertue. But here though I do not grant, That the Being of God, cannot be prov'd by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet I must remind him, that he flies here from the Question, as it was by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self first stated, where he supposes the B<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104464:69"/>
of God to be now known to us. But then, as if he was himself conscious of his Evasion herein, he immediately adds, <hi>Vel st aliqua inde petenda esset, scilicet vitii vel vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis cognitio,</hi> &amp;c. if there was any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Vice and Vertue to be drawn from Nature, then it could be no other, than that that should be counted vicious, from which any Man's Nature doth abhor; and that honest, to which Men are carryed by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Propension. But this is a strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Morality, to make every Man's exorbitant Lusts and Passions the rule and measure of good and evil; nay, according to these Principles there can searce be any thing evil, for <hi>p.</hi> 254. he tells us, <hi>Nihil fere est, nec ullum flagitium, ad quod natura multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> &amp;c. that there is scarce any wickedness, to which the Nature of many Men is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclin'd. I shall not here particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine his Opinion concerning Original Sin, only herein he shows himself neither a sound Divine, nor good Philosopher; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of the Heathens themselves did acknowledge the Substance, that is, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral depravation of humane Nature, tho' they were unacquainted with the Name and Nature of it. But he again resumes his former Argument, That if the way how
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104464:69"/>
God is to be Worshipped, may be known by the light of Nature, then the reward of eternal Life, might be known also by the same light. But this is no good consequence, as I before show'd. 'Tis true, neither the way and method of Divine Worship, nor eternal Life are so clearly known by the Light of Nature, as they are now made manifest to us by Divine Revelation: yet it doth not thence follow, but that Nature hath, in some measure, discover'd Both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, 2 Tim. 1. 10. <hi>Christ hath indeed brought life and immortality to light, through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;</hi> that is, made clearer manifestations of it; but then this hinders not, but that both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> might have some more obscure and imperfect Notions of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>But he goes on and tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 252. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis &amp; vitii Christiani notitia,</hi> &amp;c. That the knowledge of Vice and Vertue, both among <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> is no otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to either of'em, but by Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And here he urges Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known Sin but by the Law; and I had not known Lust, if the Law had not said, Thou shalt not covet.</hi> But here first I would ask him, Whether those People, who have no outward Law given 'em, either do or can
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104464:70"/>
commit any sin, provided they do but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own natural Inclinations? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, there is no sin, but when a Man is guilty of such a strange piece of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, as not to comply with his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Appetites, when there is nothing, as in this case, that forbids him so to do. Thus <hi>p.</hi> 260. he tells us, That no actions, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Worship of God, by the mere Light of Nature, can be counted sin, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter illas à quibus vel omnium hominum natura abhorret, vel in certis hominibus illas, quae ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorum naturae sunt contrariae.</hi> Where by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> he means nothing but natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Appetites and Inclinations: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Man must have a new Nature, and a new Bible given him, before this will pass either for Reason or Religion. But then for the better understanding of that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited; some say, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> there doth not speak in his own Person, but in the Person of a <hi>Iew,</hi> brought up under such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who did not understand coveting, as it includes the inward act only, to be a sin. Others say, That sin was known to be so by the Law of Nature, before the giving of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law; thus <hi>Theophylact,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; &amp;c. How was the Deluge brought upon the World? And
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104464:70"/>
why were the <hi>Sodomites</hi> destroy'd by fire, if Lust was not known to be a sin before the Law? So that the Law did not first make Lust to be a sin, but did more expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be so. He quotes indeed several other places of Scripture, but to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>p. 254. Si pietatis officia specialia,</hi> &amp;c. if the special Offices of Piety were known by the Light of Nature, then there must be some certain foundation from whence they might be drawn. Here he mentions three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Natural Instinct.</item>
                  <item>2. The Sanctity of God.</item>
                  <item>3. Divine Power, or Dominion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As for the first, Natural Instinct, this indeed, he says, is not the rule of humane Actions, to them who live under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; but, according to his Principles, it must be to them who only enjoy the Light of Nature.</p>
               <p>Nor, Secondly, says he, can the Sanctity of God be the rule of our Actions; but the reason he there gives, is a very strange one, and very odly express'd, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>God acts nothing but by instinct of his Nature,</hi> nor is <hi>there any thing holy in God, but what his Nature desires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this I Answer: First, That God sometimes acts as an absolute Soveraign of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104464:71"/>
the Universe, and Governour of the World; and in these cases his Actions are not, in all particulars, to be the rule of ours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It seems an irreverend way of speaking, to say, That God acts out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of Nature, which is commonly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly attributed to meer Animals: yet grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Expression <hi>in sano sensu,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be suppos'd, that God doth daily alter the Determination of his Will concerning the same Object.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yet this we may safely say, That the holiness of God is the rule of our Actions, so far as, either by the Light of Nature, or Divine Revelation, it is made known to us to be so.</p>
               <p>But in the Third placo, He resolves all into the absolute Power and Dominion of God, That nothing is just and good, but that only which he commands, and for no other reason, but because he does so: And yet in the very next Sentence, <hi>p.</hi> 255. (as if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from within had whisper'd better things to him) he tells us, That God indeed may command any thing, <hi>Madò Dei naturae non sit contrarium, ut talia siant,</hi> &amp;c. provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be not contrary to his Nature, that it should be done. This indeed is a very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and prudent, a true and rational Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104464:71"/>
but then it contradicts the design of the whole Chapter. Some things indeed may be more evidently and directly contrary to the Nature of God, as not to love, or not to obey him; but then to forbid all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of himself, all Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to command all filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit in rational Creatures, this certainly is also contrary to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He then proceeds, as he says, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the principal parts both of Natural and Christian Religion, in order to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there lies any obligation upon us to 'em, but meerly by the Divine Command. And here I grant, That those Truths, and those Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> the belief of a Trinity and Faith in Christ, that depend meerly upon Divine Revelation, cannot be known to be such, by the Light of Nature: But then the reason is not the same in those other Moral Duties, which Christianity did not first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, but only further illustrate and confirm to us. Nor shall I here follow him through all the parts of Natural Religion, which he there instances in: I shall only pitch upon one, which yet seems of the greatest weight and moment, that of Iustice. This, he says, cannot be recommended to us from the Nature of God, because it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104464:72"/>
by Nature, <hi>Deum neminem injuriâ affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> That God does no Body any wrong: For, he says, that if that be injury, when we hurt those who have not deserved any such thing at our hands; <hi>Quid infantes in Deum peccaverunt?</hi> Wherein have Infants sin'd against God, who yet many times are grievously afflicted by him? To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I before premised this, That God sometimes acts, as a Soveraign, or Lord of the World; and in this case some actions may be injurious, or unjust in Men, which are not so in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The consideration of original sin, might give easie Solutions to what he there urges: But because he doth not acknowledge any such thing, I shall not therefore here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no ways contrary to Divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to inflict very high degrees of Asflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on rational Creatures, provided that the Mercies they injoy be more than the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they undergo: And he will never prove, that God ever inflicted such Miseries upon Infants, but that, if they had the power of Election, they would rather chuse to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go 'em, than their own Annihilation. But he lays great stress upon that action of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104464:72"/>
                  <hi>Israelites</hi> robbing of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which was done by God's Command, or Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and therefore was no sin: Therefore nothing is just or unjust in it self, but only as God commands, or forbids it.</p>
               <p>In Answer to this some say, That God herein acted as the universal Creator and original Proprietor of all things, and here transfer'd the Property, as he justly might, from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Others say, That as Soveraign Legislator, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spens'd with the Law in this particular; yet it will not follow hence, that there is nothing good or evil, but with respect to God's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Command: For I humbly conceive, there are some other <hi>rationes boni &amp; mali,</hi> more sacred and indispensable, than those of Property.</p>
               <p>If the Reader here Object, That my Stile, especially in the latter end of this Chapter, is more than ordinarily rough and uneven; I willingly acknowledge, that I am no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of it, not in the most even way, where all lies plain before me: But then here in my Reflexions upon <hi>P. Poiret,</hi> and <hi>Caperus,</hi> I had a mind to keep as near to their words, as I well could, lest some perhaps might say, That I injur'd their sence; and all Men know, how rough and broken the Stile

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Being of God.</head>
               <p>IT is the general method of the Atheists of the present Age, to skirmish, as it were, in their Arguings, rather than come to a close Engagement; and think they have got matter enough of Triumph, if they can defeat some of those Arguments, we bring for the Proof of a God, or by some subtle Evasion, lessen, or enervate the force of 'em. They do not much pretend, by posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments to prove the reasonableness of their own Opinions, or the impossibility of ours; both which they ought to do, if they would gain any Credit to their Cause.</p>
               <p>The Heathen Philosophers, and Orators of Old used to invoke the Deity to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe a Blessing upon their respective Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and taught it as a Duty incumbent upon all, with Prayers to Sanctifie their first
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104464:73"/>
Entrance upon any work of Importance. But now to desire an Atheist to do thus, would seem a direct contradiction, and a begging of the Cause, to desire him to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that, which by the state of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, he is engaged to deny.</p>
               <p>But yet an Atheist himself in this dispute, wherein the right knowledge of the Truth is of so much concernment to him, ought at least to bring with him a teachable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and disposition of Mind and Will, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive what his understanding upon the fairest consideration of things that they are capable of, dictates to be, if not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely demonstrated, yet most rationally probable, and most prudentially credible. The Atheist therefore, seeing he cannot be absolutely sure, and positively certain, That there is no God, ought (and that without any Violation to his Principles as a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, however highly agreeable to his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a Man) at least to make such Applications as these to that Supream Power, whose Existence he very much doubts, or perhaps rather denies; That if there be any such, then that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to enlighten his Understanding with the true knowledge of the truth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his Will to be Belief of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104464:74"/>And here 'tis observable, That <hi>Protago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> who was generally counted an Atheist, and was expelled out of <hi>Athens</hi> for being so; yet as <hi>Diog. Laert.</hi> reports of him, he makes <hi>Precatio</hi> to be the first part of an Oration.</p>
               <p>What was the first occasion of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Triad,</hi> whether the contrary false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Atomists</hi> concerning the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality of the Universe, and the manner of its Formation, according to the way and method laid down by the Learned Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in his Treatise of <hi>Idol. p.</hi> 407, 408. I shall not here dispute: Yet as to the Belief of a God in general, that was never occasioned by any false belief of others to the contrary, because Truth, in order of Nature, is always antecedent to Errour. What is said of Idols, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 14. 13. That they were not from the beginning; the same may be said of Vice, and Errour, that they were not so from the beginning, but that Truth and Vertue was still antecedent to them. <hi>Primus in Orbe Deos fecit timor,</hi> is so far from being true, that the Belief of a God was the cause of Fear; and not Fear the cause of the Belief of a God.</p>
               <p>The Opinion of the Existence of a Deity has so much the advantage of the contrary, that of Atheism, that I believe, its very Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104464:74"/>
when at any time they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves seriously to consider, and examine the reasons on both sides, that their dissent is not so much their Opinion that the thing is really so, as their secret desire and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it should be so; for if we consider either the weakness of their own Arguments, or the frivolous Answers they return to ours, one would think, that they had not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground so much as to found an Opinion upon, so much violence do they offer in their Arguings, not only to Religion, but to Reason too. Though the Atheists of the former Ages seem more excusable, than these of ours, for they wanting those Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Arguments drawn from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and not knowing so well how rightly to manage those natural ones (which yet if rightly used, would have proved a God) they thus argued themselves into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, or into Tenents very like it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ours, either out of Ignorance or inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, either not willing, or not able impartially and throughly to examine the Arguments, which both Reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do afford them, they thus run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into foolish and false Opinions, satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with meer shadows of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning instead of Substances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:104464:75"/>Thus a Spirit must be banished out of the World, only because they say the Notion of it implies a Contradiction: And the World must be the result of the Fortuitous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Atoms, only boccuse it implies no Logical Contradiction that it should be so; thus boldly asserting impossibility, where indeed there is none, and resting in bare Possibilities where there is no reason to do so. And this seems the very Sum and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Philosophy of our Modern Atheists.</p>
               <p>But 'tis here objected, That the Belief of a Deity was an Opinion at first invented, and afterwards continued in the World by those whose Interest prompted them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>viz.</hi> by Kings and Princes, and those of the Ecclesiastical Order, the one to keep their People in awe, the other to maintain and bear up the reputation of their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion at first was only the Politick Invention of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and afterwards for the same reasons carried on by their successive orders: That the Thunderings and Lightnings of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> were only the well-order'd Plots of somewhat like Drums and Gun-powder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Stage; and that the Miracles of our <hi>SAVIOUR</hi> were only the deluding
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104464:75"/>
and cheating of the outward Senses of some, and the inward Imaginations of others; that his seeming restoring Eyes to the Blind, was only the deceiving the Eyes of the Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a perswading the Blindman that he saw, what indeed he did not. But it would be too frivolous a design to go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute such an extravagant and groundless As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; for perhaps it would require as much power to perswade a Blind Man, that he saw, when he did not; as really to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store his Eyes.</p>
               <p>But then as to the Principle, whereon the Objection is founded, I shall do these three things.</p>
               <p>First, Show the weakness and falseness of it in it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Accidentalness of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Unfitness and Improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, as made by them, and how it may be with as much strength retorted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Foundation of the Argument is this; That that is justly suspected as false in Religion, the Belief or Practice whereof is joyned with either publick, or private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to those concern'd. Now nothing is more false than this, for this is one <hi>main</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:104464:76"/>
Foundation of our Natural Religion; and part even of the <hi>Gentile's</hi> Creed, <hi>viz.</hi> A Belief that God is, and <hi>that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him;</hi> That such is the Goodness of God towards us, that he has joyned our Duty and our Interest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not only as to the future, but also as to the present Life: And God, in so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Frame of our Religion, has but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded and confirmed the common sense of Mankind, and acted according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Humane Nature; for such is the Constitution thereof, that Good and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is the necessary Object of all our Desires. Now if any thing of present or future Advantage be made an Argument of the falseness of things in Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may then upon the same grounds question the Truth and Reasonableness of all humane Actions; because Men necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily propound some kind of advantage to themselves in 'em all. But this would lay a Foundation of Scepticism in Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cause us to reject or doubt of things for those very reasons, for which we ought to receive 'em.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Objection taken from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that attend Religion is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent and accidental one, such as could be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104464:76"/>
of no force in the first Ages of the Church, when Christianity exposed its Professors to nothing but Persecution, their Names to Sandal and Reproach, their Estates to Ruine, and their Bodies to Martyrdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I shall show the unfitness of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as made by them that urge it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if those Men were so Heroical in their pursuits of Vertue and Holiness, as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace 'em meerly upon the account of their Intrinsick Excellence; then might there something more be pleaded for 'em: But since they are Men of Debauched Lives, and if possible to justifie their own Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, would insinuate into the Minds of others, a secret belief, That Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meer Cheat: This is the greatest instance not only of Profaneness, but of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, because the Argument may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, with as much strength upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, thus.</p>
               <p>If the Belief of a God and Religion be therefore suspected to be false, because it is the Interest of those that believe 'em, that there should be both:</p>
               <p>Then why may not the Denial of a God be rejected for the same reasons; because it is as much the Interest of wicked Men, that there should be no God, as it is of good
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104464:77"/>
Men, that there should be one. So that if there be any force in the Argument, it proves as much against themselves, as it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us.</p>
               <p>As for those who tell us, That the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God includes in it a Contradiction, and that it is and ever was impossible that there should be one; these Men indeed take the most effectual way of defending their Cause, in case they could prove their Assertion: For whoever grants the possibility of the Being of God, must either grant that he really is, or else will be forced to contradict himself; for what is possible may be reduced into Act. But if God be not now, and actually was not existent from all Eternity; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for such a Being, as is included in his notion, ever to begin to be: And this seems to be <hi>Bradwardine's</hi> Argument, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 3. So that an Atheist must prove not only that there is no God, but that it was from Eternity impossible, that there should be one; neither of which, he will ever be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prove.</p>
               <p>The Being of God is not the less credible, because it is not capable of such proofs as some other things are; all things will not admit of Mathematical Demonstrations, nor indeed is it expected, that they should;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104464:77"/>
nor are they on this account less true and certain than those that do: For sometimes the very possibility of Demonstration ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues some degree of uncertainty, or obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the thing to be demonstrated; thus Indemonstrables are always the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, therefore the Being of God is not therefore the less certain, because it cannot be demonstrated. Some indeed are so gross in their Reasonings, that they make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility of Spirits an Argument against their Existence; whereas indeed the very Reasons, upon which we believe their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, are inconsistent with their Visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>That some Heathens did worship that one supream and true God, is certainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both from the Testimony of Profane and Sacred History, Act. 17. 23. <hi>Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</hi> So that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> either worshipped the true God, or St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to 'em a false one; yet 'tis generally agreed, that such Heathens might be, and were guilty of Idolatry. Nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinders, but that the <hi>Papists</hi> may be guilty of Idolatry, though they do not only acknowledge the true God, but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Trinity; nor do I see, how their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104464:78"/>
as such, that is, such as is consistent with the Belief of the true God, is capable of any mitigation; because no one charges them with any other, than what they are truly guilty of.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Protestants</hi> indeed say, That some of the Heathens are capable of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that the <hi>Papists</hi> make for themselves, that is, That they only give an Inferiour Worship to Saints and other Inferiour Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but pay the Supream Worship to the Supream God only.</p>
               <p>Now this Plea seems to hold as much for the one, as for the other, and must either acquit both or neither. Nor can the <hi>Papists</hi> their being more particularly instructed in the Knowledge of the Nature and Will of God, be any Mitigation of their Offence, but rather an Aggravation of it. False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is neither in its own Nature fit, nor was it ever intended by God, as a proper means whereby to defend truth: For this neither stands in need of a Lye, nor can it really be defended by it; nor is it our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest or Prudence to attempt the defence of a good Cause by weak Arguments; for this will only give occasion to our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when they see that they can easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer these, to think worse of our cause, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104464:78"/>
that all the rest of our reasonings are of the same nature. Yet granting that some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments sometimes made use of to prove the Being of God, are not absolutely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and conclusive, yet are they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be rejected, as useless; and that upon these two accounts.</p>
               <p>First, Because they that urge them, do not make use of any single Argument, as if the Cause did wholly depend upon it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In things of a Moral Concernment, there may be such a thing as an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative Demonstration, as Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> tells us in another Case. (<hi>Pag. 124. Lib. 1. Cases of Consc.</hi>) Therefore, supposing a Man in his attempt to prove the Being of God, should either through the shortness of his Meditations, or the sublimeness of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, make use of an Argument not perfectly conclusive; yet seeing the success of the Cause depends not upon it, and seeing the Man perhaps has effected as much, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it; that is, added his Mite to the former Treasury; upon the whole matter, it seems hard if such an one must be prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, as an Atheist, or a Betrayer of the Cause of Religion. <hi>Cicer. de Univers.

               </p>
               <p>Among the many Arguments brought to prove the Being of God, these two seem the most considerable.</p>
               <p>First, That comprehensive one which is drawn from the Being of the World; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I understand not only the Divine Power of creating or producing something out of nothing, but that admirable Wisdom also that appears in making it such as it is; and in the proper subserviencies of things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to their respective Ends; That Argument further which is drawn not only from the Material, but the Intellectual Universe, not only from the structure of the Body, but the Nature of the Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which is drawn from the Consent and universal Acknowledgment of all Nations.</p>
               <p>As for that, which seems <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the World was from Eternity, and yet that it was in Nature of an Effect, in respect of God, the Cause; it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to free this Assertion, either from a Contradiction, or from an unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104464:79"/>
upon the Excellency of the Divine Nature. For if God, as a Cause, was in time antecedent to the World, then it is a contradiction to say, it was from Eternity. If it did flow from God, as an Emanative Effect, as the Beams from the Sun; then this destroys the chiefest Perfection of the Divine Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> its Liberty.</p>
               <p>And this seems one of the best Arguments to prove, That the World neither was, nor could be from Eternity, and it will be very hard, (if once we give our Adversaries leave to suppose it to be Eternal) by any other Argument to force 'em out of their Opinion: For I do not see, that it would be any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity to say, That supposing the World to be Eternal, there has been as many Years as Days; that is, an equal Infinite number of both, all Infinites being Equal; for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity can no more be exhausted by Years than Days; if it could, then it would not be, what it is in its own nature, inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But the truth is, such is the nature of Infinite with respect to our Finite Capacity, that the one is not a Competent Iudge of the other: and when we enter into disputes of this nature, we are often entangled with unanswerable difficulties on both sides.</p>
               <p>But the Atheist tells us, That all this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104464:80"/>
Universe, the Heavens, the Earth, and all Mankind at first were the lucky hits of blind Chance, which after almost infinite successless Tryals going before, did at last happen upon these admirable and excellent Structures, particularly those of humane Bodies. But here we must know, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Principles, the same Chance, which first made us, must still continue us. But then how comes it to pass, that Chance is so regular and constant in its Productions since? That whereas it is above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to one, according to these Principles, but that Mankind long ere this, must have wholly ceased to have been, or else nothing but Monsters have been produced; instead hereof we see a very regular and orderly course of Nature generally observed?</p>
               <p>This is, as if a Man should be a thousand years in casting all sizes upon six Dice, and then for a thousand years after to throw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, if we could suppose a Mans Life to last so long. Whoever can believe such strange things as these, ought never to blame any one for being over credulous.</p>
               <p>As for that other Argument, drawn from the consent of Mankind, there are some who tell us, That those natural Impressions of God upon the minds of Men, upon which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104464:80"/>
this universal consent is founded, are mere imaginary things, and that there is no need of 'em in our disputes against Atheism. But these Men might do well to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not too much oblige the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists, and go too far towards the betraying the Cause of God, and Religion in the World, who willingly quit and give up that Argument which hath hitherto been mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with such good success by the best and wisest of Men in all Ages: willingly, I say, to give it up <hi>gratis:</hi> for I verily believe, it can never be forc'd and wrested out of the hand of a Christian Philosopher, who rightly understands it. And why should we grant any thing to an Atheist, which may tend to the advantage of his, or the prejudice of our own Cause? unless he necessarily force it from us by dint of Argument; always provided, that we readily acknowledge evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Truth whereever we find it.</p>
               <p>First, I conceive, there neither is nor can be any Argument in a true and proper sense, <hi>à priore,</hi> to prove the Being of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Idea is not such; But it is an arguing from the effect to the Cause, only the effect seems a more immediate one, and such as bears a more particular resemblance to the Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:104464:81"/>That somewhat was from Eternity, is evidently demonstrable; for if once there was nothing, it was impossible for any thing ever to begin to be: Now this something must be either Matter or Spirit, a thinking or unthinking Being; it cannot be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Being, for then it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that there should be any such thing, as Knowledge or Cogitation in the World, which yet we are inwardly consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our selves of. For as Dr. <hi>Lock, Chap. 10. Book</hi> 4. hath well observ'd; <hi>It is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to conceive, that ever bare incogitative matter should produce a thinking intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that nothing of it self should produce matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it must be either Man, that was the first Eternal Being, the Creator of all things, or some other Being. But though the Atheists are not the greatest Wits in the World, yet we must not think 'em such very Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists neither, as to make mere Man to set up for a Sovereign Creator. Thus we have an Idea, or Conception of a Being infinitely more perfect than our selves, and therefore we were not the Cause of our own Existence: for if we had, we should then have given our selves those Perfections, which we find wanting in us, and conceive in another.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104464:81"/>
Therefore we owe our Existence to, and dependance upon that Being without us, which enjoys all Perfections.</p>
               <p>But now the Question is, Whether the Idea be the Cause, or occasion of this Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, or the Ratiocination the Cause of the Idea. Some think, that these two, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning and the Idea, ought not to be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or contradistinguish'd in this dispute: For the Idea is not such an Engine, as of it self will prove the Being of God, without the Use and Exercise of reasoning thereupon. So that the Idea doth not exclude, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the use of our Faculties; nor is it any receding from the Argument so to do: Yet it seems more probable, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Man, Co-eval with and connatural to his very Being, that dictates such a thing, and directs our thoughts and reasonings that way; for it is not probable, that Men should, as it were, accidentally, and yet so generally agree in one and the same thing, without some inward suggestions, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations at least to employ their Faculties upon such an object, <hi>viz.</hi> a Supreme Being.</p>
               <p>So that though this Idea be not so full and perfect, but that it may receive further Additions of strength and clearness from Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination; yet this is no more a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104464:82"/>
to the Works of Nature, that they are sometimes further perfected by Study and Industry, than it is to a Man, that he was not born with all those accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, which he hath afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next to a Sceptick, who grants no Principles at all, it is the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to convince an Atheist, who asserts such absurd and unreasonable ones, that he can scarce be urged with any greater, so that he will more easily evade the force of any Argument, if what we urge upon him, as an absurdity, if he make it, as it were the very Foundation of his Discourse. Only 'tis observable, that such Men are more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevail'd upon by the Convictions of Conscience, which is done, I conceive, by awakening those natural impressions of God, and their obligations to him in their minds) than merely by convincing their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the managing our thoughts upon this subject, we ought to consider, not only what is in it self possible, and perhaps may imply no contradiction, but what upon a full consideration of things, and all their circumstances, may be counted most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, what is worthy of our rational Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104464:82"/>
to assert, and a prudent Person to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>So that after these inward impressions made upon the minds of Men, and those outward manifestations of himself by the Works of Creation and Providence, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would be difficult, even for the most Sceptical Person to assign, what further Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Evidence he could desire for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Deity. Nor does that variety of Opinions concerning the Nature of God in different Nations and among different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, any whit lessen the credibility of his Being, but rather confirms and strengthens it. For this shows, that it was not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or Contrivance of any single Nation at first, nor of more jointly afterwards; for if they had thus combin'd together, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd one from another, in all probability they would have agreed better in their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Opinions concerning him: Nor was Religion any humane Invention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the Exorbitances of Mankind, because there was Religion before any such Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as a Learned Prelate of our own has well observed; <hi>That Oppression, though by Accident, grew rather from Religion, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from Oppression;</hi> for before the two Brothers, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> had offer'd up
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104464:83"/>
their Sacrifice, there was no such thing as Oppression.</p>
               <p>There are some, who tell us, that the Being of God cannot be proved by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Arguments, from any natural impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made upon the minds of Men, dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any such thing; others, that it cannot be proved by any external ones, drawn from the nature of the Universe, or any thing else without us. Now the Atheists make this advantage of these our unseasonable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences herein, That they bid us first An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer our own Arguments, which we bring against our selves: and if the Being of God cannot be proved either way, which some among our selves do with too much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness severally assert; then they think they have gain'd their point. For as for Divine Revelation, they do not much value that, as thinking it not so proper to be urged against them, because they believe nothing of the whole matter. What <hi>Cuperus</hi> in his <hi>Arcana Atheismi,</hi> sayes of Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are first convinc'd by it, That there is a God, and afterwards thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to prove it by reason, I think, may be better apply'd, in some proportion, to these two ways of probation here made use of, thus; That from these natural impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104464:83"/>
made upon the minds of Men, we have the first grounds of our belief of a God: and then this is further confirmed by those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Arguments drawn from Nature.</p>
               <p>—Quae non prosunt singula, juncta juvant.</p>
               <p>I shall here make some short remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cuperus</hi> his Opinion in this particular; In the beginning of his Proem he tells us, with some kind of Formality and Ostentation, That the only prejudice, that can be done to a good cause, is to endeavour to defend it by weak Arguments. That he had frequent opportunities of hearing Atheists (being bred up amongst'em) discovering the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Arguments, which the Theists brought against 'em. Hereupon he was forced to think upon some more effectual way of proving the Being of a God, than hitherto had been made use of, which is this, to deny all natural knowledge of God, and utterly to reject, at least at first, all those Arguments drawn from the light of nature, and to prove his Being by Divine Revelation. This indeed is a very firm and sure way of doing it, but I am afraid it will not be altogether so cogent, as to convince an Atheist: for such an one will not believe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104464:84"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> his History, neither the Creation, nor any Tradition relating to it.</p>
               <p>Now the whole force of his Argument will depend upon this slender hinge, <hi>viz.</hi> The faithful and uninterrupted conveyance of this Tradition to all succeeding Ages: But <hi>the present Learned Archbishop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, <hi>in that excellent Sermon of his against</hi> Atheism, <hi>Page</hi> 51. tells us, <hi>That it is much more likely, that the Belief of God, is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was bred in the mind of Man, and born with him, than a Tradition, transmitted from hand to hand, through all Generations; especially if we consider, how many rude and barbarous Nations there are, which consent in the Opinion of a God, and yet have scarce any certain Tradition of any thing that was done amongst'em, but two or three Ages before.</hi> If the Knowledge of God, says <hi>Cuperus, (Proem. p. penult.)</hi> was drawn from the Light of Nature, then it needed not to be proved, That there was a God; because thus we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, and already believe it: But may not his own way of arguing be retorted more justly upon himself? When he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 246. That, <hi>Postquam per Dei Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem edocti sumus esse Deum, tum intelligi posse,</hi> &amp;c. When by Divine Revelation we are taught there is a God, then we can find
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104464:84"/>
out natural Arguments to prove it. But when we are first taught and convinc'd by DivineRevelation, That there is a God, How do Arguments drawn from natural reason, afterwards prove it? So that indeed these Arguments will be little more than Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or further Confirmations of a thing already believed, because revealed. But then he says in the same place, <hi>Principia ostendi deberent, ex quibus is, qui nullam un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Numinis mentionem, vel suspicionem hausisset, sponte in Numinis, Naturae Conditoris, agnitionem paulatim deduceretur.</hi> Some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples must be shown, from whence he that never heard the least mention, nor had the least suspicion of a Diety, might be drawn to the knowledge of him. To this, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
               <p>First, That according to the Principles of those Men, whom he now opposes, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ordinarily suppose a Man, without some suspicion at least of a Deity; for this, say they, is born with him, and he must not suppose his Adversaries Assertion to be false, but prove it so.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why may not that conviction of mind, which is the result of our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties rightly reasoning hereupon, inferring the Existence of a Supream Being, together
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104464:85"/>
with that inward consciousness of our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to him? Why may not these be Principles sufficient to prove, so far as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for Nature to do it, That there is a God, and that to one who had not heard any other way that there was one? But he seems to lay a great stress upon that of a Man's having, or not having heard the least mention of a God before. But if he suppose a Man so to have heard of a God, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, as thereupon really to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Existence, then those natural Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought to prove the same, may further confirm him in his belief; but tho' he have heard mention made of a God, and yet not believe that there is any such thing, I do not understand, how his bare hearing of him before will any ways make those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, drawn from Nature, the more effectual to convince him.</p>
               <p>If Men of late have too frequently run into Atheism, it was not any weakness they found in that Argument drawn from the Light of Nature to prove the Existence of a God, (so far as can in reason be expected from it) that was the cause thereof; but he seems to lay the fault there, where indeed he ought not, and ascribes it to the weak defence that some Men have made of a good
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104464:85"/>
Cause, only thereby to magnifie and usher in his own new Notion with more pomp, <hi>p.</hi> 247. He there grants, that Men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have some Notion, or Idea of God: but then, <hi>Nullus alius modus inveniri potest, quo mentes hominum occupavit, quàm quòd ab ipso Deo per Revelationem, vel Creationem sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertus.</hi> If by Creation he means that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral constitution of Soul, whereby, by the very Laws or Creation, natural to such a Being, this Notion of God was imprinted on it: then his Assertion would be true, but then he would herein contradict himself. By Creation therefore he must mean only that Tradition of the Being of God, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved down to all Mankind from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and then we can easily assign another way how this Idea might possess the Minds of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> that before mention'd natural Inscription. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. there his chief design is to prove, that the Being of God is not knowable by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now I humbly conceive, that in that Dialogue, which he fram'd betwixt <hi>Philalethes</hi> and <hi>Misalethes,</hi> he did not equal justice to Truth in stating the Question so, as to make <hi>Philalethes,</hi> (whose Province it ought to have been rather to defend than prove the <hi>Being of God</hi>) the Opponent;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104464:86"/>
whereas he should in strictness, rather have been Respondent: for this advantage accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Misalethes,</hi> by being on the Defensive part, that meer Evasions might serve instead of solid Answers. For it seems a more easie thing to defend an Errour, than to oppose a Truth.</p>
               <p>Though I speak not this as if Truth was not able, not only to defend it self, but to convince its Adversaries, provided that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would do it. But I do not see, why we should give that advantage to the Atheists, as to give 'em leave to <hi>suppose</hi> us at once, both out of our Reason and Religion too. <hi>p. 264. Cùm verò omnes ex natur â petitas rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, quae pro utraque sententiâ proferri possunt, invalidas esse,</hi> &amp;c. Seeing, he says, he has proved all the natural Reasons brought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for, or against the <hi>Being of God,</hi> to be invalid, and the Atheist, he says, has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to relie on: then the most natural consequence hereof will be, That the Atheists must now hang in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> and profess themselves Scepticks; and this is the utmost that he can pretend to have effected upon 'em, <hi>p. 265.</hi> He tells us, That that Notion of a God, which so generally prevails in the World, must be derived from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for <hi>si conficta esset,</hi> &amp;c. if it were feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104464:86"/>
then it would be necessary, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation there should be some who first invented it, and perswaded it upon others; <hi>Quod,</hi> (p. 266.) <hi>sanè impossibile est, nisi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines qui de Deo nihil unquam audiverunt, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali dispositione ad illam opinionem maximè essent proclives;</hi> where he grants, That if there be such a natural Proclivity in the Minds of Men to believe a God, then his Argument fails: he therefore should have bent his utmost force to disprove this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Disposition, or Proclivity to believe a God; but the Argument he there brings, will not do it. 'Tis only this, that <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortius</hi> and some others relate, That there are some Nations in <hi>America,</hi> who cannot be perswaded that there is a God. To this I Answer,</p>
               <p>First, That it will proportionably prove against himself, and destroy the Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own Tradition, for it will follow hence, either that God had not taken care to make known this Original Tradition to all Nations, or that they which were the first Founders of these Nations, had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to teach it to their Posterity; or that in process of time both Parents and Children were grown so rude and barbarous, as to forget it: and indeed, according to this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104464:87"/>
it is a wonder that half of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> World long e're this, is not become mere <hi>Soldanians,</hi> without any knowledge of God, or any Principles of Morality; nor can there be any good account given of those Moral Principles of Honesty, according to this Traditionary way, which were as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, and perhaps with a greater Unisormity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We do not say, that this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God is so implanted in the Minds of Men, or so connatural to our Faculties, but that by carelesness and Inadvertency, by Vice and Luxury, by habitual Wickedness and Debauchery it may be in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure obliterated.</p>
               <p>Others tell us, That the Being of God is not to be proved either by any Original Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or by any Natural Impressions made upon Men's Minds, but only by external Arguments drawn from the Nature of things, and from the Nature of Man; that is, from the consideration of his Soul and Body, not supposing, or including any such Natural Notices: I do not here go about to oppose any Arguments brought to support and defend the Cause of God and Religion in the World. <hi>Valeant quantùm valere pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt:</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:104464:87"/>
Only when their Authors would mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize all the force of Argument to their own way of arguing, and absolutely reject all the rest; this, I think, is to give our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries <hi>advantage over us.</hi> Thus that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentleman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> in his late Book, <hi>p. 197.</hi> tells us, <hi>That the knowledge of the Being of God is clearly, and without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to be read, from the great Book of the Creation, without any assistance from natural Impressions;</hi> and he cites Rom. 1. 19, 20. <hi>Because that which is known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them; for the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things, that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Where he says, The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle appeals to the common reason of Mankind, guided by things without us, for the proof of a Deity: But it doth not appear from hence, that he draws his Argument meerly from things without us; for the 19th Verse seems as clearly to relate to those inward Impressions made upon our Minds, as the 20th doth to the outward Creation. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is manifest in them; I know that Preposition <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is sometimes render'd <hi>inter;</hi> but when the proper and natural signification of words may be kept,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104464:88"/>
why should we look for another? <hi>For the invisible things of him from the Creation.</hi>] By Creation here is neither meant the things created, nor the Act of Creation, but only it relates to the time thereof. <hi>From the Creation</hi>] that is, ever since the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by which, says Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That there is no necessity of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting God's <gap reason="foreign">

Nay, I may add, that even those natural Impressions upon the Minds of Men, may be meant by God's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here mention'd. <hi>Even his Eternal Power and Godhead;</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the same Chapter also he tells us how necessary it is for those, who aspire to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be strict in fixing the true sense of Words, and framing true Definitions, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining those of former Authors, and either to correct 'em when deficient, or to make new ones themselves. Therefore, he says, in Geometry, which is the most accurate Science, Men begin with setling the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of their words; which setling of Significations, they call Definitions, and place 'em at the beginning of their work.</p>
               <p>Now it had been well, if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had practis'd his own rule, and that, in one of the most considerable Instances of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy; that is, if he had at first given us a perfect definition of that word so oft made use of in his Writings, <hi>Nature,</hi> and had fix'd the Significations of those Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104464:89"/>
                  <hi>Naturally, and by Nature:</hi> Which he could not well have done without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing it into pure and primitive, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corrupt and depraved <hi>Nature:</hi> Which he having no where done, it has occasion'd a great deal of obscurity and uncertainty in all his Discourses relating thereunto; which if he had done, in all probability it would have put an end to many of those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, which were perhaps at first begun, and afterwards continued by the want of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, he has given us several Senses and Acceptations of these words, but yet has been so far from setling and fixing their Significations, as he calls it, that he has ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left them still in greater uncertainty, especially in those other places, where they are mentioned singly, without any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, in what sense they are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. In his Preface to his Book <hi>de Cive,</hi> where 'tis objected, that from his Principles it would follow, that Men are wicked by <hi>Nature.</hi> This, he says, does not follow, for though Men by <hi>Nature,</hi> that is, <hi>from their first Birth, as they are meer sensible Creatures,</hi> &amp;c. Here Nature must signifie Man, as he comes first into the World, with respect meerly to his Animal Qualisications, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104464:90"/>
he has in common with other Creatures. In the same Preface, forasmuch as God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules all Rulers <hi>by Nature;</hi> that is, by the dictates of Natural Reason: here Nature seems to refer rather to the higher, than the lower Faculties of the Soul, <hi>Chap. 1. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph 2.</hi> if by <hi>Nature</hi> one Man should love another; that is, as Man; here <hi>Nature</hi> seems to refer to Man in his largest extent. The Law of <hi>Nature</hi> he thus defines, that it is the dictate of <hi>Natural Reason</hi> conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout those things which are either to be done or omitted for the constant preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Life and Members, as much as in us lies. Here he makes <hi>Natural Reason</hi> to truckle under that mean design of self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation in the narrowest sense, as if right reason had no other or higher end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, than that of a Man's private security here in this World. It would be tedious to reckon up all those several Senses, which in several places he gives to those words, accordingly as may best serve the purpose he is then about. Now in the midst of these various Significantions, how must we inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret those places, where he tells us, That the Dispositions of Men are <hi>naturally</hi> such, that unless they be restrained through fear, every Man will distrust and dread each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104464:90"/>
that Men <hi>by Nature</hi> are in such a state, wherein their Wills are their supreamest Law, with respect to their Self-preservation: How shall we know, whether <hi>by Nature</hi> here be meant the Dictates of right reason, truly so call'd, or only the irregular motions of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and sensitive Appetite. But I shall here leave Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to the just severity of his own censure, and a little examine <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> wherein he makes the State of Nature a State of Equality, and a State of War: These are the two imaginary Poles, upon which his State of Nature moves.</p>
               <p>First, He tells us, That Men are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for strength of Body, the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest; and to kill is the greatest thing, and they that can do the greatest thing, are equal: <hi>quod erat demonstrandum.</hi> The Confutation of some kind of errors may give occasion to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the Writer's Thoughts, or the Reader's Pains; but the confuting of such insipid stuff, as this, cannot but be tedious to both. By this way of arguing he might prove, that the meanest Creature in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, or may be equal to Man: For did not a Fly once kill a Pope? And may not a Spider poyson an Emperor? But then how
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104464:91"/>
this should become a Principle of Policy, any other way than as by considering this casual Power, which the weakest Man, or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Creature may have over us, thereby to incite our utmost care and circumspection, and to beget in us an inoffensive behaviour towards all Men: how, I say, this should be an Argument to prove the natural equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all Men, as the Phrase is us'd in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, is hard to understand.</p>
               <p>Then as to the Faculties of the Mind, he says, he finds a greater equality among Men, than that of strength of Body: for <hi>Prudence is nothing but Experience, which equal time gives equally to all:</hi> but suppose that Men were equal, as to Prudence, which yet is evidently false; yet there are other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or habits of the Mind, wherein one Man may excel another. Here it is not material to enquire, whether the Souls of Men were equal, as to their first Creation; we are now to consider 'em in a more complex'd capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as join'd with such and such Bodies, wherein we find as much variety in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral abilities and inclinations now, as if they were really created unequal: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Prudence must be something more than mere Experience: for Prudence is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habit super-induc'd upon the Faculty,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104464:91"/>
whereby we are enabled to manage our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, according to the Rules of Reason and Equity; thus Experience to Prudence is but as undigested meat to the nourishment of the Body. Experience indeed may collect general Rules for the mannagement of the affairs of Life: but then it is Prudence, which by considering matters of fact in all their Circumstances, by comparing them with the present state of things, and the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities of future contingencies, doth as it were digest experience into laudable nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment: but if we did suppose Men equal in their natural, yet it will not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they are so in their Political capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city too. For since Men did not at first spring out of the Earth like Mushrooms, but came into the World, by the ordinary methods of Generation, by way of Father and Son; therefore there must needs be a subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inferiority among 'em, a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon one another in respect of Causa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and an Obligation in respect of Duty and Obedience.</p>
               <p>Nor, secondly, is the state of Nature a state of War; <hi>if any two men,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Hobbs, desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become Enemies, and in their way to their end endeavour to destroy or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104464:92"/>
subdue each other.</hi> If he speak this in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Dominion or Empire, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mistress courted by all, as he says, in the state of Nature; it may be justly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, whether all do thus inordinately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect superiority, and whether all find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thus naturally enclin'd to destroy those that seem to stand betwixt them and the Throne: or are there not some more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly vertuous, who out of consciousness of their own inabilities, and out of due respect to other Mens Merits above their own, who would quit their pretences to Empire, and willingly live in obedience to others? Is it not inordinate Pride and Ambition, rather than the dictates of nature and right reason in those, who thus unreasonably aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than a Crown.</p>
               <p>Secondly, These natural Usurpers do not make use of the most proper means, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their own self-preservation. Here I would only apply Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own way and method of reasoning against the attempt of obtaining Soveraignty by Rebellion to the present Case, <hi>Pa. 73. Lev. 'Tis manifest, says be, that though the event should follow, yet because it cannot reasonably be expected, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary, and because by gaining it so, others are taught to gain the same in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104464:92"/>
the attempt thereof is against reason.</hi> Now doth not this equally hold good against the attempt, which these natural Usurpers do propound to themselves of an Universal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? would not the great hazard of any ones particular design succeeding make the action, in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his own account, very unreasonable? So that there is but little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Men to betake themselves to that way of anticipation in this state of nature, that is, for a Man to endeavour to Master all before him, so long, till he see no other Power great enough to endanger him: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that very equality, which he supposes, should more effectually perswade 'em to Peace, or some more Friendly way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing differences, rather than urge 'em to War; seeing no single Person can in reason ever hope to attain to Empire, since he must always have ten thousand as strong and as cunning as himself, to oppose all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. Thus that equality which seems to give him right, doth at the same time hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from the actual procurement of it. He grants indeed, <hi>That this condition of War was never generally over all the World; yet he says, in many places they live so now: for the Savage people in many places of</hi> America <hi>(ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Government of small Families, the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104464:93"/>
Concord whereof depends upon natural Lust) have no Government at all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But how is Government (though of small Families) consistent with that state of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute independency, before describ'd, where every one hath a right to every thing, and every Man an Enemy each to other? So that this exception of particular Families doth indeed destroy his general Rule: but then he interposes these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That these Families are small.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Concord depends upon natural Lust.</p>
               <p>But first he grants, <hi>Lev. Pag. 105. that a great Family, if it be not part of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as to rights of Soveraignty, is a little Monarchy;</hi> but he will not grant the same priviledge to a little Family, <hi>viz. unless it be of that power, as not to be subdued without the hazard of War:</hi> but the rights of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that, wherein the nature and essence of any Government doth consist, and not in strength and greatness; now these propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally are as much in a little Family, as in a great one; and we may with the same reason say, that the Essence of a natural, as well as of a Political Body, doth consist in such a proportion of strength and greatness, below which a Man cannot truly be call'd a Man.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:104464:93"/>2. He says, that the Concord of these Families depends upon natural Lust, <hi>Solâ cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditatum similitudine,</hi> Lat. Translation. But let the Concord depend upon what it will, 'tis not material, the Government and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Families is not consistent with such a state of nature as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hobbs</hi> describes; and here he might as well say, That Bastards are not Men; because they are gotten for the gratification of unlawful Lust; for the different grounds, or reasons, or ends, Men may have in making a thing, do not alter the nature and essence of it, when once made. The Question here is not, whether the Families be small or great, or upon what their Concord doth depend; but whether the notion and being of a Family, doth not destroy his suppos'd state of Nature. But how doth he prove, that the Concord of those Families depends only on natural Lust, as his English; for War seems the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine result of Lust, than Concord: or on similitude of desires, as his Latin Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on renders it? for this he makes the great Cause of competition and contest, when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral desire, and are not able to enjoy the same thing. Thus similitude of desires must be sometimes the cause of War, sometimes of Peace; thus doth he at once, out of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104464:94"/>
same Mouth, blow both hot and cold. What the meaning of the Author of the device was, when he made two Pitchers floating upon the Waters, with this Inscription, <hi>Si collidimur, frangimur,</hi> I know not; but it seems very applicable to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reasoning, if they be consider'd singly, they may perhaps bear some plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shew of Argument: but if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with each other, they will often be found as inconsistent with themselves, as they are singly inconsistent with the truth. But he tells us, that <hi>in all times Kings and Princes, because of their Independency, are in continual Iealousies, in a State and posture of Gladiators.</hi> Here 'tis observable, how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly he joins those two words, <hi>State and Posture,</hi> seeming thereby to insinuate, that Men could not be in a posture of Defence, unless they were in a state of War: for Kings to put themselves into a condition to repel injuries, when violently offer'd, is no more, than what reason and Prudence dictates; but this doth not infer Mr. <hi>Hobb's</hi> his State of War, but rather the contrary, when we see some Kingdoms able, and yet not willing to oppress their Neighbours. That Men may awfully do something in the time of War, which is not lawful to do in the time of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104464:94"/>
Peace, is certainly true: but then we mast not think, that the same blast of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet that Proclaim'd the War, did at the same time blow away all those airy Notions of just and unjust, which according to him, have no other being in Nature, but what they receiv'd from humane Compacts. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Injustice, are none of the <hi>faculties, either of the Body or Soul, they are qualities that relate to Man in Society, not in Solitude. Further in this slate of Nature, nothing can be unjust, here Force and Fraud are two Cardinal Pertues:</hi> that the practice and external ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Iustice, and many other moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doth suppose a Society, or at least a state of Friendship, that so Men may have proper objects of those respective Vertues, is certainly true; yet the reasons of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation are founded in the nature of each single Man, and so may belong to a Man in Solitude, for the reasons of Iustice and other Moral Vertues, are not ultimately to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd into that natural support and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they bring to a Society and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and that they cannot, without great disadvantage, be banished out of it, but into that Conformity they bear to the Divine Nature, and to the participation thereof in our selves: God indeed in the wise and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104464:95"/>
disposals of his Providence, has twisted our duty and our interest together: Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vertue have a natural tendency to make us as perfectly happy, as 'tis possible, even in our civil and political Capacities; but then they are not therefore only Vertues, because profitable to the publick, but upon some other higher grounds and reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vertues, they thus also, as parts of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, <hi>become prositable to all things; having the promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why are Iustice and Injustice quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that relate to Men only in Society, and not in Solitude? seeing these may as well be in a Man alone in the World, as some of his Passions, which also necessarily relate to their proper objects.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> some where approves of that definition, which the Schools give of Iustice, <hi>constans &amp; perpetua voluntas jus suum cui<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buendi,</hi> so that according to this, a Man may be just, if he have a real and sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to give every one his own, though he have not where withal to do it. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so why may not a Man be just and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though he want fit objects to exercise these Vertues upon; for why should the want of the object more destroy the nature
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104464:95"/>
of the Vertue, than the want of the subject matter, or material part, as in the former Case of the necessitous just Man.</p>
               <p>There were some fatal Philosophers of old, and some such there are still, who make good and evil, just and unjust, mere factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; such as depend only upon the free and arbitrary determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Will, but then to make 'em to depend merely upon the pleasure of the Civil Magistrate, this seems to be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar flight, proper only to Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> thus to make a God of his <hi>Leviathan:</hi> This Opinion of his doth either suppose no God at all, or such an one, as doth not much concern himself in the Government of the World, but, leaves all to his Vicegerent here below; obey the King, and you can scarce, according to him, disobey God.</p>
               <p>Some will scarce allow, that granting Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Principles, that his Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do ever necessarily (or but seldom) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that is, that there is but little strict and severe ratiocination in all his Writings: yet this, I think, we must grant, that his dangerous Errours in Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are but necessary deductions from his false Principles first laid in humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:104464:96"/>That Man is naturally a sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fit for Society, is granted by most, and not deny'd by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself, but then he tells us, <hi>that Man is not born fit for it,</hi> this he is fitted for, <hi>not by Nature, but by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and the reason hereof is, because he is not born at Years of discretion, not at Age to Seal a Bond, and without this there is no entring into Compacts, or Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. But he tells us, <hi>Pa. 21. Lev. that Children are called reasonable Creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of reason in time to come;</hi> and I know not, why we may not by the same reason, grant Men to be <hi>born</hi> sociable Creatures, or fit for Society, for the like apparent possibility, though they were not actually enter'd into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, for they are born with all those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and aptitudes to Society, which they have for reason it self: now that Man is thus really a SociableCreature, will appear both from the nature and necessities of Mankind. 1. From the nature of Man, for the very fundamental Laws of Nature suppose either a Society, or something an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to it, <hi>Quod tibi non vis sieri, alteri ne feceris; Do to others, as me desire others should do to us,</hi> and we are generally as much oblig'd to the duties of Iustice and Honesty
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104464:96"/>
to others, as of Prudence and Caution to our selves; and this necessarily supposes a Society, or something like it, a state of Friendship. 2. The necessities of Mankind seem to argue us to be sociable Creatures, such whose very subsistence necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the aid and assistance of others, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the very Birth of a Child would be the certain exposing of it to destruction.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will not grant any Laws of Nature truly so call'd, in the state of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they are only certain Theorems, or Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, tending to Peace, rather than Laws, that bring us under any obligation.</hi> But why do not these Laws of Nature, which he grants to be dictates of reason, lay as great an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us for Obedience, as those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Passions of Nature? Especially if we consider, that obedience to these dictates of reason are more fit and proper means in order to self-preservation, than the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those mere rights of nature, as he calls them, violence and anticipation. And if we reflect upon matters of fact, and the several instances that History furnishes us withal, we shall find Examples of Mercy and Compassion to others, of a generous condescention and self-denyal of our selves, and of an universal love and good will to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104464:97"/>
Mankind, sufficient to confute the scandals cast upon humane nature upon this account. Though it must also be granted, that there has been too many barbarous and inhumane actions committed, both by Heathens and Christians too, but then those actions were not approved by the more wise and sober Persons of those very Nations that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em. 2. They were universally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the more civiliz'd part of the World. 3. They were so far from tending to their advantage, that they have many times prov'd the cause or occasion of many and grievousCalamities brought upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and Nation by the just Providence of God.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Principles in general seem to be the suiting or fitting the vicious practises of Mankind to an Hypothesis, thereby endeavouring to enact wickedness by a Law, and to prove the lawfulness of all possible violence and injustice, by the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Self-preservation. This bad use has he made of the general viciousness of Mens Lives, from thence to gather Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which might, if possible, legitimate their actions, like <hi>Machiavel,</hi> who from the small respect that Princes generally bore to Leagues and Oaths, taught his Prince, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104464:97"/>
there was no obligation lay upon him from 'em, but only to consult his own interest and advantage by 'em; and whereas his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgator admires the bad fortune of <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> to see one Man inherit in particular the Mass of reproaches due to all Princes and Statesmen in general, he might have ceas'd his wonder, if he had consider'd, that it was one thing to act wickedly, and another to teach Men that they might do so. Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bad actions are but the failures of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men, such as they themselves perhaps may go about some ways to excuse or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, but not to justify: but now <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> his thus becoming an Advocate for Vice, is of more pernicious consequence; it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens Sin, and endeavours to confound the notions of good and evil, for <hi>he that shall break one of the least Commandments, and teach men so, he shall be called the least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> It is further pleaded for <hi>Machiavel,</hi> that all his Documents he gives only to a Prince, for had he recommended this practice to a Son, or any else circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd in a narrower compass, than a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he might have been more justly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. Now this Apology, however weak and insufficient it is for <hi>Machiavel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet is Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> utterly uncapable of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104464:98"/>
any such excuse, because his bad Principles are of a more universal influence, and reach not only to Prince, but People too.</p>
               <p>I call'd Mr. Hobbs his Principles an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, now if any be offended at the word, as a term of diminution, I shall here further do these two things. 1. Show, that it is only so, and no more, being something that is rather suppos'd than sufficiently prov'd. 2. That it is not a good Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, as wanting those conditions and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which are requisite to any Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis in general, much more to such an one, as the nature of the subject requir'd his to be. 1. It is an Hypothesis and no more, and I have very good Authority so to call it from Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his own words, 8 <hi>Ch. de Cive. Let us return again, sayes he, to the slate of nature, and consider Man as even now sprang out of the Earth, and suddenly, like Mushromcs come to full maturity, without all kind of Government to each other.</hi> Now this, I conceive, the most proper and genuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation that can be put upon the place, to call it an Hypothesis. For I would not willingly think, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> did really believe, that once upon a time Men started out of the Earth, like Mole-hills, especially if we consider, that he himself doth Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104464:98"/>
reflect upon such a supposal, where he compares some kind of <hi>ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to Children, that having no thoughts of Generation, are made believe by the Women, that their Brothers and Sisters are not born, but found in the Garden:</hi> here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how little right reason there is in all Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Discourses, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend hereupon, for he himself tells us in his <hi>De Cive, 2 Ch. That right reason is that which concludes from true Principles.</hi> Now these true Principles in matters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Policy, must be more than sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedly true: indeed a certain kind of truth may be in favour granted to an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis of natural Philosophy, if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly answer all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, though it self do not answer the real truth; but this Indulgence cannot be granted to things of a moral or political concern.</p>
               <p>Neither Secondly is it a good Hypothesis, as wanting those qualifications which are requir'd to any Hypothesis in general, which are these three. 1. An Hypothesis must be possible, this is the least that it can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, but it must not be only so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the utmost extent of possibility, but also fairly possible according to the most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104464:99"/>
methods of our Conceptions, that is, probable, so contriv'd, that we might be thence perswaded, that that was the way, that God and Nature made use of in that particular: that as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> say of the Universe, that though it was the result of blind chance, yet all things therein have happen'd as well, as if they had been the result of the greatest wisdom and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: thus an Hypothesis, though perhaps it be not the real truth, yet it should give as full and natural Solutions of things, as if indeed it were. 2. It must be self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, and not contain Principles of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolution within it self, for it is impossible, that that should be agreeable to the wise and regular methods of Nature, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is not agreeable with it self. 3. An Hypothesis ought to employ our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the search of true and useful Knowledge, and also to promote real Piety in the World, therefore we ought not to fancy to our selves such an Hypothesis in Philosophy, as excludes God out of the World, and such an one as asserts a mere material Universe. Now here I might easily show, that this of Mr. <hi>Hobb's,</hi> is neither 1. Possible, much less probable. 2. Not consistent with it self. 3. So far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104464:99"/>
sound Knowledge and true Piety, that it is really destructive of both.</p>
               <p>Whether such a state of Nature, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> describes, be a proper and effectual means, in order to a Mans self-preservation, may be justly question'd, and indeed he himself seems not to be of that Opinion, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he makes his natural Statesmen to get out of it as soon as they can, in order to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of their condition; yet this is certain, that he makes private interest the great and ultimate end of all humane actions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of his <hi>Levia.</hi> in particular, as being that, wherein he thinks he has laid the best and surest foundations of all humane happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: I shall therefore here, by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to this Chapter, speak something in general concerning this great Principle of Self-Preservation.</p>
               <p>It is the natural folly of Mankind to run out of one extream of Vice and Errour into another; thus perhaps the ignorant Zeal and blind Devotion of some who attributed too little, might first give occasion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ascribe too much to Sels-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; however we must not deny it its due regard, so far as Reason and Religion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, because others have extended it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than in either it ought. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104464:100"/>
freely grant, what the greatest Patrons of Self-preservation can with any just ground or reason demand, and hereby I shall gain this double advantage. 1. It will hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it is not out of any preiudice or heat of opposition, that I contradict any thing, even in that Opinion I do oppose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby I shall come to a truer state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Question, and so shall be better able to defend it: for this disadvantage there is even to Truth it self, in the false stating of a Question, that we either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to oppose that in an adversary which is really true, and so irresragable; or else to defend something that is false, and so not capable of being defended.</p>
               <p>To deny that which is true, is altogether needless, for we need not fear any prejudice to a good Cause from truth elsewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all truths of this nature are consistent with themselves, and no ways contrary to each other, whereas the denyal of any thing that is true, tho' in an adversary, may break that continuity of truth, and some way or other weaken our own cause, I shall ad two or three general considerations relating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God has imprinted in Man a principle of self preservation is not only
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104464:100"/>
true, but very agreeable to the goodness of God, and very subservient for the carrying on the designs of Prudence and Piety in the world, for it would have reflected dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably either upon the goodness or wisdome of God, to have made such an excellent creature as Man, and taken no care for his preservation, so far as it should not be in the power of any one upon every slight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to throw away himself, and so destroy Gods peculiar Image; or to have expos'd him to all the dangers, that either his own inadvertency or the malice of others might have brought upon him, without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate inclinations of self preservation, and suitable principles of prudence to inable him thereunto. Thus Religion it self doth not only permit, but command us to act with a due respect to those two grand Principles of a Christian Life, Prudence and Innocence, to be <hi>wise as Serpents, and innocent as Doves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, without this we had wanted that most exact and easy rule of Charity to others, <hi>Whatsoever you would that Men should do unto you, even so do you unto them,</hi> where our love to our selves is made the rule and measure of our Charity to others.</p>
               <p>But, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes self preservation
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104464:101"/>
without any respect to the lawfulness of the means, to be the first and great dictate of Reason and Nature, and charges Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with folly, in that in some cases it so little regards its own safety, but exposes its professors to Martyrdome for Religion's sake.</p>
               <p>If, says he, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42. we be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our lawful Prince, to say that we do not believe in Christ, we must obey him, for words are but external things, and do no more express the assent of the Speaker, than any other external action: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Christian in such things hath the same liberty, that the Prophet gave to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian:</hi> 2 Kings 5. 18. <hi>In this thing the Lord pardon thy Servant, that when my Master goeth into the House of Rimmon, to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow my self in the house of Rimmon, the Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy servant in this thing, and he said unto him, go in peace.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, that <hi>Naaman</hi> believed the true God in his Heart, but by worshiping would seem not to believe, least he should offend his King. But here he supposes, but proves not, that <hi>Naaman</hi> here asks Pardon for what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to do for the time to come, whereas the words may be as well render'd so, as to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104464:101"/>
signify his asking Pardon for the time past: but supposing, that he here refers to the time to come, yet this is not so much a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the true God, as if he had deny'd him with his Lips, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would have it, for here he did not deny the true God at all, because he declar'd before, that by this incurvation he did not design any adoration of the Idol, and this Declaration was as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as his action, <hi>viz.</hi> that henceforth he would worship no other, but the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> could not well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a Man to deny the true God with his Lips before a persecuting Magistrate, and withal suppose him at the same time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, as it was in <hi>Naamans</hi> Case, that he intended no such thing, as he spoke by his words, for this in all probability would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incense the Prince, than any ways tend to his own preservation. 2. Though the love of God, and the love of our selves, rightly understood, are no ways opposite to one another, in as much as God requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of us, that is inconsistent with our real interest, yet we may truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly assert, that God is to be lov'd for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for the Excellency and Amiableness of his own Nature, not but that we may, and generally do, love God too with respect to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104464:102"/>
his relative goodness towards us: thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is suited, both to the most generous tempers of some, and provides objects for the most heroick acts of vertue, and takes away all occasion from those, who would, upon this occasion, fix upon it the name of mercenary, and also on the other hand it condescends to the more common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inclinations of Mankind, in suffering and encouraging them to act with respect to the recompense of reward.</p>
               <p>But though the constitution of humane nature be such, that the considerations of Gods relative goodness to us do generally mingle themselves with all our thoughts of God, and exercises of our love towards him; I doubt not but we may, without any fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical abstraction, so far distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the mercies received, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Divine Nature, that we may even therein found a reason of our love of him. So that the loving of God for his own sake, though, I believe, it seldom occurs in practise, yet it ought not to be spoke against in Discourse, provided first, that it be not made use of to lead men into unwarrantable extravagancies, either in opinion or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, Secondly, Provided, as Bishop <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> says, that what is a great perfection in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104464:102"/>
some be not impos'd as a Law upon all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In extreme necessity, it is lawful for a Man to do, what otherwise he ought not to do: here, I suppose, a Man brought to that exigency, that without timely and suitable supplies, he certainly perisheth; by what means he is here brought into these circumstances, I do not here consider; only I except this, That he be not a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor condemn'd, and now about to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the just and due Punishment of his Offence: but then this necessity must be for the necessary sustentation of Life, not for the gratisication of Humour or sensual Appetite; we must not think with Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> That we may, not only for Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but Delectation also, endeavour to destroy others. He also tells us, That in the State of Nature there is nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required to make a thing lawful, but its being necessary to our Preservation; and nothing required to make it necessary, but a strong opinion that it is so; so that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, confidence of Belief, and strength of Fancy may alter the nature of things, and make 'em lawful or unlawful accordingly; so that, according to him, we then principally, if not only offend
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104464:103"/>
against the Laws of Nature, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend something necessarily to tend to our Preservation, which indeed either doth not, or what we do not confidently enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to do so. Further,</p>
               <p>This necessity must be real, not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; urgent and inevitable, not such as may be supply'd or prevented by our own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. We must not pretend Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when indeed we only indulge our own Laziness, and neglect the use of those means, whereby we might possibly remove, what we now suppose: in these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances a Man may lawfully make use of those means, which necessarily tend to his Preservation, and no further. Thus in case of extreme Hunger, he may take so much of other Mens Goods, as are necessary to preserve his Life, without incurring the Guilt of Theft; and the Reason hereof is, not merely because the Owner, in such a case, is bound to give as much as is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that purpose; for in many cases others may be bound to do, what we have no power to force in case of denyal. Nor, <hi>secondly,</hi> because at the first Division of things, the Dividers excepted this case of extreme Necessity; wherein they did not design the Right of Dominion and Property
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104464:103"/>
to be so strict and severe, but that, in this case, the <hi>Ius primaevum</hi> should return.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>first,</hi> it seems not so reasonable to believe, that there ever was that <hi>Usus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis</hi> of all things, as <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts, and consequently no such Division, wherein he supposes all Property to be founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppose the Dividers, either thrô carelessness or inadvertency had left this as a <hi>Casus omissus,</hi> without making any Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion about it, and it doth not any ways evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that they ever made any such; or if thro' perverseness and ill nature they had determin'd it otherwise, yet the thing would still have been, as now we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it: so that it is more than probable, that both Property and that lawful Power that a Man hath, to relieve himself in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme necessity, doth depend upon some antecedent Reason, and some higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, than that barely suppos'd Agreement of the first Dividers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reasonableness of laying down our Lives for the sake of Religion, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the unreasonableness of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Assertion, which must suppose one of these three things; either that God has not Authority to command his Creatures such instances of Obedience; or not Goodness
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104464:104"/>
enough to reward 'em, for what he thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns; or that we have not sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that his Will and Pleasure is, that in some cases he requires it: to deny the two former, is to deny the Dictates of natural Reason; to assert the third, is to deny the plain Words and Commands of God in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And further, if we consider what it is, that we are commanded to part with, only the short and transitory satisfactions of a frail Life, which at best we cannot enjoy long, and which may be otherwise so load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Miseries, that the very continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it may be the greatest Punishment. Besides, 'tis probable, the Martyrs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the greatness of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being as great as either the Wit or Malice of their Enemies could invent, yet that they did not feel so much pain, as mere sensual Men might imagine, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the intenseness of their Thoughts, then set on the Ioys above, and also the more plentiful effusions of the Divine Grace, strengthening and assisting them; so that they seemed rather pleasantly to enjoy, than painfully to undergo the flames.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Religion the best Foundation of Civil Government. With an Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some of <hi>Machiavel's</hi> Opinions relating hereunto.</head>
               <p>IF we consider the Nature of Religion in general: how that it is that Order and Constitution of things in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all rational Agents, either do, or at least are bound to act in observation of those mutual Respects they bear to God, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others; how that it is that great instrument of Providence in the World, for the management of the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Affairs thereof. And what some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have asserted of the Soul of the Universe, may be very well applyed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in respect of the rational World, that it ties each part to it self and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and disposes of every thing for the Good and Advantage of the whole, and of every part. This consider'd, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that Religion should have a very
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104464:105"/>
good and benign influence upon all publick Societies, these being the most considerable Bodies of the Universe.</p>
               <p>And this the very Enemies of Religion acknowledge in their most malicious scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and reproaches, that are cast upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> when they tell us, That Religion is nothing but a meer politick Device and Contrivance of Princes, by which they might better govern their Subjects, and awe them into obedience: but this, as most Errours are, is founded in a certain Truth; and though it be a false scandal cast upon Religion, yet it supposes this undeniable Verity, That Religion is not only consistent with, but also highly promotive of the Ends of Government. Now the consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Religion with Government in general will appear, from these following Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Religion in the true and sincere Exercise of it, is the only Means appointed by God for the attaining of eternal Happiness; now one great end of God's instituting a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, was to put Men into a better capacity of performing their Duty towards God, themselves and others.</p>
               <p>These things being first granted (which I think also are sufficiently plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104464:105"/>
in themselves) it is impossible, that Religion should be inconsistent with, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of Government; seeing these two are made joint means in order to one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end of humane Happiness. Thus God sent us into the World, that by Holiness we should arrive at Happiness; and he has appointed a Government over us, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it we should lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these two, Religion and Government, are certainly consistent with each other; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it would charge God with Folly and Imprudence, by designing to bring about an end by incosistent means.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Government in general, be subordinate to Religion, in reference to the ultimate End, eternal Happiness; yet the Church (and the Affairs of Religion) in reference to its private Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is subordinate, in a great measure, to the State. Thus we say, that the Church is in the State, and not the State in the Church. But now this is not an essential, but only an accidental Subordination; that is, such an one, as depends upon Divine, positive Institution: for if God had so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he might have made the State inferiour to the Church in all things, as he hath made
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104464:106"/>
the Church subject to the State in most. Now if we may venture to give a Reason of the Divine Institution, it may seem to be this; That God seeing how much it was for the Interest of the State, to provide for and secure the Affairs of Religion, hath therefore subjected the Church in most things (always excepting those spiritual Priviledges and Peculiarities belonging to the Church, which I always suppose sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable) to the Power of the civil Government; for it is not probable, that God would thus have committed his Church (to which he always bore such a tender regard) to the care and charge of the State, if it were as our Adversaries sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so much for the Interest of the State, to violate the Laws of the Church and of Religion.</p>
               <p>But now particularly, Religion lays the best foundation of Government, these four ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By asserting the Original of Civil Power to be truly Divine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By shewing the Religious Obligation of an Oath, and founding Obedience nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Fear, nor Interest, but in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:104464:106"/>3. By correcting and confuting all those false Opinions and Principles, which are so destructive of all humane Societies and civil Obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By removing all those Lusts and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions out of the Minds of Men, which are the great Incendiaries of the World, and Fomenters of War and Discord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Religion does the best secure Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by asserting the Original of civil Power to be truly Divine. Here I shall not restrain my Assertion to Monarchy only, but extend it also to all regular and well-settled Governments. Though I think, that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy has a great advantage in its Plea, for a more particular Divine Institution, so far as Example and primitive Practice can give any right thereto; nor do I here assert, That all Monarchies, in their original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, were absolute; or however there was no necessity that they should be so. Some indeed say, That whatever Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Limitations have been since introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into some Governments, yet from the beginning it was not so; these were the Encroachments of after Ages, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples usurping upon the Prerogative; or else the Grants and Concessions of good-natur'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104464:107"/>
Princes. But this, I think, is rather barely asserted, than positively proved: yet will it not follow hence, that the People are the original Proprietors of all civil Power. What our Saviour said to <hi>Pilate, Ioh. 19. 11. Thou could'st have no power over me, except it were given thee from above;</hi> the same we may say of the People, that suppose (but not granting) that they had such a Power, as some imagine, yet they could not have it of themselves; they must either medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or immediately derive it from God: so that, they giving this Power to the King, the Power will be still truly Divine, though it be convey'd through the People, as thro' a Conduit. But then to what purpose should we suppose such a needless circuit in the proceedings of Divine Providence: Why might not God give it more immediately himself, seeing this is, as easily conceivable, attended with fewer Inconveniencies, and more promotive of the Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the other? Thus Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> no less falsly, than impiously tells us, <hi>That God created Man in such an ill-condition'd State of Nature; not that he design'd him to continue in it, but that he might mend himself by his own Prudence, by getting out of it, as soon as he could.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to be much
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104464:107"/>
what of the same Opinion, in his Book <hi>de jure belli &amp; pacis,</hi> where, among his many perplex'd methods of arguing upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet this he seems positively to assert, That civil Power had its Original from the Consent of the People, not taking the least notice of any higher principle: but yet he directly contradicts himself herein, in his Epistle Dedicatory, to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>XIIIth.</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> (whether only in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment or no, I know not) where he tells him, <hi>Quàm gloriosum hoc,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut si quando te Deus ad suum Regnum vocaverit, audacter possis dicere, hunc ego à te gladium pro justitiae tutelâ accepi, hunc ego tibi nullius temerè fusi sanguinis reum, purum insontém<expan>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> reddo.</hi> Here he says that <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>XIIIth.</hi> received the sword of Iustice from God, which if he did, it was more than ever any other King, according to his Principles, did before, <hi>p. 80. de jure belli; Notandum est pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mò homines non Dei praecepto sed sponte adductos, experimento infirmitatis familiarum segregum, adversus violentiam in societatem civilem coiis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, unde ortum habet civilis potest as quam ideo humanam ordinationem Petrus vocat, quanquam &amp; alibi divina Ordinatio vocatur, quia homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num salubre institutum Deus probavit, Deus autem humanam legem probans censetur probare
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104464:108"/>
at humanam &amp; humano more:</hi> where we see, that God was no farther concern'd in the constituting this civil Power, but only by way of approbation of what Man had done before: But here first, he supposes, it would be hard for him to prove, That Men liv'd at first in separate Families, without any common Power over them.</p>
               <p>But, 2. suppose they did; the sense and experience of the Inconveniences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this way of living might be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or occasion of Mens looking out for help: but I do not see, how they are thus any more the radical Cause of Civil Power, than the Patient is the Cause of his own Cure, or of the Physician's Skill, only because he apply'd himself to him.</p>
               <p>Nor is it here deny'd, but that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may, in some cases determine the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as in Elective Kingdoms. And further, suppose a mixt company of Men, such as are neither Parents of Children, nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families; such as have no relation or dependance upon one another; suppose these by chance cast upon an uninhabited Coast, they may frame themselves into any particular Form of Government; such as they may reasonably believe to be most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their Circumstances, and most
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104464:108"/>
subservient to the great Ends of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> Peace and Piety.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithstanding the Power, in this case, is not originally from the People, but, as the Learned and Iudicious Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> has determined the Case, <hi>God by a secret Compact made with Mankind, in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth infuse the Power, as the Soul, into the Body Politick (as well as Natural) thus duly prepar'd, and as it were presented to God for that purpose, by a prudent and regular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Determination:</hi> they who would see this further explain'd and confirm'd, may consult Dr. <hi>Donne's Pseudo-Martyrs,</hi> Cap. 6.</p>
               <p>That which seems most liable to Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Account is, that secret Compact which God is here suppos'd to make with Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that Learned Man is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call it; but I am not very sollicitous either about the name, or the particular way and mode of conveying this Power, only to make the thing appear the more reasonable. We may consider, that it would be very hard, if at all possible, for those, who derive this Power merely from the consent of the People, either to secure the Government at present, or the Succession afterwards upon these Principles. For since,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104464:109"/>
according to them, Men are by Nature born free, and consequently it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, how far the Act of the Father, in this case, will oblige his Posterity: Why may not the Children plead, that they have as good right to vote and consent for themselves now, as their Fathers had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this would soon prove the utter Ruine of all Government.</p>
               <p>But now since the Obligation that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, is from an higher Principle; this, if any thing, will keep Men in their due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and this, I conceive, is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Doctrine laid down in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Overall's</hi> Convocation-Book.</p>
               <p>Here 'tis further observable, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of that Opinion, which founds Power originally in the People, are like those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their Disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infallibility. Those we have here to deal with, are sure, that the Original of Power is in the People, only they know not where to fix and where to find it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Body of the People, collectively taken, or only in the Heads and Masters of Families; or in the Men only, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Women and Children, or in each particular Man singly, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> asserts: for he doth not suppose, that when the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104464:109"/>
People make a Migistrate, that they confer any Power upon him, which he had not before in his private Capacity; only they covenant, that they will not use their Power in opposition to his, but let him alone to rule without a Rival. Now the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty these Men are in, both in respect of Infallibility, and the first and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Subject of this Power, is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption at least, that there is no such as either, in that way and manner wherein they assert them: thus, I conceive, this way of stating the Question gives both to God, the King, and the People, what is of right their due; and if the People should chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge more than what is here given them, I think it would be to their disadvantage. As for those other three Particulars before-mentioned, I shall refer the Reader to those respective Authors who treat of 'em. But though civil Power be originally from God, yet is it not founded in Grace, which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is now commonly stated, is but the novel Invention of some brain-sick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of latter days, founded upon the mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sence of some Prophecies of the old Testament, and upon some forc'd Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious of some Texts of the New; and it has been further promoted by the fantastick
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104464:110"/>
Pride nnd Folly of those that entertain it; first, by fansying themselves Saints, and then falsly applying all those Honours and Priviledges to themselves, which they think are any where applyed to Saints in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>1 Cor. 6. 2. Know ye not that the Saints shall judge the world;</hi> hence they fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, That those Kings who have not a just right or title to a Crown in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ought to lay no claim to one on Earth, and therefore those wicked of the World are to be rooted out, only to make room for their Saintships. But for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of that place, we must know, That Saints in Scripture frequently signifie no more, than the <hi>called and faithful;</hi> such as from Iudaism or Heathenism were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Christian Religion. Thus <hi>know ye not that the Saints shall judge the world?</hi> that is, Know ye not, that the World shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christian, and that it shall be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Christian Magistrates: and why should you deem your selves unfit to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise that Iudgment now in a more private manner among your selves, without going to Heathen Tribunals, which Christians shall 'ere long do, in a more publick and solemn manner upon all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:104464:110"/>If Dominion was so founded in Grace, that all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings were truly Pious and Religious, then would there be no publick Wrongs, or Injuries committed in the <hi>Christian</hi> World; but this is a thing rather to be wished, than ever rationally hoped for: Besides, God in the Iust and Wise Methods of his Providence sometimes makes use of wicked Princes, as Instruments of his Iustice, to punish the sins of others; which could not be done, if all Kings were truly Religious: Neither doth God make 'em wicked, that so he may thus make use of 'em, as Instruments of his Providence, but finds 'em so; neither doth this any ways lessen the sin in them, because God makes use of it for other Purposes, than they ever intended, their wicked and malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Injury and Oppression being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by nothing abated: And indeed that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is so destructive of all publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Properties, that it would soon dissolve all civil Societies, which our Saviour, both by his Precept and Example made his constant business to uphold: And if any in the World could ever lay claim to Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon this account, certainly he might have done it, and yet we find he always
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104464:111"/>
declin'd the taking of any such thing upon him.</p>
               <p>I shall here now briefly examine that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Machiavil,</hi> which tells us, That a Prince ought indeed to appear Religious, but that there is no necessity of his being so in <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>h and reality. Here the Question is not, Whether a Prince that doth not act out of ante <hi>Christian</hi> Principles, for the Glory of God, and the Good of Men, but is indeed <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Hypocrite, whether such an one may not yet rule well, and derive all the Blessings of a pious Government upon his People, provided that his Actions, though they be deficient as to the principal, yet that they be good and lawful as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But <hi>Machiavil</hi> means not thus much by his seeming Piety, but only a meer pretence of Religion, till a fair opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it self, and then thereupon to violate all that before he counted sacred, <hi>viz.</hi> to break Oaths, and all the Laws of Iustice and Honour, where his private Interest, or publick reason of State prompts him thereunto: But here we may consider, that the Advantages that attend real Piety, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Religion, what they are, they are constan<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and perpetual, but those that are
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104464:111"/>
the result of Hypocrisie and Persidiousness, they are but for one turn; we can hardly again deceive those whom we have once impos'd upon; so that this Counterfeit of Religion will not consist long with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Piety, his own People at home, and other Princes abroad, are usually quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted enough to espie the faults of their Governours, and of those they have to deal withal; and Hypocrisie, when 'tis once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, is the most contemptible thing in the World.</p>
               <p>But indeed it is neither the Honour nor Interest of a Prince to be Irreligious.</p>
               <p>First, It is not the Honour of any Man to be Wicked.</p>
               <p>And Princes do not cease to be Men when they take upon 'em the Soveraign, but still remain under all these Obligations that God and Nature had before laid upon 'em. Now that Wickedness is in it self dishonourable, will appear upon these several Accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though some Men may arrive at that height of Wickedness as to glory in their shame; yet, thanks be to God, they are but few in respect of that greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of Men, which both pity the Persons, and detest the Follies of such poor
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104464:112"/>
deluded People: For we never yet heard of a Kingdom, a Commonwealth of <hi>Atheists,</hi> Providence having so order'd the affairs of the World, that the open and general Profession of Wickedness should be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with all Humane Constitutions.</p>
               <p>And here we might further appeal to the experience of Wicked Men themselves, whether their sins were not always the most pleasant, when they were most private: For there is something of a secret shame in sin, and something of an awful Veneration ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Vertuous and Religious Men; so that if Wicked Men at any time boast of their Wickedness, it is commonly before such who are as bad and extravagant as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wicked Men may sometimes glory in their sins, not that they take any such real pleasure therein, but that they may thus invite others to mention their Enormities, and so are glad to hear that they have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in their Vicious Follies, and others as bad as themselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wicked Men themselves do not seem be in earnest, when they pride themselves in their Wickedness, for when they would effectually reproach a Man, they then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104464:112"/>
him, not with his Vertues, but with some real or feigned Wickedness, which they falsly attribute to him.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, such may be the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place (but more frequently in Commonwealths than Kingdoms) that Men shall suffer for their very Vertues and Excellencies, as it happened among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who could not endure a Man of extraordinary Vertue and Excellence; hence was made that Law of <hi>Ostracisme</hi> to banish such, whose great Endowments had made terrible, and suspected by the State: But then the execution of this Law upon any one was so far from being a Disreputation to him, that the Banishment it self was counted honourable. Nor</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it the Interest of Princes to be wicked, for nothing doth more weaken the Nerves of Government at home, nor lose the Reputation of a Prince abroad, than Sin and Wickedness; and Princes as well as Merchants, do in some sense live upon their Credits. And further, Wickedness in a Prince has a Malignant Influence upon his Subjects, and a natural tendency to make them so too, so that there is scarce any Vice in him purely personal, but it commonly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104464:113"/>
extends its influence as far as his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now 'tis easily conceivable, how the Viciousness of the Subject tends to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Prince; for by this means they are neither well dispos'd to keep peace at home, nor so well able to manage a War abroad. Thus <hi>Machiavil</hi> tells us, That Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd Provinces do fully revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their Conquerours, by receiving them delicately, and corrupting them by loose manners: For thus the sostness of Pleasures and Delights will cause 'em gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to degenerate from their former Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And whereas <hi>Machiavil</hi> tells us, That a Prince may as well be hated for his Vertues, as for his Vices, and instances in <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Alex. Severus,</hi> Wise and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Princes, and therefore hated by their Men of War: Hence he concludes, That if a Prince will preserve himself in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, he must comply with the humours of such as may hurt him, and even imitate their Vices and Corruptions.</p>
               <p>In Answer hereto, I shall not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some small Passages of those two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, which some Historians take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, as possible occasions of those Disgusts that grew among their Men of War, but
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104464:113"/>
shall suppose that these Soldiers did really hate the Vertues of these Emperours, For it will not follow from hence, that Vertue is equally liable to the hatred of Men. Thus Thieves hate the Magistrates, because they execute Iustice upon 'em, yet hereby do they get more Love from the publick than they contract hatred from the Offenders: Thus, though those two Emperours were hated by some few dissolute and disorderly Bands of Soldiers, yet never did any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours fall more lamented by the generality of the Empire, than they.</p>
               <p>And though sometimes a private Person, as I before intimated, may be the cause of some inconveniences to himself by his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ability, or Moral Vertues: yet this cannot take place in a Prince, because he is already in that Supream Authority, which others perhaps only aim at: nay, thus by being eminently Vertuous he will present all growing Popularity in the most Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his Subjects, and eclipse their histre even in the Opinion of those, why would otherwise be their great Admirers. I shall here only add the Apology that the <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines themselves, make the their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man <hi>Machiavil,</hi> viz. That he himself
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104464:114"/>
did not really believe his own Assertions in his wicked Maximes of Policy and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only designing hereby, if possible, to ruine the House of the <hi>Medices,</hi> who had oppress'd the Common-wealth of <hi>Florence,</hi> he broach'd these Pestilent Doctrines, in hopes they would embrace 'em, and so ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine themselves by the practice of them. As for that Opinion of <hi>Machiavil,</hi> That the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion has so effeminated the Spirits of its Professors, that <hi>Christendom</hi> is now become an easie prey to all Invaders; this is so false and soolish, so contrary both to Reason and Experience, that it scarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a Confutation. Christianity forbids indeed all private Revenge, and teaches us Meekness and Humility towards all Men, but this is no way destructive of true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and 'Generosity: For a firm belief of God, and the Immortality of the Soul, and a due care of engaging in a just Cause, are certainly the best foundations of true Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: There is nothing that a <hi>Christian</hi> fears more, than to commit sin; now if the fear of offending God, and violating his Laws, be counted Cowardise, then who would be asham'd of such an Honorary Accusation; but there is no necessity to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104464:114"/>
purchase one Vertue at the expence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to forfeit our Magnanimity, to maintain true Christian Meekness: For the most Stout are always the most Generous, Meek and Merciful; and Cruelty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a certain sign of a Pusillanimous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and as for Experience, both Ancient and Modern Histories testifie, that neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor any other Infidels have any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over <hi>Christian</hi> Kingdoms upon this Account.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Moral Vertue.</head>
               <p>MOral Vertue is a thing so natural, and only proper to Mankind, that a Discourse of Humane Nature without this, would seem defective in one of its most principal parts; the retaining of this Vertuous Innocence, was the Duty of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise;</hi> and the regaining of it, as far as this present state of Imperfection will admit, is still ours now. So that this universal recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our Natures, was the first and most absolute Duty incumbent on Man, for Faith and Repentance, those two great Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Duties, though they be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in this laps'd State of Mankind; yet their necessity did only commence with Man's Fall: for in Innocence there had been no need of either, but Vertue and Holiness, Piety towards God, and Honesty and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Men; these were Duties at first, and will be so to all Eternity hereafter, when Faith shall be swallowed up in Vision, and when all sin shall be done away, and so no
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104464:115"/>
need of Repentance. Thus Vertue was part of that Divine Image, wherein we were first created, and whoever, in this sense, speaks against it, Blasphemes God. Moral Vertue therefore, as distinguish'd from original Righteousness, and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Holiness, may be thus describ'd: <hi>It is an habit of the Mind, founded indeed in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but perfected by frequent use and exercise, whereby the Man is enabled by the mere strength of Natural Principles, to do that which is most agreeable to the Duty and Dignity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in those three Relations he bears to him-self, to others, and to God.</hi> I shall give a short Paraphrase upon the Desinition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, It is an Habit,</hi> and so distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from original Righteousness, which was not an Adventitious Quality, or super-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd upon Man <hi>in esse completo;</hi> but it was as essential to Man in Innocence, as round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to a Globe: Here I call it an Habit, rather than a Power or Energy, because though External Causes, and such is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Exercise, by which Vertue is gotten, be not of the Essence of a thing, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact Rules of Desining, ought not to enter into the Definition; yet it is very difficult to come to the knowledge of the Essences of things of this Nature,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104464:116"/>
and they are usually defin'd by their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Effects, by their Ends and Objects, and the manner of their Operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though a Man should be born with this Quality of Vertue, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he would be truly Vertuous, yet here we speak of things, as they are, not as it is possible for us to suppose and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them, because none naturally are born so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Habit is not a meer dull in-active thing, but Action is included in the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, especially in these Habits of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, wherein, besides the general relation they bear to Action; they also include a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary obligation thereunto in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Notion of 'em. Indeed some tell us, That original Righteousness, or that first Grace, by which <hi>Adam</hi> was enabled to rule his lower Faculties, was only given as a Bridle into his Hand, whereby he was to govern his Unruly Appetites; which, like a Wild Horse, would otherwise easily have cast off their Rider, and that this was only super-added to Man already perfect. But this Opinion seems not so well to vindicate the Goodness of the Divine Providence herein; for though Man had a super-added power of governing his Passions, yet if
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104464:116"/>
they were naturally headstrong and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, he was in much greater probability of falling than standing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Founded in Nature,</hi> and so neither by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration from God, nor by the Influence, or Influx of the Stars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not by Inspiration from God, which either was, or, at least was more generally suppos'd to be the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that Vertue could not be taught, but was more immediately inspir'd by God: But the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Platonists</hi> do either not make this his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or if they do, they do not then seem much to favour it. Alcinous. <hi>Cum igitur vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus res divina sit,</hi> &amp;c. upon which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator's words are, <hi>Omnis rei, cujuscunque sit, summa excellentia, quae à Deo esse putatur, divina appellatur, quo modo rudiore quâdam Minervâ intelligi potest, quod hoc loco dicitur, virtutem, quae hominis est perfectio, rem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam esse divinam:</hi> Not but that every good and perfect Gift comes from God, either immediately or mediately; but perhaps this was a way of Expression common to <hi>Plato</hi> with the <hi>Iews,</hi> of calling any thing that was great and excellent in its kind by the Name of Divine; so that all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably meant by this Phrase, was only to express the excellency of the thing, and the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104464:117"/>
great Opinion he had of it; or else that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence had some more particular concern in the disposing and inclining Men to it, either by giving them a more happy Constitution of Body, or a more Ingenuous Temper of Mind, or by affording more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Circumstances of time and place, yet so as that the most happy Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences do not necessitate Men to be Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous without their own Industry and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor the most Unhappy force 'em to be wicked without their own fault.</p>
               <p>However if this be <hi>Plato's</hi> Opinion, That Vertue is so from God, that it cannot be gotten by Humane Industry, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the ordinary Influences of Divine Providence, this Opinion is neither reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it self, nor is it sufficiently prov'd by that Argument made use of by <hi>Socrates</hi> for that purpose: <hi>If</hi> (says he) <hi>Vertue was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be taught, then would Good Men more especially teach their Sons, that so they might inherit their Father's Vertues as well as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;</hi> but the contrary frequently appears. To this I Answer,</p>
               <p>First, That nothing can be prov'd from particular Instances, seeing as many may be brought to the contrary, where Vertue has been, as it were, propagated with the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104464:117"/>
Family, and we may furnish our selves, even from our own Observation, with Examples of the happy success of a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Education.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Vertuous Parents, tho they may desire their Children may be such too, yet many times such is their Tenderness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to 'em, that they do not make use of those Methods which are most proper thereunto, which are commonly joyn'd with some degrees of Severity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Vertue, though it may be taught, and is capable of being learn'd, yet is it a very conditional thing, and depends upon the concurrence of many Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, for the producing the effect, and that which often defeats all the rest, is the liberty of the Will, which many Men use in opposition to all those Moral means, which are otherwise sufficient in themselves and design'd by others to moderate their Passions, and reduce 'em to Vertue. Nor</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doth Vertue proceed from any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Influx of the Stars, for if we consider the Nature of the Heavens, and natural Causes, and compare 'em with the Nature of the Soul and the Native Liberty of the Will, it will be impossible to conceive how any Sydereal Influences can any ways cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

or necessarily determine the Minds of Men. And the same Arguments that prove the Vanity of Iudicial Astrology in other respects, do much more evince the folly of their pretences, who go into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fetch down Vertue from thence, when indeed it is nearer us, even in our Mouths, imprinted upon our very Hearts and Natures: I shall here give you <hi>Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norola's</hi> Argument in a case much what to this purpose: <hi>If</hi> (says he) <hi>the</hi> Christian <hi>Faith and Life proceed from the Stars, then their Faith is either true or false; if it be true, then it cannot proceed from thence, because it condemns that Opinion, and asserts the Vanity of Iudicial Astrology; if it be false, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Stars, then it follows, that the Stars incline Men to falshood, and the falshood of the Effect will be no good reason why we should believe the truth of the Cause. Whereby Men by the mere strength of Nature,</hi> &amp;c. And thus Vertue is distinguished from Grace; thus the <hi>Heathen Moralists</hi> have discours'd very well of Vertue in their Writings, and given great Instances thereof in their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, who yet were very Strangers to all Supernatural Revelation: And this Notion of it seems fitly to assign the just Limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Gentile</hi> and the <hi>Christian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104464:118"/>
it deprives not the one of what it may justly challenge, as its right; it allows to men in the state of Nature, some inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and abilities too to Vertue, but yet that without supernatural assistance, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrive at Evangelical Perfection: it doth not so far depress humane nature, Modices to make it perfectly stupid; nor on the other hand doth it raise it to a pitch of Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisin; it grants Heathens to be Men, and reminds Christians of their Original Sin, and the present depravation of their Natures. And though the Heathen Moralists do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mention such a thing, as <hi>afflatus divinus</hi> yet it cannot be in reason extended so far, as to signify that which Christian Writers commonly understand by that expression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To perform that which is most agreeable to the duty and dignity of his nature.</hi> Thus though vertue in the proper acceptation of it be distinguish'd from Grace, as to the Principle from whence it flows, the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from nature, the other from a more divine original; yet do they agree in their end, and Friendly conspire together to carry on the same designs of Providence in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God and the good of Men. Now the dignities or excellencies of humane nature are of two sorts. 1. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104464:119"/>
and original. 2. Such as are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults of the divine benignity afterwards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Natural and Original, and under this head I shall only consider the excellencies of the Soul in particular. 1. As to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of its nature and essence, that it is a spiritual being, and ray of Divinity; now considering this natural preheminence of the Soul above the Body, we act unworthy of the dignity and excellence of the Soul, when we make it only a Slave to the Body, and only as it were the Bodies Purveyor to make provision for the flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof. 2. As to its intellectual Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Man only, of all this lower Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is endowed with a power of reasoning: now certainly God never gave us such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent faculties only to employ 'em upon mean objects, and debase 'em by unworthy Employments, <hi>Phil. 4. 8. What soever things are true, what soever things are just,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>think on these things.</hi> 3. As to its moral Endowments, that is, all those natural Inclinations and Capacities the Soul has to Vertue and Goodness, that inward sense of Honesty, that <hi>tactus quidam divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat is,</hi> as <hi>Iamblicus</hi> calls it: now this also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to be true to that inward sense of obligation that lies upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:104464:119"/>2. Such dignities as are the result of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benignity afterwards, and these I shall consider as belonging to humane nature in general: 1. The honour that Christ has put upon humane nature, by taking it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself. 2. As Man now is made the Temple of the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 16. 1 Cor. 6. 19.</hi> 3. As humane Nature, by being join'd to the Divine, is made capable of enjoying Eternal Happiness in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Heavens: but these are things rather of a Divine than Moral Consideration.</p>
               <p>Thus have I more fully explain'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Moral Vertue, wherein whilst I endeavour'd to do right to Nature, I hope I have not any ways injur'd Divine Grace: for I count him not worthy to partake of the benefits thereof, who speaks the least word to derogate from the excellency and necessity of Divine Assistance.</p>
               <p>How far Vertue, Reason, or Philosophy (for they meant much what the same thing by them all) was or is available to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in order to their future Happiness, I shall not here particularly enquire, or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determine, this being a Question wherein Scripture is much what silent; and Modesty here teaches us not to be wise above what is written, nor curiously inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104464:120"/>
in things wherein we have no certain Rule to guide us.</p>
               <p>Only here give me leave barely to relate their Reasons, who are willing to entertain as favourable thoughts, as they can, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the possibility of the Salvation of some Heathens: and here first to prevent mistakes, they lay down this as an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principle, and a certain Truth, that there is no <hi>name given under Heaven, by which any can be saved, but only the name of Iesus.</hi> So that none was ever saved, but with a respect to Christ's Death, and by the benefits they receive thereby: nor do they here hold an indifferency of Religions, as if it was equally possible and easy to be saved in any: for tho' some Heathens may be saved, yet the advantage on the Christians part above them is much every way, both in respect of the means in order thereunto, and also in respect of the certainty, that God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly accept of such conditions as he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in the Gospel. So that a Christian, if he be not wanting to himself, is not only sase, but certain, sree not only from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but from doubt, which an Heathen cannot be: nor do they frame such notions of God, as if he was compos'd wholly of Mercy, and that Iustice was only an empty
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104464:120"/>
Title; for they assert, that as mercy appears in the Salvation of a Christian, so likewise the Salvation of Heathens, if any such thing be, will not be in a way or method incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Divine Iustice: they do not here go about to describe the particular way how it is to be done, only they charitably conceive, that it is not any thing contrary to the Divine Nature, nor to any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he has made in Scripture.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Some short Observations upon <hi>Mr Hobs</hi> his first Chapter of his Kingdom of Darkness.</head>
               <p>HE begins this Part of his <hi>Leviathan</hi> with a pleasant description of the Kingdom of Satan, which he makes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as phantastick as that of <hi>Oberon,</hi> or the Fairy Land, making the notion of Spirits and Immaterial Substances to be as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as the Dreams of Madmen, and indeed the mere results of the timorous apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Children or Fools. There is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made <hi>in Scripture of the Principality of</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:104464:121"/>
Belzebub <hi>over Demons, that is to say, over Phantasms, that appear in the air; and since</hi> Belzebub <hi>is the King of these Phantasms, the Sons of Darkness, Phantasms and the Spirits of illusion signify the same thing:</hi> the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating hereof seems a sufficient Answer, it being too sancisul to require a serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutation.</p>
               <p>And yet he makes this one great instance of the Churches being not yet fully emerg'd out of the Territories of Darkness, or not yet inserted into the glorious light and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sons of God, because it believes Spirits to be Immaterial Beings, subsisting by themselves, and not mere Phantasms; as if the Church could never arrive at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity of Doctrine, till it became a Company of Men openly prosessing that, which either immediately borders upon, or naturally tends to Atheism.</p>
               <p>But then in the beginning of his next Chapter, he tells us the manner how Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms are produc'd, which in short is this, by the impression which visible objects make upon the Senses: which motion being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the place of perception, doth there beget in the Mind or Soul the Conception or Phantasm of the object thus communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the mind. So that a Phantasm accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104464:121"/>
to this way of explaining it, is not, and cannot be any where existent, but in the mind of the Perceiver. But then how will this agree with what he had said before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Belzebub's</hi> being the Prince of <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms, that inhabit the air.</hi> But perhaps it would sometimes be as hard a matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> to himself, as it would be to reconcile his Opinions to Truth. How is Satan Prince of those Phantasms which every Man frames to himself? May not every one rather create his own Subjects, and become himself Prince of his own Phantasms? but when he calls Satan or <hi>Belzebub</hi> Prince of these Phantasms, he seems to grant a greater reality of Existence to him, than to them: Now I do not see, according to his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but that <hi>Belzebub</hi> himself is as great a Phantasm, as any of the other. Now the first way he assigns, by which this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkness is promoted among Men, is by extinguishing the light of Scripture by false Interpretations; and I could wish Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was not thus guilty himself of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting this Spiritual Darkness.</p>
               <p>The first instance he gives of this false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, is of those, who make the Church, now in the World, the Kingdom of God, so often mention'd in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104464:122"/>
Scripture; whereas, says he, 'tis manifest to the contrary, that the Kingdom of God was instituted by God by the Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi> over the Iews only, who for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son are call'd <hi>The peculiar People of God:</hi> which Kingdom ceas'd at the Election of <hi>Saul,</hi> and that there never was any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God properly so call'd, since that, on Earth.</p>
               <p>Two things there are generally requir'd to the founding of an Hypothesis. 1. To show the reasonableness of it in it self. 2. The agreeableness of it to all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, relating to such a matter. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> in his former part of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> had been laying down the reasons and foundations of his Political Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis: and now because he doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deny the truth of Scripture, but that some respect is owing to it; therefore he thought himself concern'd, to sute it, as near as possible, to the Scripture also: hence he endeavours, if he cannot bring his Principles to it, he will, by forc'd Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bring the Scripture to them.</p>
               <p>This premis'd in general, it is easily discernable why Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> would not grant now God any Kingdom upon Earth, truly so call'd because if he had, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:104464:122"/>
that notion which he hath fram'd of a Kingdom, as to its first Constitution, which must be by conferring Rights, by mutual Compacts, and Covenants, being an acquisition of power over their Subjects by their own consent. Now he fancies, though without any good grounds, that the People of the Iews, under <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> were such a Kingdom, wherein the People did transfer their Rights, and did mutually Covenant with God for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Kingdom, according to his own Notion; whereas indeed there was no more drawing of Articles, whereby God did acquire any more new right over them then, than there is now under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. 2. Supposing that this formal transferring of rights was necessary to the constituting of a Kingdom amongst Men; yet it will not follow hence, that God too must acquire his right of Government the same way: for certainly God's right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding doth not depend upon the Peoples Choice and willingness to obey. 3. Though Christians do not go about to chuse God their Soveraign, as they do a King in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Kingdoms, by majority of Votes; yet their very taking upon them the profession of Christianity, and expecting Salvation
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104464:123"/>
upon its own terms, doth imply a tacitCom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. Thus the New Testament is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Covenant too. So that the Church on Earth may as properly be call'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ now, as the People of the Iews the Kingdom of God then: and Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> himself tells us, <hi>Ch. 31. Levi.</hi> that to reign <hi>in the proper acceptation of the word, is to rule by commanding, threatning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising.</hi> Now why may not Christ be now said properly to rule by his word and laws? that is, by commanding, threatning and promising. But let us examine the reasons why the Church upon Earth cannot be call'd the Kingdom of Christ: All that is there offer'd is, <hi>Errori huic, quod Ecclesia, qu. e nunc est in terris,</hi> &amp;c. Here he calls it an errour, supposing that he had prov'd it so in his 35 <hi>Ch.</hi> Where he purposely insists upon this Argument: There he tells us, that the Kingdom of God by Divines is sometimes taken for that Eternal Happiness which the Blessed shall enjoy in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory. Sometimes it is taken for the Kingdom of Grace here on Earth. But here he doth not prove, which he ought to have done, that these are false and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Interpretations of the word, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the true sense of those places,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104464:123"/>
where the Divines so interpret them: only he says, <hi>contra in Scripturis Sacris invenio regnum. Dei ubi<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> fere significare regnum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prtè dictum,</hi> &amp;c. Now this one word <hi>fere, almost,</hi> doth quite invalidate the force of all his Argument: for granting that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is sometimes taken in that sense of his before-mention'd (which yet will be very hard for him to prove) yet if there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, wherein that word occurs, which cannot so be interpreted; then that is not the necessary and constant sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p>I shall here briefly examine those places of Scripture, which he draws, rather than leads to the confirming his own Notion, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. And I will establish my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their Generations for an Everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi> Here, he says, <hi>Abraham</hi> promis'd to obey God, for himself and his Posterity; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he doth not mention one word to any such purpose: so that there was no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of rights, no inducing obligations <hi>per verba in praesenti:</hi> but all the reason that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had to cite this place in favour of his Opinion, seems only this, because there is mention made of a Covenant, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104464:124"/>
he supposes all Covenants must be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Model: but I might as well cite <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 31. where God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to make a new Covenant with the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> after those days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is to be understood of the coming of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the Flesh, to prove a Kingdom of God, properly so call'd, now under the Gospel, as this of <hi>Gen.</hi> is cited to prove it then. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place is <hi>Exod. 19. 5. If ye will hear my Voice, and keep my Covenant, ye shall be to me a peculiar people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>these are the words, that thou shalt speak to the People. And</hi> Moses <hi>call'd the Elders of the People, and laid before their Faces all these words which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him: and all the People answered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and said, All that the Lord hath spoken, we will do.</hi> Here God seems to require the consent of the People, for the ratifying of his Covenant. To this I Answer, 1. That these and such like Covenants, though they have so much of the nature of a Compact, as that the Blessings therein promis'd are conditional, and to be obtain'd only by the performance of the Conditions; yet upon the whole, they seem rather conferring of benefits, than severe stipulations: so that the conditions being propos'd, no one, that hath the use of reason, will refuse to comply with 'em.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:104464:124"/>2. Though God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to declare his Covenant to his People, yet it cannot be suppos'd that the obligation did depend merely upon their acceptance: for God had right to command what he there requir'd, though he had not join'd to the observance of his Laws such particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God might have particular Reasons to deal in this more sensible manner with the Iews, in complyance with their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, out of tenderness of affection to 'em, to let 'em see that he requir'd their own consent to what he enjoin'd 'em, hereby to lay a great sense of obligation upon 'em; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if they now rebell'd, they would not only break their natural Laws of duty to him, as God, but also violate their own Promises.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Consequent upon this errour, that the Church now on Earth is the Kingdom of Christ, and that there ought to be one Man, or a Company of Men, by whom our Saviour, now in Heaven, speaks to Men on Earth; consequent to this it is, that the Pope challenges an Universal Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> That which I here first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve is, his artificial sliding of these two Propositions together, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104464:125"/>
on Earth is the Kingdom of Christ, and that there ought to be one Man, or one Company of Men, which should rule the same, as universal head under him, hereby to impose upon the unwary Roader, as if they were Propositions altogether of the same import: whereas the one is only a false consequence drawn from the other; but it is no unusual Artifice with Mr <hi>Hobbs,</hi> to charge false Inferences upon true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, thus, if possible, to disparage what he is not able otherwise solidly to disprove: but by the same way of arguing, he may prove that there is no God, from those Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious and Idolatrous Practices, which are accidentally consequent upon, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by the belief of a Deity; for if there were no Opinion of a God, there would be no Idolatry nor Superstition. But this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is deficient in other respects, so also is it in respect of time: for the Church on Earth might have been the Kingdom of Christ for the first four or five hundred Years after his Appearance in the World, notwithstanding the force of this Argument. For it then only began to be an Argument when the Pope began to arrogate so much Power to himself. And indeed Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> had great reason to thank the Church of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104464:125"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> for affording him so much Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matter to stuff his Kingdom of Darkness withal. Another Artifice, by which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> would disparage a truth, that he has a mind to oppose, is, with a Philosophical Gravity, to feign an idle and ridiculous ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, to which judiciously to ascribe it: thus he fancies, that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> from the consideration of this or such like Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Homo est animal;</hi> from the <hi>Copula</hi> in this Proposition he took occasion first to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert separate Essences, Celestial Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and humane Souls. <hi>Leviat. Latin</hi> p. 320.</p>
               <p>Another instance he gives of the false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, is the asserting the immortality of the Soul, and its being really distinct from the Body; but now one would scarce desire a better Argument for the proof thereof, than the very Answers he gives to those places of Scripture, which are commonly alledg'd for it, so weak and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous many times are they: Eccles. 12. 7. <hi>The Spirit returns to God that gave it;</hi> which words, says he, <hi>may suffer this interpretation,</hi> but then they must undergo a great deal of pain, and have a great deal of Patience, if they suffer it: One great defect, which seems to run through all Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104464:126"/>
of Scripture, is this, that he supposes himsels on the defensive part, and that all that he had to do, was only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent some frivolous Evasion, or put some forc'd Interpretation upon the place, and then all was done: whereas he ought posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to prove, that that of his was the only true and genuine sense and meaning of the place, both from the generally approv'd concurrent Testimonies of the best and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Ages, from the just and proper accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, by the best and most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors; from the general scope and design of the Context, and from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency that his Sense and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation has, to promote those noble ends of Vertue and Piety in the World, which God and Christ design'd to carry on by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. None of which things Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath as much as attempted to do: <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit returns to God that gave it;</hi> that is, says he, <hi>God only knows whence it comes, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goes:</hi> And I could wish that he had been true to his own Interpretation. But then how comes he so positively to assert its Mortality at present, and at what Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods it must return again to Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another place, he says, which seems to make for the immortality of the Soul, is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104464:126"/>
                  <hi>Matt. 22. 32.</hi> Where our Saviour affirms <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> to be alive; to which he answers, That they were indeed alive, but not actually, but as by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God they were sure of Eternal Life: but he also tells us, That the wicked are sure of eternal Death; and thus, why may not the wicked be as properly said to be dead, even whiles they are alive, by vertue of the threatning; as the Righteous can be said to be alive, by vertue of the promise, even then, when they are suppos'd not to be at all.</p>
               <p>The sum of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Opinion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is this; he supposes the Soul not to be any thing really distinct from the Body, but that it is compos'd of the purer parts of the Spirits, and by consequence it dies with the Body; not that it is annihilated, for matter in this sense is immortal; that is, not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally capable of annihilation, but that upon such grand indispositions of Body, which is called Death, the Soul is render'd uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of such agitations, and such reactions, in which the nature of a living Creature doth consist: So that according to this Opinion, a Man can no more properly be said either to be alive or dead, than Quicksilver may; for though it be not so Organized, as Mans
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:104464:127"/>
Body is, though it hath neither heart nor brain to transmit Spirits to each other, and though it has not the use of Speech, yet may it have a Soul as really intelligent as that of ours. The greatest part of the rest of this Chapter is employ'd in confuting or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing some Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet we may observe, that notwithstanding his severe handling that Church in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, yet her Authority is then valued by him, when she seems any ways to favour his Opinions: thus he cites her Authority to confirm his assertion, That Spirits are mere Phantasms, because she in her Exorcisms calls 'em so. I shall here only further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, how he hath transform'd all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Satan into Phantasms, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Kingdom of Darkness, and in the latter end thereof has allegoriz'd all the Officers and Ministers of the Pope into mere Hobgoblins.</p>
               <p>That which gave the first occasion of employing my thoughts this way, was those false Opinions concerning God, those various modes of Theism, which now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the World, which seem to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Epicurism and Hobbianism trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into other (I know not whether I may say into better) shapes. Now if
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104464:127"/>
what I here write, may but give occasion to some abler Pen more fully to examine and confute those fatal Principles (and I hope it will, rather than a good Cause should suffer by my ill management.) If these Papers, I say, have this good effect, I shall not then need to make any other Apology, but think my Pains very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX TO THE Seventh Chapter.</head>
            <p>I Would not there be thought in the least to favour that false and foolish, that dangerous and destructive opinion of Theism, an Opinion, which grants indeed the Being of God and natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but denies all Divine Revelation made to Mankind afterward: and thus it seems a composition of the worst ingredients inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to humane Nature, Pride, Ignorance, and Ingratitude; of Pride, as not duly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the frailties of humane nature; of Ignorance, as not fully understanding the true state and condition of laps'd Mankind; of Ingratitude, as not thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the benefits of Divine Grace. But Secondly, besides these, there are others, who granting a Divine Revelation made to Man, do yet so melt it down, as it were,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104464:129"/>
below it self, till it come to an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with, or very little exceed mere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion. 3. Others, who in words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a God, but denying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles of all Religion, the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and a future State, seem perfectly to entertain the Doctrine of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi>—As for the light of Nature, which these Men so much Idolize, I shall grant to it as much, as in reason it can desire, and so satisfy its own just demands. 1. The Law of Nature is a Divine Law, and brings us under the obligation of its Commands, so that whatever is directly contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, cannot be made part of any suture Revelation, because one Divine Light is not contrary to another. 2. The rational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Faculties might be, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was made use of by the Prophets and Apostles in their revealing the Will of God to Man, yet still under the Influence and Superintendence of the Holy Spirit, guide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and directing them in such a measure, as was necessary in order to such an end. 3. This light of natural Reason, together with the concurrence of those other means, design'd by God in order thereunto, may be made use of for the better understanding of God's reveal'd will in Scripture: now
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104464:129"/>
after such fair Concessions made to it, it ought not to exalt it self above, or make it self equal to that of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>Theism in a Christian state, where Men have not only all the Opportunities of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and understanding the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also live in the outward profession of it, this of all things is the most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, for even the best and wisest Asserters of the Light of Nature and Human Reason, do grant, that in those places where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is known, Reason it self <hi>will find more, and much stronger, Arguments for the Christian, than for any other Belief what soever.</hi>—These Theists must also prove one of these two things; either, <hi>1st,</hi> That there never were any such persons as the Prophets, our Blessed Saviour, and his Apostles, in the World; which is contrary to the universal Consent and Confession of all, both Friends and Enemies: Or else, <hi>2ly,</hi> That they never made any new revelation of God's Will to Mankind; which they can never be able to do. As for the practical Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we grant they are founded in Nature, and agreeable to Reason; but then withal we say, That Revelation hath both added to the clearness of the Truth, and to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Obligation of those Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:104464:130"/>But here they tell us, That Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son has discover'd enough; and that there is no need of any farther Revelation to be made to Man; but it is a very weak and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical way of arguing against a Matter of Fact, from a supposed needlesness, that there should be any such thing; we ought rather in this case to argue thus: It doth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, That God hath made such and such Declarations of his Will to Man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not needless, because God doth nothing in vain. Farther, It is disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ungratesul for Natural Reason thus to boast it self upon its own sufficiency, and not acknowledge its Benefactor, seeing it now owes its present improvement, in a great measure, to the Benefits and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it has received from Divine Revelation.—The Author of the <hi>Discourse of Human Reason, with relation to matters of Religion,</hi> printed 1690. tell us, That <hi>the whole Substance of Christianity it self, according to St. Iohn's account of it, is most certainly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that universal light, which enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every man that cometh into the World.</hi> Pa. 4. of his <hi>Presatory Letter.</hi> But to this I answer, 1. That St. <hi>Iohn</hi> there doth not speak of the Light of Nature, but of Christ; and tho' Christ be the Author of that Light,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104464:130"/>
yet his thus enlightning every one that comes into the World, doth not supersede the necessity, or lessen the excellency of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. 2. The whole Substance of Christianity cannot be founded therein, because Christianity contains in it Articles of Faith, above the natural power of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to find out, as well as matters of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. 3. Tho' the practical part be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this universal Light of Nature, yet Christianity may carry on the Superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture higher than meer Nature was ever able to do. 4. It is not most certain, that that is the right Translation of that place of St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> it may be also render'd thus, <hi>He was that true Light,</hi> which coming into the World, enlightens every man; that is, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that hath the Happiness to hear the glad tydings of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The said Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 92. having before made an exact and full enumeration (as he thinks it) of the Principles of all, or rather of meer Natural Religion, <hi>In the Belief and Sense,</hi> says he, <hi>of these general Traths, and in the practice of the Duties that result from 'em, according to their full extent and tendency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists all true Religion, and whatever else is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into any Religion, either notional or practical; I say, what either doth not necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104464:131"/>
flow from some of these Branches, or tend to enforce the observance of 'em; is no essential part of true Religion, but the meer Product of Superstition, Folly, or Design.</hi> But according to his Scheme of Principles, what shall we think of those Articles of the Christian Faith the Trinity, the Incarnation and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Body, for these are neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Enumeration, nor do they necessarily flow from any Branch thereof. If he say, that these may tend to enforce the observance of those Duties before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; this I grant, but it seems a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous way of proving Articles of Faith, to bring 'em in only by the by, because the belief thereof may enforce the practice of Christian Duties; though this also is true, that they do so, yet the true reason of our belief of 'em, is, because they are revealed in Scripture.</p>
            <p>What Monsieur <hi>le Clerk's</hi> design (or whoever else was the Author of those five Letters concerning the Divine Inspiration of holy Scriptures, lately translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish) was, I shall not here enquire: Truth indeed forbids me to think him a Deist, in the first sence before mention'd; but Charity it self doth not forbid to think him one in the second; that is, one who would bring
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104464:131"/>
Divine Inspiration into as narrow a room as he could, and believe as little of it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as possible. Yet we ought not to be too severe, in charging the consequences of an Opinion upon its Author, especially when he disowns 'em to be his Opinions; but on the other side we ought to be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over our selves, that we do not broach or defend any Opinion, that may any ways tend to unhinge the Principles, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Foundations of Christianity, and we ought the more to suspect and carefully examine such, from whence men generally draw dangerous consequences.</p>
            <p>That a Papist should industriously set himself to lessen the Authority of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and upon all occasions seek advantage against it, is not so much to be wonder'd at, because hereby he serves a turn, and by this means endeavours to advance the Authority of his own Church, that what is pretended to be wanting in Scripture, may be supplied by <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition. But then, why they who call themselves <hi>Protestants</hi> should joyn in such a Design, and pick up all the little Arguments of ill-designing Men against Scripture; this is not so easie to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:104464:132"/>Scripture doth not go about meerly to beg a favourable reception in the World, as if it stood in need of such mean methods of proceeding; seeing it may justly challenge a due regard and veneration from all sober and considerate persons, it doth not desire to make use of any precarious Principles in its own defence, nor refuses to joyn issue with its Adversaries in the most severe method of Raciocination.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, as the Translator tells us in his Preface, that it is <hi>unbecoming the dignity of such sacred Truths as the Christian Religion teaches us, to build them upon unsound Principles, or defend them by Sophistical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If this be applied to the following Letters, designing thereby to reflect upon the contrary Opinion, and to magnifie the soundness of the Principles and Cogency of the Arguments contained in these; I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Lowth's</hi> Answer is sufficient to convince any considerate person to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>The sum of the Author's Hypothesis in the five Letters, seems to be this; he abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely rejects some of the Books of the Old Testament, and very much questions the Authority of others of the new: He doth not allow Scripture in general, either as to the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104464:132"/>
matter, or as to the words, to be inspired by the Holy Ghost, excepting only some few particular Instances: And as for the Difficulties that occurr therein, he doth not much concern himself about 'em, but takes this more easie way of solving all, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, when any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is objected, that the holy Pen-men were there mistaken, and contradicted themselves. And as the Translator, in his <hi>Preface, p. 6.</hi> tells us, the use of all this is, <hi>to settle our Christian Religion upon a basis not to be shaken by the Difficulties about the Scripture, which the Learned are forced to acknowledge to be insuperable.</hi> But I am apt to believe, that too little reading and considering the best Authors, and too great a Tincture of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice upon the Minds of Men doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make that seem an insuperable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which is not so in it self: Or, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there were some such in Scripture, must we therefore reject the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole, because we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand some parts of the Bible. <hi>Vid. Letter</hi> to a <hi>Deist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I do not see what sufficient Answer he returns to that place, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. The holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104464:133"/>
               <hi>acted or carried by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Here <hi>Beza</hi> gives this seasonable Caution; <hi>Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trè hoc intelligendum est, ne quis divini spiritûs rectè compositos &amp; verè divinos afflatus compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret profanorum, Vatum furoribus, &amp;c.</hi> But the aforesaid Author comes short of the true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Phrase, when he makes this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse or Influence of the Holy Ghost to be nothing more than the meer result of a pious and well-disposed Mind, acting only by the strength of Memory, and a well-inform'd Understanding. But for a man to espouse such a dangerous and unwarrantable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and when he is urged with plain and express places of Scripture (such as seem <hi>non sine numine,</hi> and, as it were, purposely so worded, as if designed to obviate such a Tenent) for him then to tell us, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth, <hi>p. 146.</hi> That <hi>no Doctrine which we esteem important, ought to be grounded bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on certain manners of speaking, which we cannot be sure they were exact, because the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writers, not affecting exactness of Style, may have used that manner of expression without any design.</hi> This is only to study Evasions, and to lay a Foundation of something like Sceptism in Religion; for, after this way of arguing, a man may assert or deny any thing, having first thus taken off the edge
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104464:133"/>
of the Scripture so, as that he need to fear no danger thence.</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <hi>p. 34.</hi> That St. <hi>Luke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses himself, in the beginning of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, That <hi>he learned not that which he told us by inspiration, but by information from those that knew it exactly.</hi> To this I answer, 1. Divine Grace is very well consistent with the sober and rational use of our Faculties, tho' perhaps it is not very easie to explain the way and method how 'tis done: Nor is such an Inspiration (as is here asserted) any ways contrary to those subordinate means which St. <hi>Luke</hi> might make use of in that case; <hi>Dubitandum non est, quin piam diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Deus direxerit.</hi> 2. St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth not say, that what he there writes he had only by Information; <hi>It seem'd good also to me, who having had perfect knowledge of all things,</hi> ab initio, <hi>from the beginning;</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>supernè, coelitus, from above.</hi> Thus <hi>Ia. 1. 17. Every good and perfect Gift is from above;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Io. 19. 11.</hi> And this, the Criticks say, is the proper and usual signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word, <hi>Vt sit adverbium loci, à quâ significatione non temerè recedendum, illua autem à principio sensum angustiorem reddit, &amp; includitur, in eo, quòd se omnia consecutum esst &amp; scripturum ordine, dicat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:104464:134"/>The said Author is much offended at those expressions in <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. which, he says, are all Curses and Imprecations: But he may as well say, that those Woes which our Saviour denounces against impenitent Sinners, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 14. are all Curses too; whereas they are rather tender-hearted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and Commiserations, for those Evils which he foresaw they would bring upon themselves by their wilful Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And what he says further, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Opinion, is only this; That <hi>if all these words were render'd in the future tense, to avoid making the Psalmist pronounce such Curses, there are a great many more places in the Psalms, where the Version would need to be reform'd.</hi> But what if this were granted, would any thing of absurdity or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence follow thence?</p>
            <p>'Tis further observable, that he boldly advances his own Opinion many times, without ever taking the least notice of those Answers that have been return'd to it both by ancient and modern Writers. Thus, <hi>2 Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture is given by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration os God, and is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. But, <hi>p. 189.</hi> he says, this may be very well thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, <hi>All Scripture that is divincly inspir'd is profitable;</hi> but it cannot well be translated
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104464:134"/>
thus, unless he can prove, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did suppose some of the Books of the Iewish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non not to be inspir'd: Otherwise <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact's</hi> Confutation of this very Opinion will still <hi>hold good,</hi> where in answer to his way of reading the words, <hi>Omnis scriptura, que divinitùs inspirata est, illa est etiam utilis,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>oportebat eos novisse, quòd cum suprà dixerit, sacras literas nosti, nunc ait, omnis scriptura qualis? de quâ disserehat, &amp; de quâ dixit, quòd sacra est: omnis igitur hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi divinitùs inspirata est, &amp; utilis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>p. 48.</hi> That the Discourses which the Apostles made before their Iudges <hi>did not contain any thing which one might not as well say without inspiration.</hi> But to prove the Apostles divinely inspir'd, we do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider what they said, but also what they did upon those occasions. I do not here speak of the Miracles done by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; but those practical Resolutions and pious Performances consequent upon theirin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perswasions and Convictions. 2. What the Apostles said and did in those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances then, were greater and stronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of their being inspir'd, than any thing of the like nature would be to us now; and the Reason is, because the Gospel was a Religion then newly reveal'd, and not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104464:135"/>
grown, as it were, habitual to 'em by a long-continued Belief of it; they acted not only against all the Power and Authority of the World, which was then vigorously set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst 'em, but also against their own late Principles and Practices of a different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they successfully attempted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd such things, which nothing but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Impulse could prevail with a prudent man to undertake.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, this Author seems very much to resemble Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; he would have the liberty of putting what Interpretations he pleases upon places of Scripture, and then puts his Adversary to disprove 'em; and this is that wherein the strength of his Plea doth generally consist. But I humbly conceive, that whereas he goes about to advance a novel opinion, he ought first by positive Arguments to consute the sormer, and prove, that those Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formerly put upon those, places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are neither agreeable to the true sense of the Words, nor to the analogy of Faith; and not think it sufficient for him, in this case, to tell us, That such or such a place <hi>may be</hi> interpreted so or so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:104464:135"/>Thus, <hi>p.</hi> 177. 'tis remarkable how indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously he labours to put the Proof upon Mons. <hi>Simon,</hi> it being Mr. <hi>N's</hi> (as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is call'd) usual way, rather to suppose than prove any thing. Thus, in the very next Page, 178. he vigorously supposes these two things; 1. That St. <hi>Paul, Acts 23.</hi> speaks not there as a Prophet, but as a meer private Person. 2. That he confesses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to blame, in giving such Language to the High-Priest, but offers not the least thing in proof of either, only makes the one Supposal to prove the other; the latter to prove the former. But if St. <hi>Paul</hi> spoke as a Prophet, as the generality of Interpreters do assert, and nothing here offer'd to prove the contrary, then we cannot in reason sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to beg Pardon for what he spoke, as such; and therefore some other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ought to be put upon that place.</p>
