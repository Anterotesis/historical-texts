            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I'm glad to hear it with all my heart; and why is this Man so bitter against the <hi>Whigs</hi> then? since there may be many Hundreds, if not Thousands of such <hi>Christian Whigs,</hi> that are <hi>Dissenters</hi> in the Nation; good, just, holy, pious, conscientious, charitable <hi>Whigs,</hi> that meddle not with the Government, give no embroil, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to it, but walk according to the true tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Opinion; and yet if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, he has in other places said, there could be none of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> good, no not one.</p>

                     <p>WHat in a brown study? what ha' you there, <hi>Heraclitus</hi> railing against the <hi>No Protestant Plot?</hi> a most wicked Libel, which, like the Shams, begets another.</p>

                     <p>I am laughing to see the Fellow mumble a company of Pebbles, taking them to be Nuts; he thinks to crack them, and breaks the stumps in his Mouth: Is not <hi>Swinger</hi> a kin to you?</p>

                     <p>He is acquainted indeed with the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, tho they are a numerous Corporation, ever since they have rub'd the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> out of sight. They have rub'd a <hi>Iesuite</hi> into a <hi>Presbyter.</hi>

                     <p>Yes, they would feign rub out the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Sign of Sir <hi>Ed. Godfrey</hi> too, that offends the Rubbers.</p>

                     <p>But they will never be able to rub the stain out of the Peoples Memorie, let them rub their hearts out.</p>

                     <p>There are some who think to do it with the Brish of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi>

                     <p>Not so great neither, as the <hi>Tory</hi> Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have performed, who have rub'd 6 or 7 Traytors into Saints. Come Sir, they know how to <hi>rub</hi> and <hi>Let</hi> too, as well as the best Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Rubbers of them all.</p>

                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>If you begin to make Comparisons I'll leave you; you are as spiteful as <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and as malicious as the <hi>Observator.</hi>

                     <p>And have they not reason to be so, when the <hi>Whigs</hi> present their Papers for a Neusance?</p>

                     <p>And much they care for it; for they are still ready to present the <hi>Whigs</hi> with 2 or 3 sheets of Bumfodder to rub their—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>N.</speaker>
                     <p>You remember the <hi>Observator</hi> says, <hi>things must be done decently and in order.</hi>

                     <p>That's a mistake, it was not the Text, but the ill handling that Text made the honest man lose his Dinner.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>Observator</hi> is an insulting fellow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the dead, Observe his Notes and his Sayings.</p>

                     <p>'Tis but only to inform the living, and to disabuse the People.</p>

                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>Good Man! I will put you one Query. <hi>Why this Gentleman never wrote Notes on the Five Iesuites, who said they dy'd innocent? nor by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing way of arguing, informed the Living, or disabused the Common People, too many of whom were apt to believe the dying words of such holy men?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>N.</speaker>
                     <p>Because he thought them better Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than those he writes against: But let me ask you one Question, what were you studying on?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>To <hi>English</hi> a little more than a line of <hi>Horace,</hi> in the Front of <hi>Heraclitus, Numb.</hi> 43.</p>

                     <p>Even as the <hi>Papists</hi> interpret Scripture: He has made the <hi>Whigs</hi> of Ancient standing: But since <hi>Horace</hi> was a <hi>Roman,</hi> I think it may be better apply'd to his People, who pray to such Saints, and then I thought

                     <p>Or as the Bonfires t'other night thorough out <hi>London,</hi> I wonder the <hi>Observator</hi> and <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> did not piss them out.</p>

                     <p>They ran away at the Shout of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the pronouncing <hi>Ignoramus:</hi> that is a terrible word, and sounds like Thunder in their ears. But let 'em go, betwixt you and me, the Little great Lord I am affraid is no great States-Man, but a Fool.</p>

                     <p>Because he did so openly and plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Mind, consult and conspire the most horrid Treason he is charged with, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for, with such kind of Men, <hi>Papists,</hi> Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats, Profligated Wretches, that could stand him in no stead, in those great designs of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing a Kingdom, with so many, so openly, without binding to secrecy, with Oaths and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
<pb facs="tcp:107110:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to be so familiar and intimate with such persons, below his Quality, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Bosom and Secrets; and indeed, to be so great a Fool or Mad-Man, to trust his Life, his Estate, the Honour of his Family in such Hands.

                     <p>This was not considered before hand. Look you, these Fellows were Doves; harmless Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, that could do no hurt with down-right Swearing, ask honest <hi>Heraclitus</hi> else; who in his impudent front of <hi>Numb.</hi> 44. puts down,</p>

                     <p>You are very Poetical methinks. But Sir, Treason is Treason, let me tell you, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overt Acts according to the Statute of <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>Ed. 3d.</hi> but Treasonable Words are Treason, according to that of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. being proved by two credible and substantial Witnesses.</p>

                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>A Man had need have a care whom he converses with, and keep a Journal of his words, as well as Actions; but I think it would do well, that this whifling Sin of Perjury were made death by the Law, especially in such cases, where the Juror, by a false Oath, shall attempt to take away the life of another.</p>

                     <speaker>N.</speaker>
                     <p>That's not our business: Let our wise Legislators in <hi>Parliament</hi> think of that: But I hope you do not charge any of the King's Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>

                     <p>Not I; but I hope a <hi>Grand Iury</hi> may think of their Credibility, since he that swears Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against another, by the Statute, ought to be a Credible Witness.</p>

                     <p>Because the Indictment was not put in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Time limited in the Statute. Then you see the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> had more reasons than one.</p>

                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Observator Numb.</hi> 77. proves them credible Witnesses, and makes it an Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Parliament to believe the contrary; since Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was particularly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the House of Commons, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 2. 1680. to His Majesty, to take him into His Royal Care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so likewise Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Macnamarra.</hi>

                     <p>What an Argument is here! Because they once were credible Witnesses, therefore there is no possibility for them afterwards to become otherwise. Because the <hi>Weather Dragon</hi> on <hi>Bow</hi> sometimes turned his Snout towards the <hi>Tower,</hi> therefore he can never after that turn it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Westminster.</hi> Because there was once a time Mr. <hi>D.</hi> had not a Clap, therefore Mr. <hi>D.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cannot get a Clap to spoil his Evidence. Because once upon a time there was a Poet that wrote an Elegy on the Usurper <hi>O. C.</hi> therefore the same Poet cannot prove Loyal, and write <hi>Absolon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel;</hi> or because one fidled once to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the said man afterwards cannot turn <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Observator. Tempora mutantur</hi>—And because some persons at some time Swear truly and sincerely, therefore the same persons may not be tamper'd with and prevail'd upon at some other time to be Perjur'd. Certainly the Learned <hi>Observator</hi> would have all men to be as much out of their Sences, as he is out in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to draw Conclusions, that they who will not believe these men for credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, whom the Parliament once represented for such, arraign the Parliament. Sure he thinks all the world fools to be thus ridiculously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon.</p>

                     <p>I know he complains foully, <hi>Num.</hi> 78. <hi>What a thing it is to see one Gospelling it in the Pulpit one day and Buffooning it in a</hi> Comus <hi>and</hi> Momus <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. To see the same person acting</hi> Christ <hi>upon his Throne to his Congregation in a Conventicle, and Mimic on the Stage to the Multitude, in a Libellous Courant. To see a Teacher of the Gentiles go recking from the Stews to the Holy Table, and at the same time declaiming against Sensuality and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Are not these good and Pious Sayings?</p>

                     <p>It would do well to collect them for the assentors sayings: but where's the hurt of all this?</p>

                     <p>None at all; But he secretly would wound the Dissenting Ministers, as guilty of this; some of which he supposes write the <hi>Protestant Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi> and the <hi>Courant.</hi> But we know the man is no Witch, he may be mistaken in his blind <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,</hi> as well as his friend <hi>Gadbury</hi> in the Stars, and in his Prognosticks; though he brags they can hardly piss but he knows it, <hi>and has the History of all their Haunts, Practices, Consults, and all the little accidents,</hi> 78.</p>

                     <p>Nay he is down-right I assure you, and loves to speak plain.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>He speaks plain enough, but it would be well if he spoke truth too: but he is for plain downright lying and accusing. <hi>They</hi> (says he, <hi>Numb.</hi> 78. meaning the <hi>Dissenters</hi>) <hi>have already assassinated one Protestant Prince, and involved 3 Kingdoms in Bloud, Sacriledge and Confusion; and they are now contriving the same over again, by a more audacious and Diabolical Association.</hi> This is an high Charge.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>N.</speaker>
                     <p>But he tells you, that they are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> neither <hi>Protestants</hi> nor <hi>Papists,</hi> that take upon them the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and brand all the Sons and Servants of the Government (such as himself) for <hi>Papists.</hi> These are the only men he speaks against, that have made an Association and Confederacy.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>And let him in Gods Name: but he should do more than write or speak against such, for he should bring them forth, and shew their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons to the world, that Justice might be done on them, and not by his Caterwauling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make us believe all the Dissenters are such kind of persons, and enter'd into an Hellish Plot, and Association against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

                     <p>If you would have let him alone, he would have shewn you the particular persons one by one: they say Mr. <hi>Somebody</hi> has a list of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the <hi>Ignoramus Iurys</hi> spoyl'd the sport; and the folly of the <hi>Tories</hi> in overdoing, has quite undone the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot. But do you think, that he who will translate out of <hi>French,</hi> an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Protestants,</hi> and justifie their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will be so wicked to undermine them, and make them guilty of Plots, when innocent?</p>

                     <speaker>S.</speaker>
                     <p>He can do more than that, when in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science he believes no such thing.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> says, <hi>Numb.</hi> 79. <hi>There is no</hi> Protestant <hi>Plot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but indeed that there is a</hi> Phanatic <hi>Plot; but they are no</hi> Protestants <hi>no more than a</hi> Turk, <hi>who puts forth</hi> English <hi>Colours is a</hi> Christian.</p>

                     <p>But who are these he calls <hi>Phanatics?</hi> He tells you in several places, they are the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> are only those of the Church of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> so that 'tis clear, all <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are Plotters against the Government, false Christians, or Hereticks, and so according to the <hi>Tory</hi> Principle, may be lawfully knockt on the Head, or swore out of their Lives, or any way put out of the way.</p>
