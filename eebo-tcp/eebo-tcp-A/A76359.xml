         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>eſts or Atheiſts as you liſt) who have made bold to impugne ſo notour a Truth, either out of a curious affectation in croſing the common ſentiment to be reputed ſingular, or elſe from an Judicial blindneſs and caſe-hardneſs of Spirit, in being given over to a Reprobat ſenſe (by gain-ſtanding the Truth) to receive a lie, whoſe caſe is more to be pitied than imitated, and their blinded Judgment more to be ſpurned at, and to be rejected with ſcorn, than kindly and amicably to be embraced.</p>
            <p>For if there be no Spirits, then (not to ſpeak of a multitude of vile abſurdities, and groſs horrid Blaſphemies, that would natively follow therupon) there is no Eternal Death, Life, nor Reſurrection to be expected, nor any Locall place of Puniſhment for the Damned to be Tormented in, by the inſtruments of His Wrath, in the execution of Juſtice upon unrepenting Sinners, nor any Heavenly Joy and Solace to be expected by the truly Godly after this Life; which were manifeſtly to Raze two of the moſt Glorious and Divine

Attributes of God both at once. For 1st, How can the glory of His rich mercy appear to the Elect, but by a declaration of the Glory of His ſevere and deſerved Juſtice towards the Reprobat. 2ly, For what end is conviction of Sin both in the good and bad, if it be not to Reclaim the one in undeſerved Mercy for Obtemperating, and to Reprobat the other in deſerved Juſtice, for declining and not harkening unto the Heavenly, and Divine Call. 3ly, Whence pray are theſe inward frights, and terrours of a troubled Conſcience, bred in the ſtouteſt Atheiſt, either upon their departure forth of the World: or while they be going forward in a full Benſile and carier of all imaginary wickedneſs, and be in health and ſoundneſs both in Body and Mind, that a quick ſtop and diſcharge is put thereto, by a ſudden roaring of an allarmed and awakned Conſcience; whereby ſometime ſooner, ſometime later, an inrood hath been made upon the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by an immediat, ſupream, and irreſiſtable Divine power, to the recovery and reclaiming of not a few, to the praiſe and glorious manifeſtation of the ineffable riches of his grace towards the poor loſt Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> witneſs hereunto the joynt teſtimony of the Elect of God through all ages of the World, the Heavenly Quier of Angels, and the glorious company of the triumphant Saints.</p>
            <p>Hence then it appears, by undenyable evidence, and by a perpetual chain of Divine Providence (whatever the groſly prophane brag in the contrair) that what vain thoughts ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Sons of men may idlely entertain in the heat of luſt, and youth, anent the falſhood and vanity of ſuch doting and fanciefull opinions (as they in their joylie and merrie fits be pleaſed to term them) they ſhall ſooner, or later, feel the teſtimony of their Conſcience as a witneſs within them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them ſeriouſly to comply with the truth of what they formerly mocked at in the days of their vanity; when at the laſt hour they ſhall be either tryſted with inexpreſſible fears, Terrours, and Agonies, of a troubled mind for their paſt life, by way of conviction and condemnation; or with unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, peace, and compoſour of Conſcience, upon a ſealed pardon and abſolution, to their eternall and unſpeakable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and ſolace both here and hereafter.</p>

So that they were to them as the Prophets of old were to the Iſrael of God, the time of that ignorance God winking at; but why they ſhould be tryſted now (in the Meridian Sun-ſhin of Goſpel-Ordinances,) with the ſame faith, and belief, (God now calling all men every where to repent, and turn from their former evil way, to walk in newneſs of Life, and to conform themſelves to the example of His Son, whom he hath ſent into the World, to deſtroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.8.) is (without all controverſie) juſtly aſtoniſhing, and ſurpriſing.</p>

Divination and Witchcraft, with all that has, or any manner of way may relate thereto is expreſly forbidden in the Law of the Lord <note n="p" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11, 12.</note> which is ſummarily compriſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.18.</p>
            <p>As to the reaſons, why Satan ſo far unmasks himſelf at this time, by ſo palpable and legible diſcovery of ſuch as be in League and Covenant with himſelf; We ſhall ſhortly ſum them up as follows, 1ſt, It may flow from the multitude of Witches, that may poſſibly be abounding amongſt us, and Satans being willing to have ſuch cut off in time, leaſt by a preached Goſpel, ſome be gained. 2ly, It may flow from ſome whited Profeſſors of the truth, being engaged in his ſervice, and his ſpite to the Goſpel, that the immaculate truth might be ſcandaliz'd through them. 3ly, We ſay, that the ſhew of the Tormentors, to the tormented, in bodily ſort, may be one of Satans Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, whereby he may be afterward enabled, the better to cut off the innocent with the nocent, it being eaſie for him who is the arch Deceiver and Maſter-peice of all craft, to make the innocent Lambs of God appear in ſhow among his own Wolves: although with this remarkable difference, that all the powers of darkneſs, be no way able to make ſuch pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable diſcovery herein, by the tormenteds laying hold on their garments, as they readily do on the others: which verifies that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He that keepeth Iſrael, neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> For the preſence of the one is meerly Phantaſtical, and the other more real, &amp; while as they be not ſeen to all by-ſtanders out to the tormented only, you muſt know that it's a eaſie thing for Satan to open the eyes of one, and reſtrain the ſight of another.</p>
            <p>Now that we may draw to a cloſe, we ſhall in the next place give you ſome vive and ſhrewd marks, or ſome evident and probable tokens, whereby a Witch, or ſuch as have made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs League and Compact with the Devil, may be decerned from all others.</p>
            <p>The firſt whereof, is the inſenſible or dead nip of a blea co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſomewhat hard, and withall inſenſible, which for that it's known to many, I ſhall not inſiſt much on it, only give me leave to ſay, that what way ſo ever, whither by accident, or otherways, ſuch inſenſible marks be in the body, yet no ſuch mark as theirs every circumſtance conſidered, is to be found with any others but themſelves, neither can ignorance how they come by it, or their getting of it when infant from their
<pb facs="tcp:170999:8"/>
nurce, plead any excuſe, it being no way probable that a Witch can have any ſuch power from the Devil.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> mark is, that ſuch can by no means be drowned, tho' tyed hand &amp; foot together, &amp; thrown into a River; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps either for that they be deſtinat for another Element, or els for that they having renunced Baptiſm, the external Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſign whereof is water, they be rejected and ſpurned againſt by this Element, by a Divine Deſtination and a ſecret fence and Arreiſt of a ſupream overruling Providence, which contrair to a common Courſe of Nature, hath put a ſtop to that light and fluide Body of Water, whereby it by no means can receive into it the Body of a Witch, tho' in its ſelf gravanimous and heavie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Mark is, that there can nothing befall them in time, (how heavie and afflicting ſoever) no not though the torture it ſelf were made uſe of,) draw from them the leaſt tear, though to that end they often diſtort, throw, and wring their faces, making as tho' they were weeping, which is the more remarkable, eſpecially in Women, for that ſuch ordinarily carrie a bowl of tears in their head, which in Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadell form they can let fall, upon very ſlight and momentuous occaſion: God by ſpecial Providence denying them tears, the ordinary conſequent and external ſign of Repentance, to whom he hath denyed the internal Grace, altho' it cannot be denyed but that the wicked may ſeek a bleſſing, as did the prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> with tears, hence you ſee upon what account tears be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to Witches altho' not to other Reprobates, for tho' theſe be in ſome ſenſe at an agreement with Satan, Sin, and Hell, yet is their Covenant and League not ſo expreſs, as is the League and Covenant of the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Mark is, the Balſilisk, or Serpentine ſight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they be endued to kill, poyſon, and deſtroy, what, and whenſoever they pleaſe, were it not that a Divine overruling providence doth often reſtrain and curb them, which ſight is in them above all other men and women in the world moſt remarkable, for while as in the Aple of the Eye there is to be ſeen in all and every one, the Image of a man (commonly called the babe in the eye) with the head up and the feet down; the quite contrair is to be ſeen in them, to wit, the feet up, and the head down; God as it were hereby making open ſhow
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170999:9"/>
to the World, that He who keepeth His own as the Apple of the eye, taketh no ſuch thought for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Slaves of Satan, but ſuffers the Devil whoſe Image they bear thus (by inverſion) as an external Sign) to portray his Image in them, upon which account a Witch whither Man or Woman will not look on fixedly or ſtedfaſtly in the face, namely, if they be adverting.</p>
            <p>In the original Hebrew this Image in the Eye is called ISHON, the little man, or the black of the Eye Or elſe it is called Bath or Babath the Apple of the Eye, or the Daughter of the Eye <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth which be made mention of by the Pſalmiſt David, <note n="q" place="bottom">Pſal 17.8.</note> while as in other places one only of the ſaid words be uſed as ISHON the little Man of Black of the Eye <note n="r" place="bottom">Deut. 32.10. Prov. 7.2.</note> Babath or Bath the Apple of the Eye, or the Daughter <note n="ſ" place="bottom">Lam. 2.18. Zech, 2.8.</note> the Black being the only Organ of fight, and the Apple of the Eye the Daughter as it were of that Organ for Bath or Babath ſignifies a Daughter, as ſaid is, and it ſerves for a munition and defence to ISHON the little Man or Black of the Eye, the true Organ of ſight; from hence is it that the Compariſon is drawn of Gods defending and keeping his People as the Black or Apple of the Eye, while as of Satans imps he hath no ſuch care, as ſaid is.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Mark is, that a Witch will by no means be perſwaded to repeat, the heads of the Chriſtian Religion, as they be ſummarly comprehended in the Decalogue, Lords Prayer, and Belief, but with ſevera minckings, eikings, or inverſions, which is certainly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth the marking; nor can their Ignorance, or Baſhfulneſs, plead any excuſe, for whether it be before a multitude, or a fewer number, they will neither of themſelves, nor by following another, by any means be engaged to repeat the Words in Form and Order as they are.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Mark is, That if you put any great or groſs Salt in the Pipe of a Kye, and put all into the Fire, upon hearing the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tackling, and ſeeing the blewiſh low thereof, which is like that of Brimſtone, inſtantly they ſhall let go their Urine; but whither this flows from an inward paſſion and ſtupifaction of mind, that upon hearing the crackling, and ſeeing the Blewiſh Low foreſaid they be brought to remember the horrible noiſe and Sulphurious burning that is abiding them in Hell, at the Judgment of the great Day, when Soul and Body ſhall be joyned together in one, and for ever and ever made lyable to the Wrath of the Everliving God, or on what other account as yet I know not, however as I am duely informed the mark is no leſs true than ſtrange.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There are not wanting ſome who be bold to averr, that a Witch may be known from a peculiar ſent or ſmell, which is to be found in them, beſide all other People in the World, and which neither flows from the neſtineſs of Cloaths, Vermine, or the like, but a contradiſtinct ſmell from any ſuch thing, which may ſeem the more probable for that the five Senſes being the Doors of the Soul where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what is within is ordinarly diſcloſed, and the Devil being in full Poſſeſſion of their Soul, muſt needs emitte his own ſent even that of the Pit.</p>
            <p>Now from what is ſaid, it plainly appears, how watchfull and circumſpect we ought to be, that we be not carried about with every wind of Doctrine, either to gainſtand the Truth, or receive a lie, in this ſo guileful and perverſe an Age, wherein notwithſtanding of the manifold opportunities of Grace, Sin hath the aſcendent over us, hence Impiety &amp; Tranſgreſſion of all kind, doth flow down as a mighty ſtream, to the great Scandal of our holy Profeſſion, few giving themſelves to the Exerciſe and Practice of Godlineſs, or bringing forth the Fruits thereof in newneſs of Life: Hence is it that Satan ſo mightily prevails amongſt us, and ſtill is like to do, except we ſet our ſelves againſt his Wiles, and wicked Devices, by an Holy and tender Walk, in all Humility and Godly Fear, putting on the Spiritual Armour, whereby we ſhall be enabled to quench all the fiery Darts of the Devil.</p>
            <p>For this end let us beg from the Hand of our God, who is a liberal Giver, quickning and ſupporting Grace, in time of need, and to learn from the fall of others, that our ſtanding is not in our ſelves, but in the free mercy and ſupporting Grace of God, who by a continual watching Eye of Providence, preſerves us every moment, which is the only cauſe, why we are not conſumed long ere now, unto whom let us in all Humility recommend our ſelves for Direction and Protection, that we may be ſafe and ſecure, while we be travellours of hope, paſſing through this vale of miſery towards our end in eternal Felicity, where we ſhall be ever with the Lord, World without end, Amen.</p>
