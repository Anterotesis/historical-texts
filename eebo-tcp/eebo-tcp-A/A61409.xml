         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE following Sermons were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above a Year ago to a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>London,</hi> and since tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
partly from some brief <hi>Notes</hi> I had
reserv'd in my Study, and partly from the
Prints of some remaining <hi>Ideas</hi> not quite
worn off my Memory; while new Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Meditations (here and there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd)
supplied the place of those which
Time and other Thoughts had effac'd.</p>
            <p>This was done to gratify a worthy <hi>Friend,</hi>
who as he was not displeas'd in hearing
them, so was desirous to read 'em too: And
after that, would not be denied the Liberty
of making 'em publick.</p>
            <p>I hope it will not be thought that I have
treated on God's Relation to Man as his
<hi>Creator,</hi> in the first Sermon, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
too abstracted and <hi>Philosophical</hi> for a
practical Discourse, when 'tis considered
that we live in an Age wherein some Men
will hearken to no other kind of Arguments;
and wherein the Minds of others can't be
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:51029:3"/>
too well fortified against the Contagion of
<hi>Atheism;</hi> especially seeing I have taken up
but a few Pages in pursuing that Vein of
reasoning, the greatest part of which has
been added in transcribing.</p>
            <p>What is advanc'd in these Discourses I
have labour'd to sustain both by <hi>Scripture</hi>
and <hi>Reason;</hi> and endeavour'd to speak to the
<hi>Understandings</hi> as well as to the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of my <hi>Auditors,</hi> and now of my <hi>Readers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who apply themselves with serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and attention to the <hi>reading</hi> of them,
(I hope) will not think their Time and
Labour entirely lost: I'm sure I shall not
repent mine in <hi>composing</hi> 'em, if it shall
please God to make 'em the means of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi>
one <hi>Sinner from the error of his
Way;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 20.</note> and so <hi>of saving a Soul from
Death, and of hiding a multitude of
Sins.</hi> To which great End that they may
succeed, I humbly commit 'em to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his <hi>Providence,</hi> and to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> with my earnest Wishes
and Prayers.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>ECCLES. xii. 1.</bibl>
                  <q>Remember now thy Creator in the Days
of thy Youth, while the Evil Days
come not, nor the Years draw nigh
when thou shalt say, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in them.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HOW much soever the Thoughts
of Youth are busied with the
amusing Entertainment of the
many sensible Objects that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost
'em, and thereby render'd unapt for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51029:4"/>
serious Reflections on the Vanity of the
World, and on the Excellency and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of a Spiritual and Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
Yet one would think, when
<hi>Reason, Experience</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> all
conspire to bespeak their Attention, (as
they do in our Text, and indeed in this
whole Book) it might reasonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that many would have the Justice
or Prudence, or at least the Curiosity, to
give three such Monitors a hearing.</p>
               <p>When a Prince excelling all other Men
in Wisdom, and other Monarchs in
Wealth and Splendor, has so much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for Mankind as to turn a <hi>Preacher;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 1.</note>
Who would not be ambitions to become
his <hi>Auditor?</hi> The News of his Wisdom
and Grandeur drew the Queen of <hi>Sheba
from the utmost parts of the Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 10.</note> to
become an immediate and admiring Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of what she had before, at a distance,
and but imperfectly heard (Fame it self,
which uses so mightily to inhance the
Glory of other Princes, having, it seems,
detracted from his, which so far exceeded
the common Standard, that its Lustre
was lessen'd by those <hi>Encomiums</hi> which
might have been justly counted strain'd
<hi>Hyperboles,</hi> when applied to others.)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51029:4"/>
Who would not then, at least, so far imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
that Generous Princess, as to recollect
his roving Thoughts <hi>from the ends of the
Earth,</hi> whither they are prone to wander,
to fix them on a Subject, which the Great
and Wise <hi>Solomon</hi> recommends to Youth
with the greatest Advantage of Reason,
and Strength of Argument? Curiosity
(if no other Consideration should) would
undoubtedly prompt many to desire, with
the <hi>Queen of the South,</hi> to hear his Wise
Speeches, (if he were now alive) and to
undergo the Charge and Fatigue of a long
Journey to that end. Ought we not then
to put a High Value on his Writings,
wherein we have that very Sense, which
so much astonished his Hearers, when he
spake to them; and <hi>by which</hi> (as 'tis said
of <hi>Abel) being Dead,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note> he yet speaks to us?</hi>
Nor have we need to traverse the Mighty
Waters to hear him, or to say (as <hi>Moses</hi>
speaks concerning the Law) <hi>Who shall
go over the Sea for us,<note place="margin">Deu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 30. 13, 14.</note> and bring his
Words to us, that we may hear them and
do them?</hi> seeing they are so very <hi>near</hi> us
in the Divine Treatises he has written.</p>
               <p>And as his extraordinary Knowledg pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
us much, so his large Experience may
justly raise our Expectation still higher.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51029:5"/>
This makes a Man speak both more feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and with more Demonstration.
Besides, 'tis not only the Experience of a
Man endow'd with a vast Stock of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and good Sense, who, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
was able to make very curious and
exact Remarks on the Event of Things;
but of one, who by the Advantage of
his elevated Station in the World, and of
his Immense Riches, was also capable of
furnishing himself with whatever the
World could yield,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 4-10.</note> or his large Curiosity
desire. And tho it was his great Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and Sin <hi>to give his Heart to know
Madness and Folly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 17.</note> after that criminal
manner he confesses he did:<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 1, 3, &amp;c.</note> Yet even this
may make way for his Advice; since he
that here decries a loose and sensual, and
commends a strict and vertuous course of
Life, is one, who had thorowly try'd
what Pleasures the World could afford;
and upon a just Estimate pronounces
them all, not only <hi>Vanity,</hi> but <hi>Vexation
of Spirit,</hi> at the beginning of this Book;
and at the latter end of it,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 13.</note> from his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
Experience of the Worth and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Religious Life, recommends it
as the only way to Happiness. So that
since these Thoughts are the Result, not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51029:5"/>
only of his Speculation, but of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
too, and that an Experience so
dearly bought, at the Expence of so much
Thought and Invention, (unhappily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in <hi>making Provision for the Flesh
to fulfil the Lusts thereof</hi>) of so much
Time and Treasure,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> and (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more) at the Expence of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
and Peace of Conscience, and
this with the great and apparent hazard
of his Soul; How much does it behove
those that are Young to become Wise at
his Cost, and to attend to the Testimony
of his Experience, as well as to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Reason?</p>
               <p>But we have not only the Wisest Man
in the World giving us Rules in a matter
of the greatest Weight, and confirming
them with the <hi>Probatum est</hi> of a very
large and long Experience; for, <hi>behold,
a Greater than</hi> Solomon <hi>is here.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 42</note> The <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of Men wrote</hi> this Book; but the
<hi>Spirit of Wisdom inspired it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> If then all
the advantageous Characters of <hi>Solomon</hi>
should not much influence the Minds of
Young Persons to regard his Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet the Authority of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
himself, whose Dictates these original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are, lays a strict Obligation on them to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51029:6"/>
observe 'em, as his own Divine <hi>Counsels,</hi>
with a Religious Zeal, and to respect 'em
as his <hi>Precepts,</hi> with an awful Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>To form in our Minds a just Idea of
the general Drift and Design of this
Book, 'tis proper to observe, That as 'tis
natural for Man to seek to be Happy, and
therefore the Philosophers of all Ages,
and of all Nations, have given Rules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Sense of Things, for the
obtaining this great End; We have <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
(a very Philosophical Prince, and
who of all others deserves best to be
term'd <hi>the Prince of Philosophers</hi>) giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Book the History of himself,
with respect to the Method he took in the
pursuit of Happiness; recounting to us his
false Steps for our warning; and at last
making both the End and Duty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Man, to consist in the Service
and Fear of God: All which seems to
be compriz'd in the Close of this Book,
in those Words,<note place="margin">Chap. 12. ver. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us hear the Conclusion
of the whole Matter, Fear God, and keep his
Commandments, for this is the whole Duty
of Man:</hi> (For if we leave out the word
<hi>[Duty]</hi> which is not found in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51029:6"/>
more Scope is given to the Words,
<hi>[This is the whole of Man] q. d.</hi> his whole
Duty, End and Interest.) And while he
is looking back with Regret on the Loss
of his own Time, and with a Penitential
Sorrow reflects on the Sins of his Youth,
he earnestly admonishes others to beware
in Time of the Rock on which he split,
to be warn'd of taking a <hi>wrong</hi> Course
by his Fall, to be perswaded to take a
<hi>right</hi> one by his Repentance; and, as an
excellent Mean conducing to both their
present and future Happiness, to devote
themselves, as soon as possible, to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, or (in the Words of our

Days of their Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our better understanding of which
Words, Order directs us to take notice of
those in the two last Verses of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Chapter, on which they have an
immediate Dependance; where the Wise
Man seems to obviate an Objection, which
some, especially those whose youthful
Heat prompts 'em to pursue the Pleasures
of the World, would raise against his
past Discourse, which so much depretiates
'em: If such should say, his Morals are
too severe, he answers them, Chap. 11.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51029:7"/>
                  <hi>v. 9. Rejoice, O Young Man in thy Youth,
and let thy Heart chear thee in the Days of
thy Youth; and walk in the ways of thy
Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes:</hi>
Which (according to some) is a Concession
of a moderate use of Worldly Pleasures,
and may be thus paraphras'd. <q>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
not (O Young Man) that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make it a Crime for thee to be
Chearful in the use of the good Things
of this Life, which the Providence of
God allots thee: No—Gratify the
Desires of thy Heart, and entertain
thy Eyes and other Senses with variety
of pleasant Objects, provided a due
Moderation be observ'd in all these
Things, so that thou <hi>use,<note place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

'em;</hi> for an Account of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of them must be render'd
before the just Tribunal of the Alimigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
I do not bid thee renounce the Joys
and Comforts of this Life,</q> 
                  <hi>[But know
thou, that for all these Things God will
bring thee into Iudgment.]</hi> 
                  <q>I therefore
caution thee of the Danger of being
insnar'd by an Inordinate Desire of
them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Others interpret these Words as an <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Permission,</hi> whereby the Absurdity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51029:7"/>
of the wild Maxims, and extravagant
Sayings, with which Young Persons are
wont to encourage themselves and others
to persist in a vicious Course, are expos'd;
and a serious Caution thereupon subjoin'd.
<q>Youth (say they) is the Time of Life
most fitted for Pleasure and Joy, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are then most lively and impressible;
and as a multitude of charming Objects
are continually inviting us, so our own
Inclinations are prompting us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
'em. Now therefore is the Time
for us to abandon our Selves to Mirth
and Pleasure.</q> Well (says <hi>Solomon) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice,
O Young Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                  <q>Take thy
own Course, give up thy self to the
Conduct of thy beloved Lusts, take thy
fill of Jollity and Pleasure; but mark
the Consequence, be assur'd that for
this Course of Life (if obstinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in) the Great and Just God will
Judg and Condemn thee to Eternal
Pains,</q> 
                  <hi>[Know thou, that for all these
Things God will bring thee into Iudgment.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which last Sense seems to me most
Genuine, not only because we have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Examples of this Ironical way of
speaking in the Holy Scripture; as that
Saying of our Blessed Saviour to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51029:8"/>
                  <hi>[Sleep on now, and take your rest]</hi>
seems to be,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 45.</note> both from the Reproof for
Sleeping,<note place="margin">v. 40, 41.</note> and Exhortation to Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which he had given 'em just before;
and from the Alarm he gives 'em, not to
indulge their Drowsiness, but to <hi>rise and
be going,</hi> (for the Reason he assigns)
just after those Words:<note place="margin">v. 45, 46.</note> And that of the
Prophet <hi>Micajah</hi> to King <hi>Ahab,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of him,<note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 15.</note> whether he should go up
against <hi>Ramoth-Gilead, [Go and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
&amp;c.] whereby he assumes the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the false Prophets; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
explains himself in express Terms
<hi>[If thou return at all in Peace,<note place="margin">v. 17, 18.</note> the Lord hath
not spoken by me.]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See also</hi> 1 Kings 18. 27.</note> Not only do such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
as these (I say) justify this Sense
of the Words last given;<note place="margin">Ezek. 28. 3, 4.</note> but that which
seems especially to make it preferable to
the former is, that those Phrases, in the
Sentence we are examining, of <hi>[Walking
in the way of one's Heart, and in the sight
of one's Eyes]</hi> can't be easily accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a moderate use of Worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
(as the former Sense supposes)
seeing 'tis evident, they are used to quite
another purpose in the Scripture, by that
Prohibition God gave the <hi>Israelites [not
to seek after their own Heart,<note place="margin">Num. 15. 39.</note> and their own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51029:8"/>
Eyes</hi>] and by the Curse <hi>Iob</hi> imprecates on
himself, [<hi>if his Heart had walked after his
Eyes</hi>] Both which shew,<note place="margin">Job 31. 7.</note> that <hi>to walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one's Heart and Eyes,</hi> is an Expression
more fairly applicable to a Dissolute and
Sinful Course of Life, than to a Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
use of Lawful Pleasures.</p>
               <p>After this Ironical Permission of Sinful
Pleasures, and the <hi>serious Premonition</hi> of
Judgment subjoin'd to it, follows a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
in these Terms, <hi>Therefore remove
Sorrow from thy Heart, and put away</hi> Evil
<hi>from thy Flesh;<note place="margin">Eccl. 11. 10.</note> for Childhood and Youth
are Vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which some will have to be a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of the <hi>Irony,</hi> and, if taken in a
proper Sense, to speak the Language of
those <hi>Libertines,</hi> who notwithstanding
what he had before said, would still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
themselves to the Pleasures of Sin.
As if he should say, <q>Cast away (as
you resolve to do) all serious Thoughts;
Fly the Occasions of Trouble and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
as much as possible; avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is ungrateful to Flesh and Blood:
for Time is fleeting; <hi>Childhood and
Youth,</hi> those Opportunities of Delight
and Pleasure, will soon <hi>vanish,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sweets they afford must be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51029:9"/>
reap'd in their Season.</q> For thus do
some Sensualists argue, for the present
and earnest pursuit of Worldly Pleasures,
from their <hi>Vanity</hi> in respect of the <hi>short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of their Continuance, which ought
rather (when their <hi>Eternal</hi> Ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
are consider'd) to take off the
edg of the Appetite toward 'em. So
the Prophet,<note place="margin">Isa. 22. 13. 1 Cor. 15. 32.</note> and after him the Apostle
introduces them arguing; <hi>Let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we shall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it seems not so likely that the Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
should be reiterated after so express
and serious a warning of Judgment, as
that in the former Verse, especially seeing
this is join'd to it by a <hi>[Therefore</hi>], as a
Conclusion founded thereupon, [<hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remove Sorrow from thy Heart,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>I should rather therefore give the
Words such a Turn as this, <hi>viz. Seeing
God will bring thee to Iudgment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Remove Sorrow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                  <q>Mix

               </p>

of which I warn thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Or else the Passion of Anger, because it
so violently agitates the Soul, may be put
for all the vitious Affections of the Mind,
and then the meaning of the Words is;
<hi>Remove all sinful Passions from thy Mind:
And put away Evil from thy Flesh;</hi>

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51029:10"/>
Or else the Sense of the Wife Man may
be to this purpose; <q>I have reason to
admonish those that are Young, of the
Evil and Danger of a Sensual Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

which are connected to those above with
a Particle, which in our Translation is

In which Words we have Three Things
to consider.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A <hi>Duty</hi> enjoin'd or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>special Time,</hi> of enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in the performance of this Duty,
prescrib'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> of it intimated.</p>
               <p>I. The <hi>Duty</hi> exhorted to, is [<hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thy Creator.</hi>]</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>special Time</hi> of engaging in
this Duty, is signify'd;</p>
               <p>1. In express Terms <hi>In the Days of
thy Youth.</hi>]</p>
               <p>2. By an opposite <hi>Periphrasis,</hi> which
contains a Description of Old Age [<hi>while
the Evil Days come not, not the Years draw
nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no Pleasure
in them</hi>] i. e. before the approach of Old
Age.</p>
               <p>III. The <hi>Reasons</hi> hereof are couch'd
and insinuated:</p>
               <p>1. In the Terms of the Duty set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, where the <hi>Relation</hi> we stand in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51029:11"/>
to God, as he is our <hi>Creator,</hi> implies the
Obligation we are under, to <hi>Remember</hi>
him, and that <hi>in our Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the Terms us'd to signify the
<hi>proper Time</hi> of this Duty; where the
fitness of the Season of <hi>Youth</hi> for entering
one's Self into the Service of God, and the
Disadvantage of deferring it to <hi>Old Age,</hi>
are suggested.</p>
               <p>Of these we shall treat severally in
their Order.</p>
               <p>I. To explain the <hi>Duty</hi> to which we
are exhorted, we shall consider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> of it, namely <hi>our
Creator;</hi> and we shall endeavour to shew
what is included in that Title here attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> it self, of <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering,</hi>
what it imports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We are first to enquire what is
included in this Title of <hi>Creator,</hi> here
attributed to God.</p>
               <p>1. It plainly and expresly declares, that
God is the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51029:11"/>
And may also include,</p>
               <p>2. That he is the <hi>Vpholder and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server</hi>
of our Being.</p>
               <p>3. That he is the <hi>Restorer and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
of Man.</p>
               <p>4. That he is the <hi>Sovereign Arbiter and
Disposer</hi> of our Being.</p>
               <p>1. God is our Creator, as he is the
<hi>Original and Author</hi> of our Being: For</p>
               <p>(1.) He created the <hi>Matter</hi> of which
we are compos'd, as well as that of all
the other Parts of the Universe. All Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of which the World consists, all that
we have any Notices of either from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
or <hi>Scripture,</hi> are either <hi>Spiritual</hi> or
<hi>Corporeal,</hi> and all these are the Works of
God. Now Man is a Creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of both these kinds of Being;
his Soul is a Spirit, and his Body is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance: And both these Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
Parts of Mankind were created by
God the Author of the whole Universe.</p>
               <p>And here we consider the Term [Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate]
in its strictest Sense, namely, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>Being</hi> to that which had none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the producing of Something out of
Nothing, <hi>i. e.</hi> without any preexistent
Matter to work upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51029:12"/>
Now it must be granted that the Soul
and Body of Man, either are from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or else had a Beginning in Time;
and if they had a Beginning, that it must
be either from themselves, or from some
other Being inferiour to God, or from
God himself.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore briefly prove, both
from Reason and Scripture, that they are
not Eternal, but had a Beginning; and
this not of themselves, nor of any
other Being but God himself; as our
Text does import, by stiling him our
Creator.</p>
               <p>1st, Our <hi>Substance</hi> is not from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
There is no plausible colour for
such a wild Conceit; seeing there are no
Characters of Eternity engraven on our
Souls, the nobler part of Man; much
less are there any Vestiges of it imprinted
on that Clay of which our Bodies are
composed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Memory</hi> we have of our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,
extends but to a very few Years;
therefore we can't pretend, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
our selves to have been from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity:
Nor has any Eternal Being <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to us that our Substance is Eternal, tho
we knew it not, or had forgotten it. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51029:12"/>
is it likely that a Being, to which Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is essential, should have so excellent
a Property as to exist Eternally, and yet
labour under so great a defect, as the
entire Oblivion of its own Eternal Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Is it to be imagin'd that if the
Minds of Men had been Eternal, there
would have been any room left for those
many New and Great <hi>Improvements</hi> of
Arts and Sciences, which have been so
often seen in the World? How could
past Eternity be so deficient, as to leave
any thing to future Invention to discover
or cultivate? Is it probable that our
<hi>Knowledg</hi> even of things much inferiour
to our selves, would be so <hi>inconsiderable</hi> as
it is, and that the vilest Insect, nay the
most despicable portion of Inanimate
Matter, should so puzzle the most Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
and Ingenious Minds, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into their Nature, if those Minds
were from Eternity? Is it not much
more reasonable to conclude, that <hi>We
are but of Yesterday,<note place="margin">Job 8. 9.</note> because we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi>
And can it be thought that a
Being that wanted no Cause for its <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi>
should need a Cause to give it
<hi>Properties</hi> far below that of <hi>Eternity?</hi>
That a Being which can't be measured by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51029:13"/>
Time, should yet be liable to so many
<hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Troubles,</hi> as we see the
Souls of Men are continually expos'd
to?</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Soul</hi> can't justly claim this
Property, how can the <hi>Body,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of dull unactive Matter, and wants
those lesser Qualities which the Soul
possesses, be imagin'd to have that
greater Excellency of Eternity, which
the Soul her self can't reasonably pretend
to?</p>
               <p>No—This is the Divine Prerogative,
and is not to be attributed to any other

               <p>For what is Eternal is Infinite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent.
Infinite in <hi>Duration;</hi> for that
which had no Cause to produce it does
necessarily exist; and that which necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Exists is infinitely Durable, and
<hi>Independent</hi> by the same Reason: And
that which is Independent, and Infinite

of God, and Incommunicable to

               <p>It therefore follows, that we had
once no Being; that our Souls and Bodies,
as well as all other Beings (except God)
had a Beginning.</p>
               <p>And if we had a Beginning,</p>
               <p>2dly, <hi>We could not be the Authors of our

can be thought on more absurd; than
that Nothing, which can't act in any

taken in this sense, is a true Maxim,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Nothing can make its No-self
to Be: But is not to be construed so as
to exempt God, whose Power is Infinite,
from being able to make a Being, which
did not Exist before. And</p>
               <p>3dly, <hi>No other Being</hi> (except God)
<hi>could make us, or any thing else, out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi>
For how can less than an Infinite
Power transport any thing from Nullity
to Existence, seeing there is an infinite
distance betwixt them? As appears, in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51029:14"/>that, if you <hi>multiply</hi> Nothing to Infinity,
it will never amount to any real Being;
and if you in thought <hi>diminish</hi> any thing
that exists to the lowest degree of Being
imaginable, you can never make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a mere Nothing? This Distance
therefore being Infinite, it must needs be
proper only to an Infinite Power, to make
that Exist which is not yet in being; as
it must needs be only the <hi>withdrawment</hi>
of that Power from supporting the Being
of a Creature, that can annihilate it.</p>
               <p>Besides, if no Being, that has had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
could give it self Existence, and
all things inferiour to God, had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
(as we have prov'd) Then no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inferiour to him could make us Exist;
for how should that, which does neither
<hi>necessarily</hi> Exist, nor could <hi>give it self a
being,</hi> be capable of giving being to any
thing else, when it wholly depends on
God for its own?</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Being</hi> simply consider'd is the
most Universal <hi>Effect,</hi> all Creatures par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of it in common; it must be
owing to the most Universal <hi>Cause,</hi> which
is no other than God himself: Therefore
he only can Create, or make that to be
which was not before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51029:14"/>
Nor have we only the Light of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in this Case; but that of Divine <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
too,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note> which assures us, that <hi>In the
Beginning God created the Heavens and the
Earth,</hi> i. e. the whole Universe. He
made the first Matter, out of which this
Curious Fabrick was built;<note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> he made the
Earth, which was without form and

out of it.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Through Faith</hi> (as well

things which are seen, were not made of
things which do appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) As God is the Author of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of which we consist: So is He also
of our <hi>Form</hi> and Composition (as well

was a vain Supposition of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that
this Frame of the World had no Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and consequently that the <hi>Species</hi>

This Fancy has been sufficiently disprov'd
by the reasons before alledg'd against the
Eternity of the first Matter of the World;
for if That be not Eternal, much less can
the Form of it be so.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Whimsey less
Absurd, which supposes, that from a

fortuitous shuffling of an Infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

this stately Frame of the World did
emerge, and that Mankind, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by such a <hi>Casual</hi> way of Generation as
this. As if Dead Matter could move

Particles could produce a Substance capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>Reasoning</hi> and <hi>Iudging, Willing</hi>
and <hi>Desiring,</hi> such as the Soul of Man is.
And what can be more absurd than to
imagine, that the Accidental Motions of
those minute Particles could frame the
Curious Structure of a humane Body;
nay the whole System of the Universe,
and every Species in it? 'Tis less unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to imagine, when one sees a
Magnificent Palace, that it was built
by the <hi>Casual</hi> jumbling together of the
Materials that compose it; or that the
most curious Watch was fram'd after
this odd manner; that an elegant Picture
may have resulted from the <hi>Accidental</hi> and

'Tis evident from the <hi>harmonious</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of the several Parts of the World,

               </p>
               <p>And this Truth is so very clear, that

that God is the <hi>Original Author of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>

So that 'tis manifest from Reason
that God has form'd us.</p>
               <p>And this the Sacred Historian of the

us make Man in our Image, after our Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so God created Man in his own Image;
in the Image of God created he him: Male

<hi>The LORD God formed Man of the Dust

the Breath of Life,<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 16.</note> and Man became a

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 100. 3.</note> 'Tis God (who is <hi>the Former

we our selves.</hi> He both made the <hi>Matter</hi>

that <hi>Form</hi> which we bear, and by
which our <hi>Species</hi> is distinguished from
those of other Creatures.</p>
               <p>(3.) God is our Creator, or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our Being, in that, as he has
fram'd the <hi>Species</hi> of Mankind in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
so he is the Former of every <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi>
Humane Creature that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World. The Multiplication of
Creatures according to their kind by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

pronounc'd on them at their Creation.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note>
But this way ordain'd by God for the
<hi>Conservation and Increase</hi> of each <hi>Species</hi>
is very Mysterious and Wonderful, and
is in the Scripture term'd Creation, and
attributed to God as such. The Psalmist
calls the Generation to come, <hi>the People
that shall be Created;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 102. 18.</note> And speaking of the

Animals,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 29, 30.</note> he says,—<hi>Thou takest away their
Breath, they die, and return to their Dust.
Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and Thou renewest the face of the
Earth.</hi> Here the Term of Creation is
used to signify the Conservation and
Multiplication of Animals in the ordinary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51029:16"/>
Course of Nature; and that (as well as
the first formation of each <hi>Species</hi>) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to the Spirit of God.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> And God
threatens the <hi>Ammonites</hi> by the Prophet
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 30.</note> to judg them <hi>in the Place where
they were Created,</hi> that is, as he explains
it in the next Words, <hi>in the Land of their
Nativity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God is the Creator in this respect,
in a sense beyond what is ordinarily
imagin'd. For it has in vain been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by Men to explain the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Laws of <hi>Motion:</hi> And so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
Difficulties meet 'em, when
they would shew how their Organs are
<hi>Mechanically</hi> form'd in Natural Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they appear impossible to be
solv'd without attributing to an Almighty
Power the Formation of every <hi>Individual</hi>
Creature (as well as of every <hi>Species</hi>)
and that in a way more <hi>Immediate,</hi> at

well founded; since that Supposition
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51029:17"/>
has been of late Years greatly discredited
by many Experiments,<note place="margin">Malpigh. de Gallis. Swainmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect. Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

very improbable, that any Plant is rais'd
without Seed by a <hi>formative Power</hi> in the
Earth, (as many have pretended) or any
Animal <hi>spontaneously</hi> produc'd without
Parents. And these God uses only as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental</hi>
or <hi>Occasional</hi> Causes, himself
being the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cause of all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
who in this respect (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
fays in another) <hi>worketh All in All;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 6.</note>
and tho' he finished the Creation in Six
days,<note place="margin">John 5. 17.</note> yet may be said to Create still, or
(as our Saviour speaks) <hi>to Work hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that it appears to be a Work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Creator of Man, to form him
in the Womb, and that after a Method
too mysterious to be trac'd by a humane
Understanding; since the Natural <hi>Laws</hi>
of <hi>Motion,</hi> at least so far as known by
Men, are not capable of producing so
Curious a Piece as a humane body: And
as it is generally supposed that the Souls
of Men are <hi>Individually</hi> form'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
into their Bodies by the hand of God,
(since no tolerable Account can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
given of their <hi>Production</hi>) so it
must be granted, that the form of each
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51029:17"/>
Individual humane Body is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the same Divine Power; which
operates after so unsearchable a manner,
that every Man may well say (not only
as to the <hi>Origin</hi> of Mankind in <hi>general,</hi>
but as to the <hi>Formation</hi> of himself in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>)
as <hi>Iob</hi> did,<note place="margin">Job. 10. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy Hands have made
me, and fashioned me round about—Thou hast
made me as the Clay:—Hast thou not pour'd
me out as Milk, and crudled me like Cheese?
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh;
and hast fenced me with bones and sinews:
Thou hast granted me Life,</hi> &amp;c. And
with the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note>—<hi>Thou hast cover'd
me in my Mother's Womb. I will praise
Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made. Marvellous are thy Works, and that
my Soul knoweth right well. My Substance
was not hid from Thee, when I was made in
Secret; and curiously wrought in the lowest
parts of the Earth. Thy Eyes did see my
Substance yet being imperfect, and in thy
Book all my Members were written, which
in Continuance were fashion'd, when as yet
there was none of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It hence follows, that God is the
<hi>Vpholder</hi> and <hi>Preserver</hi> of our Being. For
this is included in the term [Creator].
When God by the Prophet addresses
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51029:18"/>
himself to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to encourage
them to trust in him for their Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to dissipate their fears of Danger,
he speaks to them under this Title;—
<hi>Thus saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Isai. 43. 1.</note> that created Thee,
O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he that formed Thee, O</hi>
Israel, <hi>Fear not,</hi> &amp;c. And to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
he adds a Promise to preserve
'em when surrounded with the greatest
Difficulties, to be with them in passing
through the Water, and through the Fire:
And the Psalmist makes the <hi>Relation</hi> he
stood in to God, as his <hi>Creature,</hi> a plea
for his <hi>Preservation,</hi> when he says in his
Prayer—<hi>O LORD—forsake not the
Works of thy own hands.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 138. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts those
that are persecuted,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 19.</note> to <hi>commit the keeping
of their Souls to God, in well doing, as to
a faithful Creator:</hi> So that from hence
'tis evident, that the Relation God bears
to us as our Creator, includes his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Care for our Preservation:
That God who is our <hi>Maker,</hi> is also <hi>the
Preserver of Men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 7. 20.</note> As it was impossible
that we should <hi>give</hi> Being to our felves;
so 'tis beyond our power to <hi>continue</hi> our
selves in Being: And as we owe not our
<hi>Existence</hi> to any Being Inferiour to God;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51029:18"/>
so neither does the <hi>Duration</hi> of our Being
depend upon any other than him. It was
the Will of God that <hi>produc'd</hi> us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
'tis the same Will that <hi>preserves</hi>
us. Before he <hi>actually will'd</hi> our Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we could not <hi>exist;</hi> and if he should
<hi>cease to will</hi> the Continuance of our Being,
it would immediately discontinue, and
be <hi>annihilated:</hi> 'Tis but for him to
withdraw his Hand, to suspend the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of his Power, and we sink into
Nothing. So that <hi>we are kept by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God</hi> in regard of our <hi>Natural,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> as the
Apostle affirms we are in respect of our
<hi>Spiritual</hi> State: And since the Divine
Will is equally the Cause of our <hi>Being,</hi>
and of the <hi>Duration</hi> of it; the term of
Creator attributed to God in our Text,
may be fitly extended to both; our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
being a Continuation of God's
Creating Work: for in <hi>this</hi> respect (as
well as <hi>that</hi> mention'd before of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of successive Generations of Men)
according to the words of Christ, God
<hi>worketh hitherto.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 5. 17.</note> And as from him our
Being is deriv'd; so <hi>in him</hi> alone <hi>we Live,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note>
                  <hi>and Move, and have our Being</hi> still; who
<hi>upholds all things by the Word of his Power.</hi>
And not only We, but all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51029:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lean on the Almighty Hand for
their <hi>Preservation,</hi> to which they all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
owe their <hi>Existence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Term [Creator] may further
include that God is the <hi>Restorer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
of Man.</hi> 'Tis true it does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow, that, because he has
made, and preserves us, therefore, after
we had undone our selves by Sin, and
effac'd the Image of Holiness he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
on us in our Original Frame and
Constitution, he also must needs <hi>actually
Reform</hi> us: But it does thence follow,
that <hi>none but God</hi> can <hi>restore</hi> a Degenerate
Creature; and that all those, whose Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature is reform'd, derive that
Blessing from the Almighty Author of
their Being. The same Divine Goodness,
Wisdom and Power, that at the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> said, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi>
(which Operative Word produc'd Light
immediately) is necessary to illuminate
the benighted Minds of Men, who are
by Sin become <hi>the Children of Darkness;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 5.</note>
and <hi>to call them out of that Darkness into
the Marvellous Light</hi> of Divine Truth.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note>
Therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> assures us,
that it is <hi>that God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> who at first commanded
the Light to shine out of Darkness, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51029:19"/>
shines in the Hearts</hi> of such <hi>to give the
Light of the knowledg of the Glory of
God in the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> He alone,
who made all things <hi>very Good</hi> in their
kind at the Creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> and who then
<hi>made Man upright,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29.</note> is able to <hi>rectify</hi> the
perverseness of his <hi>Will,</hi> and to <hi>purify</hi>
his <hi>Heart</hi> from the Pollution it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted:
To <hi>create</hi> in him <hi>a clean Heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 10.</note>
and to renew a right Spirit within him.</hi>
Nothing less than our Creator's own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Goodness</hi> could move him to restore
deprav'd Sinners; nothing less than his
own Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> could contrive the
Method of their Restoration; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than his Divine <hi>Power</hi> could put
it in Execution, and accomplish it: He
contriv'd the <hi>Scheme</hi> of this Glorious
Work, He appointed and prepar'd the
<hi>Means,</hi> and He renders them effectual to
the <hi>End</hi> designed.</p>
               <p>Who but our Creator is able to restore
us, and reform us from Sin; seeing Sin is
a Privation of Sanctity, a <hi>Nullity</hi> oppos'd
to the <hi>Being of Holiness?</hi> Nay a state of
Sin is a state of <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God, a
State of Enmity and <hi>Opposition</hi> to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our Being; therefore worse than
Annihilation it self: because that which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51029:20"/>
                  <hi>is not,</hi> as it can do no <hi>Good,</hi> so does no

the <hi>Word</hi> of God brought us out of <hi>Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note>
and gave us Being; nothing less than
the <hi>Blood</hi> of God could avail to redeem
us from that <hi>Abyss</hi> of Iniquity and Misery
we were sunk into by our Apostacy from
Him.</p>
               <p>Who but He that <hi>establish'd the World
by his Wisdom,<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 12. and 51. 15.</note> and stretched out the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
by his Discretion and Vnderstanding,</hi>
could have form'd the <hi>Method</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation,
so as to glorify his <hi>Holiness
and Iustice,</hi> as well as his <hi>Grace and Mercy</hi>
by it; so as to make <hi>Mercy and Truth
meet together,<note place="margin">Psal. 85. 10.</note> and Righteousness and Peace
to kiss each other,</hi> as he hath done by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
fallen Man by the Sacrifice of
his only begotten Son? What Depths
of <hi>Wisdom</hi> appear in this Stupendous
<hi>Mystery of Godliness,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> God manifested in
the Flesh</hi>—That <hi>Sin</hi> should be punish'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51029:20"/>
with the utmost <hi>Severity,</hi> and yet the
<hi>Sinner</hi> spar'd by Infinite <hi>Mercy!</hi> That
our Saviour, who <hi>knew no Sin,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> should be
made Sin for us, that we might be made the
Righteousness of God in him!</hi> And the same
Characters of Divine Wisdom, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the <hi>Foundation,</hi> are seen also in
the whole <hi>Superstructure</hi> of the Church
of God, and in every part of this great
Work of Restoration.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more astonishing than
that Infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> that appears in this
Mighty Work; which can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Author than that Infinite Being that
hath created us. Who, but <hi>He that
made us,<note place="margin">Isai. 27. 11.</note> would</hi> or could <hi>have</hi> so much
<hi>Mercy on us?</hi> And who, but <hi>he that
formed us, would shew us</hi> so much <hi>Favour,</hi>
as to rescue us from Sin, and the Curses
entail'd on it, by so endearing a Ransom,
as the precious Blood of his own Son?</p>
               <p>And as none but our Maker is capable
of Redeeming us; so the <hi>frequent use</hi>
he makes of the Term [Creator] in his
Word, to encourage Men to obey him,
and to trust in him, may well be suppos'd
to intimate the Design he had fram'd to
restore Sinners to his Favour: For had
he not revealed himself to be <hi>Willing,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51029:21"/>
as well as <hi>Able,</hi> to be our Creator in this
Sense, by taking us into his Hand the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
Time to reform us, or create us
anew; there would be no room for us,
since we have all violated the Laws of
our <hi>first</hi> Creation, to hope to offer any
acceptable Service to him, or to expect
any Favour from him: There would be
no Incouragement to remember him as
our Creator in the <hi>first</hi> Sense exclusive
of this <hi>latter;</hi> because our Guilt would
fill us with Terror at every due Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him, who, as he made us for
his Glory, so is able to punish us, and
might justly do it, for the Indignities
we have offer'd him by our Sins. So
that whenever God is pleas'd to press,
or encourage us to our Duty in his
Word, by stiling Himself our Creator,
we are to consider that <hi>Title,</hi> as tacitely
including his being our <hi>Redeemer</hi> too;
that <hi>the God that made us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15.</note> is also <hi>the
Rock of our Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we find the great Work of the
Holy Spirit in Renewing and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
a Sinner is frequently term'd [Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation]
in Holy Writ;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> both to signify
the <hi>Greatness</hi> of the Work,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 15.</note> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance</hi>
this <hi>New</hi> Creation in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51029:21"/>
bears to the <hi>first;</hi> and also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note,
that both those mighty Works are
to be ascrib'd to the same Author; and
that God may be term'd our Creator,
not only in that he gave us a <hi>Being,</hi>
but also in that he often makes Sinners
become <hi>New Creatures,</hi> by <hi>Renewing them
in knowledg after his own Image;<note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> and</hi>
by <hi>Creating them in Righteousness and
true Holiness:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And 'tis worth remarking, that this

be fitly express'd by this common Name
of <hi>Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. As God is our Creator, he is the
Soveraign <hi>Arbiter,</hi> and <hi>Disposer</hi> of our
Being. He is the Soveraign Judg of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51029:22"/>
World, inflicting <hi>Punishments,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
<hi>Favours,</hi> as he pleases. He that
has made us, and preserves us, has power
to render us Happy or Miserable: He
has the Issues of Life and Death in his
Hand. He that hath created us, knows
all the Capacity we have of Joy or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
Pleasure or Pain; and has power
to affect us with either of them, as he
pleases. He can make his <hi>Arrows</hi> of
Terror <hi>stick fast</hi> in the Conscience;<note place="margin">Psal. 38. 2.</note> or
fill the Soul with <hi>unspeakable Ioy.</hi> He
can punish or chear the Mind with his
<hi>immediate</hi> Frowns or Smiles; or he can
convey Anguish or Joy into the Soul
by the <hi>Occasion</hi> of different Impressions
on the Tabernacle of Flesh and Blood
wherein she dwells: He can dispense
Punishments or Pleasures by his own
Hand <hi>immediately,</hi> or <hi>mediately</hi> by any of
his Creatures. And—<hi>when he giveth Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness,<note place="margin">Job 34. 29.</note>
who then can make Trouble? And
when he hideth his Face, who then can behold
him? whether it be done against a Nation or
against a Man only.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 6, 7, 8.</note> 'Tis <hi>the Lord</hi> (as
<hi>Hannah</hi> speaks) that <hi>killeth and maketh
alive: He bringeth down to the Grave,
and bringeth up. The Lord maketh Poor
and maketh Rich, he bringeth low and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51029:22"/>
up.</hi> Which this Holy Prophetess
proves by this Argument; <hi>For the Pillars
of the Earth are the Lord's, and he hath
set the World upon them;</hi> where his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power</hi> over Men, to dispose of
their State as he pleases, is infer'd from
his <hi>Relation</hi> to them as their Creator.
And when the Angel in the <hi>Revelation</hi>
protests <hi>there should be Time no longer;</hi>
He <hi>swears by him that created Heaven and
Earth,<note place="margin">Rev. 10. 6.</note> and Sea, and the things therein;</hi>
to shew, that God, as <hi>Creator</hi> of the
World, is the Soveraign <hi>Arbiter</hi> of it,
and that the Consummation of Time, and
of Temporal Things, belongs to him
under that Character. So that 'tis our
Maker, that both <hi>shews the Path of Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 11.</note>
and holds in his Hand the <hi>Keys of Hell
and Death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 18.</note> And as he has made all
things: So <hi>he does whatsoever he pleses
in Heaven,<note place="margin">Psal. 135. 6.</note> and in Earth, in the Sea, and
all deep places.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 10. 7.</note> And, <hi>Who can deliver out
of his hand?</hi> Seeing <hi>he doth according to
his Will in the Army of Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Inhabitants of the Earth; and
none can stay his Hand, or say unto him,
What dost Thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we endeavoured to shew
what is comprehended in God's Title
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51029:23"/>
of [Creator] on which we have taken
the greater Liberty to expatiate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hereby a solid Foundation is laid
for some of those <hi>Reasons,</hi> which we are
hereafter to insist on, to enforce the Duty
in our Text; in the <hi>Division</hi> of which we
have observ'd, that in the <hi>Terms</hi> of the
Duty (<hi>Remember thy Creator</hi>) the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of that Duty are in part insinuated.</p>
               <p>Having given some Account of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
of this Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> God, under the
Title of our <hi>Creator;</hi> We shall now</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Briefly explain the <hi>Act</hi> it self
of <hi>Remembring</hi> him, and shew what that
imports.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Memory</hi> is that Faculty of the Soul
whereby she is capable of recalling the
<hi>Ideas</hi> of things, which have before been
present to her.</p>
               <p>But here, <hi>to Remember</hi> does not only
signify the exercising of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on our Creator, by reflecting on
what our Senses, Reason, and Divine
Revelation may have suggested to our
Minds, concerning God under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:<note place="margin">Psal. 63. 6.</note> It does not here barely import
<hi>[to meditate</hi> on him,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 32.</note> and <hi>bear</hi> him <hi>in
mind]</hi> but, because the Understanding
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51029:23"/>
directs the Will and Affections, and
Men move and act very much according
to their Conceptions of things, their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi>
following the Conduct of their
<hi>Thoughts;</hi> this Term is applied both to
the one, and to the other. Sometimes
it signifies to <hi>Esteem</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Eccl. 9. 15.</note> as
<hi>Psal. 20. 3. The Lord—Remember all
thy Offerings, and accept thy burnt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
Sometimes to <hi>Trust,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 20. 7.
<hi>Some Trust in Horses, and some in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> 1 Chron. 16. ver. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note>
but we will Remember the Name of
the Lord our God.</hi> Sometimes to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
and <hi>Praise,</hi> as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 12. where
after <hi>David</hi> had exhorted to <hi>sing</hi> to God,
to <hi>glory</hi> in him, and <hi>seek</hi> him, because of
his mighty Works, he adds to the
same purpose—<hi>Remember the marvellous
Works that he hath done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> Adore
and praise him for them.</p>
               <p>And this may be further illustrated by
the use of the opposite Term of [For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting]
which sometimes signifies to
<hi>disesteem</hi> and <hi>slight,</hi> as <hi>Ier. 2. 32. Can a
Maid forget her Ornaments, or a Bride
her Attire? yet my People have forgotten
me days without Number.</hi> Sometimes to
<hi>Distrust,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 7.—<hi>That they
might set their Hope in God, and nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51029:24"/>
the Works of God:</hi> And sometimes
to <hi>neglect to praise and worship God,</hi> as
<hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 12, 13.—<hi>They sang his Praise;
they soon forgot his Works, they waited
not for his Counsel.</hi> Or to <hi>forsake the
Service</hi> of God, as <hi>Deut. 6. 12. Beware
lest thou forget the Lord,</hi> that is, by
<hi>going after other Gods,</hi> as it is explain'd
in <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>So that, to <hi>Remember</hi> God does not
only import, to <hi>think</hi> or <hi>meditate</hi> often
on him, but to <hi>think worthily</hi> and <hi>beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly</hi>
of him; and to pay him a Respect
in some measure sutable to the <hi>Idea</hi> we
have of him. To remember his glorious
Perfections so, as to <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>respect</hi>
him; deliberately to call to mind the
Number and Quality of his Favours,
and to recollect, how fit an Object of
<hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> and of all <hi>Worship,</hi>
he is; so as to engage our Souls to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in him, to offer him the Sacrifice
of Praise, and all the Adoration and
Service that we are capable of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In a word, to remember our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
is to remember his Omniscience,
Power and Justice, so as to reverence
and fear him; to remember his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Mercy and Veracity, so as to love
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51029:24"/>
and praise him; and to remember his
Holiness and Purity, so as to imitate
and obey him: 'Tis so attentively and
seriously to meditate on his Nature, and
on his Works,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 3.</note> that <hi>while we are musing,
the Fire may burn</hi> (as the Psalmist speaks)
that our Thoughts may kindle a holy
Flame of Love in our Hearts towards
him, which will break out in becoming
Acts of Service, and Obedience to his
Glory. 'Tis to serve him both with our
Understanding, Will and Affections, to
devote our selves entirely to him.</p>
               <p>And as our <hi>whole Man</hi> is to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the Service of our Creator; so
he also deserves the <hi>whole</hi> of our <hi>Time:</hi>
and we ought to begin as early as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to remember him: For this our
Text shews,</p>
               <p>II. In prescribing the <hi>special Time</hi> for
engaging in this Duty; which now falls
under our Consideration.</p>
               <p>1. 'Tis prescrib'd in express <hi>Terms</hi> [in
the days of thy Youth].</p>
               <p>2. By an opposite <hi>Circumlocution,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a Description of <hi>Old Age</hi> [while
the evil Days come not, nor the Years
draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51029:25"/>
no pleasure in them]; that is, before the
approach of Old Age:</p>
               <p>As is evident, both in that these <hi>Evil
Days,</hi> &amp;c. are opposed to the <hi>Days of
Youth;</hi> and in that many elegant <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
are used to decypher the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Miseries of <hi>Old Age,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of this Chapter, immediately after
the Text.</p>
               <p>And in this <hi>Description</hi> of <hi>Old Age,</hi>
we have</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Time</hi> it self expressed by <hi>[Days
and Years].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Character</hi> of that Time of Life,
those <hi>[Days are Evil],</hi> and those <hi>[Years</hi>
such as (we shall confess that) <hi>we have
no pleasure in them.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. For the <hi>Time</hi> it self, it may be
call'd <hi>[Days and Years];</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) Either <hi>emphatically</hi> to signify one
and the same thing; it being an usual
Elegancy in the <hi>Hebrew Dialect,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the same thing in various <hi>synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
Terms in two Sentences, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
succeeding one another, which serve
partly for <hi>Illustration,</hi> and partly to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate</hi>
Truth in the Mind: Of which
we have Instances in almost every Verse
of the 51st <hi>Psalm,</hi> as well as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51029:25"/>
places of Scripture, as 'tis easy to
observe. Or else,</p>
               <p>(2.) By <hi>[Days]</hi> to signify the <hi>Brevity</hi>
and Great <hi>Vncertainty</hi> of the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Time; (which is soon swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
up by Death, as the fleeting Days
of Youth are soon lost in Old Age) and
by <hi>[Years]</hi> the <hi>tedious passing</hi> of this short
Time, by reason of the many Afflictions
and Infirmities a Man then labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Tho' the Time is very <hi>short</hi> in it
self, 'tis made very long by Misery and
Pain, which seem greatly to extend it.
For as the Soul, when fill'd with <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
and <hi>Ioy,</hi> during her easy posture,
forgets the Time, as it were, and suffers
it to slide from her with little Notice;
which makes it appear extremely short:
So when she is fill'd with Sentiments of
<hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> her uneasy Situation,
and impatient desire of Change, do so
constantly apply her Thoughts to the
consideration of that Time, which is the
Continuance of her Misery, that it seems
very long and irksome to her: So that
the <hi>Duration</hi> of her Sorrow seems always
to increase proportionably to the <hi>Degree</hi>
of it; and a Man imagines himself
to have been much longer under an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51029:26"/>
                  <hi>acute</hi> than under a <hi>slight</hi> Pain, when
in reality the Time of their Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is equal. Thus every Moment of
Time becomes an heavy Burden to one
in Misery, who (as <hi>Moses</hi> says the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
should do, when under punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their Sins) cries out,<note place="margin">Deut 28. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>in the
Morning, Would to God it were Evening!
and in the Evening, Would to God it were
Morning!</hi>—And 'tis well known that
this is the Language of Old Age.</p>
               <p>And therefore,</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis express'd by the <hi>Character</hi> of
<hi>[Evil]</hi> Days, and Years wherein <hi>[no
pleasure]</hi> is to be had; which may be
thus explain'd.</p>
               <p>(1.) By <hi>[Evil Days]</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Decays and Diseases of Old
Age:<note place="margin">Aetas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. Plaut.</note> And by <hi>[the Years wherein there
is no Pleasure]</hi> may be signified the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
and Misery that those Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Infirmities give the Mind, these
being a great Occasion of her Sorrow,
which is then especially aggravated, when
the Guilt of the Soul conspires with the
Distempers of the Body, to make the
Man compleatly miserable; so that <hi>he
shall say,</hi> that is, he shall confess or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that, <hi>he has no Pleasure in those evil
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51029:26"/>
Days,</hi> that he has no Sanctuary of Ease
to fly to, no Reflection to make that
can allay the Trouble of his Mind, no
Medicine to use, that can remove the
Distempers of his Body. For this is
often the Condition of those,<note place="margin">Isai. 51. 13.</note> who <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the LORD their Maker</hi> in their
Youth, grow Old in the service of Sin.
Or,</p>
               <p>(2.) By <hi>[Evil Days]</hi> which is a <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Character,</hi> the Time of Old Age
may be represented, as attended with
many positive Afflictions and Pains;
and by [the <hi>Privation</hi> of Pleasure at
that Time] which is a <hi>Negative Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
may be signified the incapacity of
relishing the Joys and Pleasures of this
Life, that accompanies those unpleasant
Years, wherein the Organs of Sense are
very much enfeebled, especially when
Old Age has been hastned by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temeperance
of Youth.</p>
               <p>And now, since it appears that God as
our <hi>Creator</hi> (in the comprehensive Sense
wherein we have explain'd that Title)
requires us to <hi>remember</hi> him, so as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
our selves to his Fear and Service,
and that in the Time of our <hi>Youth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Old Age,</hi> with its many Afflictions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51029:27"/>
and Sorrows, overtakes us; if one makes
but a transient Reflection on these things,
'tis easy to observe that the Wise Man
in this Exhortation intimates,</p>
               <p>III. The <hi>Reasons</hi> of the Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd;</p>
               <p>1. In representing God, the <hi>Object</hi> of
it, to us, under the August <hi>Character</hi> of
[our <hi>Creator];</hi> which evidently entitles
him to the Service of our Youth. And</p>
               <p>2. In setting <hi>Old Age</hi> before us, as a
<hi>Scene</hi> of Misery and Horror; as a Time
made up of <hi>few and evil Days.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note> And in
opposing them to the <hi>better</hi> Days of
Youth; thereby to insinuate, that as Old
Age brings with it many great Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Impediments to obstruct
our Conversion to God; so Youth is
attended with many favourable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
that render it the best and fittest
Season to initiate one's self in the ways of
Righteousness.</p>
               <p>The strength of these Reasons I shall
consider at large hereafter: And shall
content my self at present with making
some few brief <hi>Remarks,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) On the Terms used to prescribe
the <hi>special Time</hi> of the Duty enjoin'd in
the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51029:27"/>
(2.) On the Terms, whereby both
the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of this <hi>Duty</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres'd:
To shew how fitly they are
adapted to the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of
those that are Young, who are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom this Exhortation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd;</p>
               <p>With which I shall conclude this
Discourse.</p>
               <p>1. From the Terms used to shew the
<hi>Time</hi> of remembring our Creator, it may
be observ'd;</p>
               <p>(1.) That this <hi>double</hi> Timing of the
Duty, <hi>first</hi> by expresly prescribing it [in
Youth] and <hi>then</hi> [before Old Age, with
its Miseries come on] gives the Words
a certain Force and <hi>Energy,</hi> proper to
inculcate so important an Admonition:
'Tis a giving <hi>Precept upon Precept,<note place="margin">Isai. 28. v. 10, 13.</note> and
Line upon Line,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
speaks) which he commends as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Course to instruct the Young, or (to
use his own Words) to <hi>teach them Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note>
and to make them understand Doctrine,
who are weaned from the Milk, and drawn
from the Breasts</hi>—to gain the Attention
of giddy and unthinking Youth, many
of whom,<note place="margin">Job 33. 14.</note> tho' <hi>God</hi> condescends <hi>to speak
once, yea twice,</hi> (as he doth here) are yet
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51029:28"/>
so dull of hearing, as not to perceive
the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of their Duty, or at
least not sufficiently to consider it; and
the <hi>Danger</hi> to which the neglect of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
'em. And</p>
               <p>(2.) We may further observe that
this Obligation of Remembring our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
extends it self equally with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
we have of Reflecting on God, as
our Maker; and increases proportionably
to the knowledg we may obtain of him.
So that none are entirely exempt from
it, who are capable of exercising their
Thoughts on God: and therefore those
may not pretend to be dispens'd with,
who have not arriv'd to the full maturity
of Youth, if they are in any degree ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of knowing their Creator. As far
as they are able to take notice of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of his Will, so far are they
oblig'd to worship and obey him.</p>
               <p>And this is further cleared by the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
the Wise Man seems to make,
betwixt the <hi>Duty</hi> in our Text, and the
<hi>Vanity of Childhood and Youth,</hi> mentioned
just before: So that if we take [<hi>Vanity</hi>]
here in a <hi>Moral</hi> Sense, the Exhortation
extends it self to Persons that fall under
either of those Denominations, that are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51029:28"/>
either in the state of Childhood or
Youth. And if by [<hi>Vanity] Natural</hi>
Frailty and Mortality be intended, the
words are not less extensive; for then
the frailty of Childhood and Youth, is
used as a Consideration to prepare the
way for this Admonition; and <hi>Children</hi>
as well as <hi>Young Men,</hi> are therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to give themselves to the Service of
their Creator: Because neither are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from the danger of Sickness and
of Death.</p>
               <p>And this may be further collected
from the charge given to Youth in
the Text, to remember their Creator,
not only before the Evil Days of Old Age
are <hi>come;</hi> but before those Years [<hi>draw
nigh</hi>]
while Old Age is yet at a distance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which shews that none that are capable
of reflecting on their <hi>relation</hi> to God as
Creator; may excuse themselves as too
Young to be concern'd in his Service. For
as his being our Creator, is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Duty of remembering him:
So 'tis evident, that our Obligation
to it is to be measured by the Capacity
we have of knowing him as such. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may well require that the tender
Buds of Childhood, as well as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51029:29"/>
                  <hi>Blossoms</hi> of Youth be consecrated
to him;<note place="margin">Psal. 8. 2.</note> who sometimes <hi>perfects his Praise
out of the mouths of</hi> (such who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of those of riper Years are but)
<hi>Babes,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 16.</note> and Sucklings;</hi> and therefore, by
the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psal. 148. 12, 13.</note> calls upon <hi>Young Men and
Maidens, and Children,</hi> as well as <hi>Old
Men,</hi> to praise and worship him.</p>
               <p>2. That the Terms of [<hi>Remembring
their Creator</hi>] are wisely adapted to the
state of Youth, to engage them early in
the Service of God, will appear by the
following Remarks on each of those
Terms.</p>
               <p>1. God under the Title of <hi>Creator,</hi> is
fitly recommended to the Young, as the
<hi>Object</hi> of their <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) Because 'tis a <hi>Term</hi> that easily
excites in the Mind a strong and clear
<hi>Idea</hi> of God's infinite <hi>Power, Wisdom</hi>
and <hi>Goodness.</hi> And the Wise Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to do with Youth, whose <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
for want of Years, and whose
<hi>unattention,</hi> for want of a habit of steady
thinking, renders them less capable of
arriving at the knoledg of <hi>the Deep
things of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> than those who to the
advantage of a long observation of things
have added that of addicting themselves
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51029:29"/>
to frequent Thoughtfulness and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he makes use of that Title of God,
which might most familiarly suggest a
proper Notion of him to their Minds.
He exposes to them the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of the
Creation, out of which even Children
may easily learn to spell the Being of
a <hi>Deity.</hi> The Ignorant and the Young,
even <hi>those that run,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 2.</note> (as the Prophet
speaks) the heedless and unattentive,
<hi>may read</hi> the <hi>Characters</hi> of the Divine
Attributes, which are plainly engraven
on the Pillars even of this <hi>Material</hi>
World. And (as the Apostle observes)
may <hi>clearly discern the Eternal Power and
Godhead</hi> of the Creator,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20, 21.</note> who is <hi>Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
by the curious Fabrick of this <hi>Visible
Creation;</hi> so as to render them altogether
<hi>inexcusable,</hi> if they neglect to glorisy
God according to those sensible notices of
him, which they may so easily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
receive.</p>
               <p>For as the sight of a Magnificent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
induces us to consider the Skill and
Ability of the <hi>Architect</hi> that built it:
So when we take a serious prospect of
the Structure and Frame of the World,
or of any part of it, it familiarly raises
our Thoughts to its Great <hi>Author</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51029:30"/>
Cause: For as <hi>every House is built by
some Man;</hi> so 'tis natural to conclude
(with the Apostle) that <hi>he that built all
things is God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 4.</note> And therefore</p>
               <p>(2.) This [of Creator] is a Title
which God is usually pleas'd to assume
in Scripture, to distinguish himself, as
the <hi>True and Living God,</hi> from the Idols
of the Heathen; and to convince their
Ignorant <hi>Votaries,</hi> that He is the only
proper <hi>Object</hi> of Religious Worship.—
<hi>The LORD is the True God</hi> (saith the
Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>);<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>he is the Living God,
and an everlasting King.—The Gods that
have not made the Heavens and the Earth,<note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note>
even they shall perish from the Earth, and
from under these Heavens.</hi> (Then speaking
again of the True God,<note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> he says) <hi>He hath
made the Earth by his Power; he hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the World by his Wisdom, and hath
stretched out the Heavens by his Discretion.</hi>
And then,<note place="margin">V. 14, 15.</note> having spoken of the Vanity of
Idols, he adds;<note place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Portion of</hi> Jacob <hi>is not
like them; for he is the Former of all things.</hi>
And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> introduces the
God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 45. 12.</note> proving himself to be the
True God, under the same <hi>Character. I
have made the Earth, and created Man
upon it: I, even my Hands have stretched
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51029:30"/>
out the Heavens, and all their Host have I
commanded.</hi> And, a little after, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
insults over the makers of Idols,<note place="margin">V. 16, 17.</note> and
then adds, <hi>Thus saith the LORD,<note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> that
Created the Heavens, God himself, that
formed the Earth and made it, he hath
established it, he created it not in vain, he
formed it to be inhabited, I am the L O R D,
and there is none else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which serves to shew how properly
this Title [of <hi>Creator</hi>] is used in our
Text, to direct the Minds of Youth to
the true <hi>Object</hi> of Love and Adoration;
who are ready to make as many Gods,
as there are pleasing Objects in the World;
and to sacrifice themselves, and all they
have to those inchanting Idols, that strike
their Senses with any agreeable Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And</p>
               <p>(3.) This is a <hi>Relative</hi> Title, denoting
the <hi>Natural Relation</hi> God bears to the
World: For the Terms [<hi>Creator and
Creature</hi>] mutually suppose one another:
And not only his Relation to the World
in <hi>General;</hi> but to Mankind, nay to
every <hi>Individual</hi> Humane Creature in
<hi>particular</hi> in the Word, [<hi>Thy Creator</hi>]
is propos'd as the ground of that Service
every one that comes into the World,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51029:31"/>
is oblig'd to pay to the Almighty, whose
Title of [<hi>Creator</hi>] includes our entire
dependance on him. So that the Wise
Man prudently makes choice of a Term,
expressing every Man's <hi>Relation</hi> to God
as his Creature; because 'tis the <hi>First</hi>
and most <hi>Evident</hi> Principle, on which
to found our Duty of Obedience to him,
and most apt to affect the Soul. For, as
when I think on God as <hi>Creator</hi> of the
World in <hi>General,</hi> it raises in my Mind
a great <hi>Idea</hi> of his Majesty and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty:
So when I confider him as
<hi>MY Creator,</hi> that <hi>Relative Character</hi>
gives an endearing force to the reasonable
Obligation I find my self under to serve
and worship him; because I then look
upon him, not only as <hi>the living God,</hi>
but also as <hi>the God of MY Life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 42. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We may also observe,</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Propriety</hi> of the Term [<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi>]
to express the Respect and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
those that are Young owe to their
Maker.</p>
               <p>(1.) [<hi>To remember,</hi> &amp;c.] signifying
the Exercise of the Thoughts on God, is
fitly urg'd on the Young; because as the
most early Impressions are the most deep
and lasting; so a habit of Holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51029:31"/>
is soonest acquir'd in Youth, when
the Mind is most at leisure, and not
embarrass'd with that multitude of
Thoughts and Projects about the Affairs
of the World, which riper Years are
usually incumber'd with. What fitter
Term could be chosen, by which to
urge the duty of Young Persons to their
Maker, than that of [<hi>Remembring</hi>] him?
seeing the <hi>Memory</hi> is a Faculty that
Young People commonly <hi>excel</hi> in, and
in which they often <hi>glory;</hi> a Faculty
that grows ripe betimes, and easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that <hi>Tincture,</hi> with which it is early
and thoroughly imbued. 'Tis as if
<hi>Solomon</hi> had said; You that are Young,
ought to season your <hi>Memories</hi> with the
best Impressions betimes, when they are
most capable both of <hi>receiving</hi> 'em, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
'em; and to <hi>fill</hi> your Minds with
the thoughts of God, and of the Service
you owe him, before they are <hi>crowded</hi>
with the Concerns and Business of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
World.</p>
               <p>(2.) A <hi>Caution</hi> seems to be wisely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
in this Term against forgetting
the Worship and Service of God, which
heedless Youth too much devoted to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Pleasure, is often guilty of; for tho'
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51029:32"/>
the Young have the most capable <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
yet they are very prone to <hi>forget</hi> their
Duty to their Maker. And how aptly
so ever they <hi>remember</hi> other things, they
often live as if <hi>God</hi> were <hi>not in any of
their Thoughts:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 10. 4.</note> For they commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and dissipate their Minds so much
with the amusing Pleasures of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World, that they don't allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
time enough, either to look <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
to remember that God who <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
'em, and to whom they owe their
<hi>Preservation;</hi> nor <hi>forward,</hi> to consider,
that 'tis only in his power to <hi>renew</hi> and
<hi>reform</hi> them from their Vices and Errors;
and that he will one day <hi>judg</hi> them;
who as he is their Creator, has the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
disposal of their <hi>Being,</hi> and has
Power either to save, or to destroy: In
whose Favour is <hi>Life,</hi> and whose Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
is more terrible than <hi>Death.</hi>

               <p>HAVING before explain'd the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi>
in the Text, which the
<hi>Wise</hi> Man addresses to those that
are Young, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>Remember their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
in the Days of their Youth;</hi> or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51029:33"/>
themselves early to the Worship and
Service of God:</p>
               <p>We are now to consider the <hi>Reasons,</hi>
whereby this Duty is enforc'd, which
are plainly enough insinuated in the <hi>Text,</hi>
as we have before observ'd in the <hi>Division</hi>
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In the Terms of the <hi>Duty,</hi>
where our <hi>Relation</hi> to God, as our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
implies the Obligations we have to
adore and serve him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the words used to signify
the proper <hi>Time</hi> of engaging in this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz. [In the Days of Youth, before the
Evil Days of Old Age</hi> come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Where
the <hi>fitness</hi> of the time of <hi>Youth</hi> to enter
one's self into the Service of God, and
the <hi>Disadvantage</hi> of deferring it to <hi>Old
Age,</hi> are intimated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Then we shall take a view of the
<hi>Reasons</hi> that oblige us to devote our selves
to the Service of God in Youth, which
arise from the <hi>Relation</hi> that is between
him and us, as he is our <hi>Creator,</hi> and we
are his <hi>Creatures:</hi> And this in that large
and comprehensive sense we have given
of the Term [<hi>Creator,</hi>] by which we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51029:33"/>
have laid the Ground-work of our present
Reasoning.</p>
               <p>1. As God is our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Preserver,</hi>
we derive from him our <hi>Being,</hi> and the
whole <hi>Duration</hi> of it; that is, the whole
of our Time: Therefore,</p>
               <p>(1.) He has an equitable Claim to us
as long as we have a <hi>Being,</hi> and to our
<hi>Youth</hi> by consequence: 'Tis but just that
what we receive from his hand, should be
again offer'd to him; that since we live
by his <hi>Good Will,</hi> we should live to his
<hi>Glory.</hi> Can we assign any portion of our
<hi>Time,</hi> which we do not equally derive
from our <hi>Creator</hi> with the rest of it?
Why then should any of those Moments
that are allotted us by his mere Favour, be
injuriously substracted from his Service,
and abus'd to his Dishonour?</p>
               <p>The great God, whose chief End in all
he does, is his own Glory, because that is
the best and most excellent End of all,
made us, and continues our <hi>Being</hi> for his
own Pleasure and Glory. Therefore to
alienate any part of our Time from him,
is to oppose his Designs, and (as much as
in us lies) to endeavour to frustrate his
End, and sacrilegiously to rob him of his
Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:51029:34"/>
Nor do we only withhold Divine <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
from him to whom it is due, when
we neglect to employ any part of our
Time in the Service of our Creator: for
Man being a Creature that can never be
altogether idle and unactive, that part
of our Lives, or portion of our Time
which we divert from the proper end for
which it is allow'd us, is not only <hi>stolen</hi>
from God, but <hi>devoted</hi> to the service of
Sin. 'Tis to snatch away a Sacrifice from
the Altar of the True God, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to offer it to the worst of Idols.
How provoking must this needs be to that
God who is so jealous of his <hi>Glory,</hi> that
he <hi>will not give it to any other?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 42. 8.</note> Much less
will he suffer it,<note place="margin">ch. 48. 11.</note> with Impunity, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Sin, which is infinitely opposite to
his holy Nature, and which he therefore
hates with a perfect Hatred.</p>
               <p>No wonder then that he requires the
whole <hi>succession</hi> of our Time to be devoted
to himself,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> and that <hi>whether we eat or
drink, or whatever we do, we should do it to
his Glory;</hi> making that the chief end of
all our <hi>Actions,</hi> which is the end of our
<hi>Being,</hi> and of the <hi>Continuation</hi> of it.
And this seemed so highly reasonable to
the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that after a long Meditation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51029:34"/>
on the Works of the great Creator, it
influences him to a firm Resolution to
honour and worship the Author of his
<hi>Being</hi> throughout the whole course of his
<hi>Time.<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 33.</note> I will sing unto the LORD</hi> (says
he) <hi>as long as I live;<note place="margin">Ps. 146. 2.</note> I will sing praise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my God, while I have my Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>whole</hi> of our Time be the
<hi>Propriety</hi> of our <hi>Creator,</hi> not given us to
<hi>squander</hi> away as we please, but lent us
to <hi>improve</hi> to his Honour, then he may
justly claim our Youth to be dedicated to
his Service: If he is the Proprietor of the
<hi>whole</hi> of our Time (as we have prov'd he
is) in that he is our Creator, he has a
right to each <hi>part</hi> of it: If we withhold
from him the Service of our Youth, we
detain a part of our Time from him, who
has a Natural Right to the whole of it.
And that part of Time, when once elaps'd,
being irrevocable, there remains but a
part of the whole to offer; and we can
then only render to the great <hi>Author</hi> of
our Being, a defective and <hi>mutilous</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
And,</p>
               <p>(2.) As our Youth belongs to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
as a <hi>part</hi> of that Time, of which
the <hi>Summe Total</hi> is his Due, so it is his
Propriety, as it is the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51029:35"/>
Time, the <hi>succession</hi> of which we enjoy
by his mere Favour and Bounty. To be
serv'd <hi>first</hi> is considered as a Token of
Honour and Respect amongst Men; how
reasonably then does the Infinite Dignity
of our Creator, joyn'd to the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we owe him as <hi>such,</hi> claim at our
hands an humble and solemn dedication
of that part of our Time, <hi>especially</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which he <hi>first bestows,</hi> and in which
he <hi>first renders</hi> us capable of offering him
Service? The Sacred Historian of the
Creation representing the Sanctification
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as immediately succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Creation of Man, (the last of
God's Works on the last of his Working-Days)
seems to signify the Obligation
we are all under to consecrate our Youth,
the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of our Time, to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Author of our Being; and
that as the <hi>first</hi> Day our first parents liv'd
after their Creation, was especially sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
to God as an Oblation of the <hi>first-fruits</hi>
of their Time; so we their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
ought to devote our Youth to our
Maker, and to <hi>serve</hi> him, as soon as we
are capable of <hi>knowing</hi> him. Righteous
<hi>Abel</hi> pay'd an acceptable Homage to his
Creator,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 4.</note> by presenting him a Sacrifice of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51029:35"/>
the <hi>Firstlings</hi> of his Flock.<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 29.</note> And as the
<hi>first-fruits</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Land</hi> were yearly
consecrated to God as the Great Creator
and Soveraign Proprietor of it:<note place="margin">ch. 23. 19.</note> So his
Right over his Creatures was also anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
acknowledg'd,<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 2, 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> by the dedication
both of the <hi>first-born</hi> of Cattle, and of
Men to his Service. All which certainly
is written for our Instruction, and may
fairly enough be apply'd to our present
purpose: For if God has a <hi>Special</hi> Right
to the <hi>first</hi> of all we have, (as these anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Institutions seem to signify) then he
may reasonably challenge the <hi>first</hi> of our
Time, as having a peculiar Title to <hi>that</hi>
part, by the dedication of which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
we are indebted to him for
the <hi>whole;</hi> and the refusal of which is an
implicite Assertion of our Independency
on him, as if we owed only to our selves
our own <hi>Being,</hi> and our <hi>Time,</hi> which is
the duration of it.</p>
               <p>So that they think very preposterously,
who count the Time of Youth the most
unseasonable of all for the Service of God,
when 'tis evident, that if it were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to substract <hi>any</hi> part of our Time
from him (as it is not, yet) of <hi>all</hi> the
parts of it, it would be the most indecent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51029:36"/>
and disrespectful to withhold from him
<hi>this</hi> of Youth, (taken in a large sense, not
only to contain Childhood, but all the
Flower of our Time) because he not
only claims a Right to it, as 'tis a <hi>part</hi> of
our Time, the whole of which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from him; but as it is <hi>that peculiar
part</hi> of it, which ought to be dedicated
to him as an Homage, whereby we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the Obligation he has laid us
under for the <hi>whole</hi> he is pleas'd to allow
us. Nor has our Creator a more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
claim to our Youth, as his peculiar,
because 'tis the <hi>first</hi> part, than he has,</p>
               <p>(3.) Because 'tis also the <hi>Best</hi> part of
our Time, wherein the Faculties of the
<hi>Soul</hi> have ordinarily no less Gracefulness
and Vigour, than the Members of the
<hi>Body</hi> have Beauty and Strength; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are most capable of engaging in
any great Undertaking, and possess sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Advantages for the accomplishment
of it (as we shall have occasion hereafter
to shew more at large.) 'Tis then but
just, that he that made us <hi>what</hi> we <hi>are,</hi>
should have the best of <hi>what</hi> we <hi>have.</hi>
If he has a Right to <hi>all</hi> our Time in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
because we receive it all from his
hand, he has a peculiar Right to the <hi>best</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:51029:36"/>
of our Time, as that which his <hi>own</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<hi>Excellency,</hi> and his great <hi>Goodness to
us,</hi> direct us to consecrate to him, as
most proper for an Offering. Why has
our Maker ordinarily adorn'd Youth
with so many delectable Flowers, with
so much Strength and Agility of <hi>Body,</hi>
and Comeliness of <hi>Form,</hi> such a Capacity
of <hi>Memory,</hi> and Quickness of <hi>Fancy,</hi>
such a Readiness of <hi>Perception,</hi> and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity
of <hi>Spirit?</hi> Why has he crown'd
it with so many advantageous Qualities,
but to indicate by these Preparations, that
he has design'd it for a Special Sacrifice.<note place="margin">

The word used in our Text and elsewhere

our Time, our <hi>Select</hi> or <hi>Chosen</hi> Time, and
does import not only that our Creator
<hi>chooses</hi> that part of our Time for himself,

               <p>'Tis therefore to offer a great Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

him our Decrepid Age, the worst of

what he has given us, as if we could of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

Strength visibly to abate; to signify
that <hi>that</hi> part of our Time, <hi>wherein</hi> we
are most capable of serving our Maker
ought especially to be devoted to him as
the most acceptable Portion of our days.
And is it not fit that he that has <hi>made</hi> us
for <hi>himself,</hi> should have the <hi>Best</hi> of our
Service? That the strength of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
should be dedicated to him that
moulded and compos'd 'em? And that
the powers of our Souls should, in their
most flourishing and vigorous state, be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51029:37"/>
offer'd to the great Author of all our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties?
Ought not the most attentive

and eager Sallies of our <hi>Wills</hi> to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
towards him who has made us <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring</hi>

of his <hi>own</hi> Infinite <hi>Perfections,</hi> and of the

Holy Exercises of <hi>meditating</hi> on him and
<hi>aspiring</hi> after him.</p>
               <p>2. As the Notion of [<hi>Creator</hi>] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that upon the Supposition of
Man's <hi>Fall</hi> by Sin, God alone is able to
perform this mighty Work of <hi>Reforming</hi>
or <hi>New-Creating</hi> him; and as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the use of this Term in the <hi>Holy
Scripture</hi> further intimates his <hi>Willingness</hi>
so to do (as we have shewn at large
before:) This further shews the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we have to devote our Youth to his
Service. And this Consideration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51029:38"/>
and redoubles the force of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Reasons: For <hi>what is Man</hi> (fallen
Man) <hi>that God should be mindful of him?<note place="margin">Psal. 8. 4.</note>
And the Son of Man that he should visit
him?</hi> What great Grace has the great
God manifested to us, that when we
had forfeited all the Blessings to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of him, as our <hi>Creator,</hi> in rebellious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casting off that Natural Obligation we
were under to obey him, he should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make us cease to be his Creatures,
and entirely dissolve that <hi>Relation,</hi> by
forsaking the Work of his hands, or <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilating</hi>
us; nor vindicate his injur'd
Authority, by upholding our Being only
to render us miserable, and by treating us
as his Enemies rather than as the Objects
of his Favour; but on the contrary that
he should still shew respect to us as the
Works of his hands, by preserving our
Being, by exercising Patience and Long-suffering
towards us, by encompassing
us with many Temporal Favours, and
by opening and <hi>consecrating a New and
Living way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 20.</note> whereby we might return to
him, by proposing to us Terms of Peace
and Reconciliation <hi>by the Blood of the

                  <note place="margin">Col. 1. 20.</note> and by offering to <hi>renew us in the

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 23.</note> in a word, to make

us <hi>New Creatures after his own Image;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note>
that so we might be not only again inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
to those former lost Blessings, that
were naturally suited to obedient Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of that order and rank of <hi>Being</hi>
wherein God had plac'd us at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
but might have our Happiness
highly <hi>improv'd,</hi> as well as effectually <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd</hi>
by that <hi>new</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> Relation to
God through Jesus Christ, which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses
them that believe in his Name in
those unconceivable Joys which he has
merited: Upon which account our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
treats those that are thus reconcil'd
to him, not only as his <hi>Creatures</hi> but as
his <hi>Children;</hi> and since his only begotten
Son,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>whom he hath appointed Heir of all
things,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 11, 12, 13.</note> is not asham'd to call them Brethren,</hi>
he refuses not to treat 'em as <hi>Ioint-Heirs
with him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15, 16, 17.</note> nor disdains to be call'd their
Father.</p>
               <p>So that the consideration of God, as
the Author of this New and <hi>Spiritual</hi>
Creation, lays on us the strongest Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
imaginable to serve and obey him,
in that it contains both the highest <hi>Reason</hi>
and the strongest <hi>Motive</hi> of that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
For as it is very <hi>reasonable</hi> that we
should obey him that has Wisdom and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51029:39"/>
Power enough to change and reform, and
render happy such sinful, deprav'd and
miserable Creatures as we are, so 'tis
the greatest <hi>Good</hi> that can be done us, and
therefore is to be earnestly sought at the
hands of the infinitely gracious God:
and seeing he is so liberal as to offer <hi>to
give his holy Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LIuk. 11. 13.</note> the Principle of all
Grace and Spiritual Life, <hi>to them that</hi>
sincerely <hi>ask</hi> and diligently seek it of
him; here is the greatest <hi>Motive</hi> and
encouragement to engage us in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
since (I say) he is not become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable
by our Sins,<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 18.</note> but still <hi>waits to be
gracious</hi> to us,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> offering to <hi>write his Law in
our Hearts,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 10.</note> and to put his Fear into our
inward Parts</hi> by the power of his Spirit,
and also assuring us,<note place="margin">Ps. 19. 11.</note> that <hi>in keeping his
Commandments there is great Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>best</hi> part of our
Time is God's peculiar Claim as he has
<hi>made</hi> us, much more ought we to offer
the <hi>first-fruits</hi> of our Time to the Service
of him who is become <hi>reconcileable</hi> to us
in Christ Jesus, and is both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to add to the Obligation of the <hi>first,</hi>
that of a <hi>second</hi> and more Glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Surely we owe not only the <hi>first</hi>
and <hi>best,</hi> but the <hi>whole</hi> of our Time now
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51029:39"/>
upon a new account to our Creator, since
he has made such provision for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and so for our Happiness, not
only through the course of our Time
<hi>here,</hi> but through an entire Eternity <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;</hi>
which leads me to the last thing I
have to urge from the import of the
Term [<hi>Creator,</hi>] viz.</p>
               <p>3. As this Title implies that God is
the <hi>Soveraign Arbiter</hi> and <hi>Disposer</hi> of our
<hi>Being,</hi> because this is a necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of that <hi>Relation</hi> of Creator; it
carries with it a forcible Argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
those that are young in the Service
of God.<note place="margin">Ps. 31. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Times are in his hand,</hi> who
can prolong or contract them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and we must be accountable to him
for the Days he has lent us, and receive a
Sentence according to our Improvement
or Abuse of them. How reasonable is
it, and how much for our Interest to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that <hi>part</hi> of our Time to our Creator
which he <hi>peculiarly</hi> lays claim to; nay,
to consecrate the <hi>whole</hi> of it to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
seeing as he is the Author of our
Being he has a right to the Soveraign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposal
of it; and if we withhold any
<hi>part</hi> of our Time from him, can fill up
the <hi>Remainder</hi> of our days with pain and

persisted in, that an eternal state of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
will be the dreadful consequence of

it; as on the other hand, that our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

the early Consecration of our Time
to him, with an eternal state of Bliss,
cannot be doubted, by such as read and
give credit to the Scriptures of Truth.
For as a multitude of <hi>Threatenings</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

which, if they ascertain Glory to all the

               </p>
               <p>From the <hi>Reasons</hi> included in the

in those words, which express the <hi>proper
time</hi> of engaging in this <hi>Duty,</hi> viz. <hi>[In

we have no pleasure in them,]</hi> wherein the
<hi>Advantages</hi> that attend the Time of
Youth, and the contrary Evils and <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments</hi>
that accompany Old Age, which
render the former the far more eligible
Time in which to begin to devote one's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51029:43"/>
self to the Service of God, are suggested.
Which <hi>Advantages</hi> on the one hand, and
<hi>Disadvantages</hi> on the other, we are now
to consider.</p>
               <p>1. Then it behoves us to dedicate our
selves betimes to the Service of our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
because the Work of <hi>Conversion</hi> is
much more easily perform'd in Youth
than in Old Age. And seeing there is a
<hi>necessity</hi> of our turning to God once in our
Lives, or else we become irrecoverably
miserable; Prudence directs to the
choice of the <hi>best</hi> Time for so weighty
a purpose. The <hi>Wise Man</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>God
has made every thing beautiful in its season,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 1-10.</note> and if all Wise
Men are careful to choose a <hi>convenient</hi>
season for the <hi>common</hi> Affairs of the
World, that relate only to their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Interest, how prodigious a piece of
folly must it be for a Man to suffer the
<hi>fittest</hi> season to escape him for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of that Work, which is the
most <hi>difficult</hi> of all others to be well
done; and upon the <hi>due</hi> accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which, both his present and
future Happiness depends! For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:51029:44"/>
(1.) Youth is the <hi>best</hi> Time for our
<hi>Conversion:</hi> Because the Soul is not then
so much vitiated by evil <hi>Habits,</hi> as when
she has run through the several stages of
Life in a continued course of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Tho Sin is deeply enough rooted
in our Nature, which is all defil'd with
the Original Stain: Yet we very much
fortify our corrupt Inclinations by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them into <hi>Act;</hi> and by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Sinful Acts, till they become
<hi>familiar</hi> and customary to us, and till we
<hi>drink down Iniquity like Water:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 15. 16.</note> So that
the <hi>difficulty</hi> of turning from Sin encreases
together with the <hi>Time</hi> of our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the practice of it. <hi>Can the</hi> Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian
<hi>change his Skin, or the Leopard his
Spots?<note place="margin">Jer. 13. 23.</note> Then may ye also do Good, that are
accustomed to do Evil,</hi> (says the Prophet.)
Is it to be thought that Conversion to
God is so slight and easy a matter, that
<hi>any</hi> Time may serve for its Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Are not the difficulties that a
long <hi>habit</hi> of Sinning will lay in the
way of that great and important Work
to be fear'd? Is it not much more easy
to bend a <hi>Young</hi> Twig than an <hi>Aged</hi> Oak,
and to <hi>prevent</hi> evil Habits than to <hi>rectify</hi>
'em? A little observation of the World
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51029:44"/>
may suffice to inform us, that long
Custom or Habit is so bewitching a thing,
that scarce any thing can be imagin'd
more ridiculous, absurd, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
than many things which the long
usage of some <hi>Persons,</hi> nay of some
whole <hi>Nations,</hi> has authoriz'd.</p>
               <p>And if Men are so tenacious of any
silly and troublesome thing which they
have been much addicted to, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
their <hi>Reason,</hi> their <hi>Honour</hi> and their
<hi>Ease</hi> to the Tyranny of <hi>Custom;</hi> how
much more prevalent must a long habit,
and course of <hi>Sin</hi> be, which besides its
deep <hi>rooting</hi> in our Nature, and besides
the ordinary force of <hi>mere</hi> Habit, has
both its flattering <hi>Promises</hi> and Pleasures
to tempt us to its Embraces, and its
<hi>Threats</hi> and Terrors too (in suggesting
all the mortifying Circumstances of a
vertuous course of Life) to raise in our
Minds the most frightful <hi>Idea</hi> of Piety
and Religion. So that, if Custom and
Habit in <hi>general</hi> be <hi>proverbially</hi> stil'd a
Second Nature,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> the habit of <hi>Sin</hi> may of
all others most fitly be so term'd: And
the force of its Dominion <hi>over</hi> our Souls,
and the difficulty of its Extirpation <hi>out</hi>
of them, must needs have an increase pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51029:45"/>
to the Time of its <hi>Duration</hi> in
them. Can any thing then be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
than that in the days of our Youth,
when Sin has not yet so deeply rooted it
self in our Hearts by evil <hi>habits,</hi> as in
Old Age after a long course of Vice, in a
multitude of repeated Acts, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
must needs have the most <hi>easy</hi>
and <hi>kindly</hi> accomplishment?</p>
               <p>(2.) This further appears, in that the
Minds of the Young are ordinarily the
most capable of <hi>Instruction.</hi> It was a
saying of a Philosopher;<note place="margin">

Dead Man and Teach an Old Man, were
things equally difficult:</hi> For (tho in <hi>some
respects</hi> Youth is sufficiently addicted to
Pride, yet) there is a kind of <hi>Natural</hi>
Modesty and becoming Humility often
discernible in the Young, arising from a
Consciousness of their Ignorance, and
unexperience of things, which disposes
them to a more <hi>Docible</hi> frame of Mind,
than is usually to be found in Elder Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose <hi>Maturity</hi> of Age often makes
'em unwilling to be inform'd, <hi>especially</hi>
in matters of Religion, either because
they imagin they <hi>already</hi> know what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may pretend to teach 'em, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are unwilling to undergo the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51029:45"/>
shame of being accounted <hi>so long</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Religion, and their concern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which every body ought to be early
acquainted with. And upon this account
('tis likely) our Saviour tells his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that <hi>except</hi> they should <hi>humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and become as little Children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 3, 4.</note> they
should <hi>not enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven,</hi> i. e. unless they should imitate
Children in Modesty and lowliness of
Mind; that the Sense of their Ignorance
might make 'em Teachable.</p>
               <p>Besides the Minds of Youth are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
a much fitter Soil for Truth, than
those of the Aged, because not usually
so over-run with the Briars and Thorns
of strong and deeply rooted <hi>Prejudices.</hi>
The Soul of Man will not long remain
empty, if it be not early <hi>stor'd</hi> with
Truth, 'twill be gradually <hi>stuff'd</hi> with
Errors; and as 'tis much more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to alter and correct a Writing full
of <hi>Nonsense</hi> and Confusion, by much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
out and interlining, than to write
a handsome piece of good <hi>Sense</hi> on a
blank Paper: So it is abundantly harder
to instruct or rectify a Mind long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd
with Falshood, than to make
deep impressions of Truth on a Soul
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51029:46"/>
more simple and unprejudic'd; which,
if empty of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> yet is not fill'd
with <hi>Error,</hi> which as it has not yet
learn'd to judg <hi>right</hi> of things, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has been much us'd to judg <hi>wrong;</hi>
and if not <hi>happy</hi> enough to be well
stock'd with <hi>good</hi> Notions, yet is not
so <hi>unhappy</hi> as to be crowded with <hi>bad</hi>
ones.</p>
               <p>Now seeing to capacitate us to serve
God,<note place="margin">John 4. 24.</note> who <hi>is a Spirit,</hi> and therefore will
be serv'd <hi>with our Spirits,</hi> (without
which <hi>Bodily Exercise profiteth little</hi>)
there are many great Truths to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9. 1 Tim. 4. 8.</note>
and tho he has promis'd the help of
his Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> to reveal these to the
simple, yet seeing he requires us to be
diligent in the investigation of Truth,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. Psal. 4. 4. John 5. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>
and very attentive to the Voice of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Scripture</hi> to that End, 'tis easy
to see by reflecting on what has been just
now said, That the Young, whose
Minds are yet unform'd, have a mighty
advantage above the Aged for learning
the knowledg of the ways of God, and
for obtaining a more copious and solid
understanding of Truth: So that we
may well say with the Prophet, (tho
perhaps he speaks in another sense)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51029:46"/>
                  <hi>Whom shall he teach Knowledg?<note place="margin">Isa. 28. 9</note> And
whom shall he make to understand Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
Them that are wean'd from the
Milk, and drawn from the Breasts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) Again, there is a certain <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of Spirit attending our first Years,
and not ordinarily to be found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which renders Conversion more
feasible. The Heart is more malleable,
and more easily receives Impressions
from the Promises and Threatnings
recorded in the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and from
the Mercies and Judgments distributed
in the World by his <hi>Providence.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we find few Persons, whose Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
has given them any tolerable
means of the knowledg of Divine
things, who do not remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to have been much affected in
their Youth in attending to the Word of
God, or in observing some remarkable
Passages of his Providence. If deep
<hi>Conviction</hi> is a great step towards Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
Experience shews this is most
easily wrought on one that is young:
How often do we see such a one weep at
a transient glance on <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(in a Sermon), or at a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Christ for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51029:47"/>
Sinners, while the cered Consciences of
those that have been long harden'd in
Sin hold proof against the most pathetick
and awakening Discourses of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Death, the dismal Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that attend a Sinner at the approach of
it, and the great consequences that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on that amazing Change, or against
the most lively description of the
most Cruel and unexampled Sufferings
wherewith our Blessed Saviour was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
for our Redemption? That
makes no impression on the <hi>Adamantine</hi>
Heart of the latter, which is often found
to effect a deep compunction of Mind in
the former; and the Eyes of the one can
hardly be kept open by a Discourse that
dissolves those of the other into Tears.
The affections of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Hope, Ioy,
Sorrow, Compassion,</hi> and the like, more
easily move the tender Minds of Youth,
and consequently make way for lasting
impressions of Piety, to the purposes of
which these Affections, when guided
and regulated by an enlighten'd Mind,
do mightily conduce.</p>
               <p>(4.) The <hi>Zeal</hi> and Resolution which
the warm Temper of Youth enages
them in, for what they embrace, renders
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51029:47"/>
a thorough Conversion to God more easy
to them than to the old; who by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either tasted much of the Afflictions
of the World <hi>themselves,</hi> or by having
been Witnesses to the Miseries of many
<hi>others,</hi> often retain so terrible an <hi>Idea</hi> of
Worldly Troubles, that the Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Self-denial prescrib'd to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Christ, gives them a strange
disgust for a strictly Religious Life: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the abatement of their natural heat
and vigour, (a good degree of which is
useful to any great enterprize) makes
'em with the Sluggard continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of <hi>a Lion in the way.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 13.</note> But the
Young who have not been so baulk'd
with Disappointments, nor <hi>felt</hi> or <hi>seen</hi>
so many Miseries, and who have also a
great <hi>sense</hi> of Honour, and are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ambitious of high Atchievements, and
<hi>disdain</hi> to have their Attempts defeated,
are hereby dispos'd more readily to take
up the Cross of Christ, and to<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>fight the
good fight of Faith, that they may lay hold
on Eternal Life.</hi> Add to this, that that
Disease of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> that so often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the Aged, who from experience
either in themselves or others, of the
difficulty of <hi>getting</hi> and <hi>keeping,</hi> and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51029:48"/>
danger of <hi>losing,</hi> and the inconveniency
of <hi>wanting</hi> the things of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more tenacious of them <hi>then</hi> when
they are nearest the unavoidable necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>parting</hi> with them; that this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
(I say) which is <hi>the root of all evil,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note>
which is Idolatry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> and therefore opposite
to the true Service of God, and which
renders it almost <hi>impossible for a rich Man
to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 24, 25, 26.</note> does
not so usually reign amongst the Young
(who are rather apt to run into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
extreme) so that their motion in
the ways of God, is not clog'd with this
dead weight, which so mightily incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
those whose Hearts have taken
deeper root in the Earth. Thus we see
how much more easy the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
is likely to be, when we engage
in it in our tender Years, than if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to Old Age.</p>
               <p>But all this while I would not be
thought to make the work of Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
consider'd as the <hi>Act</hi> of God, (who
alone can <hi>turn</hi> a Soul <hi>from darkness to
light,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> and from the power of Satan to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>)
to be more difficult in one <hi>Subject</hi>
than another, for all things are equally
possible to him; but I have hereby made
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51029:48"/>
an Essay to shew that the Heart of an
old Sinner is a <hi>Subject</hi> much more <hi>untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable</hi>
and obstinate in it self, than that
of one, who (by reason of his Youth)
is yet but a <hi>Novice</hi> in Vice? That
the work of Mortification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is commonly begun with less dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and carried on with more ease
and speed on the Young than on the Old,
and that a greater <hi>degree</hi> of Grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to reform the latter than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and whether the Almighty will
grant such an extraordinary measure of
his Grace to one that is grown old in
wickedness, may well be doubted (as
we shall shew hereafter.)</p>
               <p>Since then the work of Conversion is
of the greatest consequence, as it is for
our truest interest both in <hi>this</hi> World and
that <hi>to come,</hi> certainly it ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in Youth, seeing that is the most
seasonable Time, as will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
               <p>2. In that much <hi>Good</hi> is <hi>lost,</hi> and much
<hi>Evil contracted</hi> by deferring our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Old Age; but much <hi>Evil</hi> (on the
contrary) is <hi>prevented,</hi> and much <hi>Good
obtain'd,</hi> through the Course of our days,
by an early turning to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:51029:49"/>
(1.) Much <hi>Sin</hi> is <hi>prevented,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
much <hi>Spiritual good obtain'd</hi> by
an early Conversion, which will appear
to be no small advantage: For seeing Sin,
as it is directly opposite to the pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, is the worst of Evils, and
seeing the <hi>Excellency</hi> or <hi>Vileness</hi> of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be measur'd by its <hi>likeness</hi> or
<hi>contrariety</hi> to God, who possesses abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
perfection in himself; it necessarily
follows, that nothing can so deform a
Creature, nothing can so defile it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can debase it so much, and set it
at so great a distance from Excellency
and Perfection, as Sin does. It must
then certainly be our Interest to break off
our Sins by an early Repentance; since
every sinful <hi>Act,</hi> and much more a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in a <hi>course</hi> of Sin, does so much
corrupt, debase, and deform the Soul.
And if we desire the meliorating of our
Nature, and would become more <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
Creatures than we are, instead of
degenerating and becoming <hi>worse:</hi> It
highly concerns us to begin early to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
that which has strip'd the Soul of
much of her <hi>Intellectual</hi> and (which is
worse) of her <hi>Moral</hi> Excellency; and
will render her, by so much the more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51029:49"/>
                  <hi>Vile,</hi> by how much the <hi>longer</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
it; and to devote our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to Religion and Holiness, which
is the principal Beauty and Glory of a
Rational Soul, and that which chiefly
makes a Man resemble his Creator.</p>
               <p>(2.) Much <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Trouble</hi> is
hereby <hi>prevented,</hi> and much <hi>Ioy</hi> and
<hi>Pleasure obtain'd</hi> and <hi>secur'd.</hi> For tho'

in this World, as all Places and Ages can

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:51029:50"/>
of this World, which make a

abundance of Grief and Trouble, which
one that becomes an early Convert to
Holiness avoids; who besides the joyous

a <hi>Relish</hi> to all his Temporal Comforts,

to turn to God in Youth is a Folly of
the grossest kind; because nothing can
tend so much to support us under the
pressure of the many Evils that attend
Old Age; nothing can tend to take off
so much of the <hi>weight</hi> of that <hi>Burden,</hi> as
an early Conversion; and nothing can

that he might be rid of those remains of

               <p>But on the other side; if Conversion
be deferr'd to Old Age, these and the
like Advantages of a long <hi>Exercise</hi> of
Grace, and of a large Spiritual <hi>Experience</hi>
being wanting, how difficult will it be
for a weak <hi>Mind</hi> and a languishing <hi>Body</hi>
to bear up under those pressing Miseries
that will then attend them? And it will
be no small Affliction to a late Penitent,
even after his Conversion, to think on
his Imprudent neglect of early laying up
this Spiritual Provision, against those
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51029:53"/>
Evil days of Age, and Weakness, when
the Soul stands in so much need of it,</p>
               <p>(2.) An <hi>early</hi> Conversion has greater
<hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Sincerity</hi> and Truth than a
<hi>late</hi> One; thereby administers great
<hi>Ease</hi> and Comfort amidst the <hi>Infirmities</hi>
of Age. For, as the true Peace and
Comfort of the Soul results from the
good and safe posture wherein she finds
her self: So according to the <hi>Evidence</hi>
or <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the proofs a Man finds in
himself of the reality of his Conversion
to God; the more <hi>stable</hi> or <hi>wavering</hi> is
his Hope and Comfort. Now those
that have been converted in their Youth,
have usually much clearer Evidences of
the Truth of their Conversion, than
they who have been reclaim'd from Sin
by a late Repentance: And therefore
the Joy of the <hi>former</hi> commonly far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
that of the <hi>latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How often does the disturb'd and

commune with her self: I find indeed

                  <hi>Punishment,</hi> and not at all from the <hi>Sense</hi>

I have render'd my self obnoxious

because I've defil'd my <hi>Soul,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled

from the Sins I formerly took <hi>Pleasure</hi> in;

Do I really loath my former disorders,

<hi>Conscience,</hi> and the <hi>rectitude</hi> of my <hi>Will?</hi>

A dying to the World of <hi>Necessity</hi> and

because it has first forsaken me;

it because I take delight in <hi>pleasing</hi> God;
or only because I <hi>fear</hi> to suffer the weight
of his <hi>Displeasure?</hi> Is it because I have
a mind to live a Holy <hi>Life,</hi> now when
the <hi>best,</hi> and almost the <hi>whole</hi> of my Time
is spent;<note place="margin">Num. 23. 10.</note> or only that I may <hi>die the
Death of the Righteous, and that my last
end may be like his?</hi> I am now willing to
<hi>devote</hi> my self to the Service of God:
But why have I not done it long before,
when I had <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Advantages to serve him with? Is
it not rather to serve a turn of my <hi>own,</hi>
than to serve <hi>him,</hi> that I offer my self so
late to his Service? Have I not Reason
to doubt whether I am sincerely willing
to choose my blessed Lord, as my <hi>Head</hi>
and <hi>Ruler,</hi> as well as my <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and
<hi>Saviour?</hi> And whether I am willing to
be <hi>purified</hi> as well as <hi>redeem'd,</hi> to be
<hi>sanctified</hi> by his Grace, as well as <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
by his Righteousness? <hi>The Heart is
deceitful above all things;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note> And how

               <p>These and such like Thoughts often

gives him so great an occasion of Remorse,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51029:56"/>
when his Conscience is once enlighten'd

great convulsions of Mind, and as it
were, rending the Soul in pieces: And

God can surmount all these Difficulties

               <p>Such Reflections will even make the

render the burden of Age supportable.
These Thoughts will obviate fears and

holy Courage and Resolution, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
her with Arguments for Prayer,
like that of the Psalmist. <hi>I will go in the

               <p>In a word, Tho every Man has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be humbled for his Sins, and that,
in every part of his Life, it must needs
be a <hi>great,</hi> and next to the Light of
God's Countenance through the face of
Jesus Christ, the <hi>greatest</hi> occasion of Joy
in the World; when a Man can lie
down in the Grave in Peace, with the
satisfaction of having made Religion
the great Business of his Life, of having
<hi>serv'd his Generation faithfully by the Will
of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 13. 36.</note> having from his Youth <hi>exercised
himself in this, to have a Conscience always
void of offence both toward God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Men:</hi> When at the shutting up of
his Days, he can, by the Grace of God,
safely appeal both to him and to Men, as
aged <hi>Samuel</hi> did;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold—I am old and
gray-headed—and I have walk'd before you
from my Childhood unto this day: Behold
here I am, witness against me before the
Lord, and before his Anointed: Whose Ox
have I taken? Or whose Ass have I taken?
Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have
I oppressed? Or of whose hand have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
any Bribe, to blind my Eyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:51029:60"/>
&amp;c. And as he that has serv'd
God from his Youth can look <hi>back</hi> with
Pleasure, so he may look <hi>forward</hi> with
exceeding Joy. For,</p>
               <p>(4.) An <hi>early</hi> Conversion furnishes
old Age with much more comfort than
a <hi>late</hi> one, in that it usually gives a
<hi>brighter</hi> and more glorious <hi>prospect</hi> of
Reward in the <hi>other Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>this Life</hi> is not valuable, but as it
may be improv'd in order to a <hi>better;</hi>
so the strong and well-grounded Hope
of eternal Bliss in the World to come,
is that which sweetens the most bitter
Afflictions of a Christian here, and
makes him as much <hi>more happy</hi> as he <hi>is
more excellent than his Neighbour</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if his <hi>Hope were only in this Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 26. 1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> he
would be of <hi>all Men the most miserable.</hi>)
And a Man's true Happiness in <hi>this</hi>
World is therefore to be measur'd by
the strength and liveliness of his Faith
and Hope for the Blessings of the <hi>other;</hi>
for by <hi>these</hi> he receives an <hi>Earnest</hi> of the
Heavenly Possession, and has some
<hi>foretastes</hi> of that Glory, with which he
expects in a little time to be <hi>fully</hi> satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For every one knows that there is
pleasure in <hi>hoping</hi> for any thing that we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51029:60"/>
think will add to our Happiness, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when that Hope is thought to be
well <hi>founded,</hi> and the things expected
of great <hi>consequence,</hi> and <hi>speedily</hi> to be
obtain'd: With what an extraordinary
Joy then must the Hope of everlasting
Bliss and Glory inspire him that firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believes he shall suddenly enjoy it!
And that this Hope makes a Saint the
most happy Man even in this Life is
evident, some of the <hi>Enemies</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>themselves being Iudges.</hi> 'Tis worth
remarking, that an <hi>Eminent</hi> Person,<note place="margin">The late E. of <hi>Roch<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

(who was one of the greatest <hi>Sinners,</hi>
as well as one of the greatest <hi>Penitents</hi>
of this Age) even while he maintain'd
his Atheistical Principles, and led a most
flagitious Course of Life, confess'd,
That <q>whether the Business of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was true or not, he thought
those who had the Perswasions of it,
and lived so that they had quiet in
their Consciences, and believed God
govern'd the World, and acquiesced
in his Providence, and had the Hope
of an endless Blessedness in another
State, the happiest Men in the World:
And said, He would give all that he
was Master of, to be under those
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51029:61"/>
Perswasions, and to have the Supports
and Joys that must needs flow from
them.</q> So Just a Thought had he
even <hi>then</hi> of the <hi>Ioy</hi> of a Good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the Pleasure which the bare
<hi>Expectation</hi> of future Glory in Heaven
occasions, that he thought it far out-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
<hi>the pleasures of Sin, which are</hi> but
<hi>for a season;</hi> and thus does <hi>Religion</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over her Enemies, extorting from

               <p>Now it cannot be expected, that a

greater and more frequent Doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Interest in eternal Glory than
the <hi>latter;</hi> and the Eye of his Faith is

                  <note place="margin">John 3. 3, 4, 5.</note>
without which, he knows,
<hi>no Man can enter into the Kingdom of

<hi>Abyss</hi> of <hi>Misery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 9. 44.</note> where a <hi>never-dying
Worm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 14, 15.</note> and an <hi>unquenchable Lake of fire</hi>
are the just and dreadful Rewards of a
sinful Life.</p>
               <p>These and such like Jealousies and
Fears, carry so specious an appearance
of <hi>Reason</hi> with them, that without a
more than common measure of <hi>Faith,</hi>
they must needs give the Soul a great
deal of Disquiet. And 'tis no wonder
if the Righteous and Holy God suffer
the Mind often to labour under these
troublesome Thoughts, as a proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
both to <hi>embitter</hi> Sin to one that has
been long accustomed to indulge it, and to
testify for the incouragement of Holiness,
that he reserves some <hi>peculiar Rewards</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:51029:63"/>
even in this Life, for them that have
serv'd him with a <hi>peculiar Zeal</hi> and
Constancy;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> and that <hi>full assurance of
Faith</hi> and Hope,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 11.</note> and a clear prospect of
those <hi>invisible</hi> things <hi>which he has laid up
for those that love him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> is a Blessing
wherewith he seldom crowns any but
those who have been for some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of their Lives, gradually raising
<hi>their Affections,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 2.</note> and fixing them <hi>on things
above,</hi> habituating themselves to converse
in Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 12.</note> and <hi>fighting the good fight of
Faith, that they might lay hold on eternal
Life.</hi> For since God is pleas'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>Rewards</hi> as motives to his Service,
'tis natural to conclude, That the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<hi>Hope</hi> of these Rewards (which is
also a Reward it self) does ordinarily
bear proportion to the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi>
of our Obedience: And therefore he
that has <hi>long</hi> devoted himself to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, as he has commonly a
<hi>clearer</hi> prospect of future Bliss, and of
the security of his interest in it; so to
advance his Joy still to a higher point, he
has reason to expect a <hi>distinguishing</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the Celestial Glory; that if he
has serv'd his Lord <hi>much</hi> in his Church,
which is his <hi>Kingdom on Earth,</hi> he shall
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51029:63"/>
not be <hi>the least in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 19.</note>
For though he has no ground to
hope to be rewarded <hi>for</hi> his Works on
the account of <hi>Debt,</hi> because when he
has done his best <hi>he is but an unprofitable
Servant;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note> yet, since God himself has
promised it, he may believe, that he
shall be rewarded <hi>according</hi> to his Works,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 27.</note>
on the account of <hi>Grace.</hi> Thus as the
early Convert looks back upon all the
Sufferings he has endur'd for the sake of
his Divine Master with Comfort,<note place="margin">Job 11. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>as
on Waters that are past away;</hi> so the
Thoughts of these raise both his Desire
and Expectation earnestly to look for a
distinguishing Recompence of future
Glory.</p>
               <p>And how unexpressible is that Joy
which a Holy Man feels, when the Eye
of Faith can with a great degree of
<hi>strength</hi> penetrate, and with equal <hi>stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness</hi>
contemplate the unseen Glories of
the Heavenly State, as firmly interessed
therein! What Joy does the early Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
often taste, especially toward the
Close of his Days, when he approaches
<hi>the Mark</hi> of his long Desire and Hope;<note place="margin">Philip. 3. 13, 14.</note>
when he considers that as he has been
long labouring to increase in the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:51029:64"/>
of God, he shall suddenly <hi>see him as
he is;</hi> and that as he has been long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
after a <hi>Conformity</hi> to him,<note place="margin">1 John 3. 2</note>
he shall not only see him, but <hi>be like him</hi>
too: That as all the <hi>Powers</hi> of his Soul
have been dedicated to his <hi>Service,</hi> so
they shall be in a little time <hi>intirely</hi> fill'd
with his <hi>Glory,</hi> and incessantly employ'd
in his <hi>Praise;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13</note> and as the <hi>Members</hi> of
his Body have been <hi>fellow-Servants</hi> of
Righteousness with the <hi>Faculties</hi> of his
Soul,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 42, 43, 44.</note> so their refin'd <hi>Matter</hi> and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<hi>Form</hi> at the Resurrection shall
render them fit to become their <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
in Glory.</p>
               <p>Thus have we made it evident, that
the Time of our Youth is in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>fittest</hi> for the Great
Work of remembering our Maker,
and of engaging in his Service; and
this, even upon the <hi>Supposition</hi> of our
being sure of obtaining an opportunity
of repenting in old Age, tho we should
not reform before.</p>
               <p>But we have further to shew, that
as the Time of Youth is the <hi>Best;</hi> so
it may be, and is most likely to be the
<hi>only</hi> Season wherein it will be <hi>possible</hi> for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51029:64"/>
us to devote our selves to our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or wherein our Service will be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi>
to him: Which gives us the
clearest proof of all, of the <hi>Danger</hi> and
<hi>Folly</hi> of neglecting to consecrate to
him the Morning of our Days. But
the Consideration of this we shall refer
to another Discourse.</p>

For</p>
               <p>(1.) We are always uncertain of <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
Time for the accomplishment of this
<hi>Important</hi> Work. Our Time is at the
Disposal of our <hi>Maker;</hi> and he has not
entrusted our lavish hands with the
<hi>whole</hi> stock of this precious Treasure, but
only suffers it to run through them by
<hi>Moments;</hi> so that we can recal no <hi>past,</hi>
nor can we command any <hi>future</hi> Time,
'tis therefore our Business to improve the
<hi>present;</hi> being ignorant how long the
Divine Bounty will continue our Time
in this World. Upon this account the
wise Man instructs us well, not to <hi>boast</hi>
our selves <hi>of to Morrow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 1</note> seeing <hi>we know
not what a Day may bring forth:</hi> And the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> reprehends the folly of
those that encourage one another to go
on in sinful Excesses, by profanely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
themselves,<note place="margin">Isa. 56. 12.</note> that <hi>to Morrow</hi> should
<hi>be as the present Day, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
The Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> also shews the
Vanity of such foolish Presumptions:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51029:66"/>
                  <hi>Go to now</hi> (says he) <hi>ye that say,<note place="margin">James 4, 13, 14, 15.</note> to day, or
to morrow, we will go into such a City, and
continue there a Year, and buy and sell, and
get Gain; whereas you know not what shall
be on the morrow: for what is your Life?
It is even a Vapour, that appeareth for a
little time, and then vanisheth away: For
that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we
shall live, and do this or that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Experience,</hi> as well as <hi>Scripture,</hi>
assures us,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 6.</note> that <hi>every Man walks in a
vain shew;</hi> and that <hi>Man</hi> (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect)
<hi>even at his best Estate is altogether
Vanity:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 5.</note> That some <hi>die in their full
strength,<note place="margin">Job 21. 23, 24, 25.</note> being wholly at ease and quiet;
their Breasts being full of Milk, and their
Bones moisten'd with Marrow:</hi> As others
<hi>die in the bitterness of their Souls, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
eat with pleasure:</hi> That <hi>they lie down
alike in the Dust, and the Worms cover
'em.</hi> 'Tis evident to every one's obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that Youth does not exempt us
from Death, nor ensure to us any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
portion of Time than what we at
present enjoy. But on the contrary,
that the far greater number of Mankind
go early to the Grave; and for <hi>one</hi> that
reaches to old Age a <hi>multitude</hi> fall short
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:51029:67"/>
Nor is it an uncommon thing for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the most vigorous and hardy
Constitution of Body to be suddenly
snatch'd away into the other World by
some violent Disease, or otherwise: For
so many fatal <hi>Strokes</hi> are we obnoxious
to; and so frail is the <hi>Texture</hi> of our
<hi>Earthly Tabernacle,</hi> that some of the least
and most contemptible things in the
World are capable of giving it a mortal
shock; and the very <hi>Pores</hi> of the Skin
sometimes prove <hi>Breaches</hi> wide enough
for <hi>the King of Terrors</hi> to enter in
at.<note place="margin">Job 18. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is well enough <hi>known,</hi> and often
enough thought upon by the generality
of Men, to engage them to use Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to secure themselves or their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as much as they can, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
their temporal Affairs might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
receive from sudden Death.
And the Rate an <hi>Estate for Life</hi> is usually
valued at, sufficiently shews, that to such
purposes as these Men need not be
<hi>taught to know their End,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 39. 4.</note> and the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
of their <hi>Days</hi> what it is, that they
<hi>may know how frail</hi> they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:51029:67"/>
And if there be no comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Earth and Heaven, between the
<hi>uncertain</hi> Wealth of this World, and
the <hi>durable</hi> Riches of the other, between
<hi>this</hi> Life and that which is <hi>to come:</hi> Then
'tis infinitely more imprudent for a Man
to neglect <hi>but</hi> for a moment,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> to <hi>make his
Calling and Election sure,</hi> (whatever fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Time here his Youth and Strength
may seem to promise) than for him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
to suffer the security of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Estate to depend merely on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Life of <hi>another Man,</hi> when he
need not put it to that hazard; or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Posterity to Poverty and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by omitting to make due provision for
them against his <hi>own</hi> Mortality, when
he has a fair opportunity of doing
it.</p>
               <p>'Tis Folly and Madness to leave that
undone <hi>to day,</hi> which must be done at
one time or other, or else we are ruin'd
for ever, and which may (for ought we
know) be impossible to be perform'd <hi>to
morrow:</hi> To neglect to improve the
<hi>present</hi> Time in doing that on which our
<hi>eternal</hi> Bliss depends; when the precious
opportunity of doing it may the next

               <p>Even the Impious <hi>Atheist,</hi> and the

for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note>
from the consideration of the shortness
and uncertainty of their Time in this
World, and seek to gratify and indulge
their Senses <hi>to day,</hi> because they are not
sure of doing it <hi>to morrow.<note place="margin">Isa. 22. 13.</note> Let us eat

who have often <hi>griev'd</hi> the <hi>Holy

And seeing he has said his <hi>Spirit

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51029:70"/>
knows how soon he may <hi>shut up his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mercies in Displeasure</hi> against those
that have long rebell'd against him;<note place="margin">Psal. 77. 9.</note> and
<hi>swear in his Wrath,<note place="margin">Ps. 95. 11.</note> that they</hi> shall <hi>never

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 18.</note> How soon he may

<hi>He that hardens his Neck,<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>(3.) There is not only a possibility or
a <hi>bare</hi> likelihood of the <hi>expiration</hi> of the
Day of Grace, to those that spend the
best of their Time in Rebellion against
their Maker, before they arrive at old
Age: But on the contrary, there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a possibility, and <hi>no</hi> likelihood, that
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> should <hi>continue</hi> to strive
with them at the winding up of their
Days, who through the greatest part of
their Time have resisted his Counsels
and Motions. And 'tis not only <hi>Reason</hi>
that furnishes us with proofs of this from
the Soveraignty and Justice of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
with the great <hi>Aggravations</hi> of
Impenitency under the means of Grace,
or the <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the Holy <hi>Scripture</hi>
that plainly include this danger, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the last Head insisted on) but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51029:71"/>
                  <hi>Experience</hi> joins issue in this matter, and
evinces that what our Saviour says of
<hi>Rich Men,</hi> may with as much reason and
force be applied to <hi>old Sinners,</hi> namely,
That <hi>'tis easier for a Camel to pass through
the eye of a Needle,<note place="margin">Mar. 19. 24</note> than</hi> for such <hi>to enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And if
this Saying seem severe to any, in respect
of these <hi>last,</hi> as it did to the Disciples of
Christ,<note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> in regard of the <hi>other,</hi> it cannot
justly be soften'd with any farther addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that which our Saviour sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd
to qualify his words in the first
case,<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>nothing is impossible with
God.</hi> 'Tis a thing possible, because all
things are so to God, but very unlikely,
and not to be often expected; and when
at any time it comes to pass, God may
be said to make a step out of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>method</hi> of the Dispensation of his
<hi>Grace,</hi> somewhat like that he makes,
when he works a Miracle in the <hi>Sphere</hi>
of <hi>Nature.</hi> In this matter (I say) one
may safely appeal to Experience. Let
any one that is acquainted with a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
number of <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>aged</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
ask each of them from what time
he dates his Conversion; and for one
that has had that happy Change
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51029:71"/>
wrought on his Soul, since he became
<hi>Old,</hi> he shall find many that turn'd to
God in the strength and verdure of their
<hi>Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And can there be a greater instance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then of the <hi>deceitfulness of Sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> and
of the bewitching power it has over the
common Sense and Reason of Mankind,
than we have in the vain promises of
Repentance in old Age, wherewith so
many flatter <hi>themselves,</hi> and by which
they seem to hope to render <hi>God</hi> propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to them? Is any kind of Folly so
great in its <hi>Degree,</hi> or so dangerous in its
<hi>Consequences</hi> as this? For Mortals to lull
themselves asleep in Sin, and sing a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying
<hi>Requiem</hi> to their Souls, while
they hang on the brink of eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
when their vain Hope has mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this uncertain foundation, That there
is a <hi>bare possibility,</hi> that their <hi>old Age may
be</hi> accepted of God, tho they spend their
<hi>Youth</hi> in sinning against him? What an
unparallel'd presumption! For a Man to
neglect to make provision for his everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bliss at <hi>present,</hi> only because 'tis not
absolutely impossible that he may do it
in time <hi>to come:</hi> To refuse the present
improvement of the Time of Grace God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51029:72"/>
is <hi>now</hi> pleas'd to allow him, because the
Divine Goodness can afford him the like
advantage <hi>hereafter;</hi> tho 'tis very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he will grant it to so presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
a Criminal! Will any Man fall
without fear upon the <hi>point</hi> of his Sword,
because 'tis possible he may not receive a
<hi>mortal Wound</hi> by it? Is any Man so mad
as to poison himself with the most subtile
<hi>Venom,</hi> because he thinks there is some
possibility of his obtaining an <hi>Antidote?</hi>
Or will any one in his Wits carelesly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his Body to languish under a violent
<hi>Disease,</hi> without seeking for Cure, till
his strength is almost quite exhausted,
and he's ready to expire, thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
secure enough of Recovery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis not utterly impossible, that a
Man may be restor'd to <hi>Health</hi> when
almost reduc'd to the last Gasp by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Sickness?</hi> No, Men are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their <hi>Bodies</hi> than to hazard 'em at
this rate, how careless soever they are
of their <hi>Souls:</hi> They are prudent in the
Affairs of <hi>this Life,</hi> but act after the
most absurd and improvident manner,
about the great Concerns of <hi>the World
to come.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:51029:72"/>
But whether we will act reasonably
or no, what has been argu'd does abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
demonstrate that it is both highly
<hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>advantageous</hi> for young
Persons to devote themselves to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of their <hi>Creator in the Days of their

<hi>unreasonable</hi> to defer that important
Work to the Days of <hi>old Age,</hi> which are
very <hi>uncertain,</hi> in that we know not
whether we shall attain them or not;
and, if we do, will prove so <hi>evil,</hi> if
this great Business of our Lives be till

               </p>
               <p>I shall now endeavour to improve the

What has been said must needs offer
you an occasion to enquire of your own
Consciences, Whether you have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
your selves to the Service of God,
or not? Whether you have yet <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
your Creator</hi> in the sense of our
Text, and are truly converted to
him.</p>
               <p>If you have <hi>not</hi> so remember'd him,
consider,</p>
               <p>(1.) How extremely dangerous your
Case is. Can you be secure on the very
brink of Destruction? Surely 'tis more
than <hi>high time</hi> for you <hi>to awake,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 11.</note> lest you
sleep the sleep of Death.</hi> It will be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of Grace,<note place="margin">Psal. 13. 3.</note> if ever you be <hi>recover'd
out of the Snare of the Devil,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> who have
been</hi> so long <hi>led Captive by him at his Will.</hi>
It has been your great folly to defer to

foundation against the Time to come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 19.</note> till
now; but your <hi>folly</hi> in deferring it longer
will still increase together with your
<hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>danger;</hi> of which if you are
sensible, seek immediately to escape:
<hi>Fly from the Wrath to come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 3. 7.</note> which is

                  <hi>your Damnation slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
not,</hi> but will soon overtake you, if
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51029:73"/>
you don't speedily <hi>awake to righteousness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 34.</note>
and to the serious remembrance of your
Creator;<note place="margin">Psal. 9. 17.</note> for <hi>the Wicked shall be turned

God.</hi> If any of you have vainly
flatter'd your selves all your Days with
the presumptuous thoughts of having
still time enough before you for the great
Work of your Conversion: Let me
warn and exhort every such person in
the words of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon
Magus;<note place="margin">Acts 8. 22, 23.</note> Repent of this thy Wickedness,
and pray God, if perhaps the thought of
thine Heart may be forgiven thee; For I

and in the bond of Iniquity.</hi> And <hi>to
Day, while 'tis call'd to Day,</hi> remember
your Maker,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>lest any of you be</hi> further
<hi>harden'd through the deceitfulness of
Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) If you are convinc'd of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sinfulness of your <hi>Neglect;</hi> Do
not absolutely conclude, 'tis now too
late to obtain Mercy, nor continue that
neglect by <hi>Despair,</hi> which you have
long persisted in by <hi>Presumption.</hi> As you
cannot set limits to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of God, so
neither can you measure his <hi>Long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Goodness:</hi> Therefore you ought

God, and to rely on his Mercy, at least
with the same Argument the famish'd
<hi>Lepers</hi> us'd to engage one another to
throw themselves on the Compassion of
the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army.<note place="margin">2 Rings 7. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Why sit we here</hi> (say
they) <hi>until we Die? If we say we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the City, then the Famine is in the
City, and we shall Die there: And if we sit
still here, we Die also. Now therefore come,
and let us fall unto the Host of the Syrians;
if they save us alive, we shall Live, and if
they kill us, we shall but Die.</hi> Reason
with your selves after the like manner.
Why sit we still in a state of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
danger? If after the sense of our
danger, we return to our former Course
of Life, we must perish; if we remain
in our present posture, and neglect to
try the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> whether he
will commiserate such inveterate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
we inevitably perish too. Let us
cast our selves at his Feet; if he'll save
us, we shall live eternally; if he refuse,
we can but perish. Say as <hi>David</hi> did

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me now address my self

to your own Hearts, Whether you have
yet remember'd your Creator, so as to
dedicate your selves to his Service, or
not?</p>
               <p>If you have devoted to him the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits
of your Time:</p>
               <p>1. It behoves you with profound <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
and Reverence to ascribe to God
the Glory of his Grace, who made you
<hi>willing in the Day of his Power to serve him
in the Beauties of Holiness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 110. 3.</note> even <hi>from the
Womb of the Morning</hi> of your Time, and
to offer him the early <hi>Dew of your Youth:</hi>
For <hi>no Flesh may glory in his Presence;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 20.</note> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>all Flesh is Grass,<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 6.</note> and the goodliness
thereof as the</hi> fading <hi>Flower of the Field,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 24.</note>
in a <hi>Moral</hi> as well as a <hi>Natural</hi> sense. If
you have been distinguish'd from others
by early impressions of Piety; know,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note>
that 'tis Grace <hi>that hath made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 2.</note>
and glorify that God,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 16.</note> who <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
his praise out of the Mouths of Babes
and Sucklings;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">luke 10. 21.</note> and <hi>reveals that to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
which he sometimes <hi>hides from the
Wise and Prudent.</hi> Bless him that has
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51029:80"/>
                  <hi>redeem'd you from the Earth,<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 3, 4.</note> and from
among Men,</hi> at a time when the Pleasures
of Sin, and the Society of Sinners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the most alluring form. Praise
that God, who by the early Seeds of
Holiness he has sown in your Hearts,
is preparing you to reap a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Harvest of Graces and Blessings
here, and of Glorious Rewards here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>2. Consider the mighty Obligations
that are upon you to engage you in a
Holy Conversation. As you have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi>
more than many others, more is
<hi>requir'd</hi> of you: And what we have said
may be justly expected to be found in
those old Disciples that have follow'd
Christ from their Youth, sufficiently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Mark you are to aim at; and
the exalted degrees of Grace you are to
aspire to. In order to which you ought
to be cautious of the least degree of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.
Have a care, lest after having
seem'd to <hi>begin in the Spirit,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 3.</note> you</hi> should
miserably <hi>end in the Flesh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 22.</note> Therefore
<hi>flee youthful Lusts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> And <hi>endure hardship

pray, that you may not enter into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or at least that your <hi>Faith</hi> may <hi>not
fail you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32</note> when you are tempted: And

your Practices: Let your manner of

that it may stop the Mouths of

that it may <hi>open</hi> them in favour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that <hi>when they see your good Works
they may</hi> be induc'd to <hi>glorify your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> and to worship him, and
to confess that <hi>God is in you of a Truth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 25.</note>
Let a becoming Modesty and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
adorn your Conversation: <hi>Let
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51029:81"/>
your Speech be always with Grace, season'd
with Salt:<note place="margin">Col. 4. 6.</note> Let no corrupt Communication
proceed out of your Mouths,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29.</note> but that which
is good to the use of edifying, that it may

others to a Holy Emulation by the lustre
of your Examples, and choose the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Patterns of the most devout and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd

Let your Zeal be constantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

always ballasted by Humility. In
a word,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Set the Lord always before your

Remember your Creator, what he is,
and what Homage and Service you owe
him:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> Remember how <hi>reasonable</hi> that
Service is, and how entirely your true

and industriously improve all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

               </p>
               <p>As for you that are still Young, but
have not <hi>yet</hi> made an offering of your
Youth to your Creator:</p>
               <p>(1.) Let me ask you, What hinders
you from presenting so reasonable a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to him? You have seen that the
reason of this Duty, which our Text
urges, is founded in your very Being, in
the <hi>Relation</hi> you bear to the Almighty
as his Creatures; and since your greatest
Interest too is embarked in it, Why
should so just, and so useful an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be rejected? Will you yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to rob your <hi>Maker</hi> of the Homage
and Service you owe him? And deprive
<hi>your selves</hi> of the Honour and Privilege
of serving him? Will you yet be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful

the great God ready to accept your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51029:82"/>
and will you still refuse to offer it?

that oblige you to your Duty; let
us also, to remove the chief <hi>Stumbling-blocks</hi>

a little into the pretended <hi>Reasons</hi> that
detain you in your Sin.</p>
               <p>Will you say, <q>'Tis a rigorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to require us to forsake the
World almost as soon as we come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; and to renounce the charming
Sweets wherewith it flatters our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
even before we have so much as
tasted many of the Pleasures to which
it invites us: And this in that part of
our Life, that gives us the highest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of these Delights, when our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are most lively and active, and
when the World shews it self most
obliging and kind, and presents us on

Objects?</q>

But tell me, Are the Promises of the
<hi>World</hi> like the Promises of <hi>God?</hi> Are
those Pleasures, the highest relish of
which vanishes (by your own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
together with your Youth, and so
may be soon out liv'd by your selves, to
be compar'd with the eternal Joys of
Heaven? Are the Smiles of the <hi>World,</hi>

to the Smiles of <hi>God,</hi> and the Joy of a

prove <hi>bitterness in the latter end of it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 2. 26.</note>
which is enjoy'd but a few Moments,
but follow'd with the gnawings of <hi>a
Worm that never dies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 9. 44.</note> to be chosen before
a Life of Holiness, which is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with inward Peace in the Soul, and
follow'd with <hi>Immortal Glory</hi> and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
Is it worth the while to purchase
a few hours delight in gratifying your
sordid and brutish Appetites, with the
loss of your precious Souls? Will you
rather hazard an eternal privation of the
Joys of Heaven, and expose your selves
to the danger of everlasting Perdition,
than curb the extravagant Inclinations of
your vain and sensual Hearts? Will you
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51029:83"/>
still flatter the levity and unsteadiness of
your youthful Minds, in pursuing all
the vain <hi>Fantoms</hi> your extravagant I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
can represent? Will you
continue to follow those gay Bubbles,
which will yield you scarce any thing
but <hi>Disappointment, Vexation</hi> and <hi>Guilt;</hi>
when you are invited to fix your Minds
and your Hearts on your Creator, to
make him the <hi>Object</hi> of your Thoughts
and of your Desires, who gives his <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi>
the Hope of Immortal Glory,
which produces in their Souls a great
degree of Happiness at <hi>present,</hi> and who
will <hi>hereafter</hi> fill them with Joys infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
beyond the most raised Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Will you further urge, <q>But we
have no mind to be singular, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
our selves from the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mankind by an Affectation of
a strict Course of Life; and that at
an Age, when every one allows the
Senses an Indulgence. There is a
proper season for every thing. Youth
is the Time for <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and Old
Age for <hi>Repentance;</hi> for the latter
part of our Lives seems destin'd to
trouble and sorrow: And then 'tis fit
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51029:84"/>
to live a spiritual Life, when Age has
deaden'd the Senses, and so prepar'd
us to live after that abstracted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And is it not as easy as 'tis reasonable
to reply, That 'tis a foolish Scrupulosity
to be so careful to avoid <hi>Singularity</hi> as to
run from it into a <hi>Common</hi> Destruction:
To refuse to be holy and happy, and to
choose Sin and Misery,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13, 14.</note> because <hi>the way
to Life is narrow</hi> and unfrequented, and
the way to <hi>Damnation broad</hi> and full of
Company? Is not this a vain affectation
of Conformity to the World, for you
to <hi>follow a Multitude to do evil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 2.</note> tho <hi>their
Ways lead to Hell, and go down to the
Chambers of Death;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 27.</note> to abandon your
selves to the Torrent of evil Examples,
tho they <hi>drown you in Perdition;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9.</note> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
your own eternal Interest in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance
to the Custom and Humour of
other Men,<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 1. and V. 6.</note> and to <hi>walk in the Counsel of
the Vngodly,</hi> tho you damn your selves
for Company?</p>
               <p>And because some rather seem to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(or even indulge) than blame many of
the Follies of Youth, partly from the
Consideration of their <hi>Vnexperience</hi> and
giddiness of Mind, and of their great
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51029:84"/>
Propensity to carnal Pleasures; partly
because <hi>Custom</hi> has render'd the Vices of
Youth familiar to the World, and partly
because many of those that are advanc'd
in Years, instead of reflecting on their
youthful Vanities with Sorrow, are yet
so insensible, as to look back upon them
as <hi>excusable</hi> Follies, or as Sins of small
consequence; must therefore an Opinion
that has so rotten a foundation, obtain
Credit in the World, as if it were a
<hi>Maxim</hi> of undoubted Truth? Does the
Holy Scripture, or Reason allow Youth
any such Dispensation for Sin? Is so great
an Evil to be at any time indulg'd? Is any
scope in Vice allowable to the Time of
<hi>Youth</hi> any more than to the Time of <hi>Old
Age?</hi> Is not Sin always evil, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be avoided? Can you think
it deserves the very <hi>best</hi> of your Time,
and that your Creator is unworthy of
such an Offering?</p>
               <p>You have heard it sufficiently prov'd
that Youth is the most proper Time of
all, and Old Age the most unfit for the
great Business of Conversion to God;
that 'tis the greatest proof of the Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Self-denial, when we restrain
the vicious Inclinations of our Youth,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51029:85"/>
that are so eager after sensual Pleasures:
And that an aged Sinner is so far from
being likely to be a true Penitent, that
the long Time he has been hardening
himself in his Wickedness, renders the
Change of his Heart impossible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a more than ordinary effort of Grace,
which God is seldom pleas'd to grant
to them that are grown old in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</p>
               <p>Will you say after this, <q>God whose
Mercies are infinite, is Gracious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to receive us into his Vineyard
at the last hour of the Day; and to
give us a place in <hi>Paradise;</hi> if, like the
Thief on the Cross, we begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
when we are ceasing to live;
and we may hope to die happily, tho
we have liv'd viciously?</q>
               </p>
               <p>After having so largely detected the
Vanity of such Hopes as these, as we
have already done, we need not add
much more. Is not this to build an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Happiness on a thousand Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties?
And what a daring presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is it,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 1.</note> to <hi>continue in Sin, that Grace
may abound?</hi> Because the Gracious God
has given <hi>one</hi> Example in his Word, of
a Sinner converted at the last hour of his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51029:85"/>
Life, is it reasonable for <hi>every</hi> Sinner to
conclude, That he may expect the same
extraordinary favour, and so may safely
defer his Repentance, till he is ready to
expire? No; this great Instance of
Mercy in the crucified Malefactor, was
given to prevent a true (tho late) Penitent
from despairing; not to encourage any
bold Sinner to <hi>turn the Grace of God into
Lasciviousness</hi> by his presumption.<note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> And
how many fatal instances might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Vanity of such hopes as these!
How few of those daring Sinners have
arriv'd at the Time, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to devote to religious Purposes!
How very few of those that have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
old Age, have become sensible of
their Guilt and Danger after a long Life
spent in the Service of Sin! Have they
not generally supinely doz'd away their
last Moments (as they vainly spent their
first) without awaking, till they have
found themselves in <hi>everlasting Burnings?</hi>
Or if they have receiv'd some Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Guilt,<note place="margin">Isa. 33. 14.</note> these have not always
produc'd on them the Characters of <hi>a
Repentance to Salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> but have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fill'd their miserable Souls with
Despair and Horrour; and their former
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51029:86"/>
delusive Hopes of obtaining pardon at
the last hour,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 27</note> have only issued in <hi>a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fearful looking for of Iudgment and
fiery Indignation to devour</hi> them. Learn
therefore,<note place="margin">Psa. 92. 12.</note> before it be too late, so <hi>to
number</hi> your <hi>Days as to apply</hi> your <hi>Hearts
to Wisdom!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you, after all that has been said,
still perswade your selves, that 'tis yet
time enough for you to remember your
Creator; and that you may safely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
defer the securing of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
yet some time longer, if not quite
to the evil Days of Old Age; that 'tis
best for you first to establish your selves
in the World, as firmly as you can, and
to make provision for your temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
and afterwards at your leisure to
think on the Affairs of another Life?</p>
               <p>These things have been also sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer'd before; let me further add,
That as your Time is very uncertain on
the one hand, so your Resolutions are
yet more fickle on the other: For how
common a thing is it for Men to assume
a purpose of Repentance, and presently
to relinquish it again! How often do
they violate their Promises to God and to
themselves, while they are perpetually
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51029:86"/>
fixing a new future season of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
So <hi>deceitful is the Heart of Man,<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note>
and so desperately wicked, who can know
it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how preposterous is the Course
you take, to endeavour to provide for
your <hi>Bodies</hi> before your <hi>Souls,</hi> and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your <hi>Temporal</hi> before your <hi>Eternal</hi>
Interest: Hearkening rather to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
Suggestions of <hi>the Father of Lies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 44.</note>
who tempts you with the gilded Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this perishing World, than to
the Counsel of him who is <hi>Wisdom</hi> it self,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 24.</note>
who advises you to <hi>seek first the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God and his Righteousness;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 31, 32, 33.</note> and

               </p>
               <p>Since therefore your Creator requires

lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none

               <p>If you now begin to entertain serious
Thoughts of Religion, to stir you up
further to this great (tho miserably

in the Days of your Youth,</hi> let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to consider two or three things,</p>
               <p>1. That God has been often pleas'd
to dignify them with special Marks of
Honour in his Church, who have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
him by the early dedication of
their Youth to his Service, and has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
their Services as eminent in the
World, as their Piety has been early and
exemplary.</p>
               <p>As the forward Piety of <hi>Ioseph</hi> kept
him uncorrupt in his tender Years amidst
the evil Examples of his envious <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 2, 3, 4.</note>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:51029:88"/>
so he was blessed with the largest
share in the Affection of his aged <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
And tho his Zeal for their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
render'd him the Object of their
<hi>Hatred,</hi> (as well as of his Father's <hi>Love</hi>)
yet the Divine Providence wonderfully
prosper'd him,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> and gave him favour in
that strange Countrey, whither their
unnatural Malice had exil'd him. And
as he there preserved his Chastity when
it was try'd after so extraordinary a
manner,<note place="margin">V. 7-20.</note> that it was become impossible
for him to keep himself <hi>Innocent</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
incurring the <hi>Odium</hi> of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>Guilty,</hi> as well as enduring other
severe Punishments: So the Purity of
his untainted Soul (who rather chose to
be accounted Vile than to be so) was
afterwards strangely clear'd up by the
Wise and Gracious Providence of the
Almighty; and his injur'd Name cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
with the highest Honours of the
Court of <hi>Egypt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> The Just and Holy
God whom he serv'd, having endow'd
him with a Prophetick Gift of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dreams; and by that Divine Skill
open'd a way for his advancement from
Prison to ride in the second Chariot of
the Kingdom. So that he became a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51029:89"/>
                  <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Father</hi> to that Nation whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was brought a <hi>Stranger</hi> and a
<hi>Slave;</hi> and proved the happy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not only of preserving Multitudes
of People from the Rage of a tedious
Famine of seven Years continuance, but
also of nourishing his Father's Family in
that time of common Calamity.<note place="margin">Gen. 43. &amp; Ch. 44.</note> And
by this means he had the honour of the
most obsequious Addresses of those very
Brethren of his that had been his Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,<note place="margin">Ch. 45.</note>
and at last had the God-like
Pleasure of melting them into a deep
Conviction of the unreasonableness of
their Enmity against him, by the most
endearing Caresses, and sweetest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Brotherly Love and Tenderness,
and the satisfaction of that truly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and innocent kind of Revenge, of
<hi>overcoming Evil with Good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 21.</note> Thus God
was pleas'd to reward the eminent Piety
of his Youth, by making him the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his Providence; and to lay the
foundation of his Glory in those Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

with their solemn and universal mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(an Honour which was refus'd to
his profane <hi>Successor</hi>) and his Funeral
celebrated with the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of a
great Prophet; and his Memory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd

               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> first devoted his

Life,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 80.</note> and then to the <hi>publick</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God in his Generation:<note place="margin">Luke 3. 2, 3, 4.</note> So he
was invested with the honorary Title of
<hi>MESSENGER</hi> to the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 7. 26, 27, 28.</note> to
prepare the way before him; who says,
he was not only <hi>a Prophet,</hi> but <hi>much

was no greater Prophet</hi> than he.</p>
               <p>The early Piety of <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> who was
well acquainted with the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>
from his Childhood, was honoured
with the most endearing Love of the
great <hi>Apostle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and with
an eminent Station in the Church of
God, wherein his prudent and Religious
Deportment secur'd his <hi>Youth</hi> from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12.</note>
and made the Apostle give him
that singular <hi>Character,</hi> to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
when he assures them that he had
<hi>no Man like-minded,<note place="margin">Philip. 2. 20.</note> who</hi> would <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
care for</hi> their <hi>State.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>beloved Disciple</hi> is reported to
have been very young,<note place="margin">John 13. 23.</note> when proselyted
to the Doctrine of Christ; and perhaps
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51029:91"/>
this was not the least occasion of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made the Bosom-friend of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Master.</p>
               <p>Nay, most of those who were dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
with the sacred Office of <hi>Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
seem to have been converted in the
Flower of their Time, by several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of their History in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and by the many Years some of
them spent in Travels, and other hard
Services and Sufferings, after the Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>On the contrary we find not like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Persons being call'd to such
eminent Services for God, and receiving
such <hi>distinguishing</hi> Marks of Honour
from him in old Age, after a flagitious
Life, almost quite wasted in the sordid
Drudgery of Sin.</p>
               <p>What a generous Emulation then
should these illustrious <hi>Examples,</hi> we
have mentioned, kindle in the Breasts
of you that are Young! With what an
Holy Ambition should they inspire you,
to become the early <hi>Candidates</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion!
Who knows in what eminent
Services it may please your Maker to
employ You? And who knows what
signal Favours and Tokens of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51029:91"/>
Love, he may confer on you, if
you consecrate to him the <hi>first</hi> of your
Strength, and the <hi>best</hi> of your Time?</p>
               <p>But the Example, which of all others
shines with the greatest <hi>Glory,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
the sweetest <hi>Influence,</hi> that is
most capable both of raising your <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and of exciting your <hi>Imitation,</hi> is
that of our Blessed <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who came
into the World to teach us by his <hi>Life,</hi>
as well as to save us by his <hi>Death:</hi> He
was pleas'd to honour the <hi>Youthful</hi> state
of Life by passing through it,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>in the
Days of his Flesh,</hi> while he dwelt with
Men, and did not defer his Father's
Work to <hi>old Age</hi> (a Stage of Life, which
he never vouchsaf'd to enter on;) in his
very Childhood <hi>he wax'd strong in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 40.</note>
was filled with Wisdom, and the Grace
of God was upon him.</hi> His <hi>Soul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
in Divine <hi>Knowledg,</hi> as his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
did in <hi>Stature,</hi> and so he <hi>grew in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with God and Man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 52.</note> At <hi>Twelve</hi>
Years of Age he was found reasoning
with the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors in the Temple,<note place="margin">Ver. 42, 46, 47.</note>
with that <hi>Sense</hi> and Understanding that
amaz'd all the Auditors, and with that
<hi>Zeal</hi> that became him, who made it his
Delight to be <hi>about his Father's Business.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 49.</note>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:51029:92"/>
All the time he liv'd amongst Men may
be properly enough call'd the Time of
<hi>Youth,</hi> for there's reason to conclude from
his History in the Gospel, that he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
the whole of his Work before
he was advanc'd much beyond <hi>Thirty</hi>
Years. And what a glorious Example
does his short Life present us, a Life
without spot or blemish, without the
least sign of any inclination to Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least shew of Injustice or Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
towards <hi>Men,</hi> or the least
appearance of Disobedience or Indevoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards <hi>God:</hi> Nay, a Life spent in
the greatest Acts of <hi>Charity</hi> to Mankind,
and in the highest Elevations of <hi>Piety</hi> to
his Father: A Life that <hi>consum'd</hi> it self
in the <hi>Zeal of his House;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 17.</note> that expir'd in
a Sacrifice to the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and for
the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>So that you have not only the <hi>Precept,</hi>
but the <hi>Prescription</hi> too of your Creator
to engage you in your Duty. He by
whom you were <hi>made,</hi> by whom you
are <hi>preserv'd,</hi> by whom alone you can
be <hi>restor'd</hi> from a state of Sin, and by
whom you must be finally <hi>judg'd,</hi> was
pleas'd to assume humane Nature,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 17.</note> to be
made Man <hi>in all things</hi> (Sin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51029:92"/>
on purpose to exemplify the
Duty in our Text by his <hi>Life,</hi>
as well as to conquer Sin and Hell
by his <hi>Death.</hi> And since he calls
you to <hi>learn of him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28 29, 30.</note> to bear <hi>the Yoke</hi>
to which he meekly condescended to
bow his own sacred Neck, in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Years, surely <hi>'tis good</hi> for you to
stoop to that <hi>Yoke in your Youth</hi> too.<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 27.</note>
Ought you not to apply your selves
as well to his <hi>Example</hi> for Direction,
as to his <hi>Sufferings</hi> for Salvation?
And is it not both for your Honour
and Interest to be conformable to that
blessed Life, that was first <hi>taken up</hi> to
instruct you, and then <hi>laid down</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
you?</p>
               <p>2. Consider how small that Oblation
is, which is requir'd of your hands,
when your <hi>whole</hi> Life is claim'd as the
Right of your Creator; seeing 'tis
but a <hi>part</hi> of it, that can be directly
and immediately offer'd to him. The
<hi>Secular</hi> Affairs that the Necessities of
your Bodies engage you in, and <hi>Sleep</hi>
together with the other Reparations of
Nature that are requisite to make
those frail Tabernacles Tenantable, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51029:93"/>
between 'em so <hi>great</hi> a share of the
Time of Life, that 'tis but a <hi>little</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it that can be allotted to Pious
Exercises, how soon soever you apply
your selves to the practice of 'em; and
will you grudg your Maker this small
<hi>share</hi> of your Time, for the <hi>whole</hi> of
which you entirely depend on him?
Can you think much to allow a part of
every day to Devotion, to the immediate
Service of God, and for the Welfare of
your Souls, when he allows you so large
a part of your Time to provide for the
present Ease and Welfare of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in procuring them the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of Life? Is it not more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to grudg that these Houses of Clay
should have so <hi>much</hi> of your Care
and Time, and that your Souls, nay,
and your Creator should have so <hi>little</hi>
of them? And ought you not rather to
study how to improve even that Time
which you spend in supporting and
accommodating this animal Life, so as
to render it subservient to the great
Ends of honouring your Maker, and
of saving your Souls, than to contrive
Excuses for entirely squandering away
the <hi>best</hi> part of that <hi>little</hi> Time in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51029:93"/>
Vanity and <hi>Sin,</hi> which you ought to
devote to the Holy Exercises of <hi>Piety</hi>
and <hi>Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And (once again) can you think
you shall bring an acceptable Sacrifice,
if after the consumption of the <hi>prime</hi>
of your Days in Vanity, you should
come to offer only some of your <hi>last</hi>
hours to your Creator? Will the
Days, in which you will confess you
<hi>have no Pleasure</hi> your selves, be a
proper Offering for him to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in? Is it fit to reserve only the
Blind and Lame and Sick for sacred
Services? May not such a Return be
reasonably expected to every such
Oblation, as God by the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi>
makes to the profane <hi>Iews</hi> in
another case;<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Offer it now to thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
will he be pleas'd with thee, or
accept thy Person? saith the LORD
of Hosts.</hi> Would you not have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear that such nauseous Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would be cast back as <hi>Dung upon
your Faces?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 3.</note> And that you would have
an Answer somewhat like that, which
you may imagine a Subject would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
who after having wasted his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51029:94"/>
Youth and Strength in bearing Arms
against his Soveraign, should come on
Crutches in his Old Age to tender
himself to be listed under his Banner?
Such a kind of Answer, I say, as such
an inveterate Rebel might expect; but
as much more terrible as it is a greater
Crime to sin against the great Creator
than to offend a Creature, and as the
Resentments of the <hi>Living God</hi> are
more dreadful than the Anger of a
<hi>Mortal Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. To conclude, Consider whether
the <hi>largest</hi> Portion of that little Time,
which you can possibly spend in the
Service of God here, makes any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
when compar'd with an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
to be employ'd in the pleasant
Contemplation and Enjoyment of him
hereafter. Can you think much to
dedicate the few Moments God is
pleas'd to lend you in <hi>this</hi> World
to him, who will reward the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of those Moments with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Bliss in the <hi>next,</hi> among those
Blessed Ones, whose <hi>Happiness</hi> as well
as <hi>Business</hi> it is to be perpetually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to the Service of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51029:94"/>
who enjoy Immortal <hi>Youth,</hi> and
feel an unconceivable Pleasure in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
it <hi>wholly</hi> in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Perfections, in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of his Praises, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Performance of his Will, and in
the perfect Enjoyment of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?</p>
               <p>Can it be thought that any of
those Blessed Spirits that are posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of this Glory, can think much
that they spent a little Time here
below to obtain it? May it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be suppos'd that they all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
wish (if such a Wish be
consistent with that perfect State of
Bliss) that they had improv'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Minute of that little Time which
their Creator allotted them in this
World, to his Glory? 'Tis not to
be doubted, that the Holy Angels
and Saints in Heaven do incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worship and serve their Maker
with the greatest Alacrity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because they constantly behold
his Face, and are always enamour'd
of his Glory: They are under a
continual impression of the Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51029:95"/>
and Goodness of his Will, and
know perfectly well that their own
Excellency and Happiness consists in
their exact Conformity to it; and
accordingly they find unexpressible
Delights in doing his Pleasure: And
if they count not an Eternity <hi>too much</hi>
for the Service of their Creator, can
you think the short Time of your
sojourning here below <hi>too large</hi> an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for him?</p>
               <p>Seeing then the Law of your <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
and the Dictates of <hi>Reason;</hi>
the Importunities of the Divine <hi>Word,</hi>
and the Warnings of the Holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
the <hi>Command</hi> of your Maker,
