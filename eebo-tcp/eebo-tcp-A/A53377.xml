            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The only Deſign of the Company of Fiſhermen, By the Bill depending in the Honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> as far as relates to themſelves is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THat thereby all the Fiſhermen may be equally known to the Government, as well as thoſe of the Company; and when their Majeſties Service requires any number of them, that the Admiralty may, out of all ſuch as get their Livelihood by fiſhing in publick waters, be ſupplied with thoſe that are beſt able to ſerve, and with due regard to the condition of their ſeveral Ages, Families and Trade.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe that are not of the Company, may not for want of a Regiſter, and by hiding themſelves during a Preſs, have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage when the Preſs is over, of returning to their Employ, and thereby get all the Trade into their own hands. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Fiſhermen may be free from thoſe great abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Preſs-maſters and Pinnaces, who take away as well Maſters of Veſſels, as common Saylors, and many times all the Men on board; leaving the charge of their Veſſels, freighted for a <hi>London</hi> Voyage, to a Boy or two; by which means their Freights of Fiſh have been many times wholly loſt, and the Veſſels indangered.</p>
            <p>And as this Act will be to the benefit of the Fiſhermen in general, ſo appointing a Regiſtry, as in the Act will evidently be, to the great advantage of the publick; in that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thereby the Government may know the Fiſhermen, their Names and Qualifications, as well as the Watermen are known on the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> and under the ſame reſtriction may be ſupplied, within the Company's limits, with ſome thousands of Men fit for Service, whilſt the reſt of the Fiſhermen may go on ſafely and quietly in their Employs: Whereas they now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally retire into remote places in time of Impreſſing, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the publick; and ſuch of them as are Impreſſed, do generally ſtand the Government in three or four pounds a man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Markets of <hi>London,</hi> and places adjacent, may be in time of War as plentifully ſupplied with all ſorts of Fiſh as in times of Peace, at one third part of the preſent price; thoſe of them that are left to the Fiſhing (after taking ſuch as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall like) having the priviledge to paſs to and fro with their Veſſels without interruption, as the Watermen do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Running or Imbezzling of the Cuſtoms (much practic'd by the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> men) will in a great meaſure be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, in having the Names and places of Abode of the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Regiſtred by the Company, who give great ſecurity to the Crown to prevent the Running of Cuſtoms; and do engage their Members by Oath not to conſent to do or conceal the ſame, but to diſcover ſuch Offenders, that they may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to Law.</p>
