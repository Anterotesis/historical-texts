            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Don't know what kind of a Preface I muſt write to find thee <hi>Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> an Epithete too often beſtow'd without a Cauſe. The Author of this Work has been as ſparing of what we call <hi>Good Nature,</hi> as moſt Readers are now adays. So I'm afraid his Tranſlator and Commentator is not to expect much more than has been ſhew'd them. What's worſe, there are but two ſorts of taking Prefaces, as there are but two kinds of Prologues to Plays; for, Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> was doubtleſs in the right, when he ſaid, That if Thunder and Lightning could not fright an Audience into Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, the ſight of the Poet with a Rope about his Neck, might work them into Pity. Some indeed have bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied many of you into an Applauſe, and rail'd at your Faults, that you might think them without any; and others, more ſafely, have ſpoken kindly of you, that you might think, or at leaſt ſpeak as favourably of them, and be flatter'd into Patience. Now I fancy there's nothing
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:60542:5"/>
leſs difficult to attempt than the firſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; for, in this bleſſed Age, 'tis as eaſy to find a Bully without Courage, as a Whore without Beauty, or a Writer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wit; though thoſe qualifications are ſo neceſſary in their reſpective Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: The miſchief is, that you ſeldom allow any to rail beſides your ſelves, and and cannot bear a Pride which ſhocks your own. As for wheadling you into a liking of a Work, I muſt confeſs it ſeems the ſafeſt way; but tho Flattery pleaſes you well when 'tis particular, you hate it, as little concerning you, when 'tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Then we Knights of the Quill are a ſtiff-neck'd Generation, who as ſeldom care to ſeem to doubt the worth of our Writings, and their being lik'd, as we love to flatter more than one at a time; and had rather draw our Pens, and ſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p for the Beauty of our Works (as ſome Errant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ls us'd to do for that of their Miſtreſſes) to the laſt drop of our Ink. And truly this Submiſſion which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wheadles you into Pity, as ſeldom decoys you into Love, as the aukward Cringing of an Antiquated Fop, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyleſs as he's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly, affects an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:60542:5"/>
Fair One. Now we as little value your Pity, as a Lover his Miſtreſs's, well ſatisfi'd that 'tis only a leſs uncivil way of diſmiſſing us. But what if neither of theſe two ways will work upon you, of which doleful Truth ſome of our Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights ſtand ſo many living Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Why, then truly I can think on no other way at preſent, but blending the two into one; and, from this Marriage of huffing &amp; cringing, there will reſult a new kind of careleſs Medley, which, perhaps, will work upon both ſorts of Readers, thoſe who are to be hector'd, and thoſe whom we muſt creep to. At leaſt 'tis like to pleaſe by its Novelty, and 'twill not be the firſt Monſter that has pleas'd you, when regular Nature could not do it.</p>
            <p>If uncommon Mirth, lively Wit and deep Learning, wove into wholeſom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, a bold, good and vaſt Deſign admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably purſu'd, Truth ſet out in its true Light, and a Method how to arrive to its Oracle, can recommend a Work, I am ſure This has enough to pleaſe any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man. The three Books publiſh'd ſome time ſince, which are in a manner an intire Work, were kindly receiv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:60542:6"/>
Yet, in the <hi>French</hi> they come far ſhort of theſe two, which are alſo intire Pieces; for the Satire is all general here, much more obvious, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more entertaining. Even my long explanatory Preface was not thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, though I was ſo far from being allow'd Time to make it methodical, that at firſt only a few Pages were intended; yet as faſt as they were printed I wrote on, till it prov'd at laſt like one of thoſe Towns built little at firſt, then inlarg'd, where you ſee promiſcuouſly an odd va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all ſorts of irregular Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I hope the Remarks I give now will not pleaſe leſs; for, as I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the Work which they explain, I had more Time to make them, though as little to write them. It would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to give here a large Account of my Performance; for, after all, you Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders care no more for this or that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, or Pretence of <hi>Mr. Tranſlator,</hi> if the Verſion do's not pleaſe you, than we do for a blundering Cook's Excuſe after he has ſpoilt a good Diſh in the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Nor can the Firſt pretend to much Praiſe, beſides that of giving his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:60542:6"/>
Senſe in its full Extent, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying his Stile, if 'tis to be copied; ſince he has no ſhare in the Invention or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of what he tranſlates. Yet there was no ſmall difficulty in doing <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> Juſtice in that double Reſpect; the obſolete Words and turns of Phraſe, and dark Subjects, often as darkly treated, make the Senſe hard to be underſtood even by a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and it cannot be eaſy to give it the free eaſy Air of an Original; for even what ſeems moſt common Talk in one Language, is what's often the moſt difficult to be made ſo in another; and <hi>Horace</hi>'s Thoughts of Comedy may well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd to this:
<q>
                  <l>Creditur, ex medio quia res arceſſit, habere</l>
                  <l>Sudoris minimum; ſed habet Comoedia tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</l>
                  <l>Plus oneris, quantò veniae minus.</l>
               </q>
Far be it from me for all this to value my ſelf upon hitting the Words of Cant in which my drolling Author is ſo luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant; for tho ſuch words have ſtood me in good ſtead, I ſcarce can forbear think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf unhappy in having inſenſibly hoarded up ſo much Gibberiſh and <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſgate</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:60542:7"/>
Traſh in my Memory; nor could I forbear asking of my ſelf, as an <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinal ſaid on another account, <hi>D'onde hai tu pigliato tante Coglio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie? Where the Devil didſt thou rake up all theſe Fripperies?</hi>
            </p>

But thoſe men of Senſe and Honour, who love Truth, and the good of Mankind in general above all other things, will undoubtedly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this Work. I'll not gravely inſiſt upon its uſefulneſs, having ſaid enough of it in the Preface to the Firſt Part. I'll only add, That as <hi>Homer</hi> in his Odyſſes makes his Hero wander ten years through moſt Parts of the then known World, ſo <hi>Rabelais</hi> in a Three-months-Voyage makes <hi>Pantagruel</hi> take a view of almoſt all ſorts of People and Prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:60542:9"/>
Truth) is juſtly thought his Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; being writ with more Spirit, Salt and Flame, than the Firſt Part of his Works. At near <hi>70</hi> Years of Age, his <hi>Genius,</hi> far from being drain d, ſeem'd to have acquir'd freſh Vigor, and new Graces; the more it exerted itſelf; like thoſe Rivers which grow more deep, large, majeſtic and uſeful by their courſe. Thoſe, who accuſe the <hi>French</hi> of being as ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Wit, as laviſh of their Words, will find an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in our Author. I muſt confeſs indeed that my Countrymen, and other Southern Nations, temper the one with the other, in a manner, as they do their Wine with Water, often juſt daſhing the latter with a little of the firſt. Now here, Men love to drink their Wine pure; nay, ſometimes it will not ſatisfy, unleſs in its very quinteſſence, as in Brandies; though an Exceſs of this betrays want of Sobriety, as much as an Exceſs of Wit betrays a want of Judgment. But I muſt conclude, leſt I be juſtly tax'd with wanting both. I will only add, That as every Language has its peculiar Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeldom or never to be acquir'd by a

Foreigner, I cannot think I have given my Author thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place: But as none compell'd me to write, I fear to ask a Pardon, which yet the generous Temper of this Nation makes me hope to obtain. <hi>Albinus,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> who had written in <hi>Greek,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd in his Preface to be forgiven his Faults of Language; but <hi>Cato</hi> ask'd in deriſion, Whether any had forc'd him to write in a Tongue of which he was not an abſolute Maſter? <hi>Lucullus</hi> wrote an Hiſtory in the ſame Tongue, and ſaid, <hi>He had ſcatter'd ſome falſe</hi> Greek <hi>in it, to let the World know it was the work of a</hi> Roman. I'll not ſay as much of my Writings, in which I ſtudy to be as little incorrect as the hurry of Buſineſs, and ſhortneſs of Time will permit; but I may better ſay, as <hi>Tully</hi> did of the Hiſtory of his Conſulſhip, which he alſo had written in <hi>Greek,</hi> That what Errors may be found in the Diction, are crept in againſt my Intent. Indeed <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> the one a <hi>Greek,</hi> the other a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> wrote ſucceſsfully in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the latter is perhaps the

moſt perfect Model of the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Urbanity</hi> of that Tongue: But I ought not to hope for the ſucceſs of thoſe great Men.

               <p>After all, this may be the Relation of ſome of the <hi>Montluc</hi>'s Adventures, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſqu'd after our Author's way.

Thus we find <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> ſaying to Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> after Ding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dong and his Sheep were all drowned,
<q>Harkee me, my Friend <hi>Ihon,</hi> never did Man do me a good turn, but I return'd, or at leaſt acknowledg'd it; no, I ſcorn to be ungrateful, I never was, nor ever will be: Never did Man do me an ill one without ruing the day that he did it either in this World, or the next.</q>

                  <hi>CHaneph</hi> is Hypocriſy in <hi>Hebrew</hi>; ſo the Iſland of <hi>Chaneph</hi> is the Iſland of the Hypocrites; accordingly our Author ſays it was wholly inhabited by Sham-ſaints, Spiritual Comedians, Forms of Holineſs, Tumblers of Beads, diſſembling Mumblers of <hi>Avemaries,</hi> and ſo forth; poor ſorry Rogues, who wholly liv'd on the Alms that were given them by Paſſengers, like the Hermit of <hi>Lormont,</hi> between <hi>Blaye</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>: Thus he chiefly places the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Mendicant Friars among the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, becauſe their Convents have no Revenue but Mumping, and ſo they are oblig'd to affect a greater Devotion than thoſe Religious Orders who do not make a Vow of Poverty as theſe do.</p>
               <p>Our Author tells us that the <hi>Pantagruelian</hi> Fleet was becalm'd when it came in ſight of that Iſland, and was forc'd to tack from Larboard to Starboard, and from Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:60542:38"/>
to Larboard, yet could not get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, tho they had added Drablers to their Sails. By this he inſinuates that this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Crew of Hypocrites did put a ſtop to the progreſs of the Reformation, and the diſcovery of Truth in general; as when he himſelf was miſus'd by ſome of them in the Convent of Cordeliers at <hi>Fontenay le Comte,</hi> merely becauſe he ſtudied <hi>Greek.</hi> Theſe Beggarly Tribes had not the power to raiſe a Storm, like the nine Sail of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were going to the Council of <hi>Cheſil</hi>; they could do little more than hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the advancement of thoſe who ſearch'd after Truth. Thus we find, not only that the Fleet could not proceed, but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ship's Company in a manner fell aſleep, doz'd, and were out of ſorts, and off the Hinges. At laſt this is remedied by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe poor Hypocrites Seventy eight thouſand little Half-Crowns, and by eating and drinking; which perhaps may mean, That provided thoſe poor hungry Curs have Meat and Drink, or Money to get Food, which is all they beg, they ceaſe to bark, and will ſuffer you to go on without any further Impediment. This has been and is ſtill obſervable in <hi>France</hi> and other parts, among ſome of thoſe begging Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; whereas your <hi>Jeſuits, Dominicans, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins, Bernardins, Celeſtins, Theatins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſuch as were in the Nine Sail,</hi> are not to
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:60542:38"/>
be brib'd or pacified ſo eaſily. One of Theſe whoſe Poetry and Criticiſms are deſervedly eſteemed among us, has reflected on our Author's admirable Satire too ſeverely for a man of his Senſe, tho not for one of his Order; I mean Father <hi>Rapin</hi>; but who could expect leſs from a Jeſuit, and a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit too whoſe Sodality is ſatiriz'd in this Work?

               <p>This is true in more than one ſenſe; for did not Hypocrites beget others, ſome parts of the world would be very thin of people; then thoſe Sham-ſanctitoes and Hermitillons whom our Author means, are chiefly the young baſtardly Monaſtic Fry, the only Fruit many Nuns bear, by

<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:60542:40"/>
Daughter of the King of the <hi>Amaurots.</hi> And indeed, as there were no more Earls of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> that Name which ſignifies <hi>being vaniſh'd,</hi> was not altogether improper then. Thus <hi>Pantagruel</hi> comes from <hi>Paris</hi> to relieve that Country, and has a Bark full of Salt tied to his Girdle, with which he fills the mouths of the <hi>Dipſodes</hi>; which may imply the heat and combuſtion in which the People were there about the Tax on Salt; and, becauſe ſeveral of thoſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers were hang'd at <hi>Bourdeoux,</hi> where they were moſt outragious and ſtubborn, <hi>Rabelais</hi> makes <hi>Pantagruel</hi> the Inventer of the uſe of <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> which is Hemp, probably becauſe he advis'd to have many of them put to death. Indeed I have not yet found that <hi>Anthony de Bourbon</hi> came thither to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, Governor of that Country for <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France</hi>; but, as the Coneſtable of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who, with that Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> had commanded in <hi>Picardy</hi> that year, came into <hi>Xaintonge</hi> to puniſh the Rebels, 'tis very likely the Duke came thither alſo; and perhaps Hiſtorians are ſilent in the matter, becauſe he only came as a Volunteer, and the Caſe did not ſeem worth employing at once a King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a High Coneſtable of <hi>France,</hi> and a Prince of the Royal Family. And this may be the Reaſon why our Satirical
<pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:60542:41"/>
Hiſtorian has chus'd to burleſque that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, for doubtleſs there could be no honour to the Duke in being concern'd in it, principally under others; though it were but in complaiſance to the Princeſs of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> his new Wife, and her Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Honey-Moon being then hardly paſt.</p>

This Paſſage, doubtleſs, refers to ſome of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi>'s Adventures, hardly to be diſcover'd in our Age; yet known in that during which he liv'd. <hi>Panurge</hi>'s Cowardice and Impudence ſuits pretty well with that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Valence</hi>'s Character; as appears by what I ſaid of his daring to preach before Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> with a Hat and Cloak on, like a <hi>Geneva</hi> Divine, and
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:60542:41"/>
then not having the courage to go on, but leaving off in the midſt of his Sermon, (though the Queen abetted him, and her preſence ſecur'd him) as ſoon as the Coneſtable of <hi>Moutmorency</hi> ſpoke two words againſt his way of preaching.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Rabelais</hi> takes an opportunity to bring in a Story, which, as well as ſome other things of as odious a nature, I would have omitted, did not many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men deſpiſe a maim'd or imperfect Book, as much as ſome Selfiſh Women hate a Male in thoſe Circumſtances. That Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is what is ſaid of <hi>Edward</hi> V. King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Francis Villon</hi> the witty Rogue, of whom I have already ſpoken. But, with our Author's good leave, this Story is as falſe as 'tis filthy, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, though we ſhould ſuppoſe there is a miſtake in the Printing (as there are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands even in the beſt Editions of this Work I have ſeen yet.) For none can imagin that <hi>Rabelais</hi> was ſo little vers'd in Hiſtory, as not to know that <hi>Edward</hi> V. died a Child, and can neither have been coſtive in his Old Age, nor familiar with <hi>Villon:</hi> who, according to <hi>Paſquier,</hi> muſt have been hang'd before the Reign of that unfortunate Prince, and perhaps before his Birth.

upon at that Rate, by a Buſſooning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; ſince, though he was not one of the wiſeſt Heads, yet he was one of the braveſt Warriors of his Time, having fought Nine pitch'd Battels, generally on Foot, and at laſt gloriouſly overcome all his Enemies: So that the Witty Jeſter would hardly have offer'd to have told him, that the ſight of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh's <hi>Oriflamb,</hi> or <hi>Royal Standard,</hi> would have ſcar'd him into a Looſeneſs.

               <p>
                  <hi>O want of Veneration! fools they ſeem'd.</hi> That is, thoſe who had been fooliſh enough to ſuffer themſelves to be ſheer'd and fleec'd thus, appear'd ſuch as they were, when
<pb n="lxxiv" facs="tcp:60542:44"/>
Ignorance had been expell'd, I mean, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Fools; neither did the Veneration which uſes to be paid to the Church, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wiſer ſort from laughing at them, or at leaſt from pitying their Sillineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, perſevering, with long Breves, at laſt no more they ſhall be empty greedy fools.</hi> Thoſe long Breves ſhould be the Sacred Books, which may be call'd ſo in oppoſition to the <hi>Roman</hi> Breviary, in which their Contents are as maim'd, imperfect and abbreviated, as the vain Imaginations of Superſtition are ſpun out there to a tedious length; at leaſt they mean the Books written by the Learned, many of which are long. So the People who appear'd fooliſh, being no more blinded by a Ridiculous Superſtition, will no more gape after it, nor be greedy of it; being fill'd with ſound Knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For they ſhall ſhell the Shrub's delicious Fruit, whoſe Flow'r they in the Spring ſo much had fear'd.</hi> That is, They will ſhell the Beans in Cod; which is as if he had ſaid, Truth that lay long conceal'd, and before was known but by a few, will be reveal'd to the World; and as much as at firſt it was hated, deſpis'd and fear'd, at its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſo much the ſweeter and more delicious will its Fruit prove, when the World ſhall have had a taſte of it.</p>
               <p>By theſe Beans in Cod we may alſo part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand our Author's Work. <hi>The
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:60542:44"/>
Beans</hi> are the Myſtery, <hi>the Cod</hi> is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem and outward Dreſs; which is good for nothing but to wrap up what is within it; neither ought we to feed upon it, but ſolely on what it contains. So we might fix the period of Ignorance, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the New <hi>Aera,</hi> or Reſtoration of Learning, at the Year 1550. at which time it began to bear good Fruit, and this Fifth Book was written, though it was not publiſh'd till after our Author's death, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe it ſpoke too plain. This makes him foretell the ſpeedy oblivion of whole Cartloads of Books that were dull, dark and miſchievous, though they ſeem'd flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, floriſhing and flowry, gay and gawdy as ſo many Papillons [Butterflies] by which he ſeems to play upon the Word <hi>Papa,</hi> as in <hi>Papimany,</hi> and in the Sixth Chapter of the <hi>Pantagruelian</hi> Prognoſtication, where the King of the <hi>Papil'ons</hi> or Butterflies, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly means the Pope.</p>
               <p>After all, as that pretended Propheſy is written in the ſtile of thoſe of <hi>Noſtradamus,</hi> it appears at firſt as dark and unintelligible as that Aſtrologer's Rhim'd Whimſies; and though there is a meaning in our Author's, and none in the dreaming Stargazer's, I would as little have troubled my ſelf to find out things paſt in the firſt, as I would look for things to come in the latter, were not this needful to confirm what I have ſaid of
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:60542:45"/>
our Author's Deſign, and to ſhew the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of this Myſtical Work; which tho much admir'd, had doubtleſs been much more beneficial, if moſt of it had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd ſoon after it was written. I mean after the Author's death; for, as to have done that before, would undoubtedly have haſten'd it, and have expos'd him and his Writings to the Flames; he did not deſire to be underſtood by every one, and only wrote for the Learned, as the Cardinals <hi>Du Bellay,</hi> and <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Maillezais, Andrew Tiraquel,</hi> his Patrons, and ſuch men as hated Ignorance, that they might effectually, though underhand, forward the downfal of Superſtition, its Offspring. Therefore, to blind the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, he turns off the ſenſe of the Propheſy, and falls a praiſing <hi>Colinet, Marot, Saingelais, &amp;c.</hi> the greatneſs of whoſe Wit, and the Elegancy of whoſe Stile, he extolls to the Skies, not without ſome little touch of Panegyrical Satire all the while, as appears by what he ſays of their Crimſin Alamode Rhetorical Stile. This he chiefly runs upon to inſinuate to thoſe whom he fear'd, that what he ſaid of the Jubile's Year is only meant of the Improvements made in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more particularly in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue. So we find him begging of the <hi>French</hi> Writers, his Contemporaries, that they would be pleas'd to admit him as Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <head>Explanatory Remarks ON THE Firſt Chapter of the Fifth Book·</head>
               <p>THE Ringing Iſland can mean nothing but the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are all perform'd at the ſound of large, middleſiz'd, little, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Bells. They are rung at <hi>Matins,</hi> Maſs, Noon, Veſpers, Sermons, and the Salutation to the Virgin every day, on the Eves or <hi>Vigiles</hi> of Holy-days, at Proceſſions and at Stations; and, whenever the Prieſt lifts up the <hi>Wafer-god,</hi> a little Bell is rung, that the People may fall down and adore that piece of Dough, which, they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, made Heaven and Earth, though 'twere made that very morning by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and ſome of the ſame ſtamp be ſhown in every Pariſh. Beſides, when the Prieſt carries the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> a diminutive Bell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tingles before him. Thus Bells are often rung where-ever there is a Monaſtery, Church, Chappel or Hermitage, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:60542:46"/>
the People's Devotion, ſummon them together, diſmiſs them, and make them come again. Add to this, That whatever is ſaid of the Ringing Iſland in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters, cannot well be adapted to any thing but the Popiſh Eccleſiaſtics; ſo thoſe who pretended to explain theſe Books only by printing at the end of ſome <hi>French</hi> Editions twenty or thirty Names, which (without the leaſt reaſon) they call a Key, either never read them, or had a deſign to impoſe on the Reader more than our Author; elſe they would never have ſaid, that the <hi>Ringing Iſland</hi> is <hi>England.</hi> I own there is much Ringing there, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are famous for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that a Recreation; but this Book was writ during King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign, at which time the Reformation had prevail'd here; and though our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mentions the Knights of the Garter in the Fifth Chapter, while he ſpeaks of the Knight-hawks of the Ringing Iſland, it does not follow that he meant <hi>England,</hi> ſince he only places the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> among the <hi>Roman</hi> Eccleſiaſtics, which was judiciouſly done, becauſe they make a vow never to marry; read the Breviary, and have Livings like Abbots. Even that Paſſage proves that the Ringing Iſland is not <hi>England</hi>; ſince <hi>Aedituus</hi> makes one of his Iſland's Knight-hawks look wiſtfully on

Aedituus</hi> adds, <hi>He is told there are ſuch in your World who wear goodly Garters below the Knee, with an Inſcription about them which condemns him who ſhall think ill of it,</hi> (qui mal y penſe) <hi>to be bewtay'd and conski<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> So 'tis plain there were none ſuch in the Ringing Iſland. Then in the Sixth Chapter <hi>Aedituus</hi> ſays, that all the good things which they have in his Iſland come from every part of the other World, except ſome of the Northern Regions, particularly from <hi>Touraine,</hi> our Author's Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that the Income of the Duke of that Country could not afford him to eat his Belly full of Beans and Beacon, becauſe his Predeceſſors had been more than liberal to the Birds of the Ringing Iſland, that they might there munch it, twiſt it, cram it, gorge it, craw it, riot it, junket it, and tickle it off; ſtuffing their Puddings with dainty Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hermit, whom the <hi>Pantagrueliſts</hi> met, aſſur'd them they ſhould not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Ringing Iſland, unleſs they faſted four days, becauſe it was then one of

               <p>We are told that the <hi>Siticines</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Birds; thoſe Birds are thoſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks, who raiſe themſelves by Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and holineſs of Life (if you will believe them) ſoaring above the things of this Earth, on which we poor groveling Layles crawl. <hi>Aedituus</hi> would make <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> ſenſible of this, when he tells him that thoſe Birds, which look'd like men, eat and drank, ſlept and bill'd like men, were nothing leſs than men, being neither Secular nor Layies.</p>
               <p>Their ſpacious, coſtly, magnificent Cages, admirable in their Architecture, are their Churches; which appears the plainer by reaſon of the Bells, which our Author ſays were above them.</p>

               <p>THE Iſland of Tools treats of Things which are not much leſs odious than the Cages of the Popehawk and Biſhhawk. There's a Catch in the Prologue to the Fourth Book which is in a manner a Key to this Chapter: 'Tis that which follows,
<q>
                     <l>Since Tools without their Hafts are uſeleſs Lumber,</l>
                     <l>And Hatchets without Helves are of that number,</l>

               <p>AFTER the Venereal Games, in the Iſland of Tools, we have thoſe of Chance, in the Sharping Iſland. 'Tis ſaid to be lean, ſandy, barren and unpleaſant, becauſe, in the main ſeldom any thing is to be got by Games of Hazard, honeſtly. What is got at one time is generally loſt at another, and goes as eaſily as it comes; for moſt Gameſters, often prodigal of what they have got, ſeldom conſider, that ſhould their Profits at the Year's end ballance their Loſſes, they ſtill will be found to have loſt their time, and ſquander'd away part of what ſhould have made the Scales even between Profit and Loſs; and ſo though
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:60542:54"/>
they have won much, they are poorer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times than they would have been had they not plaid at all. 'Tis obvious that the two little white ſquare Rocks, with eight equal Points in the ſhape of a Cube, are the Dice; the ſix different Stories are their ſix different ſides and numbers, that aſcend from 1.2.3.4.5 to 6. Of which twenty one Points <hi>Rabelais</hi> makes ſo many Devils, becauſe they tempt and bewitch men ſo much; though, as he obſerves, the Land is barren and unpleaſant; for, after all, Gaming is a tedious Repetition of the ſame thing, and a continual gazing upon the Dice or Cards without any pleaſing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Not to ſpeak of the Fear and Agony of the Gameſters, their Toil, when they paſs whole Nights at play, and break their Reſt, and not their Faſt; their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and Curſes when they have loſt, the mean Actions by which they debaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to borrow, or pawn; and the Quarrels, and their ſad Conſequences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greateſt Friends on the account of Play. So that <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Pilot was in the right, when he told him that more Wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ks had happen'd about thoſe Square Rocks, than about all the others in the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>After the Games of Hazard, comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is as deceitful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t leaſt; I mean the Trick of Reliques. The Author places
<pb n="xcvi" facs="tcp:60542:55"/>
them in the Iſland of Sharping, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſharps the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Layity out of great Sums of Money by the doubtful Remains of as doubtful Saints, much more than by the real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the True. Accordingly our Travellers, with a world of pother and ado, Formalities and Antick Tricks, were bleſt at laſt with a ſight of a Phial of <hi>Sang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,</hi> that is, as I have obſerv'd on the 43d Chapter of the Fourth Book, what they impudently pretend to be our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Blood; but after all, 'twas only <hi>the ſcurvy Face of a roaſted Conny.</hi> Mr. <hi>Emiliane,</hi> in his Book of the Frauds of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, tells us, that ſuch a kind of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique is in <hi>Italy</hi> to this day: That pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blood is ſhewn with great Ceremonies, and ſtore of Flambeaux, Torches, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifi'd Tapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Author ſays, that they ſaw nothing worth ſpeaking of in that Iſland but a good Face ſet upon an ill Game, which ſuits well with the Carriage of thoſe who ſhew ſuch Sham Reliques; accordingly he ſays they alſo ſaw the Shells of the two Eggs formerly laid and hatch'd by <hi>Laeda</hi>; which indeed are moſt worthy being plac'd among ſuch Reliques.</p>
               <p>The Hats and Caps of the Manufactury of the Place <hi>(Chapeaux de Caſſade)</hi> may be mention'd to banter ſome Prelates who had a mind to be Cardinals, and perhaps
<pb n="xcvii" facs="tcp:60542:55"/>
were fool'd out of the Money which they gave to the Pope's Favourites to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Avoir des Caſſades</hi> is a Burleſque Expreſſion; ſuch, as when we ſay, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gull'd,</hi> or <hi>ſwallow a Gudgeon.</hi> Yet, as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belais</hi> ſays, that ſome of the Company bought a piece of <hi>Laeda</hi>'s Eggſhells for a morſel of Bread, and then immediately adds, that they bought thoſe Hats and Caps, which, he fear'd, would turn to no very good account, he may either mean that they were cheated there, or bought ſome ſham <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> and ſuch Holy Trumpery. Whatever it be, we find, that in the next Chapter they went through the Wicket; and, for offering to ſell them again, were clapt into Lob's Pound, by order of Gripe-men-all, Arch-duke of the Furr'd-Law-Cats.</p>

               <p>TO attain to the knowledge of Truth, 'tis neceſſary to take a Survey of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; ſo our Travellers ſteering their Courſe to its Oracle, ſail towards the Queendom of <hi>Whims</hi>; by which, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, may be underſtood all ſorts of ſtrange whimſical Notions, and <hi>Alchymy</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, as they come near that Country, that is, imitate the fantaſtic wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering People that fill their Heads with all the ſtrange Imaginations which we call Whimſies, ſome ſudden Guſts or Scuds of Wind ariſe, and the Wind ſhifting from Point to Point, is at no certainty: They tack about, the Guſts increaſe, and by Fits blow at once from ſeveral quarters. This very well repreſents an unfix'd Mind, that unmethodically applies itſelf to many things at once, then leaves them to think on others, which ſoon reſign the working Brain to a Crowd of ſucceeding raw and undigeſted Notions.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of the Ship orders the Sheers to be let fly, for fear of overſetting the Ship, and is for running adrift, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize, as the Author calls it; thoſe Guſts

               <p>After all, this may refer to ſome of thoſe doubtful Points about which the Learned were as idly buſy in that Age, as to this day many in This are about them and others, placing Religion more in Notions than in Actions, and neglecting the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to talk of the Theory: Such Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are thoſe of Free-will, Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which the People reap as little Benefit as the Teachers gain Glory, when they diſplay their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ignorance about them. <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Ship that is ſtranded, or run aground, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to <hi>weather-coil</hi> and break through the Whirlwind, after it has been toſt by it, is an Image of thoſe who thinking to eaſe their fluctuating Minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at laſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on ſome new Nation, which at firſt ſeems plauſible to ſome, but they are ſoon g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S Epiſtle Dedicatory To the moſt Illuſtrious PRINCE, And moſt Reverend <hi>Odet,</hi> Cardinal <hi>de Chaſtillon.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOU know, <hi>Most Illuſtrious Prince,</hi> how often I have been and am dayly preſt by great Numbers of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons, to proceed in the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruelian</hi> Fables; they tell me that
<pb facs="tcp:60542:80"/>
many languiſhing, ſick and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Perſons peruſing them, have deceiv'd their grief, paſs'd their time merrily, and been inſpir'd with new Joy and Comfort. I common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, that I aim'd not at Glory and Applauſe, when I diverted my ſelf with writing; but only deſign'd to give by my Pen, to the abſent who labour under Affliction, that little help which at all times I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtrive to give to the Preſent that ſtand in need of my Art, and Service. Sometimes I at large relate to them, how <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in ſeveral places, and particularly in Lib. 6. <hi>Epidem.</hi> deſcribing the Inſtitution of the Phyſician his diſciple, and alſo <hi>Soranus</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Orbaſius, Galen, Hali, Abbas,</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, have deſcended to particulars in the preſcription of his Motions, Deportment, Looks, Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Gracefulneſs, Civility, Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of face, Cloaths, Beard, Hair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hands, Mouth, even his very Nails<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As if he were to play the Part of a Lover, in ſome Comedy, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:60542:80"/>
the Liſts to Fight ſome Enemy. And indeed the practice of Phyſic is properly enough compar'd by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to a Fight, and alſo to a Farce acted between three Perſons, the Patient, the Phyſician, and the Diſeaſe. Which Paſſage has ſometimes put me in mind of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi> ſaying to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> her Father. One day ſhe came before him in a very gorgeous looſe laſcivious Dreſs: which very much diſpleas'd him, though he did not much diſcover his diſcontent. The next day, ſhe put on another, and in a modeſt Garb, ſuch as the chaſt <hi>Roman</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wore, came into his preſence. The kind Father could not then forbear expreſſing the pleaſure which he took to ſee her, ſo much alter'd, and ſaid to her: <hi>Oh! how much more this Garb becomes, and is commendable in the Daughter of</hi> Auguſtus. But ſhe, having her excuſe ready, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>This day,</hi> Sir, <hi>I dreſt my ſelf to pleaſe my Father's Eye; yeſterday to gratify that of my Husband.</hi> Thus, diſguis'd in looks and garb, nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:60542:81"/>
as formerly was the Faſhion, with a rich and pleaſant Gown with four ſleeves which was called <hi>Philonium,</hi> according to <hi>Petrus Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus in</hi> 6. <hi>Epidem.</hi> a Phyſician might anſwer to ſuch as might find the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> indecent: <hi>Thus have I accoutred my ſelf, not that I am Proud of appearing in ſuch a Dreſs; but for the ſake of my Patient, whom alone I wholly deſign to pleaſe, and no ways offend or diſſatisfie.</hi> There is alſo a Paſſage in our Father <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> in the Book I have nam'd, which cauſes Some to ſweat, diſpute and labour; not indeed to know whether the Phyſician's frowning, diſcontented, and moroſe Look ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Patient ſad, and his joyful, ſerene and pleaſing Countenance rejoyce him, for experience teaches us that this is moſt certain; But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Senſations of grief, or pleaſure, are produc'd by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Patient, obſerving his motions and qualities in his Phyſician, and drawing from thence coniectures of the end, and cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe
<pb facs="tcp:60542:81"/>
of his diſeaſe, as, by his pleaſing Look, joyful and deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Events, and by his ſorrowful and unpleaſing Air, ſad and diſmal Conſequences; or whether thoſe Senſations be produced by a transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſerene or gloomy, aerial or terreſtrial, joyful or melancholic Spirits of the Phyſician, into the Perſon of the Patient, as it is the Opinion of <hi>Plato, Averroes</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Above all things the beſt Authors have given particular directions to Phyſicians about the Words, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and Converſe, which they ought to have with their Patients, every one aiming at one point, that is, to rejoyce them without offending <hi>God,</hi> and in no ways whatſoever to vex or diſpleaſe them. Which cauſes <hi>Herophilus</hi> much to blame that Phyſician who being ask'd by a Patient of his, <hi>Shall I dye</hi>? impudently made him this Anſwer:
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60542:82"/>

            </p>
            <p>Another who had a mind to know the ſtate of his diſtemper, asking him after our merry <hi>Patelin</hi>'s way: <hi>Well, Doctor, do's not my Water tell you I ſhall dye?</hi> He fooliſhly anſwer'd, No; if <hi>Latona</hi> the Mother of thoſe lovely Twins, <hi>Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> begot thee. <hi>Galen.</hi> lib. 4. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 6. <hi>Epidem.</hi> blames much alſo <hi>Quintus</hi> his Tutor, who, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain noble Man of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſaying to him, <hi>You have been at break-faſt, my Master, your breath ſmells of Wine</hi>; anſwered arrogantly, <hi>yours ſmells of Fever, which is the better ſmell of the two? Wine or a putrid Fever?</hi> But the Calumny of certain <hi>Cannibals Miſanthropes,</hi> perpetual Eaves-droppers, has been ſo foul and exceſſive, that it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered my patience; and I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to write one jot more. For the leaſt of their Detractions
<pb facs="tcp:60542:82"/>
were, that my Books are all ſtuffed with various Hereſies, of which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they could not ſhow one ſingle Inſtance; much indeed of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and facetious fooleries, neither offending God nor the King: (And truly I own they are the Subject, and only Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As much was done by his Son, our moſt gracious, virtuous, and bleſſed Sovereign, <hi>Henry,</hi> whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven long preſerve; ſo that he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you his Royal privilege, and particular protection, for me againſt my ſlandering adverſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60542:83"/>You kindly condeſcended ſince, to confirm me theſe happy News at <hi>Paris,</hi> and alſo lately when you viſited my Lord Cardinal <hi>du Bellay,</hi> who for the benefit of his health, after a lingring diſtemper, was retired to St. <hi>Maur</hi> that place (or rather Paradiſe) of ſalubrity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, conveniency, and all deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Country-Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>my Lord,</hi> under ſo glorious a Patronage, I am emboldened once more to draw my pen, undaunted now and ſecure; with hopes that you will ſtill prove to me againſt the power of Detraction, a ſecond <hi>Galli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> had ſome knowledge of the Bible, and had convers'd with the Chriſtians of his time, as appears <hi>Lib. 11. De Uſu Partium; Lib. 2. de dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentiis Pulſuum, cap. 3,</hi> and <hi>ibid. Lib. 3. cap. 2.</hi> and <hi>Lib. de rerum affectibus</hi> (if it be <hi>Galen</hi>'s) Yet 'twas not for any ſuch Veneration of Holy-Writ that he took Care of his own Health.

            <p>This made him boldly ſay, that he did not deſire to be eſteem'd a <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> if from his twenty eighth Year to his old Age he had not liv'd in perfect health, except ſome ephemerous <note n="*" place="bottom">Fevers, that laſt but a Day, and are Cured with Reſt.</note> Fevers, of which he ſoon rid himſelf; Yet he was not naturally of the ſoundeſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his Stomach being evidently bad.

The Law allows it; the King would have it ſo: nay you have my advice for't; neither more nor leſs than the Law-Makers of Old did fully impower a Maſter to claim and ſeize his run-away Servant whereever he might be found.

This right Worſhipful Father <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whom we have here Nodding with his Crimſon Phyz, to be reveng'd on the <hi>Thebans,</hi> had got a Fairy Fox, who what ever miſchief he did, was never to be caught or wrong'd by any Beaſt that wore a Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60542:90"/>The Noble <hi>Vulcan</hi> here preſent had fram'd a Dog of Moneſian Braſs, and with long Puffing and Blowing put the Spirit of Life into him: he gave it you, you gave it your Miſs <hi>Europa,</hi> Miſs <hi>Europa</hi> gave it <hi>Minos, Minos</hi> gave it <hi>Procris, Procris</hi> gave it <hi>Cephalus.</hi> He was alſo of the Fairy kind, ſo that like the Lawyers of our age, he was too hard for all other ſorts of Creatures, nothing could ſcape the Dog: Now who ſhould happen to meet but theſe two?

            <p>The Caſe was brought before your Council; you protested that you would not act againſt the Fates; and the Fates were contradictory. In ſhort, the End and Reſult of the matter was, that to reconcile two contradictions was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in Nature. The very Pang put you into a ſweat, ſame Drops of which happ'ning to light on the Earth produced what the Mortals call <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers.</hi> All our Noble Conſiſtory for want of a Categorical Solution were ſeiz'd with ſuch a horrid Thirſt, that

            <p>After this manner, 'tis my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you ſhould petrify this Dog and this Fox.

               <p>THat day and the two following, they neither diſcovered Land nor any thing new; for they had formerly Sailed that way; but on the fourth they made an Iſland called <hi>Medamothy,</hi> of a fine and delightful Proſpect, by reaſon of the vaſt number of Light-Houſes and high Marble Towers in its Circuit, which is not leſs than that of <hi>Canada. Pantagruel,</hi> enquiring who Govern'd there, heard that it was King <hi>Philophanes,</hi> abſent at that time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of the Marriage of his Brother <hi>Philotheamon</hi> with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Engys.</hi>

               <p>Hearing this, he went aſhoar in the Harbour, and while every Ship's Crew Water'd, paſs'd his time in viewing divers Animals, Fiſhes, Birds, and other exotic and foreign Merchandiſes which were along the Walks of the Mole, and in the Markets of the Port.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60542:105"/>
Prince opened the Letters, the firſt thing he ſaid to him, was, Have you here the <hi>Gozal,</hi> the Heavenly Meſſenger? Yes, Sir, ſaid he, here it is ſwadled up in this Basket. It was a grey Pigeon taken out of <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s Dove-Houſe, whoſe youngones were juſt hatch'd when the Advice-Boat was going off.</p>
               <p>If any ill Fortune had befallen <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> he would have faſtened ſome black Ribbon to its Feet; but becauſe all things had ſucceeded happily hitherto, having caus'd it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt, he ty'd to its Feet a white Ribbon, and without any further delay, let it looſe. The Pigeon preſently flew away cutting the Air with an incredible ſpeed, as you know that there is no flight like a Pigeon's, eſpecially when it hath Eggs or Young Ones, through the extream care which Nature hath fixt in it to relieve, and be with its Young; inſomuch, that in leſs than two hours it compaſs'd in the Air, the long Tract which the Advice Boat with all her diligence, with Oars and Sails, and a fair Wind, had gone through in no leſs than three Days and three Nights, and was ſeen (as it went into the Dove-Houſe) in its Neſt. Whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> hearing that it had the white Ribbon on, was joyful and ſecure of his Son's wellfare. This was the Cuſtom of the Noble <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi> when they would have ſpeedy News of ſomething of great Concern, as the event of ſome Battel either by Sea or Land;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60542:105"/>
the Surrendring or Holding out of ſome ſtrong Place; the determination of ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Moment; the ſafe or unhappy Delivery of ſome Queen or great Lady; the Death or Recovery of their ſick Friends or Allies, and ſo forth. They uſed to take the <hi>Gozal,</hi> and had it carried from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Poſt, to the places whence they deſir'd to have News. The <hi>Gozal</hi> bearing either a black or white Ribbon, according to the Occurrences and Accidents, us'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their doubts at its return, making in the ſpace of one hour, more way through the Air, than thirty Poſt-Boys could have done in one natural day. May not this be ſaid to redeem and gain time with a vengeance, think you? For the like Service therefore, you may believe as a moſt true thing, that, in the Dove-Houſes of their Farms, there were to be found all the year long, ſtore of Pigeons hatching Eggs or rearing their young. Which may be eaſily done in <hi>Aviaries</hi> and <hi>Voleries,</hi> by the help of <hi>Saltpeter</hi> and the Sacred Herb <hi>Vervain.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Gozal</hi> being let fly, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> perus'd his Father <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s Letter, the Contents of which were as followeth.</p>

               <p>WE had ſtill the Wind at South South Weſt, and had been a whole day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Land.

               <p>The People there are much like your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot-pated <hi>Poitevins,</hi> ſave only that all of them, Men, Women, and Children, have their Noſes

               <p>You People of the other World, eſteem it a wonderful thing, that, out of the Family of the <hi>Fabii</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> on a certain day, which was the 13th of <hi>February,</hi> at a certain Gate, which was the <hi>Porta Carmentalis,</hi> ſince nam'd <hi>Scelerata,</hi> formerly ſituated at the foot of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> between the <hi>Tarpeian Rock</hi> and the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> March'd out againſt the <hi>Veientes</hi> of <hi>Etru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> three hundred and ſix Men bearing Arms, all related to each other, with five thouſand other Soldiers every one of them their Vaſſals, who were all ſlain near the River <hi>Cremera</hi> that comes out of the Lake of <hi>Beccano.</hi> Now from this ſame Country of <hi>Ennaſin</hi> in caſe of need, above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand all Relations, and of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, might March out. Their degrees of Conſanguinity and Alliance are very ſtrange, for being thus akin and allied to one another, we found that none was either Father or Mother, Brother or Siſter, Uncle or Aunt, Nephew or Neece, Son-in-Law or Daughter-in-Law, God-Father or God-Mother to the other, unleſs truly, a tall flat-nos'd old fellow, who, as I perceiv'd, call'd a little ſhitten-ars'd Girl of three or four years old, Father, and the Child call'd him Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>While we were there, a pleaſant Match was ſtruck up bewixt a Female call'd <hi>Pear</hi> (a tight thing as we thought, but by ſome who knew better things, ſaid to be quaggy and flabby) and a young ſoft Male, call'd <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> ſomewhat ſandy.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60542:122"/>
Pray, Mr. <hi>Poet,</hi> was <hi>Homer</hi> frying Congers when he writ the Deeds of <hi>Agamemnon? Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> readily anſwer'd; But do you think, Sir, that when <hi>Agamemnon</hi> did them, he made it his buſineſs to know if any in his Camp were frying Congers? The King thought it an Indecency that a <hi>Poet</hi> ſhould be thus a frying in a Kitchin; and the <hi>Poet</hi> let the King know that it was a more indecent thing for a King to be found in ſuch a place: I'll clap another ſtory upon the Neck of this, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> and will tell you what <hi>Briton Villandray</hi> anſwer'd one day to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were ſaying that at a certain Battle of King <hi>Francis</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Briton</hi> arm'd <hi>Capape</hi> to the Teeth, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like St. <hi>George</hi>; yet ſneack'd off, and play'd leaſt in ſight during the Ingagement. Blood and Oons, anſwer'd <hi>Briton,</hi> I was there and can prove it eaſily; nay, even where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you, my Lord, dar'd not have been. The Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reſent this as too raſh and ſawcy; But <hi>Briton</hi> eaſily appeas'd him, and ſet them all a laughing. I gad, my Lord quoth he, I kept out of harm's way; I was all the while with your Page <hi>Jack</hi> ſculking in a certain place where you had not dar'd hide your head as I did. Thus diſcourſing they got to their Ships, and left the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Chely.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> paſs'd by the Land of <hi>Petifogging,</hi> and of the ſtrange way of living among the <hi>Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>STeering our courſe forwards the next day we paſs'd by <hi>Pettifogging,</hi> a Country all blurr'd and blotted, ſo that I could hardly tell what to make on't. There we ſaw ſome Pettifoggers and Catchpoles, Rogues that will hang their Father for a Groat. They neither invited us to eat or drink, but with a multiplyed train of ſcrapes and crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſaid they were all at our ſervice, for the <hi>Legem pone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of our <hi>Droggermen</hi> related to <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> their ſtrange way of living, diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppos'd to that of our modern <hi>Romans:</hi> for at <hi>Rome</hi> a world of Folks get an honeſt livelyhood by Poyſoning, Drubbing, Lamba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, Stabbing and Murthering; but the <hi>Catchpoles</hi> earn theirs by being Thraſh'd, ſo that if they were long without a tight Lambaſting, the poor Dogs with their Wives and Children would be ſtarv'd. This is juſt, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> like thoſe who, as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, cannot erect the Cavernous nerve
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60542:123"/>
towards the Equinoctial Circle, unleſs they are ſoundly flogg'd. By St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Slipper, who ever ſhould jirk me ſo, would ſoon in ſtead of ſetting me right, throw me off the Saddle, in the Devils Name.</p>
               <p>The way is this, ſaid the Interpreter, when a <hi>Monk,</hi> Levite, cloſe fiſted Uſurer or Lawyer owes a grudge to ſome neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentleman, he ſends to him one of thoſe <hi>Catchpoles</hi> or <hi>Apparitors,</hi> who nabs, or at leaſt cites him, ſerves a Writ or Warrant upon him; thumps, abuſes and affronts him impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by natural inſtinct, and according to his pious inſtructions; in ſo much that if the Gentleman hath but any guts in his Brains, and is not more Stupid than a <hi>Girin</hi> Frog, he will find himſelf oblig'd either to apply a faggot-ſtick or his ſword to the Raſcal's Jobbornol, give him the gentle laſh, or make him cut a caper out at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by way of Correction. This done, <hi>Catchpole</hi> is rich for four Months at leaſt, as if <hi>Baſtinadoes</hi> were his real harveſt; for the <hi>Monk,</hi> Levite, Uſurer or Lawyer will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him roundly, and my Gentleman muſt pay him ſuch ſwindging damages, that his acres may bleed for't, and he be in danger of miſerably rotting within a ſtone Doublet, as if he had ſtruck the King.</p>
               <p>Quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> I know an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt this; us'd by the Lord of <hi>Baſché</hi>; what is it? ſaid <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60542:124"/>
Lord of <hi>Baſché,</hi> ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> was a brave honeſt noble-ſpirited Gentleman, who at his return from the long war in which the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> with the help of the <hi>French,</hi> brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended himſelf againſt the fury of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the II. was every day cited, warn'd and proſecuted at the Suit and for the Sport and Fancy of the fat Prior of St. <hi>Louant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One morning as he was at breakfaſt with ſome of his Domeſtics (for he lov'd to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times among them,) he ſent for one <hi>Loir</hi> his Baker and his Spouſe, and for one <hi>Oudart</hi> the Vicar of his Pariſh, who was alſo his Butler, as the cuſtome was then in <hi>France</hi>; then ſaid to them before his Gentleman and other Servants: You all ſee how I am daily plagu'd with theſe raſcally <hi>Catchpoles,</hi> truly if you do not lend me your helping hand, I am finally reſolv'd to leave the Country, and go fight for the <hi>Sultan,</hi> or the Devill, rather than be thus eternally tees'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be rid of their damn'd Viſits, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when any of them come here, be ready you Baker and your Wife, to make your perſonal appearance in my great Hall in your wedding Cloaths, as if you were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be affianc'd; here take theſe Ducats which I give you to keep you in a fitting Garb. As for you, Sir <hi>Oudart,</hi> be ſure you make your perſonal appearance there in your fine Surplice and Stole, not forgetting your
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60542:124"/>
Holy Water, as if you were to wed them. Be you there alſo, <hi>Trudon,</hi> ſaid he to his Drummer, with your Pipe and Taber. The form of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony muſt be read, and the Bride kiſs'd, then all of you, as the Witneſſes uſe to do in this Country, ſhall give one another the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Wedding, (which you know is to be a blow with your Fiſt, bidding the Partie ſtruck remember the Nuptials by that token) this will but make you have the better Stomach to your Supper: But when you come to the Catchpole's turn, thraſh him thrice and three fold, as you would a Sheaf of green Corn, don't ſpare him, maul him, drub him, lambaſt him, ſwinge him off, I pray you. Here take theſe Steel Gantlets covered with Kid, Head, Back, Belly, and Sides, give him blows innumerable; he that gives him moſt, ſhall be my beſt Friend. Fear not to be call'd to an account about it, I'll ſtand by you; for the blows muſt ſeem to be given in jeſt, as it is Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary among us at all Weddings.</p>
               <p>Ay, but how ſhall we know the Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, ſaid the Man of God, all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple daily reſort to this Caſtle? I have taken care of that, reply'd the Lord. When ſome fellow either on foot or on a ſcurvy Jade, with a large broad Silver Ring on his Thumb comes to the door, he is certainly a Catchpole: The Porter having civilly let him in, ſhall ring the Bell, then be all ready, and come into the Hall, to act the Tragi-Comedy,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60542:125"/>
whoſe Plot I have now laid for you.</p>
               <p>That numerical day, as Chance would have it, came an old fat ruddy Catchpole; having knock'd at the Gate, and then piſs'd, as moſt Men will do, the Porter ſoon found him out, by his large greaſy Spatterdaſhes, his Jaded hollow flank'd Mare, his Bag full of Writs and Informations dangling at his Girdle, but above all, by the large Silver hoop on his left Thumb.</p>
               <p>The Porter was civil to him, admitted him in kindly, and rung the Bell briskly. As ſoon as the Baker and his Wife heard it, they clapt on their beſt Clothes, and made their perſonal appearance in the Hall, keeping their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities like a new made Judge. The <hi>Domine</hi> put on his Surplice and Stole, and as he came out of his Office, met the Catchpole, had him in there, and made him ſuck his Face a good while, while the Gantlets were draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all hands, and then told him, you are come juſt in Pudding time, my Lord is in his right Cue; we ſhall feaſt like Kings anon, here's to be ſwindging doings, we have a Wedding in the Houſe, here, drink and cheer up, pull away.</p>
               <p>While theſe two were at it hand to fiſt, <hi>Baſché,</hi> ſeeing all his People in the Hall in their proper Equipage, ſends for the Vicar. <hi>Oudart</hi> comes with the Holy Water Pot, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the Catchpole, who as he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall, did not forget to make good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60542:125"/>
ſtore or aukward Cringes, and then ſerv'd <hi>Baſché</hi> with a Writ. <hi>Baſché</hi> gave him <hi>Grimace</hi> for <hi>Grimace,</hi> ſlipt an Angel into his Mutton Fiſt, and pray'd him to aſiſt at the Contract and Ceremony. Which he did. When it was ended, Thumps and Fiſticuffs began to fly about among the Aſſiſtants; but when it came to the Catchpole's turn, they all lay'd on him ſo unmercifully with their Gantlets, that they at laſt ſettled him, all ſtunn'd, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, bruis'd and mortify'd, with one of his Eyes black and blue, eight Ribs bruis'd, his Brisket ſunk in, his <hi>Omoplates</hi> in four quarters, his under Jaw-bone in three pieces, and all this in jeſt and no harm done. God wot how the <hi>Levite</hi> belabour'd him, hiding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the long Sleeve of his Canonical Shirt, his huge Steel Gantlet lin'd with Ermin, for he was a ſtrong built <hi>Ball,</hi> and an old Dog at Fiſticuffs. The Catchpole all of a Bloody Tyger-like hue, with much ado, crawl'd home to <hi>l'Iſle Bouchart,</hi> well pleas'd and edify'd however with <hi>Baſché</hi>

                  </gap>s kind recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with the help of the good Surgeons of the place, liv'd as long as you'd have him. From that time to this not a word of the buſineſs; the memory of it was loſt with the ſound of the Bells that rung for Joy at his Funeral.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. How, like Maſter <hi>Francis Villon,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Baſché</hi> commended his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</head>
               <p>THe Catchpole being pack'd off on blind Sorrel (ſo he call'd his one Ey'd Mare) <hi>Baſché</hi> ſent for his Lady, her Women and all his Servants into the Arbour of his Garden; had Wine brought, attended by good ſtore of Paſties, Hams, Fruit, and other Table-Ammunition for a Nuncion, drank with them joyfully, and then told them this Story.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Francis Villon</hi> in his old Age, retir'd to St. <hi>Maixent</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> under the Patronage of a good honeſt Abbot of the place. There to make ſport for the Mob, he undertook to get the <hi>Paſſion</hi> acted after the way and in the Dialect of the Country. The parts being diſtributed, the Play having been rehears'd, and the Stage prepar'd, he told the Mayor and Aldermen, that the Myſtery might be ready after <hi>Niort</hi> Fair, and that there only wanted Properties and neceſſaries, but chiefly Clothes fit for the parts; ſo the Mayor and his Brethren took care to get them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Villon,</hi> to dreſs an old Clowniſh Father Grey Beard, who was to repreſent God the <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:60542:126"/>
begg'd of Fryar <hi>Stephen Tickletoby,</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan to the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryars of the place, to lend him a Cope and a Stole. <hi>Tickletoby</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd him, alledging that by their Provincial Statutes, it was rigorouſly forbidden to give or lend any thing to Players<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Villon</hi> reply'd, That the Statute reached no farther than Farces, Drolls, Anticks, looſe and diſſolute Games, and that he ask'd no more than what he had ſeen allow'd at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and other places. <hi>Tickletoby,</hi> notwithſtanding, peremptorily bid him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelf elſewhere if he would, and not to hope for any thing out of his Monaſtical Wardrobe. <hi>Villon</hi> gave an account of this to the Players, as of a moſt abominable action, adding, that God would ſhortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, and make an example of <hi>Tickletoby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Saturday</hi> following he had notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, that <hi>Tickletoby</hi> upon the Filly of the Convent (ſo they call a young Mare that was never leap'd yet) was gone a Mumping to St. <hi>Ligarius,</hi> and would be back about two in the afternoon. Knowing this, he made a Cavalcade of his Devils of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> through the Town. They were all rigg'd with Wolves, Calves, and Rams Skins, lac'd and trim'd with Sheeps Heads, Bulls Feathers, and large Kitchin Tenter-Hooks, girt with broad Leathern Girdles, whereat hang'd dangling huge Cow Bells and Horſe Bells which made a horrid din. Some held in their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60542:127"/>
Claws black Sticks full of Squibs and Crackers, others had long lighted pieces of wood, upon which at the corner of every ſtreet they flung whole handfuls of Roſin duſt, that made a terrible fire and ſmoak: having thus led them about, to the great diverſion of the Mob, and the dreadful fear of little Children, he finally carried them to an entertainment at a Summer-Houſe without the Gate that leads to St. <hi>Ligarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they came near the place, he ſpy'd <hi>Tickletoby</hi> afar off, coming home from Mump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and told them in Maceronic Verſe, <q>
                     <l>Hic eſt Mumpator natus de gente Cucowli,</l>
                     <l>Qui ſolet antiquo ſcrappas portare <note n="*" place="bottom">

Well ſaid, cry'd <hi>Villon</hi>; but let us hide our ſelves till he comes by, and then change home briskly with your Squibs and burning Sticks. <hi>Tickletoby</hi> being come to the place, they all ruſh'd on a ſudden into the Road to meet him, and in a frightful manner threw fire from all ſides upon him and his Filly Foal, ringing and tingling their Bells, and howling like ſo many real Devils, hho, hho, hho, hho, brrou, rrou, rrourrs, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

don't we play the Devils rarely? The Filly was ſoon ſcar'd out of her ſeven Senſes, and began to ſtart, to funk it, to ſquirt it, to trot it, to fart it, to bound it, to gallop it, to kick it, to ſpurn it, to calcitrate it, to winſe it, to frisk it, to leap it, to curvet it, with double Jirks, and bum-motions; in ſo much that ſhe threw down <hi>Tickletoby,</hi> tho' he held faſt by the Tree of the Pack-Saddle with might and main: now his Straps and Stirrups were of Cord, and on the right ſide, his Sandal was ſo entangled and twiſted, that he could not for the Hearts blood of him get out his foot. Thus he was dragg'd about by the Filly through the Road, ſcratching his bare Breech all the way, ſhe ſtill multiplying her kicks againſt him, and ſtraying for fear, over Hedge and Ditch; in ſo much that ſhe tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd his thick Skull ſo, that his Cockle Brains were daſh'd out near the <hi>Oſanna</hi> or <hi>High Croſs.</hi> Then his Arms fell to pieces, one this way, and t'other that way, and even ſo were his Legs ſerv'd at the ſame time: Then ſhe made a bloody havock with his Puddings, and being got to the Convent, brought back only his right Foot and twiſted Sandal, leaving them to gueſs what was become of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Villon</hi> ſeeing that things had ſucceded as he intended, ſaid to his Devils, you will Act rarely, Gentlemen Devils, you will Act rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I dare engage you'll top your Parts.

               <p>Likewiſe, Friends, ſaid <hi>Baſché,</hi> I foreſee, that hereafter you will act rarely this Tragical Farce, ſince the very firſt time you have ſo skilfully hamper'd, bethwack'd, belamm'd, and bebump'd the Catchpole. From this day I double your Wages. As for you, my Dear (ſaid he to his Lady) make your Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications as you pleaſe; you are my Treaſurer, you know. For my part, firſt and foremoſt, I drink to you all. Come on, box it about, 'tis good and cool. In the ſecond place, you, Mr. Steward, take this Silver Baſon, I give it you freely. Then, you, my Gentleman of the Horſe, take theſe two Silver gilt Cups, and let not the Pages be Horſe-whip'd theſe three Months.

Never did the Batchelors at <hi>Avignon</hi> in Carnival time play more melodiouſly at <hi>Raphe,</hi> than was then play'd on the Catchpole's Microcoſm: at laſt down he fell.</p>
               <p>They threw a great deal of Wine on his Snout, ty'd round the Sleeve of his Doublet a fine yellow and green Favour, and got him upon his ſnotty Beaſt, and God knows how he got to <hi>l'Iſle Bouchart,</hi> where I cannot truly tell you whether he was dreſs'd and look'd after or no both by his Spouſe and the able Doctors of the Country, for the thing never came to my Ears.</p>
               <p>The next day they had a third part to the ſame Tune, becauſe it did not appear by the lean Catchpole's Bag, that he had ſerv'd his Writ. So the fat Prior ſent a new Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole at the head of a brace of Bums for his <hi>Guard du Corps</hi> to Summon my Lord.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60542:130"/>
by the Women, and made them eat till their Bellies crack'd with their Breeches unbutton'd. The Fruit being ſerv'd, the Catchpole aroſe from Table, and before the Bums cited <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ché, Baſché</hi> kindly ask'd him for a Copy of the Warant, which the other had got ready: He then takes Witneſs and a Copy of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. To the Catchpole and his Bums he order'd four Ducats for Civility Money. In the mean time all were withdrawn for the Farce.

               <head>CHAP. XV. How the Ancient Cuſtom at Nuptials is renewed by the Catchpole.</head>
               <p>THe Catchpole having made ſhift to get down a ſwindging Streaker of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Wine, ſaid to <hi>Baſché,</hi> Pray, Sir, what do you mean? You do not give one another the Memento of the Wedding. By St. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Wooden Shoe all good Cuſtoms are forgot. We find the Form, but the Hare's ſcamper'd; and the Neſt, but the Birds are flown. There are no true Friends now-a-days. You ſee how in ſeveral Churches the Ancient Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cuſtom of Tippling on account of the bleſſed St. <hi>O. O.</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> is come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The World is in its Dotage, and Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is certainly coming all ſo faſt. Now come on; The Wedding, the Wedding, the Wedding, remember it by this. This he ſaid, ſtriking <hi>Baſché</hi> and his Lady, then her Women and the <hi>Levite.</hi> Then the Tabor beat a point of War, and the Gantlets began to do their Duty, in ſo much that the Catchpole had his Crown crack'd in no leſs than nine places. One of the Burns had his right Arm put out of joynt, and the other his upper Jaw Bone or Mandibule diſlocated; ſo that it hid half his Chin, with a Denudation of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60542:131"/>
and ſad loſs of the Molar, Maſticatory and Canine Teeth. Then the Tabor beat a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; the Gantlets were carefully hid in a trice, and ſweet Meats afreſh diſtributed to renew the Mirth of the Company. So they all drank to one another, and eſpecially to the Catchpole and his Bums. But <hi>Oudart</hi> Curs'd and Damn'd the Wedding to the pit of Hell, complaining that one of the Bums had utterly diſincorniſiſtibulated his nether Shoulder blade. Nevertheleſs he ſcorn'd to be thought a Flincher, and made ſhift to tope to him on the ſquare.</p>
               <p>The Jawleſs Bum ſhrug'd up his Shoulders, joyn'd his Hands, and by ſigns beg'd his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; for ſpeak he could not. The ſham Bridegroom made his moan, That the crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Bum had ſtruck him ſuch a horrid thump with his Shoulder-of-Mutton-Fiſt on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elbow, that he was grown quite eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruquanchuzelubelouzerireliced down to his very Heel, to the no ſmall loſs of Miſtreſs Bride.</p>
               <p>But what harm had poor I done (cry'd <hi>Trudon</hi> hiding his left Eye with his Kerchief, and ſhewing his Tabor crack'd on one ſide) they were not ſatisfied with thus poaching, black-and bluing, and morram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouzevezengouzequoquemorgaſacbaquevezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemaffreliding my poor Eyes, but they have alſo broke my harmleſs Drum. Drums in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued are commonly beaten at Weddings;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60542:131"/>
(and 'tis ſit they ſhould) but Drummers are well entertain'd, and never beaten. Now let <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> e'en take the Drum to make his Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a Night-Cap. Brother, ſaid the lame Catchpole, never fret thy ſelf, I will make thee a preſent of a fine, large, old Patent which I have here in my Bag to patch up thy Drum, and for Madam St. <hi>Ann's</hi> ſake I pray thee forgive us. By'r Lady of <hi>River,</hi> the bleſſed Dame, I meant no more harm than the Child unborn. One of the Querries who hopping and halting like a mumping Cripple, mimick'd the good limping Lord <hi>de la Roche Poſay,</hi> directed his Diſcourſe to the Bum with the pouting Jaw, and told him, What, Mr. <hi>Manhound,</hi> was it not enough thus to have morcrocaſtebezaſtevereſtegrigeligoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copapopondrillated us all in our upper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with your botch'd Mittens, but you muſt alſo apply ſuch morderegripippiatabirofrelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamburelurecaquelurintimpaniments on our Shinbones with the hard tops and extremitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bum wringing his Hands, ſeemed to beg his Pardon, muttering with his Tongue, mon, mon, mon, vrelon, von, von, like a Dumb Man. The Bride crying laught, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cry'd, becauſe the Catchpole was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with drubbing her without choice or diſtinction of Members, but had alſo rudely rous'd and tous'd her; pull'd off her Topping,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60542:132"/>
and not having the fear of her Husband before his Eyes, treacherouſly trepignemanpinillori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frizonoufreſturfumbledtumbled and ſquees'd her lower parts. The Devil go with it, ſaid <hi>Baſché,</hi> there was much need indeed that this ſame Maſter King (this was the Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole's Name) ſhould thus break my Wifes Back: however I forgive him now; theſe are little Nuptial Careſſes. But this I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, that he cited me like an Angel, and drubb'd me like a Devil. He hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him of Fryar <hi>Thumpwell.</hi> Come, for all this I muſt drink to him, and to you likewiſe his truſty Eſquires. But ſaid his Lady, why hath he been ſo very liberal of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual kindneſs to me without the leaſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? I aſſure you, I by no means like it; but this I dare ſay for him, that he hath the hardeſt Knuckles that ever I felt on my Shoulders. The Steward held his left Arm in a Scarf, as if it had been rent and torn in twain: I think it was the Devil, ſaid he, that mov'd me to aſſiſt at theſe Nuptials; ſhame on ill luck, I muſt-needs be meddling, with a Pox, and now ſee what I have got by the Bargain, both my Arms are wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engoulevezinemaſſdandbruis'd. Do you call this a Wedding? By St. <hi>Briget</hi>'s Tooth, I had rather be at that of a <hi>Tom T — d-Man</hi>; this is o'my word e'en juſt ſuch another Feaſt as was that of the <hi>Lapithes,</hi> deſcrib'd by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher of <hi>Samoſate.</hi> One of the Bums
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60542:132"/>
had loſt his Tongue. The two other, tho' they had more need to complain, made their excuſe as well as they could, proteſting that they hadt no ill deſign in this Dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding; begging that for goodneſs ſake they would forgive them, and ſo tho' they could hardly budge a foot, or wag along, away they crawl'd. About a mile from <hi>Baſché</hi>'s Seat, the Catchpole found himſelf ſomewhat out of ſorts. The Bums got to <hi>l'Iſle Bouchard,</hi> publickly ſaying, That ſince they were born, they had never ſeen an honeſter Gentleman than the Lord of <hi>Baſché,</hi> or civiller Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than his, and that they had never been at the like Wedding (which I verily believe) but that it was their own faults if they had been tickled off and toſs'd about from Poſt to Pillar, ſince themſelves had began the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So they liv'd I can't exactly tell you how many days after this. But from that time to this it was held for a certain truth, That <hi>Baſché</hi>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly to ſee thoſe Catchpoles bang'd, good luſty thumps would have done well on his ſhav'd Crown, conſidering the horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions now-a days among thoſe puny Judges. What harm had done thoſe poor Devils the Catchpoles. This puts me in mind, ſaid <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi> of an ancient <hi>Roman</hi> named <hi>L. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius</hi>; he was of Noble Blood, and for ſome time was rich; but had this Tyrannical Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that whenever he went out of doors, he cauſed his Servants to fill their Pockets with Gold and Silver, and meeting in the ſtreet your ſpruce Gallants and better ſort of Beaux, without the leaſt provocation, for his fancy he us'd to ſtrike them hard on the Face with his Fiſt, and immediately after that, to appeaſe them and hinder them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to the Magiſtrates, he would give them as much Money as ſatisfied them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60542:133"/>
to the Law of the twelve Tables. Thus he us'd to ſpend his Revenue, beating People for the price of his Money. By St. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Sacred Boot, quoth Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> I will know the truth of it preſently.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, he went on ſhoar, put his hand in his Fob, and took out twenty Ducats, then ſaid with a loud voice in the hearing of a ſhoal of the Nation of Catchpoles, Who will earn twenty Ducats, for being beaten like the Devil? Io, Io, Io, ſaid they all; you will cripple us for ever, Sir, that's moſt certain, but the Money is tempting. With this they were all thronging who ſhould be firſt, to be thus pretiouſly beaten. Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi> ſingl'd him out of the whole knot of theſe Rogues in grain, a red Snout Catchpole, who upon his right Thumb wore a thick broad Silver Hoop, wherein was ſet a good large Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. He had no ſooner pick'd him out from the reſt, but I perceiv'd that they all mutter'd and grumbl'd, and I heard a young thin-jaw'd Catchpole, a notable Scholar, a pretty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at his Pen, and, according to publick report, much cry'd up for his honeſty at <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> making his complaint, and muttering; becauſe this ſame crimſon Phyz car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away all the Practice, and that if there were but a ſcore and a half of Baſtinadoes to be got, he would certainly run away with eight and twenty of them. But all this was look'd upon to be nothing but meer Envy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60542:134"/>Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi> ſo unmercifully thraſh'd, thump'd and belabour'd Red-Snout, Back and Belly, Sides, Legs and Arms, Head, Feet, and ſo forth, with the home &amp; frequently repeated application of one of the beſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Faggot, that I took him to be a dead Man; then he gave him the twenty Ducats; which made the Dog get on his Legs, pleas'd like a little King, or two. The reſt were ſaying to Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> Sir, Sir, Brother De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, if it pleaſe you to do us the favour to beat ſome of us for leſs Money, we are all at your Devilſhip's command, Bags, Papers, Pens and all. Red-Snout cry'd out againſt them, ſaying with a loud voice: Body of me, you little Prigs, will you offer to take the Bread out of my Mouth? will you take my Bargain over my Head? Would you draw and inveigle from me my Clients and Cuſtomers? Take notice, I Summon you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Official this day ſe'night; I will Law and Claw you like any old Devil, that I will. — Then turning himſelf towards Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> with a ſmiling and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful look, he ſaid to him, Reverend Father in the Devil, if you have found me a good Hide, and have a mind to divert your ſelf once more, by beating your humble Servant, I will bate you half in half this time, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than loſe your Cuſtom, do not ſpare me I beſeech you; I am all, and more than all yours, good Mr. Devil, Head, Lungs,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60542:134"/>
Tripes, Guts and Garbage, and that at a Penniworth I'll aſſure you. Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi> n'er heeded his proffers, but e'en left them. The other Catchpoles were making Addreſſes to <hi>Panurge, Epiſtemon, Gymnaſt,</hi> and others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them charitably to beſtow upon their Carcaſſes a ſmall beating, for otherwiſe they were in danger of keeping a long Faſt: but none of them had a Stomach to it. Sometime after, ſeeking freſh Water for the Ship's Company, we met a couple of old Female Catchpoles of the place, miſerably howling and weeping in Conſort. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had kept on Board, and already had caus'd a Retreat to be ſounded. Thinking they might be related to the Catchpole that was baſtinado'd, We ask'd them the occaſion of their grief. They reply'd, That they had too much cauſe to weep, for that very hour from an exalted Triple Tree, two of the honeſteſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Catchpoleland</hi> had been made to cut a Caper on nothing. Cut a Caper on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? ſaid <hi>Gymnaſt,</hi> my Pages uſe to cut Capers on the Ground; to cut a Caper on nothing, ſhould be hanging and choaking, or I am out. Ay, ay, ſaid Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> you ſpeak of it like St. <hi>John de la Paliſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ask'd them why they treated thoſe worthy Perſons with ſuch a choaking Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Sallat? They told us they had only bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd, <hi>alias</hi> ſtol'n the Tools of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and hid them under the handle of the Pariſh.

It had been foretold him by the Sooth-ſayers, that he would dye on a certain Day, by the ruin of ſomething that ſhould fall on him; that fatal day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come in its Turn, he remov'd himſelf out of Town, far from all Houſes, Trees, or any other things that can fall, and indanger by their ruin; and ſtay'd in a large field, truſting himſelf to the open Sky, there very ſecure as he thought, unleſs indeed the Sky ſhould happen to fall, which he held to be impoſſible.

               <p>THe next day we eſpied nine Sail that came ſpooning before the Wind; they were full of <hi>Dominicans, Jeſuits, Capuchins, Hermits, Auſtins, Bernardins, Celeſtins, Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, Egnatins, Amadeans, Cordeliers, Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Minims,</hi> and the Devil and all of other holy Monks and Fryars, who were going to the Council of <hi>Cheſil,</hi> to ſift and garble ſome Articles of Faith againſt the new Hereticks; <hi>Panurge</hi> was overjoy'd to ſee them, being moſt certain of good luck, for that day and a long train of others. So, having courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſaluted the goodly Fathers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the ſalvation of his precious Soul to their Devout Prayers and private Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he caus'd ſeventy eight dozen of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia</hi> Hams, Unites of Pots of Caviar, Tens of <hi>Bolonia</hi> Sawſages, Hundreds of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>targoes, and Thouſands of fine Angels, for the Souls of the dead, to be thrown on board their Ships. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſeem'd metagraboliz'd, dozing, out of ſorts, and as melancholick as a Cat: Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi> who ſoon perceiv'd it, was enquiring of him whence ſhould come this unuſual ſadneſs? When the Maſter, whoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60542:138"/>
Watch it was, obſerving the fluttering of the Ancient above the Poop, and ſeeing that it began to overcaſt, judg'd that we ſhould have Wind, therefore he bid the Boatſwain call hands upon Deck, Officers, Sailers, Fore-Maſt Men, Swabbers, and Cabbin-boys, and even the Paſſengers; made 'em firſt ſettle their Top-ſails, take in their Spreet-ſail; then he cry'd, in with your Top-ſails, lower the Fore-ſail, Tallow under the Parrels, brade up cloſe all them Sails, ſtrike your Top-Maſts to the Cap, make all ſure with your Sheeps-feet, Laſh your Guns faſt. All this was nimbly done. Immediately it blow'd a Storm, the Sea began to roar, and ſwell Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain high: The Rut of the Sea was great, the Waves breaking upon our Ships Quarter, the North Weſt Wind bluſter'd and over-blow'd; boiſterous guſts; dreadful claſhings and deadly ſcuds of Wind whiſtled through our Yards, and made our Shrouds rattle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Thunder grumbled ſo horridly, that you would have thought Heaven had been tumbling about our Ears; at the ſame time it Lighten'd, Rain'd, Hail'd; the Sky loſt its tranſparent hue, grew dusky, thick and gloomy, ſo that we had no other light than that of the Flaſhes of Lightning and rending of the Clouds: The Hurricans, Flaws and ſudden Whirl-winds began to make a Flame about us by the Lightnings, Fiery Vapours, and other Aerial Ejaculations.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60542:138"/>
Oh how our Looks were full of amazement and trouble, while the ſawcy Winds did rudely lift up above us the Mountainous Waves of the Main. Believe me, it ſeem'd to us a lively Image of the Chaos, where Fire, Air, Sea, Land, and all the Elements were in a refractory confuſion. Poor <hi>Panurge,</hi> having, with the full contents of the inſide of his Doublet, plentifully fed the Fiſh, greedy enough of ſuch odious Fare, ſat on the Deck all in a heap, with his Noſe and Arſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moſt ſadly caſt down, moping and half dead; invok'd and call'd to his aſſiſtance all the Bleſſed he and ſhe Saints he could mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up, ſwore and vow'd to Confeſs in time and place convenient, and then bawl'd out frightfully, Steward, <hi>Maiſtre d'Hoſtel,</hi> ſee hoe, my Friend, my Father, my Uncle, pr'ythee let's have a piece of Powder'd Beef or Pork, we ſhall drink but too much anon, for ought I ſee, eat little and drink the more ſhall hereafter be my Motto, I fear. Would to our dear Lord and to our bleſſed, worthy, and ſacred Lady, I were now, I ſay, this very minute of an hour, well on ſhoar on <hi>Terra firma,</hi> hale and eaſie. O twice and thrice happy thoſe that plant Cabbages! O Deſtinies, why did you not <hi>Spin</hi> me for a Cabbage <hi>Planter</hi>?

Diſpute who will of Felicity, and <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> for my part, whoſoever <hi>plants</hi> Cabbage, is now by my Decree proclaim'd moſt happy; for as good a reaſon as the Philoſopher <hi>Pyrrho</hi> being in the ſame danger, and ſeeing a Hog near the ſhoar eating ſome ſcatter'd Oats, declar'd it happy in two reſpects, firſt, becauſe it had plenty of Oats, and beſides that was on ſhoar.

               <p>This alſo is to be as ſilly, as that Jolt-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Loblolly of a Carter, who, having laid his Waggon faſt in a-Slough, down on his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60542:144"/>
Marrow-bones, was calling on the ſtrong-Back'd Deity <hi>Hercules,</hi> might and main, to help him at a dead lift, but all the while forgot to goad on his Oxen, and lay his. Shoulder to the Wheels, as it behoved him, as if a <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> alone, would have got his Cart out of the Mire.</p>
               <p>What will it ſignifie to make your Will now? For either we ſhall come off, or drown for't. If we ſcape, it will not ſignifie a ſtraw to us; for, Teſtaments are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, or Authority, but by the death of the Teſtators. If we are drown'd, will it not be drown'd too? Pr'ythee who will tranſmit it to the Executors? Some kind Wave will throw it aſhoar, like <hi>

Codſooks, our Ship is almoſt overſet. Ods death, how ſhall we clear her? 'Tis well if ſhe don't founder. What a Deviliſh Sea there runs? She'll neither try, nor hull, the Sea will overtake her, ſo we ſhall never ſcape, the Devil ſcape me.

               <p>SHoar, Shoar, cry'd <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Land to my Friends, I ſee Land, pluck up a good ſpirit, Boys, 'tis within a kenning, ſo we are not far from a Port.— I ſee the Sky clearing up, to the North-wards.— Look to the South-eaſt! Courage my Hearts, ſaid the Pilot, now ſhe'll bear the hullock of a Sail, the Sea is much ſmoother, ſome hands aloft, to the main Top.— Put the Helm a weather. — Steady, Steady.— Hall your aftermiſen bowlins.— Hawl, Hawl, Hawl.— Thus, Thus, and no near.

Come, Children be nimble.— Good.— Loff, Loff.— Thus. — helm a weather. That's well ſaid and thought on. Methinks the Storm is almoſt over. It was high time, faith; however the Lord be thanked.— Our Devils begin to ſcamper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> — Out with all your Sails.— Hoiſt your Sails.— Hoiſt.— That's ſpoke like a Man, Hoiſt, Hoiſt.— Here agod's name honeſt <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> thou'rt a luſty fornicator, the whore-Son, will get none but Boys. <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> thou art a notable Fellow. — Run up to the fore-top Saile. — Thus, Thus. — Well ſaid, I faith, Thus, Thus. I dare not fear any thing all this while, for it is Holy-day. Vea, Vea, Vea! Huſah! This ſhout of the Sea-men is not amiſs, and pleaſes me, for it is Holy-day: Keep her full, Thus.— Good. Cheer up my merry Mates all, cry'd out <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> I ſee already <hi>Caſtor</hi> on the Right. Be, Be, Bous, Bous, Bous, ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> I am much afraid it is the Bitch <hi>Helen.</hi> 'Tis truly <hi>Mixarchagenas,</hi> return'd <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> If thou likeſt better that denomination which the Argives give him. Ho, Ho! I ſee Land too; let her bear in with the Harbour, I ſee a good many People on the Beach: I ſee a light on an <hi>Obeliſcolychny.</hi> Shorten your Sails, ſaid the Pilot, fetch the ſounding-Line, we muſt double that point of Land, and mind the Sands.— We are clear off them, ſaid the Sailers. Soon after, away ſhe goes, quoth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60542:146"/>
the Pilot, and ſo doth the reſt of our Fleet: Help came in good ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>By St. <hi>John,</hi> ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> This is ſpoke ſomewhat like: O the ſweet Word! There's the Soul of Muſick in't: Mgna, Mgna, Mgna, ſaid Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> If ever thou taſt a drop on't, let the Devil's-Dam taſt me thou Ballocky Devil. Here honeſt Soul, here's a full Sneacker of the very beſt. Bring the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Doſt hear, <hi>Gymnaſt,</hi> and that ſame large Paſty Jambic, Gammonic, as you will have it. — Take heed you pilot her in Right.</p>
               <p>Cheer, up cry'd out <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Cheer up, my Boys: Let's be our ſelves again, do you ſee yonder cloſe by our Ship, two Barks, three Sloops, five Ships, eight Pinks, four Yawls, and ſix Frigats, making towards us, ſent by the good People of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſland to our Relief. But who is this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>calegon</hi> below, that cry's and makes ſuch a ſad moan. Were it not that I hold the Maſt firmly with both my hands, and keep it ſtreighter than two hundred tacklings.— I'd.— It is (ſaid Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) that poor Devil <hi>Panurge,</hi> who is troubled with a Calf's ague; he quakes for fear when his belly's full. If, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> he hath been afraid during this dreadfull Hurricane, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Storm, provided (waving that) he hath done his part like a Man, I do not value him a Jot the leſs for it. For as to fear
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60542:147"/>
in all Encounters, is the mark of a heavy, and cowardly Heart, as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> did, who for that reaſon, is ignominiouſly tax'd by <hi>Achilles</hi> with having Dogs Eyes, and a Stags Heart; ſo, not to fear when the caſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently dreadful, is a ſign of want or ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Now if any thing ought to be feard, in this Life, next to offending God, I will not ſay it is death; I will not meddle with the diſputes of <hi>Socrates</hi> and the Academics, that death of it ſelf is neither bad nor to be fear'd: But I will affirm that this kind of death by. Shipwrack is to be fear'd or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is. For as <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, it is a grievous, dreadfull, and an unnatural thing to periſh at Sea. And indeed <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in the Storm that took his fleet neer <hi>Sicily,</hi> was griev'd that he had not dy'd by the hand of the brave <hi>Diomedes,</hi> and ſaid that thoſe were three nay four times happy who periſh'd with <hi>Troy.</hi> No Man here hath loſt his Life; the Lord our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour be eternally prais'd for it: But in truth here is a Ship ſadly out of order. Well, we muſt take care to have the damage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd. Take heed we do not run a ground and billage her.</p>

Indeed that ſame Decumane Wave that took us fore and aft ſomewhat alter'd my Pulſe. — Down with your Sails, well ſaid, how now, Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> you do nothing? Is it time for us to drink now?

here, this Fryar <hi>Jack,</hi> who is fain to drink to hearten himſelf up, and dyes for fear.— Rare weather.— I now find the anſwer of <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> the noble <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; being ask'd what Ship he reckon'd the ſafeſt, he reply'd that which is in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: he made a yet better repartie, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> when ſome body inquiring which is greater, the number of the living, or that of the dead? He ask'd them amongſt which of the two they reckon'd? thoſe that are at Sea? ingeniouſly implying, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in danger of death, dying live, and living dye. <hi>Portius Cato</hi> alſo ſaid that there were but three things of which he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; That is, if ever he had truſted his Wife with his ſecret, if he had idled away a day, and if he had ever gone by Sea, to a place which he could viſit by Land. By this dignified Frock of mine, ſaid Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> to <hi>Panurge,</hi> Friend thou haſt been afraid during the Storm, without cauſe or reaſon; for thou wert not born to be drowned, but rather to be hang'd, and exalted in the Air, or to be roaſted in the midſt of a jolly bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire. My Lord, would you have a good Cloak for the Rain? Leave me off your Wolf and Badger-skin mantle: Let <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urge</hi> but be flead, and cover your ſelf with his hide. But do not come near the Fire, nor near your Blackſmith's Forges a God's name, for in a moment you would ſee it in

aſhes. Yet be as long as you pleaſe in the Rain, Snow, Hail, nay, by the Devil's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, throw your ſelf or dive down to the very bottom of the Water, I'll ingage you'll not be wet at all. Have ſome winter Boots made of it, they'le never take in a drop of Water; make Bladders of it to lay under Boys, to teach them to ſwim, inſtead of Corks, and they will learn without the leaſt danger. His Skin then, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſhould be like the herb called, true maidens Hair, which never takes wet nor moiſtneſs, but ſtill keeps dry, though you lay it at the bottom of the Water as long as you pleaſe, and for that reaſon is call'd <hi>Adiantos.</hi>

               <p>Friend <hi>Panurge,</hi> ſaid Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> I pray thee never be afraid of Water, thy life for mine, thou art threatn'd with a contrary Element. Ay, ay, reply'd <hi>Panurge,</hi> but the Devil's Cooks dote ſome times, and are apt to make horrid blunders as well as others, often putting to boyle in water what was deſign'd to be roaſted on the fire, like the head Cooks of our Kitchin, who often lard Partridges, Queeſts and Stockdoves with intent to roaſt them, one wou'd think, but it happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that they e'en turn the Partridges into the Pot to be boyl'd with Cabbages, the Queeſts with leek Porradge, and the Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doves with Turnips.</p>

               <p>IMmediately after, we went a ſhoar at the Port of an Iſland, which they call'd the Iſland of the <hi>Macreons</hi>; the good People of the place receiv'd us very honourably.

Town-houſe to refreſh himſelf, and eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but he would not budge a foot, from the Mole, till all his Men were landed. After he had ſeen them, he gave order they ſhould all change Cloaths, and that ſome of all the Stores in the Fleet, ſhould be brought on ſhoar that every ſhips Crew might live well, which was accordingly done; and God wot how they all top'd, and carrouz'd; the People of the place brought them Proviſions in abundance The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pantagruelieſts</hi> return'd them more: As the truth is, their's were ſomewhat damag'd by the late Storm. When they had well ſtuffed the inſides of their Doublets, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> deſired every one to lend their help to repair the damage, which they readily did. It was eaſy enough to reſit there; for all the inhabitants of the Iſland were Carpenters, and all ſuch handicrafts as are ſeen in the <hi>Arſenale</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> None but the largeſt Iſland was inhabited, having three Ports, and ten Pariſhes; the reſt being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run with Wood, and deſert, much like the Foreſt of <hi>Arden.</hi> We entreated the old <hi>Macrobius</hi> to ſhew us what was worth ſeeing in the Iſland, which he did; and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and dark Foreſt, We diſcover'd ſeveral old ruined Temples, Obeliſcs, Pyramids, Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ancient Tombs, with diverſe Inſcriptions, and Epitaphs, ſome of them in hieroglyphic Characters, others in the Gothic Dialect, ſome in the Arabic, Agarenian, Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sclavonian

and other Tongues: Of which <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> took an exact Account. In the interim <hi>Panurge</hi> ſaid to Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> is this the Iſland of the <hi>Macreons?

               <p>The Noble <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, more admirable yet in the Art of Shooting and Darting; for with his dreadful Piles and Darts, nearly reſembling the huge Beams that ſupport the Bridges of <hi>Nantes, Saumur, Bergerac,</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> the Millers and the Changers Bridges, in length, ſize, weight, and Ironwork, he at a Mile's diſtance would open an Oyſter and never touch the edges; he would ſnuff a Candle without putting it out, would ſhoot a Magpy in the Eye, take off a Boot's under-ſoal, or a Riding-hood's lining without ſoylling them a bit, turn over every leaf of Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi>'s Breviary one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and not tear one.</p>
               <p>With ſuch Darts, of which there was good ſtore in his Ship, at the firſt blow he ran the <hi>Phyſetere</hi> in at the Forehead ſo furiouſly, that he pierc'd both its Jaws and Tongue, ſo that from that time to this it no more open'd its Guttural Trap-door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor drew and

               <p>THE reſolution of the Councill was, that let things be how they would, it behov'd the <hi>Pantagrueliſts</hi> to ſtand upon their Guard. Therefore <hi>Carpalim</hi> and <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> were order'd by <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> to go for the Soldiers that were on board the Cup-Gally, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Mawl-Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terling,</hi> and thoſe on board the Vine-Tub-Frigat, under the command of Colonel <hi>Cut-pudding</hi> the younger. I'll eaſe <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> of that trouble, ſaid <hi>Panurge</hi> who wanted to be upon the Run: You may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him here.

Weep, and diſhearten the good Sholdiers. I'll certainly come back, ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my Ghoſtly Father, and ſpeedily too; do but take care that theſe Plaguy <hi>Chitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> don't board our Ships; all the while you'l be a Fighting, I'le pray heartily for your Victory after the example of the valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and guide of the People of <hi>Iſrael, Moſes</hi>; having ſaid this he wheel'd off.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of theſe two Colonels of yours, <hi>Mawl-Chitterling</hi> and <hi>Cut-pudding</hi> promiſeth us Aſſurance, Succeſs and Victory, if thoſe <hi>Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlings</hi> ſhould chance to ſet upon us. You take it rightly, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and it pleaſeth me to ſee you foreſee and prognoſticate our Victory by the Names of our Colonels.</p>
               <p>This Way of foretelling by Names is not new, it was in Old times celebrated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly obſerv'd by the <hi>Pythagoreans.</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great Princes and Emperors have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made good uſe of it, <hi>Octavianus Auguſtus</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Romans</hi> meeting on a day a Country Fellow nam'd <hi>Eutychius,</hi> (that is, fortunate) driving an Aſs nam'd <hi>Nicon</hi> (that is in Greek <hi>Victorian</hi>) mov'd by the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Aſs's, and Aſs driver's Names, remain'd aſſur'd of all Proſperity and Victory.</p>

               <p>Indeed, ſaid <hi>Epiſtemon.</hi> I ſaw this way of Syllabiſing, try'd at <hi>Xaintes</hi> at a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Preſence of that Good, Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Learned and juſt Preſident <hi>Brian Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60542:173"/>
Lame, or crooked of the Right ſide; and of the Left, if they were even in number: and ſuch indeed we ever found them.</p>
               <p>By this Syllabical invention, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> the Learned have affirm'd, that <hi>Achi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But returning to Names, Do but conſider how <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, Son to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> of whom we ſpoke juſt now, compaſs'd his Undertaking, meerly by the Interpretation of a Name. He had beſieged the ſtrong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and for ſeveral Weeks battered it with all his Power; but all in vain; his Engines and Attempts were ſtill baffled by the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> Which made him finally reſolve to raiſe the Siege to his great Grief, foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Stain, which ſuch a ſhameful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat would be to his Reputation. In this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and Agitation of mind he fell aſleep, and dream't that a Satyr was come into his Tent capering skipping, and tripping it up and down,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60542:174"/>
with his Goatiſh hoofs, and that he ſtrove to lay hold on him. But the Satyr ſtill ſlip'd from him, till at laſt having pen'd him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Corner, he took him: With this he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd, and telling his Dream to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Sages of his Court, they let him know, that it was a Promiſe of Victory from the Gods, and that he ſhould ſoon be Maſter of <hi>Tyre</hi>; the word <hi>Satyros</hi> divided in two being <hi>Sa Tyros,</hi> and ſignifying, <hi>Tyre</hi> is thine; and in truth, at the next Onſet he took the Town by Storm, and by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Victory, reduc'd that ſtubborn People to Subjection.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, ſee how by the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of one word, <hi>Pompey</hi> fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Being overcome by <hi>Caeſar</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he had no other way left to eſcape but by flight; which attempting by Sea, he arrived near the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and perceiv'd on the ſhoar near the City of <hi>Paphos</hi> a beautiful and ſtately Palace; now asking the Pilot what was the name of it, he told him, that it was call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Evil-King,</hi> which ſtruck ſuch a dread and terror in him, that he fell into Deſpair, as being aſſured of looſing ſhortly his Life; inſomuch that his Complaints, Sighs, and Groans were heard by the Marriners and other Paſſengers. And indeed a while after a certain ſtrange Peaſant call'd <hi>Achillas</hi> cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:60542:174"/>To all theſe Examples might he added what happen'd to <hi>L. Paulus Emilius,</hi> when the Senate elected him Emperour, that is, Chief of the Army which they ſent againſt <hi>Perſes</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi>; that Evening returning home to prepare for his Expedition, and kiſſing a little Daughter of his call'd <hi>Traſia,</hi> ſhe ſeem'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſad to him. What is the matter, ſaid he, my Chicken, why is my <hi>Traſia</hi> thus ſad and Melancholly?

               </p>
               <p>If time would permit us to diſcourſe of the Sacred Hebrew writ, we might find a hundred noted Paſſages evidently ſhewing how reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly they obſerved Proper names, and their Significations. He had hardly ended this Diſcourſe, when the two Colonels arrived with their Soldiers, all well arm'd and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> made them a ſhort Speech, intreating them to behave themſelves brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in caſe they were attackt; for he cou'd not yet believe that the <hi>Chitterlings</hi> were ſo treacherous, but he bad them by no means to give the firſt offence; giving them <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval</hi> for the watch word.</p>

There he perceiv'd little Strength, leſs Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but much diſorder. From that time, foreſeeing that things would go ill with them, as it ſince happen'd, he began to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now one and then another, and be very Free of his cutting Jeſts: ſo ſome of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Captains playing the good Fellows to ſhew their aſſurance, told him, Do you ſee how

many Eagles we have yet? (They were then the Deviſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> in War) They might be of uſe to you, reply'd <hi>Cicero,</hi> if you had to do with Magpies.</p>
               <p>Thus ſeeing we are to fight <hi>Chitterlings,</hi> purſued <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> you infer thence that it is a Culinary War, and have a mind to joyn with the Cooks. Well, do as you pleaſe. I'll ſtay here in the mean time, and wait for the event of the Battel.</p>
               <p>Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> went that very moment among the Sutlers into the Cooks Tents, and told them in a pleaſing manner, I muſt ſee you Crown'd with Honour and Triumph this day, my Lads; To your Arms are reſerv'd ſuch Atchievments, as never yet were perform'd within the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man. Od's Belly, do they make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the valiant Cooks? Let us go fight yonder fornicating <hi>Chitterlings,</hi> I'le be your Captain: But firſt let's drink, Boys— come on— Let us be of good Cheer. Noble Captain, return'd the Kitchin Tribe, this was ſpoken like your ſelf, bravely offer'd: Huzza! we are all at your Excellency's Command, and will live and dye by you. Live, live, ſaid Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> a God's Name; but dye by no means. That's the <hi>Chitterlings</hi> lot, they ſhall have their Belly full on't: Come on then, let us put our ſelves in Order; <hi>Nabuzardan</hi>'s <hi>the word.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XL. How Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi> fitted up the Sow; and of the Valiant Cooks that went into it.</head>
               <p>THen by Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi>'s Order the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers and their Work-men fitted up the great Sow that was in the Ship <hi>Leathern-Bottle.</hi> It was a wonderful Machine, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, that by the means of large Engines that were round about it in Rows, it throw'd forked Iron Bars, and four ſquar'd Steel Boults; and in its Hold two hundred Men at leaſt could eaſily fight, and be ſhelter'd. It was made after the Model of the Sow of <hi>Riole,</hi> by the means of which <hi>Bergerac</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixth.</p>
               <p>Here are the Names of the Noble and Valiant Cooks who went into the Sow, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did into the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe.</p>

Here's a kind of a Whim on that Subject which I made formerly.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60542:185"/>
                  <l>One Evening, when <hi>Toſs-pot</hi> had been at his Buts,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joane</hi> his fat Spouſe cram'd with Turnips her Guts,</l>
                  <l>Together they pigg'd; nor did Drink ſo beſot him,</l>
                  <l>But he did what was done when his Daddy begot him.</l>
                  <l>Now when, to recruit, he'd fain have been ſnoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Joane's</hi> back-door was filthily puffing and roaring:</l>
                  <l>So for ſpight he bepiſs'd her, and quickly did find,</l>
                  <l>That a very ſmall Rain lays a very high Wind.</l>
               </q>
               <p>We are alſo plagu'd yearly with a very great Calamity, cry'd the Mayor; for a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant call'd <hi>Widenoſtrils,</hi> who lives in the Iſland of <hi>Tohu,</hi> comes hither every ſpring, to purge by the advice of his Phyſicians, and ſwallows us, like ſo many Pills, a great number of Windmils and of Bellows alſo, at which his Mouth waters exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Now this is a ſad Mortification to us here, who are fain to faſt over three or four whole Lents every year for this, beſides certain petty Lents, Ember-Weeks, and other Oriſon and Starving-tides. And have you no Remedy for this, ask'd <hi>Pantagruel</hi>? By the advice of our <hi>Mezarims,</hi> reply'd the Mayor, about the time that he uſes to give us a Viſit, we Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon our Windmills with good ſtore of Cocks and Hens. So the firſt time that the greedy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60542:185"/>
Thief ſwallow'd them, they had like to have done his buſineſs at once, for they crow'd and cackl'd in his Maw, and flutter'd up and down athwart and along in his Stomach, which threw the Glutton into an Lipothymy, Cardiac Paſſion, and dreadful and dangerous Convulſions, as if ſome Serpent creeping in at his Mouth, had been frisking in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>Here is a comparative <hi>as</hi> altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and impertinent, cry'd Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> interrupting them, for I have formerly heard, that if a Serpent chance to get into a Man's Stomach, it will not do him the leaſt hurt, but will immediately get out, if you do but hang the Patient by the Heels, and lay a pan full of warm Milk near his Mouth. You were told this, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and ſo were thoſe who gave you this account; but none ever ſaw or read of ſuch a Cure. On the contrary, <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his fifth Book of <hi>Epidem.</hi> writes, <hi>That ſuch a caſe happening in his time, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient preſently died of a Spaſm and Convulſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the Cocks and Hens, ſaid the Mayor continuing his Story, all the Foxes in the Country whip'd into <hi>Widenoſtril</hi>'s Mouth, poſting after the Poultry, which made ſuch a ſtir with <hi>Reynard</hi> at their Heels, that he grievouſly fell into Fits each minute of an hour.</p>
               <p>At laſt by the advice of a <hi>Baden</hi> Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the time of the Paroxyſm, he us'd to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60542:186"/>
flea a Fox, by way of Antidote: Since that he took better advice, and eaſies himſelf with taking a Clyſter made with a Decoction of Wheat and Barly-Corns, and of Livers of Goſlins; to the firſt of which the Poultry run, and the Foxes to the latter. Beſides, he ſwallows ſome of your Badgers or Fox-Dogs by the way of Pills and Bolus's. This is our misfortune.</p>
               <p>Ceaſe to fear, good People, cry'd <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> This huge <hi>Widenoſtrils,</hi> this ſame Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Windmills, is no more, I'll aſſure you; he dy'd, being ſtifled and choak'd with eating a lump of freſh Butter, at the Mouth of a hot Oven by the advice of his Phyſicians.</p>

               <p>THe next morning, we arrived at the Iſland of <hi>Popefiggs,</hi> formerly a rich and free People call'd the <hi>Gaillardets,</hi> but now alas mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably poor, and under the Yoke of the <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The occaſion of it was this.</p>
               <p>On a certain yearly high Holy-day, the Burger-Maſter, Syndies and topping Rabbies of the <hi>Gaillardets</hi> chanc'd to go into the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

               </p>
               <p>Theſe had rebell'd againſt him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ignominiouſly turn'd the Empreſs out of the City, mounting her a <hi>Horſe-back on a Mule</hi> call'd <hi>Thacor,</hi> with her Breech fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt toward the Old jaded Mules head, and her Face turn'd towards the Crupper: Now, <hi>Frederick</hi> being return'd, maſter'd them, and caus'd ſo careful a Search to be made, that he found out, and got the famous Mule <hi>Thacor.</hi> Then the Hang-man by his order, clap'd a Fig into the Mules Jim-crack, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the inſlav'd Citts that were brought into the middle of the great Market-Place, and proclaim'd, in the Emperor's Name, with Trumpets, that whoſoever of them would

Perceiving the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Calamity of that Generation, we did not care to go further up into the Country,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60542:187"/>
contenting our ſelves with going into a little Chappel near the Haven to take ſome Holy water. It was dilapidated and ruin'd, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo a Cover (like St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>) When we were in, as we dip'd our Fingers in the ſanctifi'd Ciſtern, we ſpy'd in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of that Holy Pickle a Fellow muffled up with Stoles all under water, like a diving Duck, except the tip of his Snout to draw his Breath. About him, ſtood three Prieſts, true ſhavelings, clean ſhorn and poli'd, who were muttering ſtrange words to the Devils out of a Conjuring Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was not a little amaz'd at this, and, inquiring what kind of ſport theſe were at, was told, that, for Three years laſt paſt, the Plague had ſo dreadfully rag'd in the Iſland, that the better half of it had been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated, and the Lands lay Fallow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Owners.

               </head>
               <p>ON the middle of <hi>July,</hi> the Devil came to the place aforeſaid, with all his Crew at his Heels, a whole Quire of the younger Fry of Hell, and having met the Farmer, ſaid to him; Well, Clod-pate, how haſt thou done, ſince I went? Thou and I muſt now ſhare the Concern. Ay Maſter Devil, quoth the Clown, 'tis but reaſon we ſhould. Then he and his Men began to cut and reap the Corn: And on the other ſide the Devil's Imps fell to work, grubbing up, and pulling out the ſtubble by the Root.</p>
               <p>The Country-man had his Corn thraſh'd, Winnow'd it, put it into Sacks, and went with it to Market. The ſame did the Devil's Servants, and ſate them down there by the Man, to ſell their Straw. The Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſold off his Corn at a good rate, and with the Money fill'd an old kind of a Demy-Buskin, which was faſten'd to his Girdle; but the Devil a Sous the Devils took; far from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Hanſel, they were flouted, and jeer'd by the Country Louts.</p>
               <p>Market being over, quoth the Devil to the Farmer, well Clown thou haſt chous'd me once, 'tis thy Fault; chouſe me twice, 'twill
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60542:189"/>
be mine. Nay, good Sir Devil, reply'd the Farmer, how can I be ſaid to have chous'd you ſince 'twas your worſhip that choſe firſt. The truth is that by this trick you thought to cheat me, hoping that nothing would ſpring out of the Earth for my ſhare, and that you ſhould find whole under ground the Corn which I had ſow'd, and with it tempt the poor and needy, the cloſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, or the Covetous Gripe, thus making them fall into your ſnares. But troth, you muſt e'n go to School yet, you are no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, for ought I ſee: For, the Corn that was ſow'd is dead and rotten, its Corruption having caus'd the generation of that which you ſaw me ſell: ſo you choſe the worſt, and therefore are curs'd in the Goſpel. Well, talk no more on't, quoth the Devil: what can'ſt thou ſow our Field with for next Year? If a Man would make the beſt on't, anſwer'd the Ploughman, 'twere fit he ſow it with Radiſh. Now cry'd the Devil, thou talkſt like an honeſt Fellow, Bumpkin, well, ſow me good ſtore of Radiſh, I'll ſee and keep them ſafe from ſtorms, and will not hail a bit on them; but harke 'e me, this time I beſpeak for my ſhare what ſhall be above ground, what's under ſhall be thine: Drudge on, Looby, drudge on. I am going to tempt hereticks, their Souls are dainty victuals when broil'd in Raſhers and well powder'd. My Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> has the

               <p>When the ſeaſon of Radiſhes was come, our Devil fail'd not to meet in the Field with a train of raſcally underlings, all waiting Devils, and finding there the Farmer and his Men, he began to cut and gather the Leaves of the Radiſhes.

He never fears to want any of theſe. But who can endure to be wedded to a Diſh?</p>

               <p>The day that we landed in the Iſland happen'd to be that which the Devil had fix'd for the Combat. Now the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, having like a good <hi>Catholic</hi> very fairly <hi>confeſſed himſelf</hi> and <hi>received,</hi> betimes in the morning, by the advice of his Vicar had hid himſelf, all but the ſnout, in the holy Water-ſtock in the Poſture in which we found him: And juſt as they were telling us this ſtory, News came that the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had fool'd the Devil, and gain'd the Field: You may not be ſorry perhaps to hear how this happen'd.</p>
               <p>The Devil, you muſt know, came to the poor Man's Door and rapping there, cry'd ſo hoe, ho the Houſe, hoe Clod-pate, where art thou? Come out with a vengance, come out with a wannion, come out and be damn'd; now for clawing; then briskly and reſolutely entring the Houſe, and not finding the Country Man there, he ſpy'd his Wife lying on the ground pitiouſly weeping and howling: What's the matter? ask'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, where is he?

Alas cry'd the old Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, he told me, the Butcher, the Tyrant, the Tearer of Devils, that he had made a match to ſcratch with you this Day, and to try his Clawes, he did but juſt touch me with his little Finger, here betwixt the Legs, and has ſpoyl'd me for ever. Oh! I am a dead Woman, I ſhall never be my ſelf again: do but ſee! nay and beſides he talk'd of going to the Smiths to have his Pounces ſharpen'd and pointed.

               <p>O thrice and four times happy People, cry'd they, you are welcom and more than double-welcom! They then kneel'd down before us and would have kiſs'd our Feet, but

we would not ſuffer it, telling them, that, ſhould the Pope come thither in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 'tis all they could do to him. No, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anſwer'd they, for we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd upon the matter. We would kiſs his bare Arſe, without boggling at it, and eke his two Pounders; for he has a pair of them, the Holy Father, that he has; we find it ſo by our fine <hi>Decretals,</hi> otherwiſe he could not be Pope. So that according to our ſubtile <hi>Decretalin</hi> Philoſophy, this is a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; he is Pope, therefore he has Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitories; and, ſhould Genitories no more be found in the World, the World could no more have a Pope.</p>
               <p>While they were talking thus, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> enquir'd of one of their Coxſwain's Crew, who thoſe Perſons were? he anſwer'd, that they were the four Eſtates of the Iſland, and added that we ſhould be made as welcom as Princes, ſince we had ſeen the Pope. <hi>Panurge</hi> having been acquainted with this by <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> ſaid to him in his Ear, I ſwear and vow, Sir, 'tis even ſo, he that has patience may compaſs any thing. Seeing the Pope had done us no good, now in the Devil's name, 'twill do us a great deal. We then went aſhoar, and the whole Country, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children came to meet us as in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion. Our four Eſtates cry'd out to them with a loud voice; they have ſeen him, they have ſeen him, they have ſeen

him. That Proclamation being made, all the Mob kneeled down before us, lifting up their Hands towards Heaven, and crying; O happy Men! O moſt happy. And this Acclamation laſted above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Then came the <hi>Busby</hi> of the place with all his Pedagogues, Uſher's, and School boys, whom he Magiſterially flogg'd, as they us'd to whip Children in our Country, formerly when ſome Criminal was hang'd, that they might remember it.

We'll take the Good-will for the Deed, and thank you as much as if we had. Ay Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſaid <hi>Homenas,</hi> but you never ſaw theſe that are Angelically written.

As for ſhriving, anſwer'd <hi>Panurge,</hi> there can be no great harm in't, but this ſame Faſting, Maſter of mine, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down with us at this time; for we have ſo very much over-faſted our ſelves at Sea, that the Spiders have ſpun their Cobwebs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Grinders.

Come then, let's go into the Church, ſaid <hi>Homenas,</hi> and pray forgive us if for the Preſent we do not ſing you a fine high Maſs: The hour of Mid-day is paſt, and after it our ſacred Decretals forbid us to ſing Maſs, I mean your high and lawful Maſs.

O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, wiſh'd for, and much expected day; and happy, moſt happy, you whoſe propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stars have ſo far favour'd you as to let you ſee the living and real Face of this good God on Earth, by the ſingle ſight of whoſe Picture we obtain full Remiſſion of all the Sins which we remember, that we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as alſo a Third part, and Eighteen <hi>Quarantaines</hi> of the Sins which we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got: And indeed we only ſee it on high an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Holy days.</p>
               <p>This caus'd <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to ſay that it was a Work like thoſe which <hi>Daedalus</hi> us'd to make; ſince tho' it were deform'd and ill drawn, nevertheleſs ſome divine Energy in Point of Pardons lay hid and conceal'd in it. Thus, ſaid Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> at <hi>Sevillé,</hi> the raskally Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers being one Evening on a Solemn Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at Supper in the Spittle, one bragg'd of having got Six <hi>Blancs,</hi> or Two pence Half-penny, another Eight <hi>Liards</hi> or Two pence, a Third Seven <hi>Carolus</hi>'s or Six pence; but an old Mumper made his Vaunts of having
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60542:197"/>
got three Teſtons, or five Shillings: Ah, but (cry'd his Comrades) thou haſt a Leg of god; as if continu'd Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> ſome divine Vertue could lye hid in a ſtenching ulcerated rotten Shanck. Pray, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> when you are for telling us ſome ſuch nauſeous Tale, be ſo kind as not to forget to provide a <hi>Baſon,</hi> Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>; I'll aſſure you, I had much ado to forbear bringing up my Breakfaſt: Fy, I wonder a Man of your Coat is not aſham'd to uſe thus the Sacred name of God in ſpeaking of things ſo filthy and abominable; Fy, I ſay: If among your monking Tribes ſuch an abuſe of Words is allow'd, I beſeech you leave it there, and do not let it come out of the Cloyſters. Phyſicians, ſaid <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> thus attribute a kind of Divinity to ſome Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; <hi>Nero</hi> alſo extoll'd Muſhrooms, and in a Greek Proverb term'd them divine Food, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with them he had Poyſon'd <hi>Claudius</hi> his Predeceſſor. But methinks, Gentlemen, this ſame Picture is not over-like our late Popes. For I have ſeen them, not with their <hi>Pallium, Aumuſſe</hi> or <hi>Rocket</hi> on, but with Helmets on their Heads, more like the Top of a Perſian Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant; and while the Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was in Peace, they alone were moſt furiouſly and cruelly making War.

               <p>NOw Topers, pray obſerve that while <hi>Homenas</hi> was ſaying his dry Maſs, three Collectors, or Licens'd Beggers of the Church, each of them with a large Baſin went round among the People, ſaying with a loud Voice;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60542:198"/>
                  <hi>Pray remember the bleſſed Men who have ſeen his Face.</hi> As we came out of the Temple they brought their Baſins brim full of <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> Chink to <hi>Homenas,</hi> who told us that it was plentifully to Feaſt with; and that, of this Contribution and voluntary Tax, one part ſhould be laid out in good Drinking, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in good Eating, and the remainer in both; according to an admirable Expoſition hidden in a Corner of their Holy Decretals; which was perform'd to a T, and that at a noted Tavern not much unlike that of <hi>Will's</hi> at <hi>Amiens.</hi> Believe me we tickled it off there with copious Cramming, and numerous Swilling.</p>
               <p>I made two notable Obſervations at that Dinner; the one that there was not one Diſh ſerv'd up whether of Cabrittas, Capons, Hogs (of which latter there's great Plenty in <hi>Papimany</hi>) Pigeons, Coneys, Leverets, Turkeys or others, without abundance of Magiſtral <hi>Stuff</hi>; the other, that every Courſe and the Fruit alſo were ſerv'd up by unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Females of the Place, tight Laſſes, I'll aſſure you, Waggiſh, Fair, Good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and Comely, Spruce, and fit for Buſineſs. They were clad all in fine long white <hi>Albes</hi> with two Girts, their Hair inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with narrow Tape, and purple Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, ſtuck with Roſes, Gilly-flowers Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Daffidown-Dillies, Thyme and other ſweet Flowers.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:60542:199"/>At every Cadence, they invited us to drink and bang it about, dropping us neat and gentile Court'ſies: nor was the ſight of them unwelcome to all the Company; and as for Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> he leer'd on them ſideways, like a Cur that ſteals a Capon. When the firſt courſe was taken off, the Females me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodiouly Sung us an Epode in Praiſe of the <hi>Sacroſanct</hi> Decretals; and then the ſecond Courſe being ſerv'd up <hi>Homenas</hi> joyful and cheery, ſaid to one of the ſhe Buttlers, Light here, <hi>Claricia.</hi> Immediately one of the Girls brought him a Tall-boy brim-full of <hi>Extravagant</hi> VVine.

When he had tipp'd that off, and given the Tall-boy to the pretty Creature, he lifted up his Voice and ſaid; O moſt holy <hi>Decretals,</hi> how good is good Wine found through your Means.

full Ears ſuck'd in the Air, as ſome of you ſuck Oyſters, to find if we could hear ſome ſound ſcatter'd thro' the Sky; and to loſe none of it, like the Emperor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> ſome of us laid their hands hollow next to their Ears: But all this would not do, nor could we hear any Voice.

               <p>At laſt we began to Fancy that we alſo heard ſomething, or at leaſt that our Ears tingled, and the more we liſten'd, the plainer we diſcern'd the Voices, ſo as to diſtinguiſh Articulate Sounds. This mightily frighted us, and not without cauſe, ſince we could ſee nothing, yet heard ſuch various Sounds and Voices of Men, Women, Children, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Panurge</hi> cry'd out, Cods Belly, there's no fooling with the Devil, we are all beſhit, let's fly.

more than enough. Let's fly, and ſave our Bacon. I do not ſay this for any fear that I have; for I dread nothing but Danger; that I don't: I always ſay it that ſhould n't.

                  <hi>Pantagruel</hi> hearing the ſad Outcry which <hi>Panurge</hi> made, ſaid, who Talks of flying? Let's firſt ſee who they are, perhaps they may be Friends; I can diſcover no Body yet, tho' I can ſee a hundred Miles round me: But let's conſider a little, I have read that a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher nam'd <hi>Perron</hi> was of Opinion, that there were ſeveral Worlds that touch'd each other in an Equilateral Triangle; in whoſe Centre, he ſaid, was the dwelling of Truth,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60542:209"/>
and that the words, Ideas, Copies and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all things paſt, and to come reſided there; round which was the Age, and that with Succeſs of Time part of them us'd to fall on mankind like Rhumes and Mildews, juſt as the Dew fell on <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Fleece, till the Age was fulfilled.</p>
               <p>I alſo remember, continued he, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> affirms <hi>Homer</hi>'s words to be flying, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſequently animated. Beſides, <hi>Antiphanes</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy was like words which being ſpoken in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try during a hard Winter are immediately congeal'd, frozen up and not heard; for, what <hi>Plato</hi> taught young Lads could hardly be underſtood by them, when they were grown Old. Now, continued he, we ſhould Philoſophiſe and Search whether this be not the place where thoſe words are thaw'd.</p>
               <p>You'd wonder very much, ſhould this be the Head and Lyre of <hi>Orpheus.</hi> When the <hi>Thracian</hi> Women had torn him to Pieces, they threw his Head and Lyre into the River <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brus</hi>; down which they floated to the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, as far as the Iſland of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> the Head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually uttering a doleful Song, as it were, lamenting the Death of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and the Lyre with the Wind's impulſe moving its ſtrings, and Harmoniouſly <hi>Accompanying</hi> the Voice.

               <p>THe Skipper made anſwer; Be not afraid, my Lord, we are on the Confines of the Frozen Sea, on which about the beginning of laſt Winter happen'd a great and bloody Fight between the <hi>Arimaſpians</hi> and the <hi>Nephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libates.</hi> Then the words and crys of Men and Women, the hacking, ſlaſhing, and hewing of Battle-axes, the ſhocking, knocking, and joulting of Armours, and Harneſſes, the neighing of Horſes, and all other Martial din and noiſe, froze in the Air; and now the rigour of the Winter being over by the ſucceeding ſerenity and warmth of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they melt and are heard.</p>
               <p>By jingo, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> the Man talks ſomewhat like, I believe him; but could n't we ſee ſome of 'em? Methinks I have read that on the edge of the Mountain on which <hi>Moſes</hi> receiv'd the the <hi>Judaic</hi> Law, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaw the Voices ſenſibly. — Here, here, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> here are ſome that are not yet thaw'd. He then throw'd us on the Deck whole handfulls of frozen Words, which ſeem'd to us like your rough Sugar-Plumbs, of many colours, like thoſe us'd in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60542:210"/>
Heraldry, ſome words <hi>Gules,</hi> [This means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Jeſts and merry ſayings] ſome <hi>Vert,</hi> ſome <hi>Azur,</hi> ſome <hi>Black,</hi> ſome <hi>Or,</hi> [This means alſo fair words;] and when we had ſomewhat warm'd them between our Hands, they mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like Snow, and we really heard them, but could not underſtand them, for it was a Barbarous Gibberiſh; one of them only that was pretty big, having been warm'd between Fryar <hi>Jhon</hi>'s Hands, gave a ſound much like that of Cheſnuts when they are thrown into the fire without being firſt cut, which made us all ſtart. This was the report of a Field-piece in its time, cry'd Fryar <hi>Jhon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panurge</hi> pray'd <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to give him ſome more; but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> told him, that to give words was the part of a Lover. Sell me ſome then, I pray you, cry'd <hi>Panurge.</hi> That's the part of a Lawyer, return'd <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> I would ſooner ſell you ſilence, tho' at a dearer Rate, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> formerly ſold it by the means of his <hi>Argentangina</hi> or Silver Squinſey.</p>
               <p>However he threw three or four Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of them on the Deck, among which I deceiv'd ſome very ſharp words, and ſome bloody words, which the Pilot ſaid, us'd ſometimes to go back and recoil to the place whence they came, but 'twas with a ſlit wee-ſand; we alſo ſaw ſome terrible words, and ſome others not very pleaſant to the Eye.</p>
               <p>When they had been all melted together, we heard a ſtrange noiſe, hin, hin, hin, hin,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60542:210"/>
his, tick, tock, taack, brededin, brededack, frr, frr, frr, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, track, track, trr, trr, trr, trrr, trrrrrr, on, on, on, on, on, on, ououou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouou, gog, magog, and I do not know what other barbarous words, which the Pilot ſaid, were the noiſe made by the Charging Squadrons, the ſhock and neighing of Horſes.</p>
               <p>Then we heard ſome large ones go off like Drums and Fifes, and others like Clarions and Trumpets. Believe me, we had very good ſport with them. I would fain have ſav'd ſome merry odd words, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd them in Oyl, as Ice and Snow are kept, and between clean Straw. But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would not let me, ſaying, that 'tis a folly to hoard up what we are never like to want, or have always at hand, odd quaint, merry and fat words of <hi>Gules</hi> never being ſcarce among all good and jovial <hi>Pantagrueliſts.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. LVII. How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> went aſhoar at the Dwelling of <hi>Gaſter</hi> the firſt Maſter of Arts in World.</head>
               <p>THat day <hi>Pantagruel</hi> went aſhoar in an Iſland which for Situation and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor may be ſaid not to have its fellow. When you juſt come into it, you find it rugged, craggy, barren, unpleaſant to the Eye, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Feet, and almoſt as inacceſſible as the Mountain of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> which is ſomewhat like a Toad-ſtool, and was never climb'd, as any can remember, by any but <hi>Doyac,</hi> who had the charge of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth's Train of Artillary,</p>
               <p>This ſame <hi>Doyac</hi> with ſtrange Tools and Engines, gain'd that Mountain's top, and there he found an old Ram. It puzzl'd many a wiſe Head to gueſs how it got thither. Some ſaid that ſome Eagle, or great Horn-Coot having carry'd it thither, while 'twas yet a Lambkin, it had got away and ſav'd it ſelf among the Buſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60542:211"/>As for us, having with much toyl and ſweat overcome the difficult ways at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, we found the top of the Mountain ſo fertile, healthful, and pleaſant, that I thought I was then in the true Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> or Earthly Paradice, about whoſe Situation our good Theologues are in ſuch a quandary, and keep ſuch a pother.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> he ſaid, That here was the Seat of <hi>Arete</hi> (that's as much as to ſay, Virtue) deſcrib'd by <hi>Heſiod</hi>; this however, with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments. The Ruler of the place was one Maſter <hi>Gaſter</hi> the firſt Maſter of Arts in this World; for if you believe that Fire is the great Maſter of Arts, as <hi>Tully</hi> writes, you very much wrong him and your ſelf; alas, <hi>Tully</hi> never believ'd this. On the other ſide, if you fancy <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> to be the firſt Inventer of Arts, as our ancient <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uids</hi> believ'd of old, you are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily beſide the Mark. The Satiriſt's Sentence, that affirms Maſter <hi>Gaſter</hi> to be Maſter of all Arts is true.

               </p>
               <p>We were all oblig'd to pay our homage and ſwear Allegiance to that migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him believe, repreſent to him, or perſuade him any thing.</p>
               <p>He do's not hear; and as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Harpocrates</hi> the God of Silence nam'd <hi>Sigalion</hi> in Greek was <hi>Aſtomé,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Mouth; ſo <hi>Gaſter</hi> was created without Ears, even like the Image of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Candia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He only ſpeaks by Signs, but thoſe Signs are more readily obey'd by every one, than the Statutes of Senates, or Commands of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs; neither will he admit the leaſt Lett, or delay in his Summons. You ſay, that when a Lyon roars all the Beaſts at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance round about, as far as his Roar can be heard, are ſeiz'd with a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. This is written, 'Tis true, I have ſeen it. I aſſure you, that at Maſter <hi>Gaſter</hi>'s Command, the very Heavens tremble, and all the Earth ſhakes, his Command is call'd, <hi>Do this or dye</hi>: Needs muſt whom the Devil drives, there's no gain-ſaying of it.</p>
               <p>The Pilot was telling us how on a certain Time, after the manner of the Members that mutin'd againſt the Belly, as <hi>Aeſop</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, the whole Kingdom of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> went off into a direct Faction againſt <hi>Gaſter,</hi> reſolving to throw off his Yoke, but they ſoon found their miſtake and moſt humbly ſubmitted, for otherwiſe they had all been Famiſh'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:60542:212"/>What Companies ſoever he is in, none diſpute with him for Precedence or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, he ſtill goes firſt, tho Kings, Emperors, or even the Pope were there. So he held the firſt Place at the Council of <hi>Baſle,</hi> tho ſome will tell you that the Council was tumultuous by the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ambition of many for Priority.</p>
               <p>Every one is buſied, and labours to ſerve him; And indeed, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this, he do's this good to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as to invent for them All Arts, Machines, Trades, Engines, and Crafts: he even inſtructs Brutes in Arts which are againſt their Nature, making Poets of Ravens, Jack-Daws, chattering Jays, Parrots and Starlings, and Poetreſſes of Magpies, teaching them to utter human Languages, Speak and Sing; and All for the Gut. He reclaims and tames Eagles, Gerfaulcons, Faulcons gentle, Sakers, Lanniers, Goſſe-hawks, Spar-hawks, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, Hagards, Paſſengers, Wild rapacious Birds; ſo that ſetting them free in the Air, whenever he thinks fit, as high and as long as he pleaſes, he keeps them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, ſtraying, flying, hovering and courting him above the Clouds: then on a ſudden he makes them ſtoop and come down amain from Heaven next to the Ground; and all for the Gut.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60542:213"/>Elephants, Lions, Rhinocerotes, Bears, Horſes, Mares, and Dogs, he teaches to Dance, Prance, Vault, Fight, Swim, hide themſelves, fetch and carry what he pleaſes; and all for the Gut.</p>
               <p>Salt and freſh-water Fiſh, Whales, and the Monſters of the Main, he brings up from the bottom of the Deep; Wolves he forces out of the Woods, Bears out of the Rocks, Foxes out of their Holes, and Serpents out of the Ground; and all for the Gut.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, he is ſo unruly, that in his Rage he devours all Men and Beaſts; as was ſeen among the <hi>Vaſcons,</hi> when Q <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> beſieg'd them in the <hi>Sertorian</hi> Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHile we fed our Eyes with the ſight of the Phyzzes and Actions of theſe lozelly Gulligutted <hi>Gaſtrolaters,</hi> we on a ſudden heard the Sound of a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument call'd a Bell, at which all of them plac'd themſelves in Rank and File as for ſome mighty Battel, every one according to his Office, Degree and Seniority.</p>
               <p>In this Order, they mov'd towards Maſter <hi>Gaſter,</hi> after a plump, young, luſty gorbellied Fellow, who on a long Staff fairly gilt, carried a wooden Statue groſly carv'd and as ſcurvily daub'd o'r with

               </p>
               <p>It was a monſtrous, ridiculous, hideous Figure, fit to fright little Children: Its Eves were bigger than its Belly, and its Head larger than all the reſt of its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, well Mouth-cloven however, having a goodly Pair of wide, broad Jaws, lin'd with two Rows of Teeth, upper Teer and under Teer, which, by the Magic of a ſmall Twine hid in the hollow part of the Golden Staff, were made to claſh, clatter and rattle dreadfully one againſt another, as they do at <hi>Metz</hi> with St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Dragon.</p>
               <p>Coming near the <hi>Gaſtrolaters,</hi> I ſaw they were follow'd by a great Number of fat Waiters and Tenders laden with Baskets, Doſſers, Hampers, Diſhes, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets Pots and Kettles: Then under the Conduct of <hi>Manduce,</hi> and ſinging I don't know what <hi>Dithyrambics, Crepalocomes,</hi> and <hi>Epenons,</hi> opening their Baskets and Pots, they offer'd their God, <list>

               <head>CHAP. LXI. How <hi>Gaſter</hi> invented Means to get and preſerve Corn.</head>
               <p>THoſe Gaſtrolatrous Hobgoblins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawn, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded the Famous Maſter of Arts, <hi>Gaſter.</hi> You know that by the Inſtitution of Nature, Bread has been aſſign'd him for Proviſion and Food, and that as an
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60542:220"/>
addition to this Bleſſing, he ſhould never want the means to get Bread.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, from the beginning he invented the Smith's Art and Husbandry to manure the ground that it might yield him Corn; he invented Arms, and the Art of War to defend Corn; Phyſick and Aſtronomy, with other parts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, which might be uſeful to keep Corn a great number of years in ſafety from the injuries of the Air, Beaſts, Robbers and Purloiners; he invented Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Wind and Hand-Mills, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Engines to grind Corn, and turn it into Meal, Leaven to make the Dough ferment, and the uſe of Salt to give it a ſavour, for he knew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bred more Diſeaſes than heavy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven'd, unſavoury Bread.</p>
               <p>He found a way to get Fire to Bake it; Hour-glaſſes, Dials and Clocks to mark the time of its Baking; and as ſome Countries wanted Corn, he contriv'd means to convey ſome out of one Country into another.</p>
               <p>He had the Wit to Pimp for Aſſes and Mares, Animals of different <hi>ſpecies,</hi> that they might Copulate for the Generation of a third, which we call Mules, more ſtrong and fit for hard ſervice than the other two. He invented Carts and Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons to draw him along with greater
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60542:220"/>
eaſe; and as Seas and Rivers hindred his Progreſs, he devis'd Boats, Gallies and Ships (to the aſtoniſhment of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to waft him over to barbarous, unknown, and far diſtant Nations, thence to bring, or thither to carry Corn.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſeeing that, when he had til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ground, ſome years the Corn pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in it for want of Rain in due ſeaſon, in others rotted, or was drown'd by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſometimes ſpoil'd by Hail, eat by Worms in the Ear, or beaten down by Storms, and ſo his Stock was deſtroy'd on the ground; we were told that ever ſince the days of <hi>Yore,</hi> he has found out a way to Conjure the Rain down from Heaven only with cutting certain Graſs, common enough in the Field, yet known to very few, ſome of which was then ſhown us: I took it to be the ſame as the Plant, one of whoſe Boughs being dipp'd by <hi>Jove</hi>'s Prieſt into the <hi>Agrian</hi> Fountain, on the <hi>Lycian</hi> Mountain in <hi>Arcadia</hi> in time of Drought, rais'd Vapours which gather'd into Clouds, and then diſſolv'd into Rain, that kindly moiſten'd the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Our Maſter of Arts was alſo ſaid to have found a way to keep the Rain up in the Air, and make it fall into the Sea; alſo to annihilate the Hail, ſuppreſs the Winds, and remove Storms as the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanenſians</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:60542:221"/>
of <hi>Troezene</hi> us'd to do. And as in the Fields Thieves and Plunderers ſometimes ſtole and took by force the Corn and Bread which others had toyl'd to get, he invented the Art of Building Towns, Forts, and Caſtles, to hoard and ſecure that ſtaff of Life; on the other hand, finding none in the Fields, and hearing that it was hoarded up and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd in Towns, Forts, and Caſtles, and watch'd with more care than ever were the Golden Pippins of the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> he turn'd Ingenier, and found ways to beat, ſtorm, and demoliſh Forts and Caſtles, with Machines, and Warlike Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, battering Rams, Baliſts, and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pults, whoſe ſhapes were ſhown us, not over-well underſtood by our Ingeniers, Architects, and other Diſciples of <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Philebert de l'Orme,</hi> King <hi>Megiſtus</hi>'s principal Architect has own'd to us.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that ſometimes all theſe Tools of Deſtruction were baffled by the cunning ſubtilty, or the ſubtle, cunning (which you pleaſe) of Fortifiers, he lately Invented Cannons, Field-pieces, Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins, Bombards, Baſilisko's, Murthering Inſtruments that dart Iron, Leaden, and Brazen Balls, ſome of them outweighing huge Anvils; this by the means of a moſt dreadful Powder, whoſe Helliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60542:221"/>
and Effect has even amaz'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and made her own her ſelf out-done by Art; the <hi>Oxydracan</hi> Thunders, Hails and Storms, by which the people of that Name immediately deſtroy'd their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Field, being but meer Pot-guns to theſe. For, one of our great Guns when us'd, is more dreadful, more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more diabolical, and maims, tears, breaks, ſlays, mows down, ſweeps away more Men, and cauſes a greater Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Deſtruction than a hundred Thunderbolts.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXII. How <hi>Gaſter</hi> invented an Art to avoid being hurt or touch'd by Cannon Balls.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>GAſter</hi> having ſecur'd himſelf with his Corn within ſtrong Holds, has ſometimes been attack'd by Enemies, his Fortreſſes, by that thrice threefold curſt Inſtrument, levell'd and deſtroy'd, his dearly beloved Corn and Bread ſnatch'd out of his Mouth, and ſack'd by a Titannick Force, therefore he then ſought means to preſerve his Walls, Baſtions, Rampiers, and Sconces from Cannon-ſhot,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60542:222"/>
and to hinder the Bullets from hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, ſtopping them in their flight, or at leaſt from doing him, or the Beſiegers and Walls any damage; he ſhow'd us a tryal of this, which has been ſince us'd by <hi>Fronton,</hi> and is now common amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g the Paſtimes and harmleſs Recreations of the <hi>Thelemites.</hi> I'll tell you how he went to work, and pray for the future be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ready to believe what <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms to have try'd; Suppoſe a Herd of Goats were all ſcampering as if the Devil drove 'em, do but put a bit of <hi>Eringo</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mouth of the hindmoſt <hi>Nanny,</hi> and they will all ſtop ſtock-ſtill, in the time you can tell three.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Gaſter,</hi> having caus'd a Braſs Faulkon to be charg'd, with a ſufficient quantity of Gunpowder, well purg'd from its Sulphur, and curiouſly made up with fine Camphir, he then had a ſuitable Ball put into the Piece, with twenty four little pellets like Hail-ſhot, ſome round, ſome pearl faſhion, then taking his aim, and levelling it at a Page of his, as if he would have hit him on the Breaſt, about ſixty ſtrides off the Piece, half way between it and the Page in a right Line, he hang'd on a Gibbet by a Rope a very large Side-rite or iron-like Stone, otherwiſe call'd <hi>Herculean,</hi> formerly found on <hi>Ida</hi> in <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> by one <hi>Magnes</hi> as <hi>Nicander</hi> writes,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60542:222"/>
and commonly call'd Load ſtone: Then he gave Fire to the Prime on the Piece's Touch-hole, which in an inſtant conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Powder, the Ball and Hail-ſhot were with incredible violence and ſwiftneſs hurried out of the Gun at its Muzzle, that the Air might penetrate to its Chamber, where otherwiſe would have been a <hi>Vacuum</hi>; which Nature abhors ſo much that this Univerſal Machine, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Air, Land, and Sea would ſooner return to the Primitive <hi>Chaos</hi> than admit the leaſt void any where. Now the Ball and ſmall ſhot which threaten'd the Page with no leſs than quick Deſtruction, loſt their impetuoſity, and remain'd ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hovering round the Stone, nor did any one of them, notwithſtanding the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with which they ruſh'd, reach the Page.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Gaſter</hi> could do more than all this yet, if you'll believe me, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a way how to cauſe Bullets to fly backwards, and recoyl on thoſe that ſent 'em, with as great a force, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerical parallel for which the Guns were planted. And indeed, why ſhould he have thought this difficult, ſeeing the Herb <hi>Ethiopis</hi> opens all Locks whatſoever, and an <hi>Echineis</hi> or <hi>Remora,</hi> a ſilly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fiſh, in ſpight of all the Winds that blow from the 32 Points of the Compaſs,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60542:223"/>
will in the midſt of a Hurricane make you the biggeſt Firſt Rate remain ſtock ſtill as if ſhe were becalm'd, or the Blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Tribe had blown their laſt; nay, and with the Fleſh of that Fiſh preſerv'd with Salt, you may fiſh Gold out of the deepeſt Well that was ever founded with a Plummet, for it will certainly draw up the precious Metal, ſince <hi>Democritus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophrastus</hi> believ'd and experienc'd that there was an Herb at whoſe ſingle touch an Iron Wedge tho never ſo far driven into a huge log of the hardeſt Wood that is, would preſently come out, and 'tis this ſame Herb your <hi>Hickways,</hi> alias <hi>Woodpeckers</hi> uſe, when with ſome mighty Ax any one ſtops up the hole of their Neſts, which they induſtriouſly dig and make in the Trunk of ſome ſturdy Tree. Since Stags and Hinds when deeply wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Darts, Arrows, and Bolts, if they do but meet the Herb call'd <hi>Dittany,</hi> which is common in <hi>Candia,</hi> and eat a little of it, preſently the ſhafts come out, and all's well again; even as kind <hi>Venus</hi> cur'd her Beloved By-blow <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when he was wounded on the right Thigh with an Arrow by <hi>Juturna Turnus</hi>'s Siſter. Since the very Wind of Laurels, Fig-trees, or Sea-calves, makes the Thunder ſheer off, inſomuch that it never ſtrikes them. Since
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60542:223"/>
at the ſight of a Ram, mad Elephants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their former Sences; ſince mad Bulls coming near wild Fig-trees call'd <hi>Caprifici</hi> grow tame, and will not budge a foot, as if they had the Cramp. Since the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous rage of Vipers is aſſwag'd, if you but touch them with a Beechen Bough. Since alſo <hi>Euphorion</hi> writes, that in the Iſle of <hi>Samos,</hi> before <hi>Juno</hi>'s Temple was Built there, he has ſeen ſome Beaſts call'd <hi>Neades,</hi> whoſe voice made the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places gape and ſink into a Chaſm and Abyſs. In ſhort, ſince Elders grow of a more pleaſing ſound, and fitter to make Flutes in ſuch places where the crowing of Cocks is not heard, as the Ancient Sages have writ, and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> relates; as if the crowing of a Cock dull'd, flatten'd and perverted the Wood of the Elder, as it is ſaid to aſtoniſh and ſtupify with fear that ſtrong and reſolute Animal, a Lion.</p>
               <p>I know that ſome have underſtood this of wild Elder, that grows ſo far from Towns or Villages that the crowing of Cocks cannot reach near it; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that ſort ought to be preferr'd to the ſtenching common Elder that grows about decay'd and ruin'd places; but others have underſtood this in a higher ſence, not litteral, but allegorical, according to the method of the <hi>Pythagoreans.</hi> As when it was ſaid that <hi>Mercury</hi>'s Statue
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60542:224"/>
could not be made of every ſort of Wood, to which Sentence they give this ſence; That <hi>God is not to be worſhip'd in a vulgar form, but in a choſen and religious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame manner by this Elder, which grows far from places where Cocks are heard, the Ancients meant, that the wiſe and ſtudious ought not to give their minds to trivial or vulgar Muſick, but to that which is Celeſtial, Divine, Angelical, more abſtracted and brought from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts, that is from a Region where the crowing of Cocks is not heard; for, to denote a ſolitary and unfrequented place, we ſay, Cocks are never heard to crow there.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis fair wind and as fine talk brought us in ſight of a high Land, which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> diſcovering afar off, ſhew'd it <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomanes,</hi> and ask'd him, do you ſee yonder to the Leeward a high Rock with two tops much like Mount <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> in <hi>Phocis</hi>? I do plainly, anſwer'd <hi>Xenomanes,</hi> 'tis the Iſle of <hi>Ganabim</hi>; have you a mind to go aſhoar there? No, return'd <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> You do well indeed, ſaid <hi>Xenomanes,</hi> for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth ſeeing in the place. The People are all Thieves; yet there is the fineſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the World, and a very large Foreſt towards the right top of the Mountain. Your Fleet may take in Wood and Water there.</p>
               <p>He that ſpoke laſt ſpoke well, quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge,</hi> let us not by any means be ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

worſe than <hi>Raw head</hi> and <hi>Bloody-bones,</hi> and full as honeſt as the Senior Fellows of the College of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> the very out-caſts of the County-Goal's Common-ſide. As you love your ſelf, do not go among 'em; if you go, you'll come off but bluely, if you come off at all. If you will not believe me, at leaſt believe what the good and wiſe <hi>Xenomanes</hi> tells you: For may I never ſtir if they are not worſe than the very <hi>Canibals,</hi> they would certainly eat us alive. Do not go among 'em, I pray you, 'twere ſafer to take a Journey to Hell. Hark, by Cod's Body, I hear 'em ringing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm-Bellmoſt dreadfully, as the <hi>Gascons</hi> about <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> us'd formerly to do againſt the Commiſſaries and Officers for the Tax on Salt, or my ears tingle. Let's ſhear off.</p>
               <p>Believe me, Sir, ſaid Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> let's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther land, we'll rid the World of that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and inn there for nothing. Old Nick go with thee for me, quoth <hi>Panurge.</hi> This raſh hair-brain'd Devil of a Fryar fears nothing, but ventures and runs on like a mad Devil as he is, and cares not a Ruſh what becomes of others; as if every one was a Monk like his Fryarſhip; a pox on grinning Honour, ſay I. Go to, return'd the Fryar, thou man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Noddy-peak! thou forlorn druggle-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sneaksby! and may a million of black Devils Anatomiſe thy Cockle Brain. The Hen-hearted Raſcal is ſo cowardly, that he berays himſelf for fear every day. If thou

art ſo afraid, Dunghill, don't go, ſtay here and be hang'd, or go and hide thy Logger-head under Madam <hi>Proſerpine</hi>'s Petticoat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panurge</hi> hearing this, his Breech began to make Buttons, ſo he ſlunk in in an inſtant, and went to hide his Head down in the Bread-room among the muſty Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in the mean time ſaid to the reſt, I feel a preſſing retraction in my Soul, which like a Voice admoniſhes me not to land there. Whenever I have felt ſuch a motion within me, I have found my ſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in avoiding what it directed me to ſhun, or in undertaking what it prompted me to do, and I never had occaſion to repent following its Dictates.</p>
               <p>As much, ſaid <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> is related of the Daemon of <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſo celebrated among the <hi>Academics.</hi> Well then, Sir, ſaid Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> while the Ship's Crew water, have you a mind to have good ſport? <hi>Panurge</hi> is got down ſomewhere in the Hold, where he is crept into ſome corner and lurks like a Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The Gunner immediately came, and was order'd by <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to fire that Gun, and then

In this Equipage, his Chops moving like a Monkey's who's a Louſe-hunting, his Eyes ſtaring like a dead Pig's, his Teeth chattering, and his Bum quivering, the poor Dog fled to Fryar <hi>Jhon,</hi> who was then ſitting by the Chain-Wales of the Starboard-ſide of the Ship, and pray'd him heartily to take pity on him, and keep

Add to this the thundering noiſe of the ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſeems more dreadful between Decks than above.
