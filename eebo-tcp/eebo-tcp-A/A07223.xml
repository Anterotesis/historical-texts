            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the God-head, being before all time, the maker of time, and all things that increaſe in time, there is number: The Trinity of perſons and vnity of God-head do declare as much. For although god be a moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diuine eſſence in himſelfe, yet hath he proportioned number in himſelfe, vnſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably vnited in his God-head: which the diuines call the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. And the ancient Philoſophers cal three inbeings, The Father, the actiue, or inworking vertue, power &amp; nature: The Son, they cal the word, ſpeech, or reaſon.</p>

But God in his nature, place, and eſſence, is greater then man. Therefore cannot God his incomprehenſible place and nature, be comprehended by the reaſon or vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of man: nature is a thing wrought by God: Now, no worke how great ſoeuer, can perfectly expreſſe the cauſe or worker thereof.

the creatures to the Creator: and out of a ceſſarie conſequent of the contrarie, it diſcouereth that God the mouer, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moued, nor doth moue; top, or from any place. For to ſay, he is here, or there, it is all one, for he is euery where: as it is authentically prooued: <hi>If I clime vp to heauen, thou art there: If I goe downe to hell, thou art there alſo. If I take the wings of the morning, and remaine in the vtmoſt part of the ſea, euen there alſo ſhall thy hand leade me: and thy right hand ſhall hold me: for the heauen is his ſeate, and the earth is his foote-ſtole.</hi> To conclude this point, we ſee and confeſſe, that God made, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things: and hath appointed their natures, beings, times, and places. Now, if he had in him the nature of any of his creatures, that is, to be limited vnto one, contained in place, or conſiſting of any materiall ſubſtance, the ſame would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber his diuine eſſence: for hee doth not come within the compaſſe of their limited nature, place, nor number: for by that meanes, wee ſhould derogate from his holy and diuine Deitie, and eſſence of a Creator, Seeing therefore, that God is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19728:9"/>
not compounded of material ſubſtance, he can not be a bodie. And ſeeing hee is not a bodie, he can not bee contained in place, neither wholly, nor in part; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it may properly be ſaid, that hee is no where: namely, that no part of him is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited within any place to be pointed at, or deſcribed.

                  </gap> leaſt to demaund, whether God be the author of euil?</p>
               <p>Theſe opinions may be anſwered thus. That making, or creating, are referred to natures and ſubſtances: and that all originall natures &amp; ſubſtances are good; And therefore that God, who is al good, is the Creator, and maker of them. Now euill, is neither a nature, nor a ſubſtance: but an income, which is fallen into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſubſtances: And therefore not in the time of creation, but is come in ſince, by a colaterall meanes. Euill, is a breathing, or diminiſhing of the foure good qualities &amp; effects: which natures and ſubſtances ought naturally to haue.</p>
               <p>Hereby wee ſee, that euen in time it ſelfe, good was before euill: and in place ſhall be farre preferred aboue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:19728:15"/>I conclude therefore, that Euill, being neither nature nor ſubſtance, hath not, nor can haue, any being in it ſelfe, but in the thing, that of his originall nature, or ſtuffe is good. Euill, is not an effect, but a default;<note place="margin">

And that euil is a certaine kinde of nothing; hauing no abiding, but in the the good: whereof it is a fault, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that theſe things which haue their being, nature, and ſubſtance, onely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and are finite with time, tending to the matter whereof they were firſt created: that is, to an vnbeing of that it formerly was: or to not beeing at all, as were the things whereof they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and vnto which, creatures haue ſtill a certaine inclination, whereby they may fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their goodneſſe. By theſe &amp; many other reaſons, may bee concluded, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19728:15"/>
there was not two beginnings, but one beginning of creatures and time. But the euill is crept in ſince, in the default, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, or abſence of the good, which in the originall creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was in the ſame natures &amp; ſubſtances, that are now become euil.</p>
               <p>Many ſuppoſals, imaginations, and opinions, haue beene holden of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingneſſe, eternitie, &amp; of the world, and of Time, by old writers; that had no other meanes to reach vnto the ſame, but the ſcope of their owne weake reaſons. But omitting the reſt, I will come ſhortly to the point. <hi>Plotinus</hi> in his booke of <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and of <hi>Time,</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">Plotinus Enead. 3.

Which opinion

the Diuines themſelues do hold.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author, hauing taken wonderfull paines in that point, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſearched out the definitions of time, made by the former <hi>Phyloſophers,</hi> knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the knot of his whole learning thus. <hi>We muſt needes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come backe to the firſt nature; which I affirmed to be in Eternitie: I meane, the vnmoueable nature, which is wholy all at once, the infinite and endleſſe life; and which conſiſteth wholy in one, and tendeth vnto one.

But</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>a certaine nature bent to many doings, that is to wit, the ſoule of the world, being deſirous to haue more then the preſent, began to mooue it ſelf.

               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:19728:16"/>By theſe concluſions, It is manifeſt, that the wiſdome and prouidence of God, for ſpeciall purpoſes and occaſions, hath made and ordained theſe three numbers, time, and place: not that they are any things, natures, nor ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, in reſpect of them ſelues; but in regard of the vſe and employment thereof: for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, placing, and conueying of things according to their qualities, natures, and effects. And for the beginning, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and furniſhing thereof.</p>
               <p>Time properly of it ſelfe, is neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue nor paſſiue: It is neither eſcence nor ſubſtance, and ſcarcely can be ſaid to haue exiſtence. And albeit time paſſe faſter then imagination, yet of it ſelfe, hath it no power to moue at all. And the beſt deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof is, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

In this appeareth the reaſon wherefore the worthy vnderſtanding of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19728:17"/>
number, place, and time, is onely known to man, and not to the other Creatures, is by the ſpirituall, immateriall, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eſſence and vnderſtanding of the reaſonable ſoule, which being created to endure when time ſhall be finiſhed, hath power and facultie to diſcerne betweene things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tranſitorie things, mortal, &amp; immortal: and ſo out of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worthineſſe then time, or any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſubſtance, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained within the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of time, to diſcern, the vſe, ſcope, end, &amp; purpoſe of al theſe les worthy &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner things. And out of an infallible reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to conclude, that the true vnderſtanding of number, place, and time, 'their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, diuiſions, purpoſes, and ends, are knowne to men: And the vſe thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only vnto them.

And vpon that ground, let this ſuffice for a concluſion, that whoſoeuer goeth about

by policie, art, or vnnaturall meanes, to erect, ſet vp, or maintaine any courſe or way, by proportioning of time, place, or number, for the benefit, reliefe, or ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mandinde; then God himſelfe hath ſet downe and prouided, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and preſeruing of his creatures: go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about as much as in him lieth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his creator for ſome defect or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and to become himſelfe in the nature of a God, to ſupply, ſuccor, and make good that want, or defect.

               <p>Among the number of things, that haue either being, ſence, or mouing, man is.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19728:19"/>
either in number, place, &amp; time, amongſt the elect: or, number, place, and time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reprobates. Now, for that <hi>I</hi> ſo generally finde, that reaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall part, to bee ſo vniuerſally caried away, ſeduced, and ouer-ruled by the meere ſenſitiue powers, entertaining the euill and forbidden things, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the good, allowable and lawfull: I haue made thus bolde to diſtinguiſh betweene theſe two times, and to giue this cauiat to the poſſeſſers thereof, that they ſtriue not ouermuch, to poſſeſſe or entertaine the number, place, and time, of theſe tranſitorie and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bleſſings, as that thereby they looſe, and faile to bee of the number, place, and time, of the elect: and bee caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of the damned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of vtter perdition.

And ſo much the more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>To come neerer to this point.

times, ſeaſons, their beginings, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, finiſhings, chaungings, or ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. And let all his creatures be then numbered, placed, and limited, according to their creations, nature, qualities, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, not ſtriuing againſt the purpoſe of his diuine prouidence, or adding, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing, too, or from, what hee hath appoindted or created.</p>
               <p>To diſcouer this, <hi>I</hi> muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and the other creatures, and the cauſes and markes they tend too, and ayme at: together, with the admirable bleſſing of reaſon: and to what meaſure the capacity of man thereby extendeth, for the ſearching out the natures, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, times, ſeaſons, places, and vſes of the other creatures, which could not bee, but out of a kind of immortall Nature, aboue all other creatures.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that God hath created all things, firſt for his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, wherein he appointeth ſeuerall vſes and ſeruices: And within the compaſſe of this dutie, are all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well men and Angels, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But take heed of the abuſe. Among many other ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vſes of mettals; Of yron and ſteele, they make kniues to cut meat: but it is not intended to cut mens throats: they make ſickles and ſithes to cut down corne and graſſe, without intent to cut mens legs. The like may be concluded of the other mettals, and the vſe of them. Wherefore to finiſh that point, gold and ſiluer being the fineſt mettals of the reſt, are ſearched out, refined, &amp; propotioned to paſſe betweene men at a value and rate, for the prouiding of victuall, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and other neceſſaries to defend the bodie, from heate, colde, and hunger: not that of themſelues, ſimply by themſelues, they are either diet, apparell, or prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont

to defende winters colde, or ſommers heate, but rather an incomberment, then comfort, if men be enforced to weare or vſe them next their naked bodies, or to feede of their ſolide ſubſtances. It ſhall be neceſſarie therefore, that wee doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or employ the ſame, to generall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures bege: or bring forth any new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary &amp; againſt his own nature: or to make it valuable with the leaſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and reaſonable Creature that euer was, or ſhall be borne.</p>

               <p>This is the condition of the Sunne, the Moone, the Firmament, and all the whole garniſhed and rich decked skies, with infinite numbers of Starres. And of all the creatures in this Sphere of Elements, they are: and yet they know not, neither what, nor whereof, nor to what purpoſe they are: what then auaileth this glorious richneſſe vnto themſelues?

Let vs proceed a little further: By the motion of the Sun, which ſurroundeth the world in 24 hours, they haue proportioned the circumference of the world, to be 360. degrees: they diuide euery degree, into 60. miles: with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which I omit.

               <p>To bee briefe in this point, becauſe the natures of things are in ſome ſorte before diſcouered; I wil only touch ſome fewe points.</p>
               <p>This great worke-maſter and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of things and natures, hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their kindes, natures, conditions, and effects: their increaſes, generations, and propagations; for hauing ſet the Heauens in motion, they continually moue without ceaſing: but in this, there is noe increaſe, nor generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill but one Sunne, and one Moone: notwithſtanding all the coniunctions ſince the worldes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

The earth cannot be metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or turned into an incorporiall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, neither is it her nature to produce or bring forth beaſts or men: for creation hath appointed euery kindes a ſeuerall manner of increaſe.

And becauſe we haue ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of number, place, and time, let vs in this place conſider what they are, or at leaſt what they are not. The better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their employments, they are not as is before recited, any matters, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, natures, nor eſſences, in reſpect of themſelues: neither haue they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to procreate or bring forth any thing. They are onely the veſſels, engines, mouldes, frames or organs, wherein
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19728:39"/>
things are caſt, faſhioned, placed, ſorted, and ordered.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe, in reſpect of nature, can proceede nothing: no not ſo much as themſelues, iſſue not, nor come not of themſelues: but are reſpected, according to the motions, courſe, order, or number of creatures, that paſſe in, by and through them. If a man ſhall offer to bring vp the Foxe whelpe, among the ſheep, euen from the firſt time of his littering: It is neither the placing him among theſe creatures, nor the vſe of time, will quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his greedy nature of deuouring his fellowes. The like may bee ſaide of all other Creatures, and their kindes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>It is againſt nature, for Creatures of one kind, to deſtroy one an other: which is a great argument of preuarication of the nature and reaſon of man: in that they ceaſe not continually and againſt nature, to worke one an others confuſion. Let vs proceed a little further: &amp; ſet theſe three, number, place, and time, to work ſimply of themſelues: they neither ingender, nor
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19728:39"/>

                  </gap>ions in theſe cauſes, to make them the more ſauery; leaſt ſtriuing to ſet our corrupt reaſon ouer high, we caſt it to the duſt. As in the firſt Creation, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, that there ſhould be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or foule matter, or defect, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in mans nature: So now, nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted, &amp; altogether polluted by diſobedience, It is both againſt, &amp; aboue this corrupt nature, that any perfection ſhould remaine in man: Albeit, there are that maintaine a ſparke or remnant of perfection, of the firſt originall nature, to remaine: whereby it may againe worke his former perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: as much as to ſunder &amp; take apart wine from water, after it is once mingled: for no polluted thing entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, can afterwards be clenſed from this polutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dye wil neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken cleane out of the white cloath. It is to be obſerued, that Chriſt in miniſtring
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19728:40"/>
the Sacrament of his bleſſed bodie and blood; Firſt he brake the bread, and they eate it: and then hee gaue the cuppe, and all was done, whilſt he was really and perſonally amongſt them.</p>
               <p>It is vnnaturally holden, that they did really and naturally eate his very fleſh, and drink his very blood: This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is againſt the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be the thing which it repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: or for the thing ſignified, to be the ſignifier, or betokener of that which is ſignified. Then it is againſt nature, that Chriſt as he was very man, being preſent and personally among them, performing this office himſelfe, ſhould at one inſtant be, &amp; not be. For, as he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo was he local. Now to deliuer himſelf, &amp; to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet remaine in the ſame ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of and by himſelfe, at the ſame inſtant, is againſt nature. Beſides, that he ſhould ſo exhauſt or drawe his moſt precious blood, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread (which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be his real &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly body) was eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19728:40"/>
there ſhould bee therein no parte of his bloud: and more, that himſelfe ſhould be at one inſtant abſolute man, &amp; at the ſame inſtant, ſee himſelfe viſibly eaten with the teeth of men, in diſtinct and ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This is againſt the nature of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and ſo againſt both. For Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not miracles, nor natures to bee changed. Beſides, in miracles, things did not at one, and the ſame inſtant, containe two ſeuerall natures: nor one nature in two ſeuerall places: as in the miracle at the mariage: as long as the water remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned water, it was not wine: and after it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wine, it was no longer water: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it wine and water, all at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, though turned in leſſe then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neither was it water in two ſeuerall places, nor wine in two places, otherwiſe then by diuiding it into ſeuerall cupps or veſſells. I make bolde to giue a touch of this miſterie, which I holde to be of deeper conſideretion then mans reaſon can reach into: which being a matter of ſpirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apprehended but by the eye of the ſame ſpirit, hauing regard to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d life before ſpoken of. Herein <hi>I</hi> obſerue, if men

be ſo bold to rack and ſtraine theſe great matters, what is it that they will leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the leſſe &amp; meaner cauſes?

Likewiſe, If any man will ſowe egges in the ground, or ſet corne vnder a hen, hee will hardly finde either Chickens, or harueſt. In ſuch ſort are the natures of things tied to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſorts, and meanes of increaſe, that neceſſitie will enforce nature to vſe her owne meanes, and manner of increaſe or generation.</p>

               <p>Let vs proceed to an example. There is an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the earth would in time, bring forth all the mettals that are in her

bowels, fully refined and pure, without Pheſies or droſſe: But either the curſe hath ſo weakened her naturall heate, or els ſhe is not permitted her time of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth her brood, which hath cauſed Arts to trie concluſions. If this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, what will follow of the next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? In this caſe, though time bee not agent, nor the paſſiue part thereof, yet you muſt giue this great bellied Lumpe, time to worke to perfection, and bring forth her great litter, brood, or ſpawne. But it will be anſwered, that Reaſon and Art, hath found a meanes, how to helpe Nature in this cauſe, and to ſupply the defect of heate by fire, for ſeparating of the purer mettal from the droſſe. Admit this, yet it muſt bee yeelded, that theſe Mines were ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially in the bowels of the earth: who in time as is affirmed, wold haue brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth: ſo as Reaſon and Art, had to work vpon. And in this caſe, you muſt likewiſe giue Art and Reaſon, time to worke their effect, and that by degrees and meanes: ſo that Reaſon nor Art cannot worke, but vpon ſubſtances,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19728:42"/>
and by meanes, which in the enſuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is not allowed. Ther is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Theoricke &amp; Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke part of any thing: or between mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of bare imagination and conceipt, and matters of ſubſtance and truth: betweene words and actions: for a man by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation may behold many thouſand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a moment, and ſet down a thouſand proportions in his minde in ſhorte time: conceiue a iourney of ten thouſand miles by Sea, with all the bowings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: But come to action, and you ſhall finde another worke and labour to performe it.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, conceit, and art, may plot &amp; ſet downe, how or what to doe: but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, matter and art, muſt performe the action. Theſe words, A thouſand pounds

It belongeth to Art onely, to proportion, but eſſentiall money muſt make ſatiſfaction. By theſe it appeareth, that God hath prouided ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial matters to paſſe from man to man, or to be vſed by man. And Reaſon hath found out Arts, to proportion &amp; rate the ſame.

               <p>The law it ſelfe is a prohibiting law, in no iote giuing libertie, but repreſſing. So are the wordes <hi>Negatiue,</hi> and forbidding. And vpon that reaſon, none of theſe words can be ſtained to make any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Theſe wordes in the cloſe of the ſentence: <hi>And no more greater gaine, or ſumme thereupon to be had</hi>; Do ſufficiently explaine, that by no meanes 100. li. by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courſe to be put out, may yeeld aboue the gaine of 10. li. for a whole yeare: But 100. li. put out for 3.6.9. months, and the money and vſe taken at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the yeare, may and doth yeeld a greater gaine then the rate of 10. li. for a whole yeare.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, the Lender may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19728:46"/>
again diſpoſe the ſame principal and vſe, for more gaine within the ſame yeare: and ſo not ſaued by the words nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſee how Reaſon can bring the former words to this concluſion. <hi>And ſo after that rate and not aboue: of, or for a more or leſſe ſumme: or for ſhorter or longer time.</hi> Theſe words being in body of the clauſe, haue refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to a rate: which rate is before expreſſed; that the forbearing of 100. ſhall not raiſe aboue 10. pounds, for one whole yeare.</p>
               <p>In this behalfe, the borrower is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, but the Lender: for the words are; <hi>No man ſhall take aboue</hi> 10 <hi>pounds &amp;c.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that as the Lawe is made onely againſt the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ker, ſo is there no libertie for him to take any thing, that may exceed <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19728:46"/>
his vſe mony within the yeare, contrary to the meaning of the Lawe: by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing &amp; placing it within one yeare: which vnder correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can by no means be conſtrued to bee ſaued by the wordes of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>A word or two, concerning the rate which <hi>I</hi> take to be double. A rate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and a rate of time. Theſe two, are ſpecially to be conſidered: for ſeeing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot worke this matter, you muſt permit Time to doe what office it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to performe. To this purpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether there be one, or more takers, at one or more times, within the yeare, is not material: but <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> reſpect is, ſeeing they haue nothing to raiſe this rate of money, but their induſtry, imployment, and labour, with a limitation of a rated time for the vſe thereof: that they may haue the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all theſe without abatements. For the eye of Reaſon in this behalf, doth not regard how often the mony be letten within the yeare, nor to how many or fewe perſons: but that the forbearing of 100. li. for a whole yeare, ſhall yeeld the Lender no more or greater gaine 10. li.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19728:47"/>
And in this behalfe, is ſpecially to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, the ſeuerall offices of the Lender and Borrower. The Lender departeth with his money vpon time, to raiſe his benefite: the Borrower, beſtoweth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by merchandiſing the money, with diligence, in time to raiſe the increaſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vſe of the money: If the Lender will take away any part of the time, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtatute, he doth not then allow the Borrower his full rate of time: and therefore of a conſequent, hee ought to abate it out of the rate of his vſe mony: for in this cauſe, thoſe two, that is, the rate of time, for which the vſe of time is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and the rate of money taken for vſe, muſt euer iumpe, to make the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euen. And common and ordinary reaſon yeeldeth, that no man will giue ſo much for any thing to bee payed at the end of one moneth, as hee would, if his payment were forborne a whole yeare. Such is the plaine caſe, as it is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vnderſtood: that the Lender, for one Moneth will take as much at the Moneths ende, as if he had forborne his vſe a whole yeare. But <hi>I</hi> take it, this error
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19728:47"/>
hath grown out of a fallaſie or miſtaking in Art, by ſome Arithmatitian,<note place="margin">Art ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that hath calculated this proportion by a wrong rule: not fully fitting; this purpoſe. for <hi>I</hi> conceiue, it hath proceeded onely by the rule of diuiſion: when it ſhould haue beene wrought, partly by diuiſion, and partly by addition: as the true conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Tables will manifeſtly expreſſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in a word or two, let me remember againe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene contemplation and action. Any that worketh barely by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by conceite: but hee that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any act indeed, muſt haue matter and ſtuffe: figures and cyphers, make no ſummes of money. Therefore if the Lender will haue conſideration, he muſt diſpoſe of his money and time: that hee, who wil haue mony &amp; time, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giue conſideration. In this cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the matter of Art, &amp; the point from whence <hi>I</hi> conceiue <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> error to ariſe, is to be looked into. It ſeemeth the Arithmatitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hath wrought only by diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the firſt

The Arithmatition ſaith, a whole yeere will yeeld 10. li. then he diuideth time, by time: One yeere into 12. parts: ſo that here time is both the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidend</hi> and <hi>Deuiſor</hi>: then he diuideth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by time: that is 10. li. by 12 months, &amp; he findeth the 12. part of 10. li. to be 16. s. 8. d. which he allotteth to one moneth. The rule is true, but not to be vſed in this caſe: for Reaſon the founder of Art, will ſhew, that he hath no warrant to meaſure by this rule: in that he hath no eſſentiall Deuiſor: for if you marke it, hee wanteth 11. months of his yeare,<note place="margin">

               <p>And on this point, doth Reaſon and Art conclude, which are more plainly expreſſed in theſe enſuing Tables: the falſe being reproued by the exceſſe, and the true, raiſed from leſſe to more, as the rate of time, and vſe of the mony giueth occaſion.</p>

Now if the owner will ſell any of theſe in their tenderneſſe, hee muſt bee contented to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of that he would require, if the ſame things were growne to more greatneſſe. If this be ſo, then in reaſon there is more cauſe the lender ſhuld forbeare his whole time before hee receiue his conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, howſoeuer hee doth his principall.</p>
               <p>Let vs touch a little the exceeding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and vſe the Lawe hath, in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes of time. Eſtates for yeares, muſt haue a certaine beginning and ending. Inheritances haue commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19728:50"/>
vppon time: and limitted to the ende of time. So the firſt eſtates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in time: and the ſecond being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtates, onely with time: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ending of time. Approbations and elections are concluded in time: things voideable, relye onely vpon time. All conditions are tyed vnto time. In the caſes of <hi>Cui in vita dum fuit infra etatem, dum non fuit compos mentis</hi>; ſpecial reſpect is of the time. All caſes of entries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſors, to take away entries, are tyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to time. The caſes that require continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all claime, are bound vnto time, with many others. But among the reſt, let mee conclude with one or two, to diſcouer what time, ioyned with ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth both enable &amp; diſable: <hi>I</hi> meane not to vouch any caſe. It is not vnknown that one attainted by act of Parliament, part of his lands ſold: time and the act of Parliament made the ſale good. But this attainder being taken off by another acte of Parliament, and the former act made voide; Time and the act of Parliament, did reſtore both the blood and lands of the attainted: &amp; made their eſtates voide,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19728:51"/>
which formerly were not. The lawe hath cleane take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away the time that was in the Feoffe; &amp; put the ſame wholly into <hi>ceſte q.</hi> vſe: and ſo wrought vppon inſtants, that there is now no inſtant at all in the Feoff, which before had the whole eſtate. Such a ſeruant is time; vnto the law, &amp; ſo aſſured is the law vnto time; That what contract ſoeuer it maketh therewith, ſhall be aſſuredly performed. In the caſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolments, there is ſpeciall prouiſion of time: wherein I make this ſhort obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that time doth worke, and vnworke, one and the ſame thing in nature accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as time is employed. The Kings te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant acknowledgeth a bargaine and ſale of land, held in capi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the barganie alſo dieth within the ſix moneths, &amp;c. his ſon within age, &amp; within the 6. moneths the bargaine &amp; ſale is inrolled. In this caſe, the ſon of the bargainer ſhall be out of ward, &amp; the ſon of the barganie ſhall be in ward, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to time. I put theſe caſes, onely to make knowne how flexible time doth turne and wind according to the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſerueth, and how ſtoute and ſtiffe it is in ſome other caſes, as the rules of law doth gouerne and direct it: and though this reſemble not the caſe in all points, yet it ſheweth, that in this behalfe, time is not to be diſpoſed at <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>A word or two concerning this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mony &amp; time. As I ſaid before, in actuall things there muſt be a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, naturall, and preſent <hi>Diuidend</hi> and <hi>Diuiſor, Numerator,</hi> and <hi>Denominator,</hi> as in theſe examples are apparant. A piece of timber is to be made into boords: In this caſe the timber is the <hi>Diuidend,</hi> and the Sawe is the <hi>Deuiſor.</hi> And of neceſsitie it followeth, that there muſt be actually and eſſencially, timber, and a Saw, or elſe there can be no boords.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19728:52"/>There is a garment to be made, In that caſe, the cloath is the <hi>Diuidend,</hi> and the ſheeres the <hi>Deuiſor.</hi> But for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the worke, there muſt eſſencially be both cloath &amp; ſheers. There is a great piece of meate to bee diuided betweene many men; the meate is the <hi>Diuidend,</hi> the knife is the inſtrument diuiding. There is a neceſſitie, both theſe ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though <hi>I</hi> know there be other <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> in theſe caſes: yet I make theſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, to make plaine my demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the neceſsitie of an eſſenciall <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend</hi> and <hi>Diuiſor,</hi> at the time of the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To reſemble this; The Lender at the end of one, 3.6. or 9. moneths, hath not an eſſenſial <hi>Diuiſor</hi> of twelue moneths, to warrant his diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And ſo diuiding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall mony by imaginarie time, doth erre in the ground of his Art: and ſo hath proportioned a rate that is not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either by Nature, Reaſon, Lawe, nor Art.</p>
