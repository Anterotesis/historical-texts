            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

To the end therfore not to omit any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting in the power

of a good Prince, that may tend to the reſtoring of the ſo long expected, ſo neceſſarie &amp; deſired vnion, peace and tranquilitie among our Subiects, we haue with much patience ſupported, and in reſpect of common commoditie pardoned the offences and raſh enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diuers, who (were it not for this reſpect) haue deſerued to be chaſtiſed and repreſſed with moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, rigorous and exemplarie puniſhments. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration hereof, after all our victories, we haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned &amp; giuen life to thoſe that leuelled at ours: And in regard of the great compaſſion that wee haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the capitall Cittie of our Realme, and to the end to eſchew the ſacke thereof, and to ſaue the bloud of many good Citizens, who were no partakers in the curſed driftes of the fauourers of this rebellion, wee haue choſen rather to fruſtrate our ſelues of that obedience that vnto vs is due, then to ſee the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent inhabitantes, the women and yong children, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſo many beautifull buildinges expoſed to the violence, rage, and fury of fire and ſworde. Wee haue therefore vppon the cauſes and conſiderations aforeſaid, in the moneth of Iuly laſt, agreed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended to a generall truce, for three monethes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time the Deputies of the Faction of our diſobedient Subiectes, haue giuen vs to vnderſtand and aſſured vs, that ſpeedely they would ſende to the Pope, to haue his good aduice vppon ſuch reſolution as they were to take for the concluſion of a good and ſtedfaſt Peace, and reconciliation of vs, who are their King and naturall Prince. Wherein alſo for their partes they haue moſt expreſly promiſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

themſelues with all loyalty and affection, for the reſtoring of the Peace of this Land, which made vs the more ready to yeeld to the ſaid Truce, albeit wee were ſufficiently enformed of ſuch diſaduantages as otherwiſe vnto them might ariſe, alſo that in matter of armes, wee had them farre on the hippe: yea and that during the ſaid conference, wee had perforce ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Towne and Caſtell of <hi>Dreux,</hi> euen in the face of the principall Leaders of their Faction. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the aſſiſtaunce of the Spaniſh Protectors: as alſo that we wanted no meanes ſo to oppreſſe the ſaide Cittie of <hi>Paris,</hi> that the want of victuals ſhould in the end haue counſelled them to ſhake off the yoke of thoſe, who for many yeares had tyrannized, and inſolently abuſed their miſerable patience. To all the which notwithſtanding wee of our authoritie did yeeld, the rather in reſpect of the Pope, whome wee wiſhed to be euery way ſatiſfied, &amp; to be truely enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our actions and behauiour, to whome alſo we purpoſed to haue recourſe, to lay open our greuances, and to craue his aide, fauour, and aſſiſtance: and to the ſame effect had choſen our deere and well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Coſen, the Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> a Prince accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with all vertues, endewed with wiſedome, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and good deſertes, who preferring the ſeruice of God, and benefite of this Eſtate, before the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of his health, and the daungers and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the way, hath cheerefully vndertaken the voyage toward him: But as for the Deputies of the ſaid Faction, who ſo aſſuredly promiſed with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſend, we haue not perceiued that during the

ſaide three monethes of Truce, they euer made any accompt to depart. Further, albeit that ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the ſaid Truce of three monethes, we haue in all their actions founde in manner no deſire to reeſtabliſh the publike Peace of this Realme, of the ſpoyle whereof they purpoſe to clothe themſelues, and to grow ritch with the goods and bloud of all good and loyall Frenchmen: with all, that there is come to our handes a certaine Oath, taken by the principal of that Faction, almoſt at the very time that they ſigned the ſaide Truce, and had promiſed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to deale, and to conſider of the meanes, how to conclude a good Peace, and to reconcile themſelues vnto vs, and to that end, to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for the good and wiſe aduiſe of the Pope: the ſaide Oath impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they ſhould neuer treate of any Peace or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with vs, wherein they ſuffered themſelues to bee ſo farre carried away with the paſſions of the King of Spaynes agents, that they reſerued not ſo much as the Popes authoritie, to whome they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend: we were therewith grieued, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, accordinge to the exigence of the caſe: All which notwithſtanding, vpon their deſire to prolong the Truce for twoo monethes more. vz. to the ende of the moneth of December laſt, ſhewing vs that it was vnpoſſible vppon our refuſall of this delay, for their Deputies to come to <hi>Rome</hi> time inough to be at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which might be there taken for the revnion of our Subiectes to our obedience, we vpon a deſire to iuſtifie whatſoeuer our actions in the preſence of the Pope preferring our purpoſed reſpect vnto him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12924:4"/>
before our owne profite, and the ſuretie of our affaires which we much hindered and prolonged, by reaſon of the ſaid delayes and prolonginges of the Truce, wee yet graunted them the ſame for the monethes of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember and December. Howbeit gathering by the ſmall deſire that they had to ſee an ende of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this Realme, together with the authoritie that vniuſtly they haue vſurped ouer a parte thereof: iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging alſo by the delayes, ſo artificially by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, that in all likelyhood they tended onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the calamities of France, and to aſſure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the wrongfull vſurpation of the townes and Prouinces by them poſſeſſed. We vpon theſe cauſes hauing referred all theſe matters to the conſideration &amp; mature deliberation of the Counſel, haue reſolued to deny them the prorogation of the ſaid Truce, for the monethes of Ianuary, February, and March, which they craued with ſuch inſtance, as we had cauſe iuſtly to beleeue, that ſuch purſuite neuer tended to grow to any good concluſion of Peace, but rather to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize vntill the Spaniſh forces might arriue in our frontiers of Picardy, by whoſe comming into the Realme, they mighte haue the better oportunitye to proſecute warre againſt vs, to the deſtruction of our good &amp; loyal Subiectes: which God of his holy grace would not permit, who hath opened our eyes to ſee, (by ſuch their miſſiues as haue bene intercepted,) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their wicked deuiſes, and obſtinate reſolution to mainetaine a perpetuall miſchiefe within this our Kingdome: his deuine clemency hauing taken into his eſpeciall protection the defence of our iuſt cauſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12924:5"/>
and enſpired the hartes of an infinite number of our good vaſſalls and Subiectes, to acknowledge the duety wherein they are naturally bound vnto vs, as appeereth by the comming in within theſe three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes into our obedience of the townes of <hi>Meaux, Lyons, Orleans, Bourges, Pontoiſe</hi> and others, among all others ſhal neuer be forgotten the happy comming in of our good towne of <hi>Paris,</hi> the head Cittie of this Realme, which happened the two and twentieth of March, with ſuch clemency, pollicy, good order and moderation, that not ſo much as one onely Citizen can iuſtly complaine of any iniury or offence againſt him any way committed: where the entry of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhewed no diſcontentment, but rather reſembled the ioyfull entry heretofore made by the Kinges our predeceſſors at their comming to the crowne, in that the ioy and applauſe of the people, vppon the ſight of their ſo long deſired King, were no whit leſſe then if they had euen then enioyed the like ſurety, as by theſe preſents is vnto them graunted of our grace, fauor, and protection, with forgetfullneſſe of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paſt, and aſſurance that we will neuer put in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion the deſertes of ſuch as in our ſeruice haue made ſhew of their vertue and ſtedfaſtneſſe. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof, together with the eſpeciall goodneſſe wherewith (vpon this occaſion) it hath pleaſed God to fauour vs, hath, and ſtill doeth bind vs more then any other mortall creature, to imagine, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to deuiſe how we may make our actions and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours agreeable before the holy maieſtie of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence, who as hee ſurpaſſeth in goodneſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12924:5"/>
and clemency, whatſoeuer the ſpirite of man is able to comprehend, ſo hath he voutchfafed to leaue vnto vs as an inſtruction and teſtimony, the example and woord of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to teſtifie vnto vs that whoſoeuer will be accompted his children, muſt forget others tranſgreſsions. Vpon this occaſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that nothing is vnto vs a greater wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that wee are made to the likeneſſe of God, then courteſie and gentleneſſe, freely forgetting all paſſed offences and tranſgreſſions: We haue, and by theſe preſentes doe declare, that wee haue, and doe accept into our fauour, the Citizens, dwellers, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of our good towne of <hi>Paris</hi>: Of our eſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and autority royall, we haue and doe aboliſh all matters happened in the ſaid towne during, and by occaſion of theſe preſent troubles, wee will and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that the ſame doe remaine ſuppreſſed, aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, extinguiſhed, and taken as thinges neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: and to that effect with the aduice of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lordes of our Counſell about vs we haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and decreed theſe thinges enſuing.</p>
