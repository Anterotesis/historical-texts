            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>By the Expedients Propoſed, tis offered,</head>
            <list>
               <item>1. THAT in ſhort time all the Wool of <hi>England</hi> may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from being Exported unwrought.</item>
               <item>2. That all the Wool of <hi>England,</hi> and what is to ſpare in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> may be Manufactur'd in <hi>England,</hi> as faſt as it grows and ariſes.</item>
               <item>3. That the converting of ſuch great Quantity of Wool will be of very little Charge to the Nation, ſo that all the Cloth we have to ſpare ſhall find quick Markets as faſt as 'tis made.</item>
               <item>4. That forty hundred thouſand pounds worth of Cloth may be made in <hi>England</hi> every year, more than now is, or can be by the preſent courſe of Trade.</item>
               <item>5. That the Wealth of the Nation Will Increaſe at leaſt forty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and his Majeſties Revenue by the Increaſe of Cuſtomes, very conſiderably.</item>
               <item>6. That every particular Pariſh and Pariſhioner in Dealings in the Country ſhall thrive thereby, conſiderably.</item>
               <item>7. That although we ſhould make twice as much Cloth as what is before-mentioned, yet there ſhall be no danger of Glutting the Markets; But we may obtain and ſecure the beſt Markets in the World to our ſelves notwithſtanding any Attempts of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. As to the firſt. To ſecure our Wool from going abroad, the beſt and moſt certain Expedient is, to have it converted into Cloth at home, as faſt as it grows and ariſes, by ſetting to work all idle hands; by means of which, our Wool will ſoon yield more at home than abroad, and this will more effectually do that buſineſs than the ſevereſt Laws.</item>
               <item>2. To have all the Wool of <hi>England,</hi> and what as to ſpare in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be Manufactur'd in <hi>England,</hi> depend's on the ſame Expedient, <hi>viz.</hi> Imploying all People, who by Contributions or Begging, are maintain'd by other mens Eſtates and Induſtry, for doing of nothing, there being (as 'tis, reaſonably computed) 200 thouſand in the Nation capable of one Employ or other;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61603:3"/>
ſo that by this great number of People, with the help of ſome <hi>Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> 'tis not to be doubted but we may Manufacture a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Packs of Wool more than are now Converted in a year.</item>
               <item>3. That the Converting of ſuch great Quantity of Wool, will be of very little Charge to the Nation, ſo that all our Cloth ſhall find quick Markets as faſt as made, is Demonſtrable: For,</item>
            </list>
            <p>By the Expedient propoſed, all theſe People now maintained for doing little or nothing, may inſtead of doing nothing, convert our Wool into Cloth, for their Living, ſo that look how much more Cloth is made by theſe two hundred thouſand People ſo much there's clear Gain to the Nation. For had they not done this, they had been, as now they are, kept and maintain'd for Begging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that put caſe all Beggars, Vagrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were plac'd in, and maintain'd by the Pariſhes as Pariſh-Poor, only for Sleeping, the thing in Effect to maintain them thus, would not be more disadvantagious to the Nation, than it is.</p>
            <p>Now ſince by the Expedients propoſed, theſe two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand People may earn ſome two pence <hi>per</hi> Day, ſome three pence, ſome four pence, ſome fix pence, ſome eight pence, ſome ten pence, and ſome one ſhilling a day more than by their preſent courſe of Life they do, and the Pariſhes by this means continue but half their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions which they paid before, then may the Clothiers in ſhort time, having their Work done for half the Wages which before they gave, afford their Cloth cheaper than ever they could; and ſince it is ſo, that other Nations who are our Supplanters cannot make Cloth without a mixture of our Wool (as our Clothiers affirm) nor good Cloth neither but on dear Terms, without Fullers Earth, which no Nation hath but our ſelves. It muſt needs follow, that we having more hands than they, to improve, more Wooll, and all the Fullers Earth our own, may (when all idle hands are thus brought to Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry) under-ſell them all, and force a Market in all Places in the World, where Cloth is vended, which is what was to be demonſtrated.</p>
            <list>
               <item>4. The fourth Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That forty hundred thouſand Pounds worth of Cloth may by the Expedient propoſed, with the Aſſiſtance of ſome Clothiers be made in a year, more than now is, or can be made by our preſent Courſe of Trade, is not difficult to conceive from what hath been ſaid, for if two hundred thouſand Perſons be induſtriouſly employed more than now are, it may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be concluded, that each Perſon one with another in a whole years time with the help aforeſaid, may manufacture at leaſt twenty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61603:3"/>
pounds worth of Cloth, which is all that was to be demonſtrated. Beſides in little time they will increaſe more and more both in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Ingenuity, for inſtead of breeding every Year <hi>thirty or forty thouſand Beggars, we ſhall by this Expedient breed up the ſame or a greater number of Ingenious Cloth-makers,</hi> as in the Propoſals at large is more fully diſcovered, ſo that 'tis not to be doubted but they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert one hundred thouſand Packs of Wool in a year more than is now converted as aforeſaid.</item>
               <item>5. That the Wealth of the Nation will hereby increaſe at leaſt forty hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> more than now it doth, and His Majeſties Revenue very conſiderably, more than before; is thus to be demonstrated.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As by the Confirmation of the ſecond &amp; laſt Propoſitions, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that after a little time of Practiſe, 100 thouſand Packs of Wool may be Converted more than now is: ſo this wool at twelve pence <hi>per</hi> pound, is twelve pound <hi>per</hi> Pack; and when it yielded ſo, the Wool was counted by the Clothiers to be one fourth part of the charge of the Cloth: By which it follows, that 100 thouſand Packs of Wool Converted, will be worth four times twelve hundred thouſand pounds, or four Millions eight hundred thouſand pounds; which being Exported, their Returns will be much more, and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Cuſtomes encreaſe proportionably; ſince our Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe will then be almoſt double to what it was, and the wealth of the City by ſuch Increaſe of Trade thrive more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than ever it did.</p>
            <list>
               <item>6. That every particular Pariſh and Pariſhioner in Dealings in the Country ſhall thrive thereby, is no leſs certain: For, Beſides raiſing the price of Wooll, at leaſt ſix-pence in every Shilling, and ſaving ſix-pence in every Shilling, which before they laid out in Contributions and Houſe-rent to the Poor. They will have better Trade for all Commodities; ready Money for Corn, Fat Cattel, Butter, Cheeſe, and every thing the Farmer hath to ſpare; by reaſon of this Circulation of Trade and Induſtry, ſeeing then there will be ſo many thouſands that pay for all they eat, drink and wear, who before had all for Begging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. That though we ſhould make twice as much Cloth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, yet there ſhall be no danger of glutting the Market; But that we may obtain and ſecure the beſt Markets in the World to our ſelves, notwithſtanding any Attempts of other Nations. This ſeems reaſonble to believe, if we conſider,
<list>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61603:4"/>
                     <item>1. That if all the Wooll, not only of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> alſo, could be Manufactur'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; yet there would be no more Cloth in the World, than now there is, for what is not made in <hi>England,</hi> is made elſewhere, ſince it is certain Wool is neither Burnt, rotted, nor any wiſe wilfully deſtroyed in any Nation wherever it grows; but is either converted at home or abroad. Therefore the more we convert in <hi>England,</hi> the leſs in other Nations, and the more they, Deereaſe in their Manufactory, the more ſhall we Increaſe in Wealth, Trade, Seamen and Navies of Ships, for the Strength and Safety of our Nation.</item>
                     <item>2. That no other Nation hath the like Expedients and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages as we have, and therefore 'tis impoſible they ſhould out-doe us; unleſs we be Wanting to our ſelves in point of Induſtry and good Method: And therefore though it cannot be expected, that we ſhould make Cloth for all the World, yet if we can under fell all other Nations, our Work is done: for we may force a 'Trade where we pleaſe. There is no Demonſtration like Experience, and for this we have a notable Example, given us by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who having by Under-ſelling their Iron, forc'd us not only to quit our forreign Markets, where before we vended very much; but alſo to deſiſt from making ſufficient for our own uſe. And then when they ſaw we had quit our Markets, and let fall our Iron works, they raiſed their Iron to as high a Rate as before. A Preſident worthy the Conſideration of the great Wiſdom of the Nation. For as 'tis true that <hi>Sweden</hi> abounds with Woods and Mines, more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than other Nations; in ſuch manner that they may under-ſell and force a Trade where they pleaſe for that Commodity. So <hi>England</hi> having more Wool, more Fullers-Earth, more Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Beggars, to be Employed, than any (if not all) the Nations about us. Therefore we may as certainly have Cloth made and fold on eaſier and more profitable Terms than any Nation in the World; And conſequently may force a Market in any Nation where Cloth is to be vended: As the <hi>Swedes</hi> have done with their Iron.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Method by which all this may be effected; is no more Charge, than if in every County, ſeveral Pariſhes ſhould be obliged to joyn together to Build in ſeveral places Working Alms-houſes for their chargeable Poor to live In: And that the Clothiers obſerve ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in their Trade, as to place themſelves near ſuch Houſes, and employ the ſaid Poor, where they may have their Work done cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61603:4"/>But in caſe the Clothiers refuſe ſuch Method, whereby all the Wool, aforeſaid may be converted, then it ſeems unreaſonable for their ſakes to prohibit the Exportation of Wool: Seeing that by their preſent courſe of Trade, little more than half is Converted: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if they ſhall ſo refuſe, it will be no difficult thing, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Pariſhes concerned, to manage the Expedients Propoſed themſelves, to all the Advantages before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>As for other great Advantages ariſing both to City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, together with the happy Reformation thereby to be Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, and all material Objections answered; the ſame with the ſaid Expedients, are more fully ſet forth and Contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. As alſo a Model of Government to be uſed in this Reſpect; for preventing all Abuſes and Deceits which have proved moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to ſuch Publick Undertakings.</p>

The firſt and great Objection is the <hi>Charge,</hi> to put us in ſuch Method of Induſtry, to which I anſwer, 'tis ſurely better once to pay for good Phyſick than alwayes to Languiſh, the Charge will not amount to a twentieth part of the Profits, for every thouſand pound expended on this Occaſion, will purchaſe two if not three thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Nation, and yet we ſhall keep our Purchaſe Money ſtill as it were in our own Sacks with our Corn, ſo that there ſhall not be a Great the leſs in the Nation, as is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated more at large in the Propoſals.</item>
               <item>2. Hence I cannot but maintain, that what is Propoſed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly practicable, for that it is no new Project, but with great Succeſs practiſed at this day by our Neighbours, being ſatisfied by what I have ſeen, that this very thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the Induſtry of the Poor accompliſh't by theſe very Expedients, is that whereby the Wealth of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> is rais'd and maintain'd. And why ſhould we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

our Country ſo far as to imagine that <hi>England</hi> yield not Men as wiſe to contrive, or as honeſt to manage ſuch an affair as any other Nation?</item>
               <item>3. It hath further been objected by the before-mentioned Honoured Perſon, that 'tis uncertain what number of Poor there is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and what Quantity of Wool to be converted. To which I humbly Anſwer, that though it be true that in thoſe Particulars I may err, yet in this we cannot err, if we proportion our Houſes to the Number of the Perſons to be employed, and to our Quantity of Wool, for then be the ſame more or leſs, the Profits will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to what I have calculated. And put caſe we have not Wool enough to employ them, this Expedient ſtill remains unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for we may employ them in making of Linnen to great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for as the firſt will bring Treasure into the Nation, ſo the other will be a means to keep it from going out.</item>

            <p>Laſtly, Leſt the Poor ſhould miſapprehend and ſuſpect by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients they ſhall be enſlaved <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt declare that I would not for all the World be an Inſtrument to any ſuch baſe and cruel Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore in my Propoſals at large have demonſtrated, that their VVork ſhall not make them Lives any wiſe Burthenſome or Deſtructive to themſelves, having nothing to do but to mind their Buſineſs, Eat, Drink, and take their Reſt without any thing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb their Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to add here, and ſubmit the whole to Conſideration.</p>
