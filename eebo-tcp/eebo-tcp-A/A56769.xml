            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read that ſome famous Divines have not
ſpared to report in Print, that they believed
<hi>Cardan</hi> Phyſician to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth,
was now in Hell, becauſe he refuſed to tell the
World a Secret with which he wrought great
Cures. And therefore for my part, I am reſolved
to prevent the Occaſion of any ſuch Cenſure, and
freely Communicate this Noble and Excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
that hath done ſuch great Cures in <hi>China,
Japan,</hi> and many other parts of the World, when
abundance of compounded Elaborate Remedies have
proved ineffectual.</p>
            <p>When I lived at <hi>Hull</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> a parcel of it
was given me for a Preſent, which I uſed with
wonderfull ſucceſs: And particularly, to a Relation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44437:3"/>
of Mr. <hi>Andrew Marvel</hi>'s, who was much emaciated,
and reduced unto a perfect Skeleton, a meer Bag of
Bones, by a long Hectick Feaver, joyned with an
Ulcer of the Lungs; being deſpaired of by all
Friends, I was reſolved to try what the Tincture of
this Root would doe, which I gave every Morning
in Red Cows Milk, warm from her Duggs, (which
my worthy Friend and intimate Acquaintance, Dr.
<hi>Primroſe,</hi> preferrs before Aſſes Milk, as you may
ſee in his Book called <hi>Popular Errors</hi>): And I found
his Fleſh to come again like that of a Child, and
his loſt Appetite reſtored, and his natural Ruddy
Complexion revived in his Cheeks, to the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his deſponding Relations, that he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Lazarus the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſolemnly profeſs, that I hate all Pretences to
Secrets, and I look upon the Printed Bills of Quacks,
who pretend to <hi>Noſtrums,</hi> and private Medicines,
to be meer Cheats, and Tricks to amuſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, and to pick their Pockets: But if any
Man can communicate a good Medicine, he ſhews
himſelf a Lover of his Countrey more than of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and deſerves Thanks of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I verily believe, that next unto
the Virtue of <hi>Scarborough Spaw,</hi> (which I ſuppoſe
I have ſufficiently recommended) I think this is
one of the beſt Medicines in the World, and in
many caſes better againſt Conſumptions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
of the Lungs than that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ogleby</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory of <hi>China,</hi> tells the
World, that a Pound of this Root is ſold in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44437:3"/>
Countrey wherein it growes, for three times its
weight in Silver, it is looked upon as ſo great a
Cordial.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Piſo</hi> that Learned Phyſician eſteems it a
mighty Reſtorer of Nature, and as far as may be
a Renewer of Youth.</p>
            <p>Publick Fame ſaith, that the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
are choſen to that Office when they are very Old,
doe make great uſe of this Root, to preſerve their
Radical Moyſture and natural Heat, that ſo they
may the longer enjoy their Comfortable Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I once recommended this Root to my good Friend
Mr. <hi>Steel</hi> the Miniſter, with ſingular advantage to
his Health, as he told me; but finding him under
the Care of an Excellent Phyſician, I adviſed him
to lay aſide all Medecins but what he preſcribed.</p>
            <p>When I read the Bills of Mortality, and find
three or four Thouſand dye in a Year of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
notwithſtanding all the rational Methods
of Phyſicians, and the boaſting Pretences of Quacks
and Mountebanks, I could no longer conceal this
Excellent Specifick..</p>
            <p>A very conſiderable Perſon at <hi>Hull,</hi> who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much pined away, had a Cough and Shortneſs
of Breath, a Quick Pulſe, and an intenſe Heat, at
ſome certain times, with wandering Pains in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of his Body, and reſtleſs Nights, and no
Appetite to Food; my Advice being deſired, I wiſht
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44437:4"/>
him to take the Extract made with this Root eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Night in Almond-Milk, and in a Months time
he gtew fat and plump, and all his ill ſymptoms
left him, and he is yet alive, to the Glory of God,
and the Comfort of his Relations.</p>
            <p>One thing is very remarkable, that let the Cauſe
of the Conſumption be what it will, <hi>viz.</hi> an Ulcer
of the Lungs, or a Scorbutick ſharp Humour in the
Blood, or a Hectick Feaver, or the Infection of the
Spermatick Veſſels, which in time and in various
Diſguiſes ſpoyls the whole Habit of the Body, and
by diſabling the parts to digeſt their Nouriſhment,
bring Leanneſs and Conſumption; I ſay let any of
theſe, or all of them, be Cauſes, yet this Root
proves advantageous, as Experience teſtifies.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of the Gentlewoman at <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
is very remarkable, who catching cold in her
Lying in, fell under great Weakneſs, a dry Cough,
Stitches in her Breſt and Sides, Heat in her Palms
and Feet, pining away inſenſibly; many Phyſicians
were conſulted, but all in vain; at laſt I adviſed her
to take the Spirit made of this Root, about ten Drops
at a time, in a Glaſs of old <hi>Mallago</hi> after Dinner.
In a ſhort time after ſhe gathered her Fleſh, and
had Five Children.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rippon</hi> there was a Good Friend of mine, of
a conſiderable Eſtate, whoſe only Child falling into
a deep Conſumption upon his Breeding of Teeth,
the Parents being almoſt diſtracted for want of an
Heir, nothing elſe being expected but Death, and
the Child being tyred out with other Medicines, I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44437:4"/>
recommended the Tincture, Spirit and Extract made
of this Root; and in ſix Weeks time the Child
mended and grew ſtrong and luſty, and is like to
be a Man.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many ſuch Examples might be given,
which are great Encouragement to make uſe of ſuch
a known, ſafe, and experienced Remedy, and ſo very
pleaſant as this is, being taken only in Drops,
whereby it becomes extreamly agreeable unto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who pine away upon breeding their Teeth,
as daily Experience ſhews, to the great Grief of
many tender Mothers.</p>
            <p>A Friend of mine at <hi>York</hi> who buried Six Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
preſerved the ſeventh (under God) with this
Root; for it hath no manner of Heat, but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
temperate, and may be given in all their
Victuals and Spoon-meat.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> once told me, he thought it was a
Medicine ſent from Heaven, to ſave the Lives of
Thouſands of Men, Women and Children.</p>
