            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WIse was the painter in his amorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, who in pourtraying out the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Venus,</hi> drew her picture with so great arte, sleight, and significant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of her naturall blazon, as the pourtraict of her foreparts all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed with the porch where she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in, <hi>posteriora eius</hi> on the back, being only seene go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Temple, presented an abstract to the beholders of so rare excellencie, as the type of the prototypon by signes and symptons seemed to say: Giue back enamorades of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies bewties: seeke not to see the face of the peerelesse: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your curious eyes with this, which though the meanest part of the delightfull obiect, yet of that perfection, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may behold the works of Dame Nature to be so farre aboue reasons reach, as wit and arte should skip beyond their skill, if they should attempt to set forth the worthiest parts of this goddesse paragon sance pere. And yet was <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> but a very strumpet: a common queane, fitter for <hi>Vulcane</hi> the black Smith, then for <hi>Mars</hi> the Captayne, and more admired at, talked of and followed for her want on tricks, insatiable lust, and shape to frame an eye to vice, then for any complement all perfection to be found in the purest parts of her filthie carcasse, or lineaments of her vading, though seeming faire sweete blesfull cheekes, shrowded in the auriflame of carnation dye, dropt in euery line mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall with argent and Gules, milke white and scarlet red.</p>
            <p>This I haue sayd, to bring into discourse the matter whereupon I meane to treate: and whereunto the treatise
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:3"/>
following doth wholy tend in chiefe, as intituled: <hi>A sparing discouery of our English Iesuites, and of Father</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>proceedings, vnder pretence of promoting the Catholick faith in England,</hi> &amp;c. For if wise were <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> or whosoeuer the Paynter was, in conueighing of his pensill, by such cunning to shew <hi>Venus</hi> on the back, as all men did deeme her face, and foreparts to be of such exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site perfection, as impossible by arte to counterfeit her beauty, and therefore in policie thought it meetest to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile her in a Temple: this glimpse of her seeming glory, being the only way to procure alonging desire of a full view to be had of her; a loue in such fondlings, kernes, lobcocks, and lewde priuadoes as had neuer seene her, and a conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what soeuer was amisse in her, or might breede lothsomnes in her followers: Then sure no fooles were the first Panegyricks of the Iesuites prayses in the vse of their wits, heads, hands, and pennes; by setting forth to the worlds theater in many strange proiects, antique stewes and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes, the hinder parts of the Iesuiticall perfection, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out the fore-parts <hi>(scil.</hi> their drifts, practises, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises which are first in intention and framing of plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes) ouershadowed with hypocriticall zeale pharisaicall pretence, and catholick shew of so true religion, as impossible for any one to equall them in any degree of perfection: whereas in very deede they are men of the most corrupt manners, imperfect life, and stayne of religion, that liue in the Cathol. Rom. Church this day, as this ensuing discourse will in part declare.</p>
            <p>And yet they stand so much vpon their pumptoes in the euerweyn'd conceit of their puritanian perfection, partly by meanes of fame, which following false reports hath made them famous: partly by folly, which hath made their follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers dote Pigmaleon-like vpon their shrines, and shadowes of vertue and deuotion; and partly, (and most of all) by cousening policy in the paynter, or her aults of their blazon, in setting forth a counterfeit of morall perfection, concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:3"/>
the essentials of christian Cathol. religious pietie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are not in them to be found. Insomuch as one (and he their chiefe Polypragmon) Father <hi>Parsons</hi> by name, scorneth to haue any secular Priests witnesse of the Iesuiticall worthinesse, and of his owne worthie deserts: but thinketh it inough to merit the honor, point of all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, worth, praise, and perfection, by possessing the minds of the <hi>mobile vulgus</hi> with an opinion of their hinder parts, to be such as themselues are (forsooth) peerelesse, matchlesse, and none to be compared with the meanest puny father of their societie. And hereupon in one of his letters like a prowde <hi>Nemrod,</hi> taking vpon him to be the holy Apostles peere (if not aboue him) he writes, and in this manner: What (sayth he) <hi>an indigemus iam co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatitijs lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: an non vos estis literae nostrae?</hi> who are priests and laborers in Gods Vineyard by our hands, and without our helps, and labors, and loue towards you, you neuer had bin such; no, nor these that are our most contradicters or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligners there &amp;c. Least therefore we should but incurre a scoffing contempt, and receiue but a flap with a foxtaile for commending of these peerelesse perfectiues: for my part I will promise good Father <hi>Parsons</hi> faithfully, that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he shall neuer haue my worthlesse commends, nor any of his remayning Iesuites. And further, in the same letter he accounts the secular priests ingratefull, for not applauding to their owne destruction, contempt of priesthood, abuse of Pope, and Prince, and ruyne of all Catholicks, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religion, in prowdly arrogating to his societie that all we haue, comes from them. Which is as false, as contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can make it: for all their credit, and what else they haue worth the naming, commeth from the secular cleargie and priestly prerogatiue. So then, this admonition of his giuen (though with many absurdities) is to be taken for a gentle caueat for all reuerend priests, and other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to beware how euer they admit, accept, or receiue from henceforth any fauour at a Iesuites hand; or yeeld
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:4"/>
them any countenance, or affoord them any furtherance in attayning to any place, office, or calling of credit, gayne, or other aduauncement: being sure by the former to be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayded euer after with disgracefull speeches, making a mountayne of a molehill (if any good be gotten by their meanes:) and by the latter, as certayne to make a rod for their owne tailes (as the tearme goeth) lesse or more sharp, agreeing to the qualitie of the profit, or preferment that any one shall enfeoffe, enrich, or possesse a Iesuite with there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And by both manifest it is, that whether you giue any thing to, or receiue any thing from them: the very gift, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, contract, bargaine, condition, familiaritie, or act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling with them; is a plague infectiue, a poyson reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse, and a pitch that floods of watery teares (nay what if I sayd bloudy) will not wash away: so dangerous are their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments and charme. For giue them but an inch, and they will take an ell. Admit them to parlee, and straight they fall to practise. Affoord them but a fauor in ciuill cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and they incroch vpon a freedome by absolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And once comply, comport, combine your selfe with them; and they pray vpon you. Aliene, sequester, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynt your selfe once from them, after acquaintance made with them, and you are sure to be deuoured by them: their baytes of calling to their lure are so sweete: their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings in giuing of gorges for off castings, so cruell, <hi>(gladij enim ancipites linguae eorum:)</hi> and their familiaritie so fatall, as like <hi>Seians</hi> iade they are infortunate, mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and worke the heauie downe-fall of those that deale with them. So as some haue wished that those priests who first (of meere charity I dare say) procured and were meanes of the Iesuites comming into <hi>England,</hi> as also of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to secular priests offices in the same: had bought their absence with their dearest bloud out of the one, and the other, the English Colledges, and the English Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But seeing the dismall dayes of our heauie calamities haue calculated to our hard fortunes, to bring those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:4"/>
vs that should augment our miseries: Let Father <hi>Parsons</hi> and his associates from henceforth spare their pennes, and (if they please) their liplabor besides, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting our witnes of their good names; and receiue with gratefull minds this testimony ensuing, by a discourse of their owne words, acts, and proceedings, as letters <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datitiats</hi> of the vnsauory fruits of their lucklesse labors. And because their face and foreparts (vnderstood by their intention, which should make their acts perfect indeed: for <hi>intentio non actus perficit actum)</hi> are masqued with a vaile of policie in externall shew of pietie, so as the ignorant sort of their foolish Enamorades haue nothing but their backs, or <hi>posteriora,</hi> that is, the fruits of their labors to iudge them by: therefore say I, by a demonstration <hi>à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriori,</hi> or of the effects, the testimony of their owne hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings and deedes done, will we, or nill we, will be such let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of commendations for them, and on their behalfe, as we are vnwilling to open, were we not forced thereunto; their friends will be sory (for their aduersaries will put them thereby to their trials:) Angels will blush at them: feendes will laugh them to scorne: and they themselues (if any grace, remorse, or shame be in them) will hide both their backs and faces for euer hereafter: neuer vaunt of their vertue, of their learning, of their wisedome, of their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of their graces: neuer pluck vp their plumes againe, neuer seeke to ouerpearke, ouercrow, ouertop their betters, their ancients, their independents, of whom they do &amp; must depend in their priestly function, their highest dignities, their whole authoritie, and the chiefe flower of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: spite of their pride, maugre their malice, though Don Lucifer be their Captaine.</p>
            <p>I might (gentle Reader, deare Cathol. Engl. Recusants, of all degrees and both sexes) heere enlarge my selfe with a long discourse of the Iesuites to too great impietie by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the example brought out of the picture of <hi>Venus:</hi> what foule, loathsome, and fearefull vices are amongst
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:5"/>
them, pharisaically ouershadowed with a pretence of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious zeale. I could here touch 20. sundry persons in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner, if confession-reuealers, if murders, if extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if cousenage, if what not more dreadfull offences worse then these (if worse may be) can touch them; and with wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of speciall credit, with more odious crimes then euer they can iustly lay (as most falsely, iniuriously, and vniustly they haue already layd them) to any of these secular priests charge: who now do stand in opposition against them. I could here set downe in a positiue discourse an historie of a great part of their whole life, euen from the beginning of <hi>Ignatius Layola</hi> a Span. Captain their first founder, to this present hower; all within one age of a man: how they are gone from their first institution, and haue corrupted and broken the rules of their order or societie: for they are so farre out of all order, as they must needes haue a new name, <hi>scz.</hi> to be called the Fathers of the societie (euen as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes haue such a like name) scorning to be called or sayd to be of the order of this, or that man, as the <hi>Benedictines</hi> are of the order of <hi>S. Bennet:</hi> the <hi>Dominicans</hi> of <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicks</hi> order: the <hi>Franciscanes</hi> of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> because the Iesuites are of the societie (forsooth) or fellowship, and that of no meaner person then Christ Iesus: how of all other religious orders (for religious they would be counted, though not of or in any order) they haue the soonest failed and fallen from all religious pietie in generall (for some of them no doubt are good men in speciall, but I doubt those are not Engl.) of any one order of religion that euer was confirmed (as theirs was) to this day. How many signes, demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and morall certainties there are, that their best dayes are past: their rare, memorable, and worthie fame, at the highest pitch: their haughtie-aspiring-towring-wits at a shamefull <hi>non plus:</hi> their prowde-ambitious-mounting-thoughts in the next turne to a Luciferian fall. I might take occasion heere to descry in the anatomy lecture of the Iesuiticall ghosts, the diuersitie of such wicked spirits, as
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:5"/>
transforming themselues into angels of light, leade more soules to hell with them, then the feends of most vglie shape appearing in their owne proper colours. I might from hence deduct a triple alphabet intire of Machiuilian practises v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Iesuites, setting downe their rules atheall in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their platforme layd for a perpetuity of their intended gouernment despoticon, and mock-weale publick oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall: how, when, amongst whom, and by whom, this &amp; that stratageme is to be practised: what maximes, axiomaes, or rules are generall or common to all: and which are speciall, and but proper to some in particular: how that <hi>vtiscientia, omnia ordine ad Deum, omnia propter bonum publ. societ. omnia pro tempore nihil pro veritate,</hi> with many the like, makes (by their interpretation) all lying, periury, swearing, for swearing, murther, incest, sacriledge, simony, idolatry, and whatsoeuer else, lawfull, profitable, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable &amp; necessary. How this polititian or state-father is to be imployed in Princes Courts as a lieger for aduice: how to canton a Kingdome: how to refine a Monarchie into the forme of a Prouince: how to insinuate himselfe in proper person or by his agents into his Soueraignes fauour, or some neerest about the seate of Maiesty, to know all the secrets of the land: how to alien the mindes of most loyall subiects, and draw them to consent to what vnnaturall inuasion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, conspiracie, riot, or what else, and when, and as he pleaseth: how to know the occurrents of chance and change in state affaires: and when and how to colour treacheries, treasons, and popular tumults, vnder glorious stiles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, and zealous actions. I might here dilate vpon the manifold iniuries, calumnies, and slaunders, breathed out by them against Popes and Princes, against the Cathol. Rom Church and common wealth of <hi>England:</hi> nay of euery Christian Kingdome: against the Mother Citie, where stands inuiolate the fortresse of our faith and religion: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all monasticall and religious orders: against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergie, and especially Seminary Priests: against all
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:6"/>
noble and generous blouds, titles, honors, and princely prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues from the regall Throne of Maiestie to the seate of worship against the right of inheritance to armes, lands, and honors, euen from the Soueraigne to the Freeholder or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in fee simple of all degrees: against all and euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, part, and member of the publick weale, molested, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered, infested by them. I might here set downe the finall conclusions of their intention, for, and to what end, they do these things: <hi>scil.</hi> to aduance themselues, and pull downe all that are not they. For this cause it is that all their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant crowes, are milke white doues: their black birds, swannes: their haggardhawkes, gentle fawcons of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For this cause it is that their sots are Salomons: their preuadoes, saincts: their silents, politicks: and all amongst them rare, matchlesse, peerelesse. For this cause it is, that they haue a more neere familiaritie with God, greater skill, and more aboundance of grace giuen them, for edifying, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, and instructing of soules, then any other Priest. For this cause it is that they dare presume to call the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an heretick: the Kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates: and to giue her Maiestie and the State heere names so odious, as too oft it is once to repeate them after them. No maruaile then if the secular afflicted Priests be subiect to their torturing toongs in all extreamenes that may be thought vpon. For this cause it is that they (the Spanish faction I meane) haue labored these 30. yeers space and vpward (for so long it is since the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> came out by the Iesuiticall humorists procurement) for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing her Maiestie of her life, Kingdome, Crowne, and all at once: for setting this flourishing common wealth on fier and flame: for establishing their owne Allobrogiall conceited soueraignty, vnder pretence of restoring this whole Ile to the auncient Cathol. Rom. faith and Religion. For this cause it is, that no Religion, deuotion, pietie, charitie, no nor any face of a true reformed Cathol. Church (as they tearme it) must be spoken of, or thought to be any where, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:6"/>
the Donatistiall-Africanian-Spanish-Iesuites: No not in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, without the Iesuites residence were any true religion to be found. For this cause it is, that all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests or other Catholicks must be censured, iudged, and condemned by these arrogant Iesuites for irreligious malecontents, atheall polititians, apostataes: and what not vile tearmes are giuen vnto them, that fauour not, nay, that will not applaude, further, and sweare to the Ladies <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes</hi> title to the English Crowne: or that will seeme any way to defend, wish, or shew any fauour in their poore and worthles conceits, (as what other opinion can afflicted sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects haue) to the line of King <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, or any one of the bloud royall of our owne Nation, borne and liuing within the Ile of <hi>Albion.</hi> For this cause it is, that the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests must be holden for men infamous, detected of most notorious vices, scandales, passionate, ignorant, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and vnfit for gouernment. For this cause it is that an innouate or new authoritie must be gotten and giuen to one Maister <hi>George Blackwell,</hi> (a man by so much the more fit for to serue their turne, by how much as he is the most vnfit of an 100. secular Priests within the Realme, for the purpose in shew pretended by them) for to extend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> with a premuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall stile and title of regall dignity, derogating as well to the see Apostolick, as to the seate of Maiesty. And yet he thus authorized standeth at the deuotion of the Iesuites to runne and turne like a lackey boy in a french Ioupe, and is to attend on his good Lord and Maister Fa. <hi>Garnets</hi> will and pleasure, being but aduaunced to the dignitie, honor, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a viceroy, nay but of a viceregent, nay but of a vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>president, nay but of a viceprotonotary, nay but of a viceui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridary: nay but of a meere spirituall rackmaster at the most. For he hath nothing to do with any Iesuite, among whom there is a subordinate authoritie by degrees ascendent euen to Emperour <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> or their Generall; but is at the commaund of the meanest puny father amongst them,
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:7"/>
to strike with ecclesiasticall censure, whomsoeuer any of them willhaue smitten downe: and therefore he must needs be said to be in some inferior calling vnder them, as the word Archpriest importeth. For the meanest Iesuit (though a lay brother) being accounted far better, and to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ordinary Seminary, or secular priest; it followeth then, that any Iesuite priest is to be preferred before an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary secul. priest, that is to say, before an Archpriest or chief maister &amp; head-priest ouer the rest of the seculars. For this cause it is, that the seeming to take notice of the Iesuits falshood, treacheries, &amp; treasons against the Cathol. Church, and commonwelth, intended by institution of this new puritanianlike superintendency, or authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resisting it (as the secular priests did, first by non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him, and then by appealing from him) is tearmed schisme, disobedience, disloyaltie, rebellion, and what not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, committed against Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> or <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> (for the words schisme, rebellion, &amp;c. must needs haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to some supreme Maiestie) and seeing the secular priests haue only (if against any) schismatiz'd &amp; rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>M. Geor. Blackwell</hi> and his Iesus masters: <hi>ergo</hi> by necessary sequel it must ensue; that he is the Pope in respect of the schism, &amp; the Prince in respect of the rebellion incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and committed against him. But then withal I do infer, that he is an absurd vsurper and traitor to them both alike, by his dotage in suffering such vaine Iesuiticall applauses to his owne destruction. For this cause it is, that he the said <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> must by the Prouinciall, or other superior or inferior Iesuits, commaund, excommunicate, suspend, and take away faculties from what priest they please; yea, and their goodnames besides. Nay which is not more cruell, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, barbarous, &amp; monstrous, then childish, ridiculous, peeuish, &amp; indiscrete, void of all wit, sense, learning, religion, conscience, ciuility, humanity, or honesty; he must and doth forbid men to defend their good names, to say, or thinke they are wronged by him, or the Iesuits: to seeke for any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:7"/>
to appeale from him in any thing. And in few, such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities are desperately diuulged by him, as neither Prince nor Pope in like cases can make lawfull: being against the law of God and Nature, wherein the Pope cannot dispence, much lesse <hi>M. George Blackwell</hi> suspend, inhibite, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, at a Iesuites pleasure. For this cause it is: that all manner of bookes, writings, or other passages of speech are contemned and condemned that fauor not <hi>Fa. Parsons</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularitie in his bookes of titles, or his treasons and slanders against our soueraigne and state in the late Bull of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication 1588 set out against her Maiestie &amp;c. or other rayling bookes of <hi>Philopater,</hi> the scribe, the wardword (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating to secular priests in sundry places) especially his high counsell of Reformation &amp;c. For this cause none but Span. and Iesuites are secretly nominated to rule the roast in <hi>England,</hi> vpon the pretended Span. inuasion for resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of religion: all the english that are not Iesuits being but fooles or atheists, and libertines, vnfit for gouernment. For this cause it is, that they (the Iesuits) haue bin plotting about this monarchie, how to bring both states ecclesiasticall and temporall vnder them aboue these 20. yeeres space: first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to tyrannise ouer the students and secular priests at <hi>Rome:</hi> then at <hi>Wishich;</hi> after that, throughout <hi>England:</hi> and now in euery place where any of them are opposite to their ambitious designements. For this cause it is, that <hi>Fa. Parsons</hi> was so beneficial to some engl. soldiers though here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, taken prisoners in <hi>Spain,</hi> that he so spedily obtained of the King Cathol. there to institute three Seminaries on his Maiesties costs and charges: that graynes and indulgences must be published in <hi>England</hi> on the Span. behalfe, for all that take his part: that all who come out of <hi>Spayne,</hi> must sweare, vow, professe, or at least acknowledge an obedience to Maister <hi>Blackwell</hi> in all things; yea euen to become ranck traytors against their Prince and Countrey, for that is principally intended. In few: for this cause it is, that the Iesuites labour in all things to be holden for peerelesse,
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:20199:8"/>
and to haue all the secular Priests to be accounted of as abiects vnworthy the naming.</p>
            <p>These with many the like particular points are here and in other bookes handled more at large: of all which, as I might enlarge my selfe beyond the limits of an Epistle: so desiring the gentle Cathol. charitable, and friendly Reader to peruse these, with this ensuing discourse aduisedly, voide of passion, affection, or other partiall doome: I craue only in recompence of my paines taken for their sakes to bring them out of error, a kinde censure of my well meant inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors, with a charitable remembrance of my poore sinfull soule in their Cathol. religious deuotions, and at the time of their best remembrance: as one that can not let passe any of my brethrens works that haue hitherto, or shall hereafter come into my hands, without an exhortatiue E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle vnto all true English hearted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, to beware of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall poyson.

            <p>
               <hi>OMnis Christi actio est nostra instructie.</hi> Our Sauiour Iesus his deedes are to all true Catholickes so many documents. The Scribes and Pharisees religious men had in processe of time through their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie vtterly discountenanced the ordinary Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. It is strange by <hi>Iosephus</hi> report, into what credit they were growne with the people, and especially with women. But <hi>ficta non diu fallunt:</hi> dissemblers for a time may beare a sway: but being like the apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi> touch them, and they turne into ashes: their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance willnot be long. Christ our Lord the truth and the light, finding these maskers ietting in his Church, plucked off their vizards, and with many woes disclosed their dissimulation: leauing vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to imitate, when we perceiue any religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons countenanced with neuer so high titles, to shift and practise by the like fraude, how for their owne aduancement, they may discredit the secular Priests, on whose shoulders, and not vpon religious mens, the cure and charge of all christian mens soules are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layd by the institution of Christ, and by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practise of the Catholick Church. We do not make this mention of religious men, as disliking of those most holy and religious orders, we are verily perswaded that they were deuised and founded by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20199:9"/>
spirit of God: some of them especially to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and some to ioyne therewith their paynes and trauell for the assisting of vs that be secular Priests in so great a worke committed vnto vs: but not to deale with vs, as these our new maisters the Iesuites do, to oppose themselues against vs factiously, or to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate and slaunder vs falsely, or to allure the peoples hearts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs hypocritically, or to insult and tyranize ouer vs most prowdly and disdainefully. For this is plaine Pharisaisme, and may not any longer be well endured: it hath already taken deeper roote in short time amongst vs then many men deeme of: and will grow to be pernicious to the Catholick Church, if with the greater foresight and diligence as pestilent weeds they be not plucked vp.</p>
            <p>Some of their followers haue presumed by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to affirme in writing, that the Iesuites are more free from error, more familiar with God, more particularly illuminated in all their meeds, and more specially indued with the spirit of guiding soules, then are the secular Priests in the haruest of God: and thereupon an admonition is giuen to all Catholicks to take diligent heed, and beware of all Priests in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that are not either them selues Iesuites, or such else, as haue relation to them, and are in all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings aduised and guided by them. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning women, some of them are admitted by our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest and the Iesuites into their secret Counsels: and both there and elsewhere amongst their gossips, they censure vs in the depth of their great iudgement very wisely: they rayle vpon vs of their charity very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, and they condemne vs before they heare vs very iudiciously: their seducing guides do fawne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, flatter, and magnifie them, and that makes the poore soules to be so fond of them, and to doate as they do, and runne ryot after them. We confesse and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20199:9"/>
thanke God for it very heartily, that as yet there are many sound and graue Catholicks both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are not bewitched with the Syrens songs of these new inchaunters. Marry the infection of this sore doth dayly as a Gangrene so spreade it selfe, as we haue thought it our duties a little to seare it, vntill the disease may be vndertaken hereafter, by some more skilfull Chirurgions, that may, if it mend not, haue power to cure it.</p>
            <p>In the applying of our remedy for the same, we will not tell you of the bones and rottennes that are in these graues or sepulchres, or of the inward filthines that remayneth within their pots and platters, or of any such inward vncleanes and iniquitie. For except the very out sides of their monuments and of their vessell, notwithstanding all their cunning paynting and scowring be foule inough, and loathsome to any that will not foolishly shut their eyes, we shall very greatly meruaile at it when we know it. For our parts the truth is, that brag the Iesuites and their adherents neuer so greatly of their familiarity with God, and of their particular illuminations: yet we professe and glory in our calling, that we do not hold it necessary for the better credit of our functions to vaunt of our more neere acquaintance with the Almighty, then our predecessors and brethren haue had: and that we are most confident, not only in the excellencie of our Priesthood, but also in assurance that we in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our functions haue a sufficient direction of Gods holy spirit, although with the <hi>Zuinckfeldians</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> we neither brag nor boast of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar illuminations. Nay if the fruits that ensue from our English Iesuitisme do proceede from their suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed familiaritie with God, and from what we know not more secret inspirations: we do greatly feare that their said familiaritie hath bred some great contempt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20199:10"/>
in them: and do pray with all our harts that God will euermore deliuer vs poore secular Priests from such familiaritie with his diuine Maiestie; and from their phanaticall dreames of extraordinary illuminations, inspirations, insufflations, or what else you will call them. We as we trust shall alwayes content our selues with the graces of God bestowed vpon vs at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing into our harts of the indeleble character of Priesthood, and multiplied as we trust by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the discharging of our duties by winning of soules, and our diligent indeuour to propagate and defend the Catholick faith: without any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of these Hispanicall conceits to winne or continue our credits and estimation with you.</p>
            <p>In this our rough draught to shadow out in some sort vnto you the contagion and practises of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, Iesuitisme and Iesuites, we do first intreate of them and such like as they are more generally, and then we will be bold a little to claw Father <hi>Parsons</hi> where he itcheth not, as the man that hath bin and still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth the chiefe firebrand that hath and doth inflame so many both mens and womens hearts with pride, disdayne, and malice against vs, their auncient, most louing, and faithfull ghostly Fathers: who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their vnkindnes towards vs, do loue them still vnfeinedly, and praying for them continually, are euery day ready to offer our liues for the honor of the Catholick Church, and for the confirmation of their faith. Now for the first point, that you may more truly discerne what manner of fellowes the Iesuites are, that thus haue bewitched many of you: we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you (the better to ease our paines herein) vnto certaine treatises which haue bin published to the world by sundry good Catholicks, as they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed them selues to be against these kinde of men and their enterprises in other Cuntries. A Gentleman
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20199:10"/>
of <hi>Polonia</hi> hath set them downe at large in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: his discourse is thus intituled: <hi>Equitis Poloni in Iesuitas actio prima.</hi> We haue seene two treatises: and there is a third also conteyning their practises in <hi>France,</hi> and the causes of their banishment out of that Kingdome. The parties that made them were the Kings Aduocates: men of great estimation: Maister <hi>Anthony Arnold,</hi> Maister <hi>La. Dolle,</hi> and Maister <hi>Symon Maryon.</hi> The first of these treatises is in Latine, and the other two are in French: which you that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that language may easily procure. But what is this to our English Iesuites? You sayd truly, were they not all in a manner birds of one feather: and that by one you might in effect discerne the rest: yet are there also some other particular treatises that come neerer home vnto vs. Maister <hi>Cecill</hi> a Catholick Priest hath written a discourse against Fa. <hi>Criton</hi> a Iesuite, and Maister <hi>Charles Paget</hi> an other against Fa. <hi>Parsons,</hi> they are both in print, and in english. Get them if you can: for in the perusing of them, although sometimes you will be much grieued, yet there are many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ministred now and then of some little disdaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mirth, to see the folly of those Fathers, how they thinke they can play at tennis with kingdomes. Foure other treatises haue also lately bin made by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen and Catholicks: and three of them by the most auncient and grauest Priests in <hi>England:</hi> such as haue endured the greatest affliction for the Catholick faith of any that now liue amongst vs. One of these treatises is in english, written of purpose to satisfie all true Catholicks concerning the garboyles amongst vs: the other three are in Latine, two of them dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Popes Holynes, and the third to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition at <hi>Rome.</hi> One of them is called a Memoriall, penned <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. and the other is intituled <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio motuum &amp; turbationum:</hi> and the third, <hi>Relatio
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20199:11"/>
compendiosa &amp;c.</hi> the two last being set out this yeere with the sayd english treatise, are all of them in print. They do all foure discourse at large of the Iesuites of our Nation, and of their Machiuilian practises. But because as we suppose you will hardly come to the sight of them; and for that sundry things were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them as impertinent to the matters there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of, or auoyded purposedly, least they should haue bin tedious, as also peraduenture because you haue seene none other of the treatises before specified: we haue heere described many ofthem after a sleight manner, vntill you may hereafter know them better, as well by the sayd treatises when they shall come to your hands, as by our small paines vndertaken of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (God he knoweth) for the benefit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, that either they may be in time reformed, or with speede auoyded.</p>
            <p>The order of that society being approued by the Pope is to be honoured of all good Catholicks, and the men them selues are to be reuerenced; such we meane as liue according to their calling and first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: which few of them do. For of late yeeres ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that order take such a course, as if religion were nothing else but a meere politicall deuise, conceiued, framed, and vpheld only by humane wisedome, and sleights of wit: and they were the men that by Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels rules are raysed vpto mayntayne it by equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, detractions, dissimulation, ambition, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for superioritie, stirring vp strife, setting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes against kingdomes, raising of rebellions, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Princes, and by we know not how many stratagems of Sathan, comming out of hell, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to confusion.</p>
            <p>The old saying was, let the Shoemaker meddle with his slipper, the Smith with his anuill, and the Priests with their prayers; but the Iesuites like franke game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20199:11"/>
are in at all. He is not worth a rush amongst them that is not able to manage a kingdome. Matters of State, titles of Princes, genealogies of Kings, rights of succession, disposing of scepters, and such affaires, are their chiefe studies. Some feare that they are more cunning in <hi>Aretine, Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Macbiuell,</hi> then either in their breuiaries, diurnals, or portuise: assuredly they do not behaue them selues like any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men. He that should tell them of liuing in a Cloyster, were as good to go a myle about, as fall into their fingers: such a base kind of life is so farre vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of their excellentnes. There are few kings Courts in <hi>Europe</hi> where some of their maisterships do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, of purpose to receiue and giue intelligence vnto their Generall at <hi>Rome</hi> of all the occurrents in these parts of the world: which they dispatch to and fro by secret ciphers; hauing either a Iesuite or some one altogether Iesuited in the most of those Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, who <hi>propter bonum societatis,</hi> must without scruple deliuer to them the secrets of their Soueraignes to their vttermost knowledge.</p>
            <p>It is true, that all orders of religion haue an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall estimation of their particular founders: but the Iesuites are therein ouercarried with humour aboue all measure. For the Inuentor of their order being a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and a souldier, of what country soeuer any of his disciples are by their birth, in their harts and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises they are altogether Spanish, breathing little but cruelties, garboyles, and troubles. They haue by their writings, their Sermons, and by all their indeuors la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to perswade all Catholicks, that the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> and ourfaith are so linked together, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a point of necessity in the Catholick faith to put all <hi>Europe</hi> into his hands, or otherwise that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religion will be vtterly extinguished and perish: which is a ridiculous, nay a wicked conceit, and like

themselues, building the faith of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors vpon the King of <hi>Spaynes</hi> Monarchie, as if he haue not all, the Church must come to nothing. But these courtly Rabbies do thinke they may easily carry vs poore secular Priests after their shadowes, and make vs to admire whatsoeuer they will tell vs. How they laboured in <hi>Fraunce</hi> (euen the French Iesuites the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues) to haue lifted the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into the throane of that kingdome, with the consequent ouerthrow of their owne natiue country, you are not ignorant: all Christendome to their perpetuall shame ringing so lowdly of it. With which prodigious, and more then heathenish practises, if they were only stayned, and that the contagion of them had not infected the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites borne amongst vs heere in <hi>England,</hi> it would much lesse haue grieued all discreete English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and especially vs the secular Priests. But to our infinite danger it is farre otherwise. For what stirre haue some of them kept in <hi>Spayne,</hi> to perswade the King to inuade this our Country (a designement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning in it the very ocean of all desperat calamities) yeelding vnto him many reasons why he was bound to vndertake that enterprise, and assuring him of great assistance heere, if once his forces were landed. Since which time, who almost is ignorant how they vrged him to a second, and to a third attempt, for the surprizing of <hi>Arwennick</hi> Castle, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hill <hi>Pendenice,</hi> two other stratagems tending to inuasion. Hereunto may be added (though out of place) how many they haue intituled to the Crowne of this Kingdome: as the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> and others, exciting some of them by force of armes to assayle her Maiestie, and buzzing into their eares how easily the Scepter might be wrung out of her hands, and they obteyne it. But most pertinent to the purpose in hand is that their plotting and compassing how to set the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20199:12"/>
Diademe of this Realme vpon the head of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Isabella</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spayne.</hi> To this purpose they haue written a booke, and set out her title (when none of the rest will serue their turnes) wherein they giue her such an interest, as they make the Kings of this land for many yeares to haue bin vsurpers. I omit the paynes they haue further taken to procure men by indirect meanes to subscribe to this Ladies Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty ouer vs, and how one Maister <hi>Midleton</hi> was driuen for feare to flye out of <hi>Spayne,</hi> because he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so to do. If we the auncienter sort of secular Priests in <hi>England</hi> could haue bin drawne to haue runne this course, whereat the new gouerment (now obtruded vpon vs) aymeth altogether: we had not bin so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and oppressed with false calumniations, as we are by them at this present. We can say for one of vs, that offers haue bin made vnto him, that if he could haue eaten gold and would but haue giuen his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and assistance that way, he should haue had it.</p>
            <p>The particulars last mentioned, a man would thinke were very vnmeete for Priests to deale in: but what if these Fathers countenanced with so great a name haue proceeded further? We are in an horror to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, and would hardly haue bin drawne thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, were it not that the things themselues are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest. What (we say) if some of them haue conspired among themselues, and with sundry other most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked persons at diuers times, to haue layde violent hands vpon the Queene, and bereaued her thereby of her life? It cannot be denyed, but that they haue done so: the circumstances haue shewed it, the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with whom they practised haue confessed it, and sundry Catholicks beyond the Seas doe very well know it, and haue charged in their writings fome of them with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:20199:13"/>We know the Iesuits many of them haue a course that there is nothing so manifest which they will not deny, when things fall not out according to their plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: whereas otherwise if they sorted to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, they would glory in them. And amongst many things that giue her Maiestie and the State very iust cause to thinke the more hardly of vs (especially that be secular Priests) this is one not of the least: in that these our pretended brethren of that society, and such as follow their steps, do in their writings so calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate, or deny, or falsifie all the actions and doings of the State, be they neuer so iudicially and publickly proceeded in, neuer so apparantly proued true, and knowne of many to be most certayne. For either they do pretend that the parties that confesse such things were vrged thereunto with tortures, or that it was a plot of the State to make all Catholicks odious, or that there was no such matter, or we wot not what, but they haue alwayes some shift or other to bleare mens eyes with, to the discredite of all the proceedings in such cases within the Realme. If any of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren dye in prison, it is sayd, they were poysoned or famished: if any kill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, it is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out they were murthered. Which we write not (God is our iudge) in any othersense, but to shew vnto you how much we think all good Catholicks ought to detest these kinds of dealings. We haue sufficient matter to charge our aduersaries truly with concerning their hard dealing with vs, though we take not this course, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose, but make vs very odious, and doth much impaire our credits in those things which we report truly ofthem. Let these men brag as much as they list of their pollicies, their foresights, and their pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall wisedome, they shall neuer whilest we liue, haue in these courses our approbation.</p>
            <p>An other thing also is generally misliked in these
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20199:13"/>
our Fathers, and breedeth vs indeede very great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, besides the danger; and it is their equiuocating, which you may tearme in plaine english, lying and cogging. For this amongst others is one of their rules: that a man framing to himselfe a true proposition, when he is asked a question, he may conceale thereof as much as he thinketh good. For example: One de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of you whether if the Pope should come in warlike manner to inuade this land by force of Armes, you would take his part, or the Queenes: you fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this answere in your minde: we will take the Queenes part, if the Pope will commaund vs so to do: may by their doctrine giue this answere lawfully: <hi>viz.</hi> we will take the Queenes part, and conceale the rest: whereby he that asked the question is playnely delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Much after this sort one <hi>Standish</hi> a Priest, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Iesuited, abused the Popes Holynes not long since: who asking him whether the matter which he propounded vnto him, touching the setting vp of our now Hierarchie, was done by the consent of the rest of the Priests in <hi>England,</hi> sayd (but most falsely) that it was: reseruing (as since he hath confessed) this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as I presuppose or presume. Which lying sleights being knowne by our aduersaries, do worke vs much woe and discredit already, and we feare, will be more and more preiudiciall vnto vs. For by this meanes, they begin to giue it forth, that the Catholicks are not to be trusted in any thing they say. And besides, they may charge vs by this ground with any treason what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, and we haue no way left vnto vs to acquit our selues from it. For be our answeres neuerso direct and true (as honest men ought to answere their christian brethren, if they will at all giue them any answere, and so much more the Ciuill Magistrate) our aduersaries may say vnto vs, that we keepe this or that to our selues, which (as they can frame it) is sufficient to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20199:14"/>
hang vs. For example: they may aske vs whether we haue taught or affirmed, that her Maiestie hath no interest to the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> and we answere: that we neuer haue either so taught or affirmed. Tush (say they) you equiuocate with vs: you keepe this in your mindes, <hi>viz.</hi> as long as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> will suffer her, or some such like point. We answere, that we do keepe no such thing in our mindes. Oh (say they) you keepe no such thing in your mindes to tell vs: we know your shifts. And thus indeede the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites doctrine giue them iust occasion (not knowing our innocency) to deale with vs, and euer <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> suspect the worst of vs. Whereby you see into what a gulph of danger and discredit this double dealing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with their heathenish position hath brought vs poore secular Priests, and other more honest and single harted Catholicks: such as cannot stoupe to their false lure.</p>
            <p>Againe, were it that these our Fathers bent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues only against Hereticks, and to défend the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, many of their imperfections might the better be borne with: but such is the intolerable pride and hypocrisie of many of them, as nothing is well done except they like it or do it themselues. No go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is well managed but by their direction: wheresoeuer they come they thrust them selues into our haruest: they euer will finde something amisse: either we haue wanted discretion, or zeale, or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or somewhat that they forsooth are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, as being of an other more excellent mould. By which their arrogant proceedings it is well knowne, that the rest of the Clergie for the most part both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and religious in <hi>Spayne, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> doe greatly dislike them, finding no meanes how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them. For such and so ample are their priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as go whether they list, neither Chauncellor, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20199:14"/>
nor Archbishop may intermeddle with them when they do amisse: their owne pleasures are their guides. If they do but pretend whatsoeuer they take in hand that it is done <hi>ordine ad deum,</hi> they may not be reprooued nor called into question for it.</p>
            <p>This immunity of the Iesuites last mentioned, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer for a time his Holynes doth tolerate it: yet as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly as it is now vsed by many, it cannot last long: except it shall be thought meete that the rest of the Clergie shall be subiect to them. Which if euer it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (as it is in good forwardnes at this day in <hi>England</hi> amongst vs that be Catholicks) you shall peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture liue to heare newes. We will omit all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes that may grow by the pursuing of those points which before we haue touched, and offer to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration but their boldnes in maynteyning any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that they themselues like of. These erroneous, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious, and hereticall assertions contrary to the Catholick faith, haue bin defended with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vehemencie amongst our Iesuited brethren in <hi>Wisbich.</hi> The Stewes are in <hi>Rome cum approbatione.</hi> The Stewes are in <hi>Rome</hi> as lawfull as any Citizen: as lawfull as any Magistrate: as lawfull as any order of religion. The Stewes are at <hi>Rome cum approbatione,</hi> as lawfull as the Pope is himselfe. The Stewes are very good and very necessary. In that a Priest is made by tradition of the Chalice, Patten, and Host into his hands, they say it is but a toy. They hold that the auncient Fathers <hi>rem transubstantiationis ne attigerunt.</hi> Some other of their positions we haue touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but we pray you, how may we thinke of these? If the Iesuites in other Countries do grow to such gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, what will Religion come to in short time, they ruling the roast? They say, that we the secular Priests are more subiect to error then the Iesuites; but (we thanke God) they are not able to charge vs with any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20199:15"/>
particulars, as we are able to charge them. In this last section, hauing acquainted you with some of their positions, there commeth an other to our mindes, which we accompt to be very odious and seditious: and it is; that the people may depose their Princes, and choose others at their pleasures: haue they any or no right to the Crowne, that it is not materiall, so it be done <hi>ordine ad deum,</hi> that is (by our interpretation) as the Fathers shall appoint it. It had bin well if they had left this point to some of our enemyes to haue branded them with, for rebellious subiects when they cannot hauetheir wils? but it hath pleased the Fathers to stayne both themselues and the Catholick cause with it. The issue whereof, if Kings will take the paines to vnderstand it, must needs be exceeding pernitious to the Catholick Church. For what Prince will indure such persons in his Kingdome, as vnder pretence of Religion, shall infect his subiects with such hatefull conceits, so dangerous to his estate? We that haue long borne the brunt in this Realme for the Catholick cause, haue found some wofull experience of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable exempting of subiects from their due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though it proceeded from his Holynes: and what then shall we expect, if we leaue the Diademe to the disposition of the multitude, and inuest them to a right for their proceeding in that so wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable a course? We are perswaded that no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King liuing or dead, either did at any time, or will euer hereafter giue the authors of this doctrine any thanks for their paynes.</p>
            <p>Here we would haue you to note an other rule of our English Iesuites, which must concurre with that of <hi>ordine ad deum:</hi> and it is this: that all things must be wrought and framed as the times and occasions require. For example: if the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> or the <hi>Infanta,</hi> can by no other practise obteyne the Crowne
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20199:15"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> then in that case the people are to haue a right to do what they list, so they will choose one of them for their soueraigne. But that done, a new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine quite contrary must be deliuered abroade, that there was a happy mistaking, which aduanced him or her into this throane: but hereafter the people must take heede of attempting the like: some check must be giuen to the publishers of such documents: a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation must be procured, and all shall be well here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Of this course or rule Maister <hi>Charles Paget</hi> (as it is thought) discoursing at large, sayth, that the old prouerbe may be well applyed to it, <hi>omnia pro tempore, nihil pro veritate:</hi> they measure all according to the time, and nothing to the truth. We will not dispute against this rule, but referre you to his treatise printed and published against Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> as it is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. This only we will say, that our pretended Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers build Castles in the ayre, and feede themselues with their owne follyes: as though where the people do once get a head, it be not as hard a matter to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse them, as to stop the breach of the sea, when in fury it hath once mastered the banks. The experience hereof is more then manifest.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we pray you obserue an other prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and course of our Iesuites here at home amongst vs, and tell vs what you thinke of it. Marke their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour well in such Gentlemens houses as they reside in, and you shall finde them that they will commaund and ouer-rule all, as knowing best how euery thing must be done (forsooth) <hi>ordine ad deum.</hi> No lease must be let, but by their aduise: the Tenants must please them or repent at leasure: such fines are to be taken as they thinke conuenient, and some part of them must be imployed as they shall prescribe <hi>ordine ad deum.</hi> In effect they do so rule and ouer-rule, as scarsly can the Maister or Mistres of the house giue a piece of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20199:16"/>
bread at their doores, but it must be done with their approbation. And for the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, they are much more at their commaundement, then at theirs whom they serue: we would be loth to tell you how all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe. Only this vnderstand, that our Iesuites are most rigorous in their taking of mens confessions, whereby they know as well by the seruants as by their Maisters and Mistresses their seuerall confessions, all the secrets in those families: the wifes against her husband: the husbands against his wife, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of them both: which if they abuse to tyranize ouer them, and to dispose of their ciuill affayres vnder a pretence of their <hi>ordo ad deum;</hi> they deale not like true Catholicke Priests, but will in the end be found what they are. Is this their most speciall endowment with the spirit ofguiding of soules, that they brag of so much?</p>
            <p>It is most manifest, to as many as know the course of many Iesuites, that although they pretend all their designements to be directed to the common good of the Church: yet their chiefest care is how to aduaunce and increase their owne society, hoping of likelihood by their number to bring one day some great matter to passe. For where they make such faire shewes and offers; when they come into some Country to teach the youth: their principall drift therein is to finde out the aptest wits for their purposes, with whome they take extraordinary paynes, and so worke them by kindnes and cunning allurements (especially if they be of good parentage, which is a chiefe point with them) till they get them to promise, that they will be of their society, or somewhat to that purpose: which is sufficient to seaze vpon them, do their parents and friends what they can, except they will hazard an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to be inclined to heresie, or to some mischief, or to we wot not what: for so they vse to calumniate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20199:16"/>
any that do crosse their proceedings. This course of alluring the fittest wits and ofthe best towardnes to their societie, they held in diuers Seminaries within the Duchie of <hi>Millan:</hi> which the good Cardinall <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeo</hi> well obseruing, thought them no meete men to remayne there, and so banished them out of all those places: esteeming it farre more necessary to haue such apt men to become secular Priests, and to take vpon them the cure of soules, then to haue them intruded into any order of religion, which intermedleth not with any such charge, but liue after their owne fashion priuately to themselues, as religious men ought to do.</p>
            <p>It were to be wished, that other States would follow this Cardinals example, at the least vntill these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were brought to some better moderation and knowledge of them selues. For our owne parts, it shall be our continuall prayer, that howsoeuer other States do, it may please God to moue the heart of his holynes to remoue all Iesuites out of the English Colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> where there are other manner of practises, then were euer attempted by any Iesuites in the territories of <hi>Millan.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> talketh (we suppose) of the iarres in that Colledge: many secular Priests being honest men, haue bin sent home vnto vs, loaden till their backs cracked with the Iesuites calumniations: and none but such as will be Iesuited altogether may finde any fauour there. Well, of this matter you may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture heare and see more hereafter. In the meane time it may be sufficient for you to know that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauell</hi> the Atheists rule <hi>diuide &amp; impera,</hi> is as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly in practise by the Rector there, as in any place we thinke in Christendome, we had almost sayd in Turky.</p>
            <p>If the Iesuites when they came first hither, could haue bin content to haue ioyned with vs that were Priests, and to haue intermedled no further then with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20199:17"/>
their Priestly functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we should haue greatly honored the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> still. But as now we perceiue, they were no sooner entertayned amongst vs, but they put in practise their <hi>diuide &amp; impera.</hi> It seemed strange to some of vs how at their first entrance into our labours, they exalted themselues aboue vs. Father <hi>Parsons</hi> comming hither with Maister <hi>Campion,</hi> and another as their Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, they presently reekoned of vs but as their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, in helping them to administer the Sacraments: as though we could neither haue preached, nor done any thing else: and that they our great Maisters were to be further imployed in other matters of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance then we simple men were any way fit for: hereof you may reade in Fa. <hi>Campions</hi> letter out of <hi>England</hi> to their Generall at <hi>Rome.</hi> But this was then the imagination of a few: their drifts were deeper, then we euer dreamed of: for misteries are hardly knowne, vntill they fall out into practise. It is true, that when they came ouer with such ample faculties, larger then they had bin graunted before to any of vs, wee might haue foreseene the inconuenience of it: knowing how apt we are in <hi>England</hi> to admit of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties: and likewise what before we had heard of some Iesuites abroade. Nay to the aggrauating of our great ouersight, in that we did not at the first oppose our selues against them, or at the least seeke to haue them recalled from vs: we may not deny it but that it was foretold vs by that excellent Cardinall then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that the Iesuites would proue but thornes in our sides, and be the cause of great troubles amongst vs. But for our sinnes, they and such of that order as came after them, did by their faire gloses, and pretence of zeale, so blinde and bewitch vs, as we gaue way vnto them: whereby and through their cunning cariage with the people, they haue by little and little caried all before them. No almes was thought sufficiently
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20199:17"/>
meritorious, except they were sanctified by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites distribution: so as in short time, the greatest part of our allowances that were in prison, came vnto vs through the Iesuites hands, pretending (forsooth) that they were but religious Collectors for vs and some others distressed Catholicks. But how faithfully they haue dealt with vs herein, when you shall happen to see the sayd Memoriall, it will appeare vnto you. Some one of them spendeth more yeerely vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then would maynteyne tenne of the best of vs: if we sayd twenty, we thinke there would be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception taken vnto it. And to conclude, they haue so dealt with vs, as where before, we were honored for our works sake, and had many ghostly children that did depend vpon vs, as vpon their spirituall fathers and shepeards of their soules, we are now through their falshood, their calumniations and vntrue sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions to our superiors brought into contempt: our sayd children (as if we had bin but their stepfathers) haue forsaken vs: their charitie towards vs is so cold, as we are very hardly able to liue, and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hereof, God himself knoweth, and we do greatly feare it. If they had bin hired by our common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to haue wrought vs mischiefe, and the cause we haue defended, they could hardly haue done it more artificially or effectually. And yet men will not see it: they will not vnderstand it.</p>
            <p>You haue heard how the Iesuites became our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, or rather not ours, but their owne: to whome for their accompts the false Steward in the Gospell we suppose may giue place. One Iesuite (as we can proue it) hath taken at times aboue 500. pound that was giuen to the imprisoned Priests then at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and imployed the same at his owne pleasure. <hi>Percye</hi> the Iesuite escaping from <hi>Wisbich,</hi> tooke fraudulently fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> benefactors abroad 57. pound 17. shillings, and the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20199:18"/>
yeere after stole 27. pound of the common money by the consent of the other his fellow Iesuites. They haue so fleeced their fauorers, as ouer and aboue their owne expences (which are exceeding great) they haue bin able to send not long since 2200. pound towards the Low countries: the prisoners then at <hi>Wisbich</hi> being in great want. Now if you will know how they scrape together so much money, you must vnderstand that they haue many sleights to that end, besides their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant cousenages, fraudes, and thefts before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. You are not ignorant of the meanes that <hi>Verres</hi> the Proconsull vsed in pilling and spoyling <hi>Sicilia,</hi> nor how odious it was amongst the <hi>Romanes:</hi> But the course that our Iesuites do take heere for their pillage both in <hi>England &amp; Scotland,</hi> are so much more shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as spirituall robberies passe all temporall pilfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, we will set downe vnto you three or foure of their tricks. They haue gotten (as they say) certayne faculties from the Pope to abstract from what Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages and Vicarages they list all spiritualtie (for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of simony) thereby to make them meerely temporall and saleable, which done, they are to be sold at the highest rates vpon pretence that the money must be diuided betwixt Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and poore priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. What Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gets amongst them we know not, and we thinke but little: sure we are the poore prisoners haue not much: one good Father or other sayth, <hi>Dominus opus habet,</hi> and make alwayes the best part of it their owne cleere gaynes. Agayne, those that come to great wealth either by Vsury, or by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or selling, and making gayne by anticipation or dilation of payment, or by iniustice, or by taking more of clyents that are suitors at the law then their ordinary and moderate fees, or by patronizing any euill cause, Landlords, Sheriffs officers, whosoeuer high or low that get any thing falsely or indirectly, all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20199:18"/>
must make restitution. But forasmuch as oftentimes it falleth out, that the parties neither know how much nor to whom such restitution is to be made: therefore they must in those cases compound with the Fathers, giuing <hi>certa pro incertis,</hi> to the vse (forsooth) before expressed: sometimes one man hath giuen 500. pound to that end: but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the poore do still come short of their share: the Fathers themselues do swallow it vp, amounting yeerely to a mighty summe of money.</p>
            <p>Moreouer to the effect last mentioned, we haue a notable history to tell you. Amongst many deuises which the Iesuits haue inuented to enrich and increase their order, they haue one, whereof it is fit that the world should take notice. It is tearmed by them an holy exercise, and is put in practise when they finde any, that are meet to serue their turnes, either for their extraordinary pregnancy of wit and learning, or for their parentage and friends, or for their wealth and possessions, and cannot otherwise allure them to their society. The course which they hold in the sayd exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is after this sort. When they finde one, whome they thinke fit for their turne; they insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into him, keepe him company, vse him with all kinde of sweete behauior and curtesy: and pretend to haue an especiall care of his well doing, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally how he may attayne to be in high fauour with God. To which purpose they enter by degrees into certaine discourses of hell: wherein they omit none of their skill by authorities, fables, and large amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to make the same as terrible as possibly they can. By which course they cast the party in time into great feare and pensiuenes; which were well done, if it were to a good end.</p>
            <p>When they haue held on after this sort so long as they thinke conuenient, intermingling now and then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20199:19"/>
some comforts, least otherwise the parties vnder their fingers should grow very weary of them, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be more plentifull in the setting forth of such comfortable promises as are made in the scriptures to the children and saincts of God. Heere they omit no part of their skill to describe the Heauens, the Maiestie and glory of God, the happy estate and ioyes of the Saincts in that euerlasting kingdome, which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for those who in this life shall embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, and become obedient children in their true calling vnto their holy Mother the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereunto they adde a discourse concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of such callings as God hath ordeyned for his seruants and children to walke in: shewing how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is for euery man to vnderstand and know what calling that is, which particularly belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe, and what danger ensueth, when men do rashly vndertake any occasion, either for profit or pleasure, to follow this or that course of life: as when great men, being borne to great possessions, do thinke it sufficient for them to follow the steps of their Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors: esteeming that to be the calling which God hath prepared for them: whereof it commeth to passe diuers times, that they make a shipwrack of all their estates, and fall into many calamities, God approuing of and sanctifying no calling, which is not entred into by the direction of his holy spirit. Many (say they) through their owne rashnes are spirituall persons, who ought by Gods ordinance to haue bin of the Layty: and many on the other side are (as we tearme them) Lay men, which ought to be Ecclesiasticall: both of them perishing in their owne courses through their owne faults, in that they had no care to learne and know their owne proper callings ordeyned for them, which God would haue sanctified, to their eternall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20199:19"/>
comforts, if they would haue vsed the meanes to haue vnderstood and imbraced them. In the description of which meanes, the height, the depth, and the breadth of all their cousenage doth consist, being the exercise it selfe before mentioned. Of these meanes they do at the first speake only in generality, entring into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the louing kindnes of God, in that he hath prepared a way, whereby euery man that list, may know how to serue him: whereinto as many as will enter, may haue assurance in themselues by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the holy Ghost, what their seuerall vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, whereunto God hath called them: and which they must vndertake, if euer they meane to come into the ioyes and consolations of the Paradice of God.</p>
            <p>Thus after they haue layd these ginnes, no meruaile if the parties so kindly and cunningly caried on, do fall into their traps. Howbeit you must obserue that in all these discourses made to such parties, they carry themselues so aloofe, as that there may be no suspition of their intents to draw them by such their practises to be of their sócietie. So as when the poore soules (as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished with a desire to attayne vnto the sayd meanes or exercise so highlie commended, and so necessary as they suppose, for all that truly thirst after the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and ioyes of Heauen) do intreate the holy Fathers, that they may be receiued into that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and blessed exercise; their motion in that behalfe the good Fathers at the first seeme little to regard: saying, that peraduenture this their desire proceedeth of passion: and therefore their manner is to leaue them in this sort for the first time: adding, with what deliberation and iudgement that sacred exercise is to be vndertaken, as being the ladder of <hi>Iacob,</hi> whereby they may ascend into the third Heauen, and there see and behold the admirable mysteries of God.</p>
            <p>If the partie thus caught be of great possessions,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20199:20"/>
wealth, or parentage, they are much the sooner intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to admit him to this exercise: the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is as followeth. The partie at the time appointed, comming to the holy Father who must deale with him, is recluded from the speech of any body but the sayd Father for a certaine time. Vpon his first reclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the Father commeth vnto him, and giueth him a meditation to study vpon for some foure or fiue houres: willing him in the meane while carefullie to remember all the cogitations that do come into his minde. The sayd foure or fiue houres expired, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this good Father: and then the partie must be confessed, and is to reueale all his particular thoughts of what matter soeuer good or bad that came into his head, all the time of his aforesayd meditation. Which done, the Father giueth the partie an other medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the like instructions to the former: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the like distance of time returning, heareth his confession. And thus the partie is exercised diuers times, euery day the space of nine dayes or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. In which time the holy Father hauing framed the sayd meditations according to his owne drift: for example: if the partie be rich, then of the contempt of the world, and the vanitie of worldly riches: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceiuing by his confessions, his disposition, and what effect the sayd meditations haue wrought, and are likely in the end to worke in him, which alwayes must be the forsaking of the world, as they tearme it; and for the most part, if they finde him by this triall, a fit man for the entrance into some profession of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: then he telleth him a long tale of the fruit of his sayd exercise, as that he well perceiueth by his sundry confessions, how the spirit of God hath wrought in him by the meanes of his sayd meditations, and that he now supposeth him to be fit to enter into the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and choice of that calling, whereunto God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20199:20"/>
himselfe hath ordeined him, to leade his life and walke in towards the attaynement of euerlasting happines. Whereupon the partie hath time to consider with himselfe, whether he will be a <hi>Dominican,</hi> a <hi>Benedict,</hi> a Iesuite, a Frier, or what he list. Which time expired, the holy Father entreth into a new stratageme.</p>
            <p>The sayd partie so exercised (as is before expressed) comming thus vnto his election, hath peraduenture determined to be a <hi>Dominican,</hi> or to take some such other course as he himselfe hath thought of. So as when the sayd holy Father commeth vnto him, if he finde him bent to any other profession, then to be a Iesuite, he beginneth to cast many doubts, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth at his pleasure by something that he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed vnto him, that his sayd choice is not agreeable to such godly motions, as the spirit of God wrought in him in the time of his exercise, and therefore aduiseth him to consider with himselfe better of his choice, that the same may be sutable to the sayd motions of the holy Ghost. The conclusion is, that the holy Fathers by this meanes, hauing sundry poore soules in their hands to worke them by terrors, deuises, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (as they list) neuer leaue them, or suffer them to be quiet, vntill (if it be possible) they make choice to be of the societie of Iesus: if in all these practises with them, they finde them fit men for their turne. Howbeit sometimes it commeth to passe that the sayd deuout Fathers do meete with such persons, as will rather choose to be of some other order, do what they can, then to be Iesuites. In which cases, when their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to winne the parties for their learning, strength of wit, parentage, and other good parts more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary do fayle, they desist from dealing with them by little and little, and so in the end giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quite ouer, meaning nothing lesse, then by such their paines to increase the number of any other order of religious
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20199:21"/>
persons, and so leaue them to take what course they list: but with this fruit of their exercises, that they will neuer loue or induce them afterwards, but rayle on them, and plague them as much as possiblie they can.</p>
            <p>If the parties were vndertaken by them for their wealth and large possessions, when they come to their election, commonly their riches, and their sayd posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are a hinderance vnto them from entring into any religious profession. For the remouing of which obstacle, the holy Fathers are furnished with many texts of scripture: as of giuing all and following Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus &amp;c. and do for the most part so farrepreuaile, as either they allure them to be ecclesiasticall Iesuites, if they haue any tolerable gifts besides their riches: and then all that they haue must be sold, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney committed to the Fathers discretions, or at the least they draw them to be lay brethren, finding no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good stuffe in them. In which case they get from them either all, or the most part of their riches, and turne them either to be some of their officers, or leaue them at large to be practisers for them in such matters as they thinke fit to imploy them in abroad: as to be solicitors for them, and to stirre vp the charitie of the people towards that societie, not ceasing to perswade as many as they can to follow their examples. And this was the effect of one M. <hi>Gilberts,</hi> and one Maister <hi>Druries</hi> exercises and some others: <hi>viz.</hi> they got from them all they had, and then imploying them as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed, procured the Popes blessing for them, for the better approuing vnto them of that their new calling: as appeareth in the faculties graunted to <hi>Parsons, Campion, Heywood,</hi> and the rest about twenty yeeres since. The euidence of which proceedings with the sayd Gentlemen, was so apparant and manifest vnto many, that disliked greatly of such kinde of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, as that some in iest would say: such a one is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20199:21"/>
Gilberted, and such a one is Druryed: and others to the like effect: they shall neuer Gilbert me, nor Drury me, nor cousen me with such their holy sleights.</p>
            <p>An other yong Gentleman not long since, entring into this exercise vnder a yong Iesuite here in <hi>England,</hi> was found by his meditations to haue lands yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold, worth a hundreth marks a yeare, which hindred his iourney to heauen. Whereupon he offering the same to the sayd yong Iesuite, the good Father allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offer, sayd, that if he should receiue the land, her Maiestie would take it from him: but (quoth he) sell it, and then I am capable of the money. By which ghostly counsaile the Gentleman set his land to sale, and was offred 900. pound for it: but the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insisting vpon a 1000. pound, the Gentleman dyed before a chapman could be gotten, and so the good Father lost all. I omit how many poore yong men, falling into these good Fathers hands to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, haue fallen into sundry inconueniences, and growne to be broken-brayned euer after. The truth is, that amongst many deurses which they haue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselues, this is not one of the least, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now knowne, may peraduenture be a hinderance vnto them hereafter, and driue both Father <hi>Garnet</hi> and his yonkers to leaue their coaches and stables of horses, and to be glad to walke on foote as their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do.</p>
            <p>We haue troubled you long in this matter of Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall gayning: and yet if you will beare with vs a little longer, we will informe you of an other deuise, not <hi>in esse,</hi> but <hi>in spe:</hi> marry it is very royall, and may be tearmed an Imperiall hunting, such a one as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene on earth before, pursued by any religious person whosoeuer, since <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Gyant hunted; <hi>qui erat robustus venator coram Domino,</hi> who was a very rough huntlman. Of this kinde of hunting, there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20199:22"/>
is a iust Volume set forth by Father <hi>Parsons</hi> and his Generall, called the high Counsell of reformation for <hi>England</hi> to take place and be in force, when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik conquerer shal be established in great <hi>Britaine.</hi> First, no religious order will that famous Volume permit in great <hi>Britaine,</hi> but <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and <hi>Capuchines: Benedictines, Carthusians,</hi> nor <hi>Dominicans</hi> must enter here, <hi>sicut placuit Iesuitis:</hi> for the holy Ghost hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken all religious orders, and is only in the <hi>Capuchines</hi> and Iesuites. If you aske vs why they make choice of the <hi>Capuchines</hi> only? We answere you, as a good <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchine</hi> did to the like question. We sute best (quoth he) with the humor of the Iesuites: for their drift is to haue and rule all; and on the contrary, our orders are such, as we must neither rule at all, nor haue any thing. These Iesuites (<hi>homines secundum cor meum,</hi> as God sayd of <hi>Dauid</hi>) do professe voluntarie pouertie, and to renounce the world, with all that belongeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But yet so mortified they are, that with the worlds weapons they will conquer the world. In these three Kingdomes <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> there are 100. Bishopricks great and small: how many Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages and Vicarages, and how many religious Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, it is hard to tell. All which must be no more in the hands of Bishops, Abbots, Parsons, and the rest, as heretofore it was accustomed. But all the holy societie of Iesus, their father Prouinciall must cull out foure Iesuites, and two secular Priests, which must be demy Iesuites. These sixe Vicars, these mightie great Lords, shall haue the Lands, Mannors, Lordships, Parsona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Monasteries, and whatsoeuer, into their owne hands; allowing the Bishops, Parsons and Vicars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent stipends or pensions, <hi>sicut plasuit Iesuitis,</hi> as the <hi>Romanes</hi> in their leagues were wont to write. All the rest must be imployed <hi>in pios vsus,</hi> as father Generall of <hi>Rome</hi> shall thinke good. The Colleges in both Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20199:22"/>
must be so likewise in the power of these mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified creatures: no Bishop, no Parson, or Vicar, no fellow of any Colledge must be so hardy as once to demaund an accompt what is become of their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, Lands, and Lordships. If they do, this shall be the answere, <hi>mirantur superiores &amp;c.</hi> The Nobilitie must be limited also what retinue they shall keepe: what they shall haue to spend yeerely, and what diet they shall keepe at their Tables. Lastly, the common lawes of our countrie must be abolished, and the ciuill beare the sway another while: those are barbarous: these are learned, and of more excellencie; happie is he that can see this booke, called the Counsell of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: where hee may reade these wonderfull platformes of Iesuiticall gouernment, deuised by the second <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the Smiths sonne of <hi>Stockgersee,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Parsons sonne of that parish, expelled from <hi>Balioll</hi> Colledge for his illegitimation, of whom, anon.</p>
            <p>In the writing of this discourse, we were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant into what a sea of Iesuiticall calumniations we haue launched. For they haue an other position not yet mentioned: and it is: That detraction in generall is lawfull: as if a Iesuite should say, that amongst the prisoners at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> there were many and so grieuous enormities, as that Father <hi>Weston</hi> and his adherents were constrayned to separate themselues from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priests: and being charged to name some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, or else if he could not, he was to be reckoned for a detractor, and therein to haue offended greatly in slaundering the whole house, he should answere: Nay my words were generall, and therefore I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not. But what talke we of their generall calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations: wee shall be sure to haue their particular commendations cast abroade against vs with heue and ho in a mischiefe, as we haue indured many of their thunderbolts alreadie. Howbeit, as we regard it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20199:23"/>
not, so do we not wonder at it, considering their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with all men that offend them, be he whom he shall, Bishop, or Cardinall: yea or the Pope himselfe, they care not.</p>
            <p>Maister Doctor <hi>Gifford,</hi> a man of very good desert, did but a little offend them, in not admiring of them and their designements, and shortly after they deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sundry most vile and vniust accusations against him: they defamed him in <hi>England</hi> for a sower of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, charging him further, to be an informer against the Iesuites, and the exhibiter of the memoriall to the Pope. They procured him to be examined before the <hi>Nuncio</hi> in the Low countries, who after long delayes, affirmed in plaine tearmes that the Doctor had wrog. Fayling of their purpose against him this way, Father <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> a man of the right stampe, dealt with the <hi>Nuncio</hi> for a generall pacification and remission on all sides: whereunto the Doctor at the <hi>Nuncio</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie yeelded. And first by order taken in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, the sayd <hi>Baldwyn</hi> in the name of Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> and all that societie, asked him forgiuenes: and the Doctor for his part in ciuilitie performed as much: with this addition, if he had offended any of them. Which being done, the <hi>Nuncio</hi> commaunded them both to be secret of what had passed in fauour indeed of the Iesuites. Which commaundement the Doctor obeyed: but Father <hi>Baldwyn</hi> omitting what he had done in the name of the rest, instantly gaue it forth after a glorious sort, that the Doctor had asked father <hi>Parsons</hi> and the Iesuites forgiuenes: and thereby to disgrace him a new, and to make their former iniuries done vnto him more probable, they caused the same to be openly promulgated out of the Pulpit in the Colledge at <hi>Rhemes.</hi> So shamelesse (you see) they are, as the very Pulpits are prophaned by them, when it standeth them in hand to mayntayne their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20199:23"/>
               <hi>per fas aut nefas</hi> they care not how.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Fisher</hi> a yong man going to <hi>Rome</hi> with some such messages from certayne of our brethren, as were not acceptable to these good Fathers, after they had very cunningly vsed him, to wring from him what they were able that might serue their turnes, they sent him to the Gallyes at <hi>Naples,</hi> where he remayneth a gally-slaue (as we are informed) if he be yet aliue. An other of our brethren a Priest, in that he opposed himselfe in some things to certayne of that order, they haue persecuted him euer since with such mallce, as he could remayne in no place in <hi>England</hi> with any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, but they hunted him thence with one lye or other, giuing it out, when nothing else would serue, that he was a spy for the State, to bring them to their vtter ruyne. In so much as not daring to go beyond the seas, knowing (as after he hath professed) that there they had layd their snares, either for his imprisonment or murthering, he was driuen to go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to hide his head there. Hereunto we might adde a long catalogue of aboue a hundreth persons by name of this Iland, whom these extraordinarilie illuminated Fathers haue most lewdlie and falsely slaundered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they disliked of sundry their <hi>Machiauilian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. But here we omit them, referring the further discourse here of to him, who hath already made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Register of them.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Cassane</hi> Doctor <hi>Lewes,</hi> was a man by whom the Iesuites had receiued very extraordinary benefit. By his procurement they got the Rectorship of our English Seminarie in <hi>Rome,</hi> God forgiue his soule for it, as we trust he hath. He was a man so fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by diuers Popes, as first he was made Monseignior, then Bishop of <hi>Cassane,</hi> afterwards <hi>Nuncio</hi> for <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> 14. to <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and then Visitor generall of <hi>Rome</hi> and all the Popes dominions. When two and twenty
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20199:24"/>
Iesuites should all of them bin banished out of the Citie of <hi>Perugio</hi> for their cunning fishing to enrich themselues, one of them being notoriously detected for alluring a Gentlewoman to giue them a very rich chayne of pearle without her husbands priuitie: this prouident good Bishop being their generall Visitor, vsed such meanes, as all that matter was husht, and they continued there still. We should be too long if we should remember vnto you all the benefits which the Iesuites in <hi>Rome</hi> and else-where from time to time receiued at his hands: all the which notwithstanding, yea though they had bin a thousand more, the kinde Fathers could not indure him, because in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyles at <hi>Rome</hi> about the Students in the English Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary, he disliked their courses and practises with them. Hence it proceeded, that whilest he was aliue they caused their disciples to rayle vpon him most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully: tearming him a factious, an ambitious, and a partiall man. And a little before his death they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them cast out a Libell against him, which was brought vnto him, wherein they layd many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crymes to his charge, and in the course of their hote charitie, made this deuoute prayer full like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>vel Turca vel mors vel Damon eum eripiat àno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis:</hi> and indeede not long after he dyed: we leaue it to Gods iudgement, whether they were the causers of it, or not. But being dead, when in all humanitie their malice should haue bin buryed with him, they ceased not, notwithstanding to follow his happie memorie with their Iesuiticall calumniations, and that most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiously. For whereas the good Bishop not foure houres before his death, vpon occasion protested that he had bin most falsely charged with vpholding, and mayntayning the Students in the English Seminary against the Iesuites: yet that impious caytife Father <hi>Parsons</hi> in a letter dated the 13-of July 1598. and sent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20199:24"/>
hither into <hi>England</hi> not to be kept secret, writeth of him after his slye fashion in this sort. A third cause (sayth he) there was, meaning of the Students oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues against the Iesuites, no lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant perhaps then any of the rest, or more then both together: which was a certaine disgust giuen at the very foundation of the Colledge, vnto a certayne principall man of our Nation, and his friends then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in <hi>Rome,</hi> who afterward not affecting greatly the gouernment or gouernors of the sayd Colledge, was euer <hi>in re,</hi> or in opinion, a back vnto them that would be discontented. Thus farre this charitable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against this blessed Bishop now in Heauen, and contrary to his profession vpon his death-bed: who when he was aliue, might if he had bin disposed, haue curbed many of that crew, being their Visitor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and peraduenture curried a little before-time this good Father for many insolencies: but a milder man liued not, or one more apt to put vp and forgiue all iniuries: and of purpose he refrayned for visiting of that crew, because he knowing their hard conceits of him, would not giue them any occasion to say, he was partiall, if he should haue dealt more roundly with them. But by the way you may obserue out of <hi>Parsons</hi> words, that this good Bishop had a dislike of the Iesuiticall gouernment and gouernors of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Colledge in <hi>Rome:</hi> so as we are not the men alone that haue thought amisse of both. Peraduenture you may see hereafter the very exhibits themselues, which the Iesuites presented vnto him, as their Visitor, one against another, and then it will appeare vnto you what little cause he found to magnifie either their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or their gouernment.</p>
            <p>The most blessed Cardinall Doctor <hi>Allane,</hi> a man most reuerenced of our Nation (and very worthilie, one or two actions excepted, whereunto hee was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20199:25"/>
drawne by Father <hi>Parsons</hi>) in the end passed not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by the Iesuites: because in very deede he dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saw further into them, then he had done: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only disliked, but disfauored diuers their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, especially towards his latter end. In which respect, that they might be euen with him in some sort, they gaue out sundry disgracefull words against him, as that he was a good simple man, but not of any esteeme or reckoning in matters or affayres handled in the Popes Consistory, a man of weake aduice, and neuer vsed but a little for some matters of learning. And such was their hatred towards him, as it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought by many in <hi>Rome</hi> that he was poysoned: which conceit the Rector then <hi>Hieronimo Florauantio</hi> a Iesuite, would gladly haue turned from his societie vpon the good Bishop of <hi>Cassane,</hi> but ridiculously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, though malitiously inough. When this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Cardinall lay vpon his death-bed, he would gladly haue had al the English Students to haue come vnto him: but this good Rector would not yeeld vnto it, for what cause God knoweth. God will at one day iudge all hypocrites, and bring their secret mischiefes to light. Vpon the death of this so memorable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they openly triumphed, and amongst other their Iesuiticall calumniations against him, sayd, that God had taken him away in good time: for if he had liued longer, he would haue disgraced himselfe, and lost the credit which he had got. These men haue the best for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in the world: for no man if once they begin to hate him doth liue any long time after it: <hi>quo artificio viderint ipsi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, concerning these two notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Iesuites haue practised an other of their rules vpon them. As to aduance themselues, they traduce all others, discommending their gifts, abilities, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, learning, discretion, pollicie, and all other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20199:25"/>
good qualities in them: as who should say, we are the only men that are to be accompted of, honored, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, and admired by all sorts in all places: so haue they a trick to aduaunce one and the same mens cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits, whom before they haue to an other end most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously disgraced and slaundered, when it may serue their turnes to worke some inconuenience or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to a third person, whom likewise they do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne and hate. For example, to hinder and discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Bishop of <hi>Cassanes</hi> Nephew <hi>Monsegnior Hugh Griffyn,</hi> they commended his Vnckle excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, to insinuate that he did farre degenerate from his Vnckles vertues. And on the other side after the death of Cardinall <hi>Allane,</hi> when they feared that the Bishop of <hi>Cassane</hi> should haue had his place, and bin made Cardinall, besides their reports of his enmitie to their societie, and stirring vp all their garboyles in the sayd Colledge, they spared not to spreade it abroade, as men that had worshipped Cardinall <hi>Allane,</hi> and loued him with their whole harts, that the said Bishop of <hi>Cassane</hi> could neuer indure him the said Cardinall, but was euer his enemy, and had wrought him much woe and griefe in his time. Whereupon to make that <hi>Machiuilean</hi> report the more odious, and to blemish the good opinion had of the Bishop thereby to trump in his way, till he was triced indeed out of their way: they entred into a large discourse of his extraordinary singularities: how beneficiall he had bin to their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: how much he was esteemed of all Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> that knew him: how deerely he had bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted of by the Popes holynes, and by other Popes his predecessors: how his greatest care was euer bent for the good of his Countrie, for the reducing of the same to the Catholick faith: what great honor he had in the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> how much he was admired by the rest of the Cardinals, and how highly reuerenced
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20199:26"/>
alwayes by themselues. All which particular points, sauing the last were most true, and ought to haue their true vse, as we hold of all the good words and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and reports made and giuen out by the Scribes and Pharisees, and by the Diuell himselfe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ, though they did the same to a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpose to haue dishonored or intangled him in his speeches or otherwise, if by any meanes they had bin able: as these good fellowes dealt with the good Cardinall, not that they so deemed of him, as their words imported, but only to hinder the sayd Bishop, as we haue sayd, from the preferment they feared and was like enough would haue been layd vpon him, if he had liued: being forsooth a man no way fit for it, that had opposed himselfe in faction to so worthie and high a Prelate. But what doe we insist vpon their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and slaunders against meaner men, nay this good Bishop and this most renowned Cardinall, when they fauour not their Iesuiticall doings? We will proceede to their presumptions against the Popes themselues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xistus</hi> 5. called before him the Generall of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, and demaunded of him, why they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Iesuits: who answered, that they did not so call themselues, but onely Clarkes of the societie of Iesus. To whom the Pope replying, sayd: why should you appropriate your selues to be of the societie of Iesus, more then all other Christians, of whom the Apostle saith: <hi>Vocati sumus in societatem filij eius?</hi> And whereas the Benedictines, are so called of their first author <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> and the Dominicans of <hi>Dominicus</hi> their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, why should not you be called <hi>Ignatiani,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the first author, and also keepe the Quier, and rise at midnight, and in all things doe as other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men doe? These words of the Pope they tooke so grieuously, as he liued but a short time after (to omit what hath been reported) and after his death, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20199:26"/>
haue not ceased very wickedly to depraue him. Some of them preached openly against him in <hi>Spaine:</hi> they haue tearmed him a Wolfe, and said he was a <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi> It was giuen forth by them; that if he had liued a little longer, he would haue vndone al Christendome. They called the manner of his death into question, and reported that at his departure he had no confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor with him. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe hearing of his death, vsed these words: <hi>Qui sine poenitentia viuit &amp; sine poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia moritur, procul dubio ad inferna descendit.</hi> Of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liehoode it is a matter of damnation, to indeuour to bring some Iesuits into order, without great pennance done for it. But for this worthie person, now a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, wee will not take vpon vs to interpret his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: marry that another miscreant in respect of any order should slaunder Christs late Vicar vpon earth, being so worthie a Bishop in his time, as his deedes will louud out his praise, whilest <hi>Rome</hi> standeth; wee hold it intolerable, had they been the best Iesuits that now liue, who should haue so disgraced him. But the chiefe poynt that we meant to obserue vnto you in one of these lewde companions speeches, is; how vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some opposition and obiections made against some of his slaunderous reports of that worthy Pope, he fell to the maintenance of this most wicked asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Hominem non christianum posse esse Romanum pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificem:</hi> and yet this proposition is not reuoked, nor the graund Archpriest hath censured him for it; who is so readie to punish others his auncients, and as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and honest men as himselfe, that wee goe no further.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Cassane</hi> so oft before mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generall Visitor in <hi>Rome</hi> of all religious men, had manie accusations exhibited vnto him by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, one against another, and manie petitions, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to come and visite them. With these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20199:27"/>
&amp; iarres amongst them, the Bishop acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope <hi>Clement</hi> that now is. Whereupon at the next generall Chapter held by the Iesuits, his holinesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the said Bishop of <hi>Cassane,</hi> and foure or fiue Bishops more, went into their house, &amp; rebuked them sharpely for their pride, and for their disorderly apparrell, and for their prodigalitie, charging them earnestlie to be more humble, and to frame the course of their liues and behauiour hereafter more like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did at that time. How these words were taken by the Fathers, wee make no doubt: with indignation inough you may be sure: and since (as we fuppose) some of that societie haue beene so bold with his holinesse, as they haue affirmed peremptorily, that he erred in absoluing the French king that now is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiued by his Diuines. Of likelihood they were not of the Popes counsell in that action, to haue giuen him better direction. But the said absolution did so much tend to the preiudice of the king of Spaine, and to their deseignments with him, as no meruaile if they doe so caluminate it: daring by their rule of <hi>ordine ad Deum,</hi> to doe and speake almost what they list.</p>
            <p>Now if these men may presume thus far with so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men, Bishops, Cardinals, and with the Popes themselues, vpon so small occasions, how will they crucifie vs poore wretches, that haue beene thus bold with their worships. And yet if the worst should fall out, hauing such companie to vndergoe with vs, the malice and spite of their lauish tongues: the griefe wil be the lesse. Wee pray God from the bottome of our hearts, that they may follow the counsaile of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and become more lowlie in their owne eyes: for otherwise some great inconuenience will insue of it. We are not Prophets, nor the sonnes of any Prophet, to foretell the euent of things before they fall out. But if we haue any vnderstanding (as we hope herein wee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20199:27"/>
haue none) if these fellowes haue the reynes laid on their neckes, and be suffered to run forward with the bit in their teeth a little longer, they wil hardlie be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, without great daunger of apostasie: such is their pride and haughtines of minde. It is great pitie that so worthie an order should be prophaned with so manie machiuilians, and that they will not rather chuse to follow their founder in humilitie, and many most excellent persons of that societie. Cardinall <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> of worthie memorie, Cardinall <hi>Bellarmino</hi> yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: <hi>Gregorie de Valentia, Suarez,</hi> and many others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen worthies in their dayes; who bestowed not their time in canuasing of kingdomes, and deposing of Princes, or in anie such like vnpriestlie practises, as you haue heard of before that our Iesuits doe.</p>
            <p>And thus for this time wee leaue the Iesuits of our nation, to deale in generalities any farther with them, or with their extraordinarie illuminations or spirits of guiding soules: and doe addresse our selues to that vertuous Paragon Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> the vnworthie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of our English Seminarie at <hi>Rome.</hi> But before we begin with him, wee had need to entertaine you with some short Preface. For some no doubt will startle that he should be touched, what? Dare any presume to call him in question? Will you intermeddle with his actions? They are not to be sifted or canuased or discountenanced by any secular Priests whosoeuer, his holines excepted. Beware what you doe: it is sure a note of an euill spirit: we pray God those men be sound that dare take this course. He is a religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a lesuit, the rarest wise man of our nation, most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with Princes, admired in Spaine, reuerenced in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie, and onlie hated in England: which is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument of his integritie. But by your good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour a little: runne not headlong with these generall conceits. These propositions be to too large, these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20199:28"/>
are too abstract: descend a while into particulars. Consider his actions: let those (not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conceits) proue or disproue the man; may not a religious person be exorbitant: a wise man forget him selfe, and an euill man winne fauour? What greater meanes to worke iniustice then fauour &amp; wit? Fooles neuer reach farre. And what thing sooner deceiueth, and longer cloketh deceit, then a religious habite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an euill person; sith most men iudge the inward man, by the outward appearance. The wolfe neuer more deceiueth then when hee is clothed in a sheepes skin: yet is not this a reproch vnto religion, nor a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the habite, but a greater reproofe to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that will abuse innocent meanes to nocent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Seeing then, that a veluet herse may somtimes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a corrupted and stinking carkas: let not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance and habite onelie carrie away and preiudicate mens conceits, where the effects doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime. If he be a religious man, he is sequestred from the world: what then hath he to doe with kingdomes and titles? If he haue abiured the world, let him shew it to be so, in his conuersation, and sincere affections indeed, and not determine of common wealths and kingdomes. If his profession will not drawe him thereto, yet let charitie moue him to forbeare, because thereby he giueth matter to increase our persecution at home. Princes are iealous, and manie times haue cause to be so: why should he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prouoke our Prince to be suspitious of vs by his follies? And as touching our selues, you shall finde vs sure and sound enough by Gods grace: some of vs hauing stood vnto it, <hi>per mult as tribulationes,</hi> when this worthie champion took his heeles, and left vs to sinke or swim for him. Whilest he hath accompanied himselfe with Princes, and liued at his pleasure in kings courts: wee poore soules, haue beene tossed from piller to post, and hurryed from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20199:28"/>
to prison, and the best of vs haue for your sakes liued in sufficient affliction: And will you now begin to doubt of vs? If Father <hi>Parsons</hi> had kept himselfe within the compasse of his owne calling: hee should haue bin quiet for vs. But his dealings being such, as should wee not disclose and reproue them, we should be inuolued in his trayterous deseignements, &amp; after our long sufferance for our consciences be hanged for high treason: beare with vs, if wee seeke to preuent that scandall. Wee will therefore proceed by your good leaues, with our purpose: following in one and the same cause, the examples of some of our brethren, who in their bookes before mentioned haue giuen some little touch of him.</p>
            <p>And first for his birth. Maister <hi>Southwell</hi> a Iesuit and whilest he liued his obedient subiect, according to the prouer be <hi>mulus mulum scabit,</hi> hath told vs this tale of it. As for Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> he hauing placed the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his ambition in the contempt of honour, and the highest of his wealth in voluntarie pouertie, will easilie acknowledge his birth to haue beene of more honest then great parents: yet were they not so meane but that they were able to afford him such education, as might haue made his good parts a way to no small preferment. For this faire glose being most vntrue, we doubt not, but that Father <hi>Parsons</hi> either hath, or will hereafter by some worthie monument of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie requite him, were it not that the Iesuits haue a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priuiledge to write what they list, be it neuer so vntrue, if it may be couered with either of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>propter bonum societatis,</hi> or <hi>ordinem ad deum;</hi> this fellow would not thus haue aduentured to haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed those to whom he hath auouched it. For in truth the said maister <hi>Parsons</hi> his graund Prouinciall, is by his birth a bastard, beggotten vpon the bodie of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry base woman by the Parson of the parish where hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20199:29"/>
was borne: and his right name is not <hi>Parsons</hi> but <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck.</hi> Which defect, because it did not proceede from any fault in him, we could haue wished had bin omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our very reuerend brethren in their late decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to his holinesse: had not both they and wee thought it expedient thus farre to touch it, because the gentleman is so high minded, and doth take vpon him so vsuallie to debase other mens parentages, not sparing like a wicked person with an ouermuch har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened forehead, sundrie of the Nobilitie of England, nor his owne Soueraigne and her most worthy proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors. Besides, it may be a good caueat vnto him to looke well to his orders: considering the Canon lawe in that point, least otherwise it cost him his Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship. Master <hi>Southwels</hi> smoothe tale will not serue his turne, if the matter be ript vp against him. But to followe our course: the said Parson that begat him, did afterwards foster him, and hauing brought him vp at the schoole, sent him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and placed him in <hi>Balioll</hi> Colledge: from whence he was in effect expelled, being Maister of Artes, not for religion as he hath vaunted, but for his Bastardie, factious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, libelling, and other misdemeanours. But hereof you neede no further information, then the said declaration: where you shall finde, that there was such lamentation at his departure from the Colledge, as for ioye he was rung thence with Bels. Doctor <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawe</hi> being then fellow of the said Colledge, was his stiffe aduersarie in the matters obiected against him: which the good Father of his Iesuiticall charitie, doth not, when occasion serueth forget: hauing within these three yeares last past, by a very lewde strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme, as touching the villanie against her Maiestie, vndertaken by one <hi>Squier,</hi> brought both him and some others as we thinke, for his sake, in great danger of their liues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:20199:29"/>After this Father his said expulsion, or his leauing the said Colledge by compulsion, he repayred to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and hauing often resort to one <hi>Iames Clarke,</hi> his old schoolefellowe, abiding then in the inner Temple, he protested to him the said <hi>Clarke,</hi> vpon some occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of speeches betwixt them, that hee neither then was, nor euer ment to be any Papist (as it then pleased him to tearme vs Catholikes) and offered, for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction therein to affirme so much vpon his oath. His resolution was as hee saide, to studie phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, and that he was purposed to trauell for that end to <hi>Padua:</hi> and rather thither, then to any place else, because one <hi>Lane</hi> a Master of Artes, and his olde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce, in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was there placed, and in good reputation. Whereby you see the Gentlemans zeale to the Catholike Romane Religion, which driue him to leaue <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after the said conference with Maister <hi>Clarke,</hi> he departed beyond the Seas: and so framed the course of his life there, as within short time, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Iesuit: being a man very violent in Cardinall <hi>Allanes</hi> opinion, and of an vnquiet spirit. In this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he did profit exceedingly, and was almost vpon the suddaine a very great Statist, little behinde many of his auncients, for plotting and practising of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry vnpriestly enterprises. We are verilie perswaded (by diuers other his like desseignments sutable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) that this new good Father had his finger in the attempts for <hi>Ireland, anno</hi> 1578. when <hi>Stukeley</hi> should haue gone thither: and also <hi>anno</hi> 1579. when <hi>Saunders</hi> went indeede. Of this second expedition you may reade in our owne Chronicles: and for the first, thus the matter stoode. About a yeere before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe of the King of <hi>Portugale</hi> in <hi>Africke, Stukeley</hi> being in <hi>Rome,</hi> perswaded Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. that hee the said <hi>Stukely</hi> would make his the said Popes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20199:30"/>
sonne <hi>Iames</hi> (then Duke of <hi>Sora</hi>) the King of <hi>Ireland:</hi> if he the said Pope would furnish him with men and money sufficient for that expedition. Whereunto the Pope agreed, and set him forth with money, and with about 3000. men, directing his letters to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> for his assistance likewise in that enterprise. But the King (ayming at that kingdome more himselfe) refused either to receiue him into any of his Ports, or at all to ayde him. <hi>Stukeley</hi> being deceiued of this hope, cast about to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> (then prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for his <hi>Affrican</hi> voiage) who gladly receiued both him and his men, promising vnto him, that if he would goe with him in that voyage, hee would at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne furnish him sufficiently for the accomplishing of his purpose in <hi>Ireland. Stukeley</hi> yeelded: goeth into <hi>Affrike,</hi> is there slaine, and the Pope was greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, that he had been so greatly ouerreached by him.</p>
            <p>At such time as it was perceiued in <hi>Rome</hi> what the Pope intended by the instigation of <hi>Stukeley,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their said desseignements for <hi>Ireland,</hi> one Master <hi>Shelley,</hi> named the graund Prior for <hi>England,</hi> cast out words to this effect: what (saith he) because there are no more Cities of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placenza</hi> to bestowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Sonne, will he now haue <hi>Ireland,</hi> the patrimony of the Crowne of <hi>England?</hi> The said Prior being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Pope to vndertake that iourney with <hi>Stukeley,</hi> he refused so to doe, and told him that he the said <hi>Stukeley</hi> was but a shifting and a vaunting fellow, and that he would assuredly cousen him in all that hee committed to his charge and trust. But the Pope was so much addicted to that attempt, that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of the Prior his said words, and partly of this his said refusall, he grewe into such dislike with him, as for the safegard of his life he thought it meete to flie to <hi>Venice.</hi> Whether Father <hi>Parsons</hi> was then in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20199:30"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> to blow this coale against the Prior, or where he was, the matter is not great, considering the daily correspondencie by letters betweene the Fathers of that societie from all places in Christendome. Besides you may peraduenture heare more hereof at another time.</p>
            <p>About eleuen or twelue yeers after his sayd expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that being a Iesuite he had wonne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by his sayd factious disposition and practises the reputation to be made the Prouinciall for the Iesuites that were to be sent into <hi>England,</hi> he came hither with two subiects only, Father <hi>Campion,</hi> and Father <hi>Cotham, Anno</hi> 1580. hauing got a great start of Father <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> who was Proctor not long before in <hi>Oxford,</hi> when Father <hi>Parsons</hi> commensed but Bachelor of Arts, if our memories do not fayle vs therein.</p>
            <p>This his said comming into <hi>England</hi> being knowne, Maister <hi>Blackwell</hi> (now his darling and Arch-priest by his direction) bewayled the same to a friend of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in prison: saying vnto him, that it was a very vndiscreet fact of the President at <hi>Rhemes</hi> (meaning Doctor <hi>Allane</hi>) to send him hither, as being an vnfit man to be imployed in the causes of religion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked why he was vnmeete for that imployment, he answered, because this casting out of <hi>Balioll</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and other articles and matters depending vpon it, betwixt him and Doctor <hi>Squier</hi> (then liuing) were very likely to be renewed, and so to worke great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit both to him, and the cause Catholick.</p>
            <p>The holy Father was no sooner come into <hi>England,</hi> but besides the vanity of his challenge to all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants (being deemed an vnfit man to haue performed the same) he began to bestirre himselfe in matters of State, especially how to aduance a certayne King by the fauours of diuers forraine Princes: to the great preiudice of her Maiesties both Crowne and safetie,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20199:31"/>
as appeareth by a letter of his written to a noble man bearing date from <hi>Rome</hi> the 24. of Ianuarie 1600. In which kinde of affaires he so busied himselfe, as diuers Catholikes were in that respect greatly discontented with him, and told him plainely, that if he would not desist from those courses, they would deliuer him into the hands of the Ciuill Magistrate.</p>
            <p>The yeere after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1581. Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated by the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. his holines vpon knowledge that he was an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish man, and experience of his eloquence, and diuers other good parts in him, tooke him from the Duke, and sent him into <hi>England:</hi> where finding Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> with the authoritie of a Prouinciall, and he the said Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> refusing to submit himselfe vnto him, a great heartburning did arise betwixt them. Father <hi>Parsons</hi> alleaged that being the Prouinciall ouer the Iesuits in England, hee the said Father <hi>Heywood</hi> must consequentlie be his inferiour: but Father <hi>Heywood</hi> answered, that his mission hither was singular, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Pope himselfe, and therefore said, hee was thereby exempted from any subiection to him. This quarrel grew to be hote, and had manie priests and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as partakers on either side: some holding with one, and some with another.</p>
            <p>The same Father <hi>Parsons</hi> hauing stirred 'vp stirres, daungers, and garboyles by his seditious challenges, and dealings in England and Scotland: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that manie Catholickes were offended with him for it, hee made great collections of monie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending therwith to relieue prisoners: but being once maister of that mint, ehe fled into France, leauing his friends in England to shift for themselues, &amp; the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to feele and indure the want. When hee came to <hi>Paris,</hi> as a man hauing latelie bin in possession of his new Prouincialitie, hee put in practise this strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme

following, of purpose to exempt himselfe from the Prouinciall and his superiour there. He perswaded them that without their owne great perill, they could not entertaine him in their Colledge: affirming that the Queene of England (good Lady) being sore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to haue so great a personage to be harboured so neere her, had proscribed him, and promised no small summe of monie to the partie that would kill him: and hereunto he added, that hee had perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from his friends in England, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie in <hi>Paris,</hi> who had vndertaken that cruell deed. Therfore he prayed the Rector, that none of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie might be suffered to walke forth in his companie: saying that if they did, they should surelie perish with him. And to make this conceit the more probable, he suborned (with his own monie) two English men well appointed, and a Flemming with them, to goe latelie in the euening, and enquire for one Fa: <hi>Parsons</hi> at the Colledge. Whereupon the Iesuits beleeuing, that all he said was true, dismissed Father <hi>Parsons</hi> to goe forth freelie whither he would, and to dispose of himselfe at his owne pleasure, to auoide death forsooth, verifiyng the old prouerbe, <hi>Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt:</hi> as craftie a crouder, and as lying a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion now amongst the Iesuits, after almost thirtie yeeres profession, as hee was in Balioll Colledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his fellowes there.</p>
            <p>We told you before of the contention betwixt this good Father, and his pretended subiect Father <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood:</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for disciplines sake you may be sure he did not forget, hauing of likelihood, some further matter against him, by reason of his courses held here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. The said <hi>Heywood</hi> assembled a Synode in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and made such constitutions as are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the treatise before expressed, dedicated to the Pope. At this assembly Maister <hi>Dolman</hi> being present,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20199:32"/>
required of Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> to see his Commission; who being not able to shew him any, he the said Maister <hi>Dolman</hi> did inhibite him to proceede any further: and tolde him plainly that hee vsurped vpon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> then being in prison, and that if hee proceeded so to doe, he the said Master <hi>Dolman</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the olde customes of the Church would resist him, <hi>vsque ad sanguinem.</hi> Furthermore, after the saide Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> departure hence: some of the Priests fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their vsuall contributions to be greatly dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and perceiuing one cause thereof to be the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish expences of Father <hi>Heywood</hi> in keeping so many men, horses, and coaches (as Fa. <hi>Garnet'</hi> doth at this present) they dealt with him in that behalfe, signifying their dislike of such his prodigalitie: and alleaged that Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> spent not so much, when he was here. To whom Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> answered, that Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> was his inferior, in that he the said Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> was sent hither but by their Generall, whereas he (Fa. <hi>Heywood)</hi> had his mission from the Pope himselfe.</p>
            <p>What aduantages Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> gaue to Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> by these or any other his proceedings here, we minde not at large to expresse. It is susficient to let you knowe that Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> after his departure hence, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thirtie articles against him to the Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> he the said Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi> was shortly after called for by authoritie to come out of <hi>England,</hi> but was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before he could get hence. Howbeit not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was banished, and then he repaired to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to some place neere vnto it: where he was not so well intreated as he looked for. Insomuch as being moued with diuers enormities amongst the Iesuits, he wrote sundry letters to the Pope, instantly desiring his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that the Iesuits might be reformed, saying that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, hee should see their ruine (he feared) in his owne daies. Whereupon the Pope called their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20199:32"/>
               <hi>Aquauiue,</hi> and demaunded of him what those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities were, which father <hi>Heywood</hi> complayned of, to whom he answered, that the old man did it of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not knowing what he sayd: and withall to stop him from writing any more to the Pope, he sent him to <hi>Calabria:</hi> where (as we haue bin informed) he was by the sayd Generals commaundement kept close priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and so or in little better case remayneth, if he be yet aliue: but as we thinke he is dead.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our deuout Father of <hi>Stockgersee (natale solum)</hi> after his said arriuall in <hi>France,</hi> as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with cousening his superiors in <hi>Paris</hi> for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter libertie, so did he continue his <hi>Machiuilian</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in matters of State, and hath not ceased since that time to seeke the betraying and destruction of his owne Country like a Monster; besides the publishing of sundrie his most seditious writings and letters, whereby her Maiestie, and the State haue bin so iustly irritated, as we poore men innocent and ignorant of all his vnnaturall deseignements, haue felt the smart of his wickednes, himselfe being without danger, and like a coward and false shepheard, hauing left both vs and the flock in the bryers. Within a while after his going into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> he plunged himselfe vp to the eares in the Scottish causes then in hand, and was an especiall instigator of the Duke of <hi>Guise, Anno</hi> 1583. or thereabouts, for his sodaine surprizing the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and her Maiesties person, with 5000. men: assuring him, that the Catholicks would assist him if neede required. Besides, it being determined that the sayd Duke should come hither in his owne person, for the performance of the attempt, there was not any man found more fit for his dexteritie and forwardnes in that matter, then Father <hi>Parsons</hi> (as <hi>Mendoza</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) to be imployed to <hi>Rome</hi> to make triall, if by his pollicie any money might haue bin gotten from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20199:33"/>
his holynes for the furnishing of that iourney. But we thinke he lost his labour. Furthermore, considering that one of the Dukes chiefe cares was to know the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Hauens to land in, &amp; that <hi>Frauncis Throckmerton</hi> was imployed for that purpose by the instigation and aduise of Sir <hi>Frauncis Englefeild, Mendoza,</hi> and others, (all of them Father <hi>Parsons</hi> especiall friends) it is more then probable that his Fatherhood was, if not a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioner for that purpose, yet one of that counsell and confederacy, or at the least acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>It is not vnknowne what a villanous attempt the traytor <hi>Parry</hi> vndertooke against the life of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie the same yeare, <hi>Anno</hi> 1583. pursuing the same, till by Gods mercy he came to the gallowes the yeere after. With this outragious plot sundry Iesuites were acquainted: nay, they were the incouragers of him to proceede in it valiantly, omitting no perswasions or meanes they could vse to that effect. It maketh our hearts to bleede, that the blessed Sacrament should euer be made a meanes to animate villaines in such diuelish enterprises. But what is all this to Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?</hi> Surely it concerneth him more then we are glad to report. For the sayd <hi>Parry</hi> hauing apprehended a certaine necessity for the good of the Catholick cause, that her Maiestie must be taken out of the way; and finding a great aptnes and desire in himselfe to be an instrument to that effect: yet was he perplexed in his mind with some doubts and obiections, why he might not lay violent hands vpon her person. For the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and remoouing of which difficulties, Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> was offred him to conferre with, as being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted one ofthe meetest men to resolue him in such matters. It is true that <hi>Parry</hi> refused to talke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with him: but yet the very offer doth argue that the good Father was acquainted with <hi>Parries</hi> intent, or at the least that he was knowne to be one, that if he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20199:33"/>
talked with <hi>Parry,</hi> would haue animated him in that course, with all his Iesuiticall arguments and best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions. You will say this is but a coniecture: and therefore for your better satisfaction of the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, you shall vnderstand, that it is to be shewed by one ofthis Fathers owne letters to Maister <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> that whilest this mischiefe was in consultation, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gentleman of good quality comming vnto him, told him of it, and sayd, that assuredly he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it: but he the godly Father disswaded him with all his skill, and would not suffer him so to do: which was (as we thinke) a more vile part in Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> being borne her Maiesties subiect, then in any stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whosoeuer, that thrust <hi>Parry</hi> forwards into that most barbarous stratageme.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this good Father that he might leaue no stone vnturned, which could tend to the trouble and mischiefe of his natiue Countrie, when his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with more priuate persons would not succeede, then he returned to those of higher place, and excited them to vndertake some exployts vpon them, which might be answerable to his Iesuiticall, that is, most bloudy deseignements. He made a lewde discourse, wherein he intitled <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to her Maiesties Crowne, &amp; indeuoured with all his skill to perswade the Duke in the right of his sonne <hi>Ranutius</hi> to set vpon this Realme with all his force, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto him diuers meanes (as one by marrying his sonne to a certayne english Lady) for his better effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ofthat enterprise.</p>
            <p>But the attempt of 1588. by the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Maiestie and this whole Kingdome, as it is and ought to be abhorred by all true hearted Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen: so we trust the memory of those wretches borne in our owne Countrie, that were either procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, perswaders, or Agents in it, shall be had in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20199:34"/>
detestation. In which number, this our Iesuite was a chiefe firebrand, and had his hand in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious booke, that was then printed for the stirring vp of her Maiesties subiects to haue taken part with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> if he could haue arriued: which booke vpon their foile and ouerthrow was presently burnt for shame, that euer the world should see so impious a treatise, we meane the whole impression was burnt, sauing some few that escaped their hands. We are the more earnest against this enterprise, because it touched all English Catholicks heere, as much as it did in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Protestants. For it is knowne right well both from the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> his owne mouth, and by other certeyne intelligence, that all the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> as well as others, and perhaps rather, were designed to the slaughter. For the sayd Duke being told, that there were some Catholicks in <hi>England:</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, I care not: I will make the best Protestants in <hi>England</hi> as good Catholicks as they, if I haue them once vnder my sword. I respect neither the one nor the other: I meane to make roome there for my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. This he hath spoken diuers times in the hearing of Maister <hi>Wencelade,</hi> a Deuonshire man. And this also the Iesuites themselues confesse, as amongst others Father <hi>Southwell</hi> at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> in the hearing of diuers of the Priests there prisoners.</p>
            <p>At what time Father <hi>Parsons</hi> went into <hi>Spayne</hi> we do not remember, we thinke it was about the yeare 1589. but sure we are that when it was knowne here, and that he was commended thither by <hi>Don Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino de Mendoza</hi> his fellow Iesuite, many Catholicks of sounder iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did vtterly dislike it. They knew the ambition of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and how <hi>bellum sacrum</hi> pretended by <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and continued since as a thing hereditary to that kingdome, vnder sundry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for the defence of the Catholick faith, did tend
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20199:34"/>
to nothing else, but to make them selues monarches. Besides, they were not ignorant with what eagernes the Iesuites began to aduaunce the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> which made them to suspect that Father <hi>Parsons</hi> going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would still bring forth some further mischiefes: and indeed it fell so out. For through <hi>Mendoza</hi> his credit, he became not only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sodain a Courtier, but grew very soone into great fauour with the King: which you know must needes be easily wrought (as the King stood then affected against <hi>England,</hi> hauing bin so much dishonored by his repulse the yeere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by his Maiesties experience of this good Fathers mortall hatred to his owne country, in plotting and casting about, how his highnes might be reuenged. We will not tell what we feare concerning the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues wherewith this Father perswaded the King to erect the Seminaries for our Countrymen in <hi>Spayne,</hi> and elsewhere, the end oftheir institution was most religiously politike, and holy: but if we shall finde those wholy employed for increasing either of Iesuits or of other Priests, such as must follow and applaude to all their trayterous courses against our Country, for our owne parts we wish they had neuer bin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1589. the same yeare that this Father came into <hi>Spayne,</hi> the Seminary was erected in <hi>Valle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid</hi> by his meanes. In commendation whereof, he writeth very amply, and mentioneth one thing by the way, which (sauing his Maisterships Fatherhood) we do not beleeue to be true: he knoweth full well how to keepe himselfe warme. For he sayth, that the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there hearing of the rigor and crueltie in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> were (in short time after the sayd erection) so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated and desirous to see themselues in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: as he himselfe was ofttimes thereby moued (had he bin a few yeeres yonger, and could haue borne that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20199:35"/>
mission) to haue gone once againe with them into <hi>England.</hi> But except he may come hither with <hi>Gloria patri,</hi> we will vndertake it for him he will not greatly trouble vs heere with his presence.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1592. the King with his sonne and daughter went to <hi>Valledolid:</hi> and being there, did visit his english Seminary at Father <hi>Parsons</hi> suite. In which visitation you shall see the continuance of this fathers deadly malice, breathed out in his schollers orations. Wherein her Maiestie is by all meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued: the Kings honor and excellency is extolled aboue all measure: her Highnes downe-fall, and his victories are prophecied, and nothing is omitted that might aduaunce the one, and depresse the other. One of them deliuering the good father his directions, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to the King in his oration, not only himselfe, but in the name of the rest, all his fellowes: nay their whole Countrey, their parents, and friends, with all their Allyes, confederates, and acquaintance. Which ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all their other proceedings then at <hi>Valledolid</hi> comming to Cardinall <hi>Allane</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> he wept for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, seeing what they still aymed at. Do not you thinke that our Country is like to receiue great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by these Spanish schollers, if they shall proceede according to these beginnings? If you can get this Fathers relation printed the sayd yere 1592. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this visitation of the Seminary, you shall see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particulars: but this we warne you of, that in the printed copy, that part of the youths oration is omitted, wherein the sayd great offer is made to the King. That is not a point to be made too vulgar, till the time and opportunity serue.</p>
            <p>The yeare after 1593. Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> because men should not thinke him idle, hath offred to the world a further testimony of his good will to her Maiestie, and his Country, in a treatise intituled, <hi>Newes from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20199:35"/>
Spayne.</hi> Herein, besides certayne exercises by the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish yong Priests in an other Seminary at <hi>Siuill,</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in effect to the same purpose with the former: it pleaseth him to discourse of some pleasant conceits, and certaine empreises: and in one; how King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterburie</hi> and the Queenes Maiestie are marshalled in a table together. Many diuels with instruments of torments in their hands are painted vnder king <hi>Henry</hi> the eights picture: and her Maiestie is made to stand as it were in great sadnes, looking both vpon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, set out with many Angels and garlands for his repentance. For Priests in a straunge countrie to deale thus with their owne Kings, argueth little Religion, and lesse discretion: it being imprinted thereby in euery mans minde, that seeth these or the like courses: that let any King offend them, and they will not faile to vse him with the like contempt. But the chiefe part of these newes is of a certaine conference at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> concerning the succession to the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> and how many pretenders there are that doe gape after it. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was at this time but in papers, you shall heare of it anon come out in Print. When this fellowe was made a Religious person, it had been good for the Church that a Mill stone had been tied about his necke, and he cast into the Sea: such scandall hath and will arise hereafter by his more then Machiuiliean deuises.</p>
            <p>In the said yeere also 1593. Fa: <hi>Parsons</hi> and Father <hi>Creswell</hi> (neither barrell better hering) set out in Spaine another booke vnder the counterfeit name of <hi>Andreas Philopater:</hi> that is, <hi>Andrew</hi> loue his country: wherein like two arrant companions they presume diuers times to speake to her Maiestie (their naturall Soueraigne) as if they were themselues two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20199:36"/>
and she but a milke maide. Besides, for that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard &amp; most ignominious <hi>filius terrae Parsons,</hi> for him (wesay) to be one, that with a brasen forehead should dare to obiect the meane parentage of sundrie great personages, who haue beene in great authoritie in this kingdome: nay for him so vile a rascall to depraue and extenuate the blood Royall which is in her Maiesties sacred person, descending from the renowned King Henry the Seauenth; what true English heart can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it? Beare with vs: for before God wee are much moued with the consideration of it. He inueieth very bitterlie against the crueltie of her Highnes lawes; which we wish had been more milde: but he neuer mentioneth that he and his fellowes haue been the occasion of them by their traiterous courses, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Crowne and life. For our owne parts wee haue felt the burthen of some of them: whereas these companions being in safetie themselues, care not what mischiefe they bring vpon our heads. Besides in this booke, are sprinckled here and there some of their seditious positions touching their setting vp of subiects against their Princes, and of cutting off the right heires to the Crowne, vnder pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which we account to bee very pernicious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. For as when Religion is receiued into any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it medleth not with, or maketh better any Kings title to his Crowne; so when it is banished thence, it doth not diminish any Princes right or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, but leaueth (in our opinions) the same as it found it.</p>
            <p>Now these said positions with many more (passing from hand to hand by conference and in papers, for two or three yeares in <hi>Spaine)</hi> begun to shew their heads in print, and are compiled into a booke: the chiefe scope whereof is this (if Maister <hi>Charles Paget</hi> or we doe vnderstand it) <hi>viz.</hi> the deposing of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20199:36"/>
the alteration of our auncient lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes: the disinheriting of all her Maiesties lawfull successors, and the aduanncing of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spayne</hi> to the royall throne of this Kingdome. When these points with their appurtenances were first published, whether in papers or in print, we know not, Father <hi>Parsons</hi> being halfe sick, acquainted the schollers in <hi>Siuill</hi> publickly with them, and read the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course himselfe vnto them, and the same he procured to be done to other english Students at <hi>S. Lucars,</hi> as a friend of his hath lately written into <hi>England</hi> in the good fathers commendation. Who telleth vs further, that father <hi>Parsons</hi> demaunding how they the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers liked that treatise, especially concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi> they answered, that they did not only like it, but diuers Priests and others subscribed their names vnto it, for a testimony of their approbation of it. This that these men subscribed vnto, was as seemeth a short draught of the <hi>Infantaes</hi> pretended title, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning also the forme of a submission for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the <hi>Infanta</hi> to be their Queene and Soueraigne. It was reported here by certayne Priests, that the sayd Students refused to subscribe to any such matter, and that father <hi>Parsons</hi> by false infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation procured them to subscribe to a blanck, both in <hi>Siuill,</hi> and in <hi>Valledolid,</hi> which he supplied after to the effect before mentioned, and offred the same to the <hi>Infanta.</hi> Maister <hi>Charles Paget</hi> reporteth hereof something, and to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that father <hi>Parsons</hi> caused diuers by fayre meanes and threates to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, that in all conferences they should when they came into <hi>England</hi> aduance the <hi>Infantaes</hi> title, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to expect her Maiesties death, but by all meanes to remoue her from the present possession of her royall estate. If these things should come to the knowledge of the State, who will blame the same, if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20199:37"/>
such Priests as come hither out of <hi>Spayne</hi> be not very well interteyned? Neither shall those that come from <hi>Rome</hi> be in any better plight, now that father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> is the Rector of that Seminary: because it may be well supposed, that he being no changeling, his schollers must either daunce after his pipe, or sit still and daunce not at all. Kings haue bin euer iealous of their estates, and will take any occasion to preuent the worst. Whereby you see what our cases are: he practiseth, and we are punished: the Catholick cause is greatly indangered and hindered by him.</p>
            <p>To this good Fathers proceedings, the death of Cardinall <hi>Allane</hi> in the end of the yeare 1594. and of the Bishop of <hi>Cassane</hi> a little after, gaue no little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, for they both disliked them. But then he rid in his owne course a gallop, laboring with his assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and mates to perswade as many as they could both in their sermons and in their writings, that the Catholick faith and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> were so lincked together, as it was a point of necessitye in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith to put all <hi>Europe</hi> into his hands: else the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick religion would perish. A position you know most absurd and blasphemous, as though Gods truth and religion had only depended vpon the old King of <hi>Spayne.</hi> Well, this foundation layd, father <hi>Parsons</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the King, that the Iesuites in <hi>Eagland</hi> were so highly esteemed, so greedely followed not only of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, but of Protestants that were of the wiser sort, and in such authoritie, that he doubted not but that shortly the King should be in euery mans hart. For the effecting whereof, his riches, his greatnes, his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, iustice, and loue towards the English were daily commended: and father <hi>Parsons</hi> was inabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the libertie of such English men as were taken prisoners: of purpose that when they came home, they might sound out the prayses of the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20199:37"/>
               <hi>Parsons.</hi> If you say we set not downe these particulars in their due places, you haue our excuse before.</p>
            <p>About the yeere 1596. the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> excited partly by Father <hi>Parsons</hi> allurements last mentioned, and by other his seditious associates (alleadging that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> got not <hi>Britaine</hi> at his first assault) attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a second exployt for <hi>Famouth,</hi> with a new Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, intending therewith to haue gotten into his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session <hi>Arwennike</hi> Castle, with the hill <hi>Pendennice.</hi> Which Armado as it was comming from <hi>Lisbone</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ferroll</hi> (the place of rendeuow) was greatly scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the way, so as 34. Ships perished in one night, with the losse of 5000. men. Thereby the Kings pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for that time was stayed: but yet not long after his Maiestie enterprised the same attempt againe for the sayd Castell, and had the like successe: his Ships were dispersed, and all came to naught. That Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> was likewise acquainted with this deseignement, if not a chiefe instigator, may appeare by one of his owne letters to a friend of his in the yeere 1597. We pray God, that no practise or deseignement set on foote, either by this good Father, or by any other, for the inda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gering of her Maiestie, or of our natiue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, haue euer better issue, but may perish as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fruit of a woman. If once God shall be pleased to restore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholick faith by holy &amp; good meanes, and that we may liue to see it, we shall be very ioyfull men, hauing so long (poore prisoners) expected the same: but otherwise we are content to languish still, and dye in our sorrowes.</p>
            <p>We are almost weary with raking in the dunghill of this good Fathers practises: and yet something of him further. When he found lesse hope by meanes of the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> or at the least whilest his Maiestie was in furnishing himselfe, <hi>Parsons</hi> or his dependants, <hi>Holt</hi> and <hi>Worthington,</hi> with his priuitie, if not aduice
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20199:38"/>
(as Maister <hi>Charles Paget</hi> noteth) practised the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of the Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> Which plot being discouered to the Earle by a Gentleman one <hi>Hesket,</hi> imployed by them to his Lordship, he the sayd Earle as a most dutifull subiect disclosed their treason, which wrought his vntimely death as many say. With this deseignement Maister <hi>Charles Browne</hi> (otherwise as true an harted Catholick as the prowdest of them) was so greatly moued, as he writ to Maister <hi>Stapleton</hi> (then in preparation towards <hi>Rome</hi>) desiring him to present to his holynes certaine articles (which he had framed against these Iesuites, and then sent likewise vnto him) concerning their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling the sayd Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> to the Crowne, their dealing with him, and the successe of them to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test staunder of all Catholicks, and hurt of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cause. He also was earnest with Maister <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that he would himselfe make knowne to the Pope what infinite garboyles and mischiefes these fellowes had stirred vp amongst vs, whilest his holynes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they were laboring faithfully to win poore soules to the Catholick faith, as it was the dutie of truly religious persons.</p>
            <p>Amongst all these tragicall deseignements of this good Father, we will tell you one of his pretie tricks. One Maister <hi>Fixer</hi> a Priest (hauing a protection heere in <hi>England</hi> from the Lord Treasurer) was so vexed and calumniated by the Iesuites, that he renounced it, and thereupon went into <hi>Spayne,</hi> intending to reade in some religious house. Being at <hi>Lisbone</hi> in good credit, he procured the release of 14. or 15. English men that were taken prisoners: willing them to thanke Master <hi>Bluet</hi> and Doctor <hi>Bagshaw</hi> for their liberty. Hereof <hi>Parsons</hi> hauing notice, sent for him into <hi>Spayne,</hi> vnder pretence of his preferment: but when he had him, he procured him to be layd in prison for a spy, where he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20199:38"/>
remayneth still, vnlesse he be dead.</p>
            <p>You see by the premisses a little glimpse of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers proceedings in <hi>Spayne:</hi> and the rest of his societie were no lesse busied to the same purpose else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Howbeit, the secular Priests both in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> did vtterly dislike both him and all the rest with their so treasonable deseignements against their owne Countrie: whereof the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> hauing notice, did write earnestly to the Pope that now is, and to other Cardinals, that in any case they should support and maynteyne the credit of the Iesuites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the complaints of the English, who without all cause, but seduced by the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> did greatly calumniate them as he affirmed. The two pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising Prelates also of the Low countryes, Fa. <hi>Holt,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Worthington,</hi> drew a formall letter suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiue, in the names of all the english souldiers, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, artizans, pensioners, as well men, as women (yea the very seruing maydes and laundresses were not omitted) the same to be presented to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Spaine:</hi> most humbly beseeching his Maiestie, in regard of his great affection and care of <hi>England,</hi> and the afflicted English, that he would deale earnestly with the Pope to preferre the worthie Father and Prelate Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> to the dignity of a Cardinall: affirming it to be the only way to binde and vnite the English to his Maiestie.</p>
            <p>In expectation of the same preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and for what causes else it is not materiall, this good Father went out of <hi>Spayne</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> in the yeare 1597. At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, he was visited in his lodging (or as they say courted) by two Cardinals, <hi>viz. Baronius,</hi> and the other a <hi>Spanyard.</hi> Which extraordinary curtesie and honor done vnto him, gaue present occasion of some speeches in the Citie, that out of doubt Father <hi>Parsons</hi> should be made a Cardinall. This conceyt thus begun
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20199:39"/>
in <hi>Rome,</hi> ended for thattime with a merryiest. For Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parsons</hi> being counselled by the Phisitions to keep his stomack warme, sent his brother for scarlet to make him a stomacher, who oflikelihood as soone as euer he heard the name of scarlet, was so possessed of a sodaine with an opinion of his brothers aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that forgetting his intent to haue only a stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, he procured two Merchants to carry in a wagon diuers pieces ofscarlet to his brothers lodging for the making of his Cardinals roabes, giuing it out by the way to all his acquaintance both going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that his brother forthwith should be made a Cardinall. When this good Father saw such packs of scarlet brought vnto him, no meruaile ifhe wondred at it. But finding his brothers error, he was in a great chafe, and much confounded, as easily foreseeing what sport it would procure amongst those that heard of it. Whereupon in all haste he dismissed the sayd Merchants with their scarlets at a back dore as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly as he could. Howbeit, the thing was so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as it could not be concealed, and caused indeede very many to iest and laugh at him. One, (a man little fauored by this good father) hearing hereof, went in meriment to his lodging to congratulate his new aduauncement. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father knew the purpose of his comming: yea (quoth he) doth he know it? It will be then in <hi>England</hi> within this fortnight.</p>
            <p>We haue before acquainted you with this fathers dealings concerning his reading to the Students and Priests at <hi>Siuill:</hi> of his discourse for the <hi>Infantaes</hi> title: and now vnderstand further, that he was no sooner seated in <hi>Rome,</hi> but to inure the Priests and Students there with his diabolicall conceyts, he required that his english booke of titles might be read publickly in their refectorie as a Chapter of the Bible is read at such times in our Vniuersities, and promised, that in so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20199:39"/>
doing, if they liked it, he would afterwards let them reade his high counsell of reformation. Wherein (as they report that haue seene it) the whole Realme of <hi>England</hi> is made a Prouince dependant vpon <hi>Spaine</hi> and Iesuitisme. The lands and Segniories of Clergie and Nobilitie and Vniuersities are abridged: and of some in particular in his vaine and childish hope are confiscated. For example, <hi>Cecyll</hi> house must be <hi>Casa professa:</hi> and another house by it, there, <hi>Nouitiatum.</hi> Whereunto an imagined principle of the Iesuits (for which they aduenture both credit and conscience ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre) being added, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Iesuits must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile where once they set footing, it maketh many to condemne them and wish that the maske of religion being taken from them (which by their occasions and turmoylings is blasphemed) they might appeare in their owne colours, that the world might no longer be decciued by them.</p>
            <p>It were a worke of very great labour to trace this fellow in all his apparant deuises and practises. And for his rules, whereby both he and his adherents doe square their actions, they are vncertaine, and holde as the time serueth, and they thinke conuenient. If they haue any vie of a man, they make faire weather with him: and afterwards least hee should expect some benefit from them, they haue waies and trickes to shake him off very Iesuitically. Maister <hi>Barret</hi> was for a long time one oftheir chiefe instruments to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purposes, whom they requited in the end with all manner of disgraces and disgusts, euen to his last breath. For example, Maister <hi>Barret</hi> being sent for to come to <hi>Rome</hi> about the breach of the students with the Iesuits, Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> hoping that hee would haue taken part with the students, intended to make him Rector, and to cast out all the Iesuits (as hee did cast out sixe) but <hi>Barret</hi> contrarie to the Cardinals ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20199:40"/>
became Iesuited, and did what he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the students in fauour of the Iesuits. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cardinal <hi>Tolet</hi> reiected him as an vnworthie man. The Iesuits afterwards sent him downe to <hi>Doway</hi> to his olde charge: and <hi>Parsons</hi> craftily made him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a house, which cost 1700. Crownes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all stopped at <hi>Rome</hi> the Popes pension for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge two yeeres. Whereupon Doctor <hi>Barret</hi> in the behalfe of the Colledge fel in debt 3000. crownes: the Iesuits all the while keeping him from the annuall pension. Whereupon hee sending to <hi>Rome</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and require the money: gentle Father <hi>Parsons</hi> went to the Pope, and accused him of excesse and euill hnsbandrie, in dissipating the Popes pensions, and suffering the house to fall to extremitie, and intended to cast him out, and place in the Iesuits, sauing that his death preuented it.</p>
            <p>I haue elsewhere mentioned vnto you the Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call axiome of winning or redeeming of time: which is in effect to runne with the time, in altering their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, so as they may best serue to winne their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. The practise of which ground is in no one of their affaires so manifest, as in labouring to set vp, now this man, now that man, to attempt the Crowne: furnishing euery one with sufficient authoritie, that of right it belongeth vnto him. And true it is, that rather then faile, they care not who hee is, or of what race, nor of what nation that wil step in for the Kingdome, so he be a Catholike.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Parsons</hi> notwithstanding all his faire shewes to <hi>Spaine,</hi> hath still been practising from time to time, whilest the Spaniard hath been in breathing, to haue raised vp others to get the Kingdome if they could, and so to haue pulled that morsell out of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards iawes: so her Maiestie were deposed, he respecteth not by whom. For as before the Earle of <hi>Darbie</hi> with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20199:40"/>
his priuitie was dealt with particularly to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: so at an other time he writ a discourse which was sent into <hi>England,</hi> and published to many of the best Catholicks heere: that hee would wish and aduise them, when the commoditie serued, that they should make an election of some principall noble English Catholick to be their King. But still when none nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretender, nor people will be so mad as to follow his deseignements, then he hath euer his recourse to the King of <hi>Spayne:</hi> and at this time insisteth vpon the <hi>Infanta:</hi> debarring himselfe from following of none that will in the meane time take Armes against her Highnes.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Charles' Paget</hi> in one of his letters telleth vs of a maxime amongst our English Iesuites, and others seduced by them: that whosoeuer doth not approue and aduaunce Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> and some of his followers, their conceits and courses touching our Country and Nation, though they be neuer so foolish, rash, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, scandalous, and dangerous, nay though men be desirous to fit still, and meddle nothing with them, or their actions one way or other: yet if he do not ayde and assist them, it is lawfull; yea, necessay, that such persons be infamed, by casting out against them any calumniations that may discredit them. The practise of which maxime, howsoeuer Maister <hi>Paget</hi> learned it, we are sure that many poore Priests in <hi>England</hi> and elsewhere, haue felt it, honester men then either he, or many of his adherents. The contention which hath bin in <hi>Rome</hi> betwixt our english Students and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, is not vnknowne to all <hi>Europe.</hi> The compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof this good Father taketh to himselfe: and so hath ordered the matter, that the Iesuites (forsooth) were alwayes blamelesse, and the whole fault was in the Students. For further declaration whereof, the wretch layeth about him in one of his letters like a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20199:41"/>
mad man: insinuating that such of the sayd Students as opposed themselues to the Fathers, were not well established in the grace of God when they came to <hi>Rome,</hi> or had no due preparation to the calling of Priesthood, or (we know not what) was amisse in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nay, he spareth not our mother Citie, the seate of Christs Vicar in earth, but impeacheth the credit of it very greatly.</p>
            <p>And for his reports of vs (poore men) that lye in prison, and are subiect to many dangers, being ready to follow our fellowes, who haue offred their liues in the defence of the Catholick Church: how he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the world with our estimation in <hi>Rome,</hi> and what accompt is made of vs there, his sayings following will declare vnto you; set downe as they stand in his sayd letter, dated at <hi>Naples</hi> the 13. of Iuly, in the yeare 1598.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>Rome</hi> (sayth he) I found the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as a field, with two hostile camps within it: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall and his assistants wholy auersed and throughly resolued to leaue the gouernment. And in an other place taking vpon him to shew the causes why our English Students haue of a long time bin so troublesome in that Colledge, he writeth thus: you shall heare him at large.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that it is in great part the nature of the place, that ingendreth high spirits in them that are not well established in Almightie Gods grace. For comming thither very yong, and finding themselues presently placed and prouided for abundantly, and acquainted daily with sights and relations of Popes, Cardinals, and Princes affaires, our youths that were bred vp at home with much more simplicitie, and kept vnder by their Parents and Maisters then the Italian education doth comport, forgetteth easily themselues, and breaketh out to liberty, I meane such
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20199:41"/>
as haue runne astray, and lost respect to their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This opinion of the circumstance of the place is greatly increased by the iudgement of Strangers both <hi>Spanyards, Frenchmen,</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: who affirme, that they try by experience their people that liue in <hi>Rome,</hi> if they be not men of great vertue, do proue more headie afterward and lesse tractable, then others brought vp at home. But yet to this, other men of our Nation do adde a second reason for the English Colledge which is at <hi>Rome,</hi> being a place whereunto many young men do resort: only vpon a desire of seeing nouelties.</p>
            <p>When any come thither of the English Nation, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such a commoditie of study and maintenance there, and themselues in want and misery, they made suite for that, whereunto perhaps they had not true vocation from God, nor due preparation in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to so holy and high estate. And so being once admitted, fell afterwards to disorder, and to put out of ioynt both themselues and others. Thus farre the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the want of grace in some, and of a true calling in others that disagreed with the Iesuites: and how dangerous a matter it is for Parents to send their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Rome,</hi> except they will haue them Iesuites, or at the least to runne their tray terous courses: the very place will marre them.</p>
            <p>But now heare his report of the estimation that our English Students and Priests haue gotten by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Rome:</hi> he shall tell it himselfe. <hi>Baronius</hi> often told me, that our youths bragged much of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but they were <hi>refractary</hi> (that was his word) and had no part of Martyrs spirit, which was in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and obedience. His holynes oftentimes told me, that he was neuer so vexed with any Nation in the world: for on the one side they pretended zeale and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20199:42"/>
pietie, and on the other, shewed the very spirit of the Diuell, in pride, contumacy, and contradiction, &amp;c. And euer now and then his holynes would put his finger to his brayne, signifying that there stoode their sicknes: and so would most of the Court when they talked of <hi>Englesye</hi> were <hi>Indiauoluti,</hi> and like words. His holynes added also that he knew not what reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to take: for on the one side, to punish them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly would be a scandall by reason of the hereticks: and if he should cast them forth of <hi>Rome,</hi> some had told him that they would haue become hereticks &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againe, in his letter to Maister <hi>Bishop,</hi> writing of the report that he the sayd Maister <hi>Bishop</hi> and Maister <hi>Charnock</hi> had made to the Commissary of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition at their being in <hi>Rome:</hi> he sayth thus to Maister <hi>Bishop:</hi> You talked before your restraint heere with the Commissary of the Inquisition, and you gaue him such a relation of our English matters, as afterward when Maister Doctor <hi>Haddock</hi> and Maister Doctor <hi>Array</hi> had talked with him also, and informed him (as they thought) of the very truths of matters, he told an Honorable man in <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great friend of mine, that foure English Priests hauing talked with him, they had taken from him all list to beleeue any English men or matters more, they told him so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tales, and yet all of them would seeme to be men of zeale. And againe, thus he writeth in the other let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I haue heard his holynes often, and diuers Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals more often, repeate with exceeding dishonor to our Nation, the headynes and obstinacie of our youths: so as now many great and wise men begin to suspect, that the sufferings of our blessed Martyrs and Confessors in <hi>England</hi> was not so much for vertue and loue to Gods cause, as of a certaine choler and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate will to contradict the Magistrate there.</p>
            <p>What thinke you Sir ofthese reports by <hi>Parsons?</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:20199:42"/>
In what case are we poore Priests? The chiefe cause of our affliction is our defending of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therein his holynes authoritie. And thinke they no better of vs for it? If this do come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our aduersaries, what aduantage will they make of it? Wo worth that Iesuiticall broode, that to mayntaine their ambition, haue wrought vs this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit. We haue bin in better reputation with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, and so we hope to be agayne, when this <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian</hi> companion shall reape the shante himselfe of this report. For it is not possible, if euer his holynes will be pleased to be informed of him, but that he will reward him with ignominy, as he hath deserued.</p>
            <p>You know our estates at home, and you haue heard what estimation both we and all our Nation haue at <hi>Rome,</hi> if <hi>Parsons</hi> write truly, as we trust he doth not. Our chiefest hope must therefore be in her Maiesties goodnes and mercie towards vs, to graunt vnto vs, if it be possible the libertie of our consciences. But herein obserue this viperous Iesuite. At the league of peace betweene the French and the Spanish Kings, there was a rumor that the Queene would enter into that league, and so graunt a toleration of religion: which <hi>Parsons</hi> did vtterly dislike; saying, that either they would haue all or none; they will admit of no conditions. And his reason is this: because (sayth he) a toleration would make the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> dull, and without spirit. It is indeede quicknes that this Father desireth, but such a quicknes, as deserueth a quick dispatch at the Gallowes. We trust he shall neuer draw our Catholicks heere to any such quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but that after our dull manner we shall for euer continue her Maiesties most faithfull subiects: and with such quicknes as becommeth vs, oppose our selues to his restles, quick, and bloudy deseignements against our Countrie. But obserue we pray you that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20199:43"/>
we say: our hope is thus of all English Catholicks, which hope may be subiect to some little doubt, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if his wicked platforme do proceede heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs: that all Catholicks must hereafter depend vpon <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and he vpon <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> vpon <hi>Parsons,</hi> and <hi>Parsons</hi> vpon the Diuell: who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all rebellions, treasons, murthers, disobedience, and all such deseignements as this wicked Iesuite hath hitherto deuised against her Maiestie, her safety, her Crowne, her Kingdome, and her life. So as our conclusion shall be with a branch, which we will alwayes remember as an addition when we say the Letany: <hi>à Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationibus Parsoni, libera nos Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> And thus wee end: desiring God to blesse vs all.</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
