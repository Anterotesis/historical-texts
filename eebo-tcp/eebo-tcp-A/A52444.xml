            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And if to bee an Author of such toyes bee a fault, it is surely doubled to make them too great a businesse. Idlenesse was their mother, which though I pleased my selfe to avoyd by their destroying her in their birth, yet to good judgements they may well bee as ill pleasing, as ill natur'd: If time were mis-spent in them, yet there was not much cast away; for the idle howers of three moneths brought them forth, except some few, the children of little more then my childhood. As they are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47776:4"/>
farre from deserving good opinion, so am I farre from the humour of some so well conceited of such their workes (like Peacocks proud of their feathers) that they are never at an end of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but still with child to utter them: my travell ended with their first birth, and so I hope or with the readers may at the first reading; for if they bee not plaine and easie, it is against my will, which as it wants strength to imitate, so cannot approve the ridling humour lately affected by many, who thinke nothing good that is easie, nor any thing becomming passion that is not exprest with an hyperbole above reason. These tormentors of their owne and their Readers braines I leave to bee admired in their high obscure flight, (while my selfe will bee happy, if I can procure but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar delight to a superficiall reading) they affect to shew more wit then love, and in truth so much, that whilst they commend beyond reason, they shew that either they want reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or their subject to bee commended; like ill ranging Spaniells they spring figures, and ravished with their extravagant fancies, pursue them in long excursions, neglecting their true game and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended affection: Bee the matter, or the discoursers capacitie never so poore and meane, I ever affect a man that maketh right conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. And for my selfe, I would rather bee thought to want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and knowledge, then judgement and good consequence in what I utter. The Poetry of these times abounds in wit, high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, figure, and proportions; thinne, light, and emptie in matter and substance; like fine colored ayery bubbles or Quelque-choses, much o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>entation and little food; conceits, similes, and allegories are good, so the matter bee carried along in them, and not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by them. <hi>Venus</hi> is here drawne by her Doves, not Serpents; and as I professe my selfe to want art in all things, so in matters or love I thinke it may bee best spared, as being an affection meerely naturall, and where Art is seldome comely, but authorised with a native disposition; besides, Verses of love are commonly made for women, whose chiefest beautie consists in being unsophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Art, and are the more pleasing in conversation by possessing a free puritie of unadulterated wit. And as wee often see that those women that have bestowed on themselves the most Art and costly dressing, nay many times that have the best proportion, are not yet the most winning: So in Verses there is to bee exprest a naturall spirit and moving ayre (or accent) more alluring and charming the affection, then others of a farre more rich, faire and curious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. The world in all things is full of Critiques, that are sharpe sighted to reprehend, and will approve nothing but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne rule; (many times out of square) But for my part I hold the same opinion of Verses as of Ayres in Musick, or Houses, that let them bee delightfull and pleasant to the first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with conveniency to the designe, and for the fantasticated rules of Art, Architecture, and proportion, let them observe them that list: and commonly who most affects them, most failes in the generall delightfulnesse and use. Poetry is in truth a kind of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47776:4"/>
the fable of <hi>Orpheus</hi> expressed as much; Musick hath its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems, Pavens, Fantesies, Galliards, Courantoes, Ayres, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Toyes, Cromatiques, &amp;c. And Verses have their Hymmes, Tragedies, Satyres, Heroiques, Sonets, Odes, Songs, Epigrams, Distiques, and Strong lines, which are their Cromatiques, and of themselves may bee excellent in their Art; but long dwelt upon grow harsh and distastefull. The commandements and preceptives are none of the poeticall parts of Scripture. Though I am no part of a Scholar, yet thus much by casuall opening of books I know, that <hi>Horace</hi> in matter of love hates difficulty: and though I beleeve it an imitation of his abrupt and harsh veine in his more serious peeces, that upon the worthinesse of his name and matter, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht many from the formerly used, more open, familiar and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing manner of versifying; yet I finde that even himselfe (howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either naturally or affectedly rugged, except his Lyrick veine) when hee uttereth his judgement, or prescribeth to others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning measured compositions, no man is more frequent in recommendation of a round, current, cleare and gracefull delivery: but what his morall, solid and satyrick matter dispenst with, is in slighter stuffe intolerable: there shall you find the rough hands, but not the voyce and substance; let them rather imitate his best, then his worst. It cannot bee good in limited lines, which are a purposed pause to the voyce, to carry with a counter-time the period of the sense to the body of the next line, much lesse to dismember an innocent word, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry child according to nature, and use, in spelling would put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and words have a naturall ayre, accent, and quantitie, whence to strayne them is to rack both them and the reader: Who will set himselfe to daunce, or his horse to manage, let him seeke to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve good time, ayre, and fashion: no man is fit for all things; whose Genius was borne for prose, let him write prose, rather then affecting Verse to make such unnaturall stuffe, as shall bee good neither. I pity both in my selfe and others to see the best of our matter in one place so extreamly prest, that it is a labour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, and yet in another part of the same peece slight and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous stuffe dilated at large. A Poet should raise light from smoak, not blow that which is light with him to carry but smoak to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">

                     <p>I may be crabbed and rugged, but will never affect to bee so, especially in verses, whose true nature and use is to worke a kind of a Charme upon the mind, even with slightnesse of matter, by the well wrought and exquisite harmony of their Cadence, and sound: There being to be transfused into verse sometimes such a naturall spirit of magnanimity, sometimes such a soft, wanton, and melting aire of passion, that the one shall never faile to affect a generous and heroick mind, nor the other to work a kind of tender and relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting disposition in a sensible and well-natur'd constitution; neither of which shall easily be seene effected from a harsh and rude (though never so witty) an expression: for as in persons, so in Verses; some, let them meane never so lovingly, shall yet by their naturall verjuyce be ever out of the way of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> But in point of obscurity, in some sort to excuse my selfe with others, I feare wee all often unwillingly incurre the errour of it by thinking our meaning as open to others, as to our selves, when indeed the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of our expression are fully supplyed by our owne understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our selves, whilst to others they are lamely contracted and imperfect. Thus much I have been bold to write, not onely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse a poore Mother wit, but somewhat to give a passe upon their strange and uneasie habit, who I doubt not but they will have many a gird at my easie and naturall nakednesse; I meane those lofty dimme shooting Archers, whom I wish to remember, that hee who shootes highest, shootes not ever nearest the marke; and hee that may walke in the light, is to bee suspected for choosing the darke. Now (Madam) I grant that all I can write (especially what these lines containe) is but vanity and a most idle vanity; yet thus farre I will excuse both the writing and the reading, that all the world is little better: wee often condemn vaine pleasures, and remember not that the most things the best of us most seriously doe, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no other end. For God being served and nature sustained, what fruit proceeds from our authority, learning, wealth, policy, and earnest intent to profit, but to satisfie our impulsive affections, which either propound to themselves a felicity whereof they faile in the possession, or seeke to divert by such imployments the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and otherwise obtruding miseries of their condition? which if you please to consider, you will the more excuse many pursuers of lawful and naturall delights, and value those pleasures at the better rate which are most perdurable and communicable.

I must yet bee so much longer, as to crave pardon for my unintended and I feare unpleasant length, it is the vice of writing to bee endlesse; thus hath my enmity to obscurity brought forth tediousnesse, yet not so much, but that all this may bee sooner read, then some one passage of our Night pieces understood: they had need afford pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable stuffe, who utter it at so hard a rate.

Worth of matter and conception supposed, nothing more commends a piece then termes well chosen, proper, lively, and significant, with a free comming on, and as free a close and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. Also a faire, cleare and even thorough carriage with well wrought joints and connexions gives credit to the workman. I love as much a great deale of force and depth couched in one word, as I hate little in many.

Sophistry and figures may appeare fine and witty, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile little upon the best judgements: Reason must convince the intellectuall soule. May I write clearly and strongly, rather then finely and artificially; hence is the difference of elocution, hence of perswasion, the one is light and aery, the other weighty and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; most lovely and commanding is the beauty of a faire ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rich soule fairely mounted, and armed upon well shaped and unanimously received vertue, goodnesse and reason. Verses are then good, when turned to prose they hold a faire and currant sense, and when translated into another language, there is such mastery found in their conception by the advantage of what is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine unto them, that there will bee either more words or lesse conceit and matter. The priviledge they have over common phrase, consists in the warranted becomming ornament of a lofty well ordered spirit, and wantonnesse, such as shall make toyes passe for Jewels, and give to what of it selfe is precious, an acquisite lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre of workmanship beyond what prose can beare, and that in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room; Their voice is more constrained, and consequently more shrill and piercing. Nor is it in writing the least perfection (howsoever it hath found little observation) so to order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract our expressions, that one well adopted word may run into, and govern many of diverse and strong sense) for nothing gives more pleasure and satisfaction to a diligent inquisitive and judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then much matter and conceit compendiously digested with sufficiency of perspicuity. To conclude, lines of a farre fetcht and labour'd fancy with allusions and curiosity, and in similes of little more fruit or consequence, then to ravish the Reader into the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fine <hi>Chamaeleon</hi> colours, and feed him with aire, I approve not so much, as heighth and force of spirit sententiously and weightily exhibited; wit needs not rack it self where matter flowes; embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries become not a rich stuffe; and art is best exprest where it least appeares.</p>

Whither else tend all our studies of comlinesse, of glory, and noble actions of charity and good deeds? Wherein can man so well resemble his great Creator as by worth and goodnesse to win love? what more noble end can any man have to study vertue and perfection, then thereby to win affection and praise, the reward and food of vertue, and tribute of God? Nay, love the essence of God, the good spirit and wings of the soule, the Mother, Child, and finall cause of Beauty, the begetter and maintainer of the world, the life of life: by love the Sunne shines, and the earth brings forth, by love is society and commerce maintained, by love the soule dwels with the body, and God with the soule; by love nature ever works for our preservation, when the body and almost the soule are laid in sleep. Admirable love! without thee life is hatefull, man but a wolfe to man, the world a second Chaos; For thy sake alone, who affectest not a decaying Mansion, I apprehend losse by growing old, yet thus againe am I comforted by thy most divine power, that thou never abandonest the dwelling of goodnesse, and art successively fruitfull over all the good works of nature to the worlds period: so that to the vertuous, where the love of women failes, the love of men begins, and where that by the withering imperfections of age grows cold, (as the aire to a setting Sunne) there, for our supreame and infinite comfort, begin to shine most clearly the beames of that divinest love, (which before were too much intercepted by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities and passions of our younger yeares) to make us therein eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy by that operation of love, and contemplation of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which at the last must be our soules immortall food and joy.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> am not ignorant that who keepes the common road, falls not into the incumbrances incurred by them who search or by or nearer wayes: Writing is a by-path of life, I am yet ingaged to it, but hope shortly to get out, and by the way I give you this Antidote and Rapsody of praecaution and true information concerning the following pieces. The reason why I retaine and expose them with others, is not so much that I esteem them worthy of view or life, as that they were many yeares since Copyed and spread abroad beyond my knowledge then, and are now beyond my power to recall: they are more Chaffe then Corn, fitter to bee ventilated, blown away, and play in the aire, then ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any Market and commerce of wit and censure: they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct, if not incorrigible; yet I consent to leave them, and many other my pieces, such as they are, to represent unto me the difference 'twixt then and now. To attempt to perfect them were to disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate their youth and hasty nature, and fall into the much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted stage [Error] of putting stronger lines, and more conceited and elaborate elegancy into weake mouths and strong passions; then well comporteth with them; let their youth and genuine concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plead their pardon. You shall mistake them if you often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them not rather the off-spring of fancy then passion. But take them at the worst, they have something of reason and serious in them: and the errours of love are not so foule, as the love of errour; nor is it impertinent to perswade love in them who have constrained it in you; and love may bee such, as to become no lesse justifiable then naturall. Love is in truth of divers kinds, ever an Ebullition of the liver: sometimes it is made and forced upon us, sometimes wee weave and foole our selves into it, sometimes it proceeds from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and good nature of gratification. It is generally the child of weaknesse, as well as of idlenesse: witnesse my selfe in my childish youth and Melancholy humour. A vigorous gayety of the heart and mind taken up and busie in other affections and entertainments hardly admits it. It is a sad confinement, a disease like womens longing, where the violent appetite of one object, no better then the rest, gives relish to that alone, whilst a right and undistasted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of every thing in the true kind is the much better and sounder constitution: and as in longing after such or such a morsell, the consideration is carried by the fancy and tast, which have no rule but themselves: or as at Table, the hearty approbation of some one dish is a provocation to others appetites: so in love. And as most Dogs will often strive to get away anothers bone, though otherwise little desired, or when a morsell is offered to bee snatched
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47776:7"/>
from them, grow greedy of that which before they neglected; so in affections; I leave the application. Sometimes as love hath been tearmed a warfare, so is brave Conquest made ambition; too many make it their felicity, and effeminately bend all their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards it; Sometimes it is taken up for a fashion, and to be in fashion is in idle times of no small importance to idle and gallant persons: Sometimes like Coqualuchios and Epidemicall diseases, it may much proceed from the disposition of the Ayre; as in other kind wee may observe of quarrells that they seldome go alone; Our poore volatile ayery affections are strongly wrought upon as well from outward as inward incentives, winds, and Aspects.</p>
                     <p>The first accesse of love is not ever by the eyes, it hath often a strong foundation and preocupation begotten at the eare; when a noble heart takes impression of a well lodged reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eminent in fame, vertue, generalitie of love and applause attending it, there is it already halfe as much subdued as it is ambitious to possesse and subdue: to complete, I acknowledge the approbation of the eye for a requisite concomitant. To draw and quicken, sometimes the saying of the shadow is usefully true, it flies what followes, and pursues what seemes to retire and flie.</p>
                     <p>Whether love bee most naturall betweene differing or sutable complections may as well bee a question, as the old rule of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to consist amongst equalls hath been lately controlled. But as friendships are conceived most firme in such relation and tye, as there may bee a dependency wrought either by a reciprocation of mutuall benefits and advantages, or where at least the good and fortune of the one relies and fastens it selfe upon the other: So if the fantasticall existence of love receive not a fixation from some more solid root and consideration, such as growes either from a rationall and deliberate election, or from such like sympatheticall proportion of mind, vertue and affections; it will bee easily subject to scatter and blow away in the lightnesse of the soyle that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. It is a fantastique and hardly to bee concluded on by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but wee generally see it is specificall, as betweene vipers and other creatures in their kind. And certainly there is a self-love raigning in us, which will not well permit a quick viperine highgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted spirit to fancy one of a dull and flegmatique temper. Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight, is as false as fine; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and opportunities more often beget it: and love, to shew its extravagant power, ordinarily graffs it selfe upon the stock of an unfavourable, prejudiciall and crabbed opinion. As there is great difference betwixt What will you give, and What will you take: so is there in seeking and making love, or being found and made to it. Wise men are said to make more opportunities then they find, but in love it holds the other way. True love is as passive as active, and it is the height of its true art, to moderate it selfe, as to love and bee wise. How blind and unreasonable soever it is supposed (as I have otherwhere said) a fair, kind and sutable object hath much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47776:8"/>
to alledge why it ought to bee loved, and it is a peculiar preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of faith to transcend our reason; you see I affect to write ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obscurely then full and largely (what you stick upon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, may stick the better with you.) I have often pitied to see not onely the most beautifull of creatures, but the fairest and kindest natures most subject to the excesse, and vitious fruite of their love and kindnesse; there is belonging to them a kind of goodnesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well affected in a gratification of others, as the naturall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure respecting onely themselves. It is as happy that divine and humane Lawes have circumscribed us herein, as it is miserable to see how nature by a gallantry of custome hath shaken off her fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, richer girdles and bracelets so farre as to become relapsed into her naked native current common with other creatures, almost drowned in her owne whirlpoole; and neglecting all other lessons of vertue, honour and Religion; men may ordinarily learne from women a strength beyond their ordinary in maintaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above the vanitie and levitie of resenting impression from admiring and affecting eyes; you may attribute it to their honour lying at stake one way, as ours another: but well considered, men as well in honour as fortune prove the greater losers by such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglings; perfection of one may bee imperfection in another.

Nature hath provided teares and showers for a mitigation and dissolution to heate and violence of passion and stormes, and as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is incapable of duration, and reason and judgement with time recollect themselves, teares thinking they have plaid their part give way to full and cleare discourse, and cease in the stronger spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Yet such power and so moving were your lines upon mee; that entertaining my self the most part of the way upon them, not onely every reading but severall clauses raised severall stormes and showers on my heart and cheeks. So see we marble statues weep ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in present sympathy with the weather, or in future presage. And I pray God the future sufferance of that family (whereof by interest of blood I have the honour to make a part) exceed not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense in this inestimable losse. I was by the way like an <hi>Aprill</hi> day, according as the Sun-shine and clouds of your spirit dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mee. Sometimes I suffered in an apprehension, that according to your title of a farewell to the place, you might bee become like others disaffected, and abhorring all relations and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to your griefe, and so to my self: but therein againe you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

and favourably cleared mee. Sometimes I became transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in your lively representations of her worth, and transcendent happinesse of excellencie both in this and the better world: But presently as much dejected and overwhelmed in your patheticall expressions and sense of her losse. But in conclusion I found you like your selfe, as full of obligation as payment, to mee as infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond my merit, as in your owne conceipt short towards her, in what you owe, and her vertue may challenge. My fancy wrought upon returning a farewell to <hi>Lees</hi>: I had cause and matter more then enough, as the breeder and true cause of that which hath been most unhappily translated to this unhappy place: but considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as due restraine mee. As I said, I resolve to deny my fancies their full birth or Trym; I can no sooner entertaine halfe a thought of writing upon her for a subject, but I become opprest with a croud of matter, conceptions, and materiall Ingeniosities, that offer their service, and presse upon mee so importunate, that if I presently give them not a birth they threaten they will neither ever bee found of mee againe, nor that I shall ever finde so good: I seeme care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as never despairing of my fancy where shee is the subject; Nay such is the plentie and treasure of her materialls as scorne the helpe of fancy, and require no more but a reasonable Recorder and Register.

What an Oeconomy besides portion, Alliance, vertue, beautie, and Religion, the other? <hi>Candish</hi> was her name, but most Candid her soule and condition. The enfolded Serpent is her Crest, most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to her excellent discretion and judgement, which was as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as her Dove-like innocency acquisite unto her. Whatsoever in her condition was to bee wished other, was fatally accidentall. Her perfections were all her owne, nor was there any perfection wanting in her, if not of not being her owne enough. It is too unhappy, and frequent an incident to goodnesse to bee too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to others, and not to give themselves their due. Time had not hardned her to endure a hardnesse of time and fortune; if there can be an excesse in goodnesse and charitie it was in her, naturall, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and divine vertues contended in her for precedencie. But as well her death as life witnest her charitie in its true prerogative to outgoe them all. Shee was matched to a field of crosses, shee converted them all to a blessing upon her soule, and would have done upon the family, had not unlucky disease and death preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Shee was an Echo of her mothers name and vertues, and that as full as numerous. I may crave pardon of her soule, and you for writing thus rashly and hastily upon so pretious, so dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and sacred a subject; my study must be to stop and containe my selfe, as others use to worke and labour their braine and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for invention. Shee neither was nor is as other women, death

that was ever gastly and hideous to me in others is to behold in her a piece of sweetnesse and excellence: Her memory and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever represents it (except her sad misfortune and <hi>Catastrophe</hi>) is all perfume, all rapture unto me; Were I not strongly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Religion, I could not forbeare a continued veneration, and addresse unto her as the Saint of my soule. Great griefes indeed are not allowed a tongue, nor can they at first finde one, nor ever a due adaequate and full one: But it were a kind of Sacriledge to rob the world in the due testimony of so divine a worthinesse, and our sorrowes tribute at least in some proportion. This is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable constitution of mortalitie, who will be indolent must be stupid and without affections; if we will love much (vertue or whatsoever) we must be contented to subject our serles to over-flowing sorrow, it never had a fairer, truer or juster occasion. But I will abruptly breake off at this time that sense and prosecution, which shall otherwise neither fade nor expire in me. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with you to whom I began; The first passage of your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though I answer it not in kind, where you mention the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and unproportionable lownesse of one part of my house, that where that noblest of soules left this unsutable and unworthy world, I meane in monument and memory of her to raise, and grace the lower side thereof to such a decoration, as (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can become the occasion) shall not be unworthy of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Piles; And that (for all your farewell) I hope you will often become an eye-witnesse unto.

others there is a kind of odnesse in it, which showes not well, you were ne're the lesse welcome unto mee as were my other friends in your company at our meales, though I saluted you not with my cup; It is to many especially inferiours more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and interruption then gratification, there is meanes sufficient otherwise to expresse our good affections, and I see not but why as well our kissing salutes as that might bee antiquated and left: kissing is a kind and degree of copulation, which should bee and is so observed by the greatest and wisest nations more elective and private. A Lady of wit and qualitie whom you well knew, would never put her selfe to the chance of a Valentine, saying, that shee would never couple her selfe, but by choyce. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and charge of Valentines is not ill left, with many other such costly and idle customes, which by a tacit generall consent wee lay downe as obsolete, onely with God wee grow more cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, except in the Lords Prayer, where I know not why wee are growing to leave out the doxology, though St. <hi>Matthew</hi> the leading Evangelist hath it at large, and so have wee been brought up to it: What may the people conceive of our former stile in Prayers and Religion, if they shall bee occasioned to thinke they have not till now enjoyed so much as the right use of our <hi>Pater noster?</hi> Wee are also in our Creed growne more familiar with <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> hee must now be <hi>Ponce,</hi> and why not as well <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar</hi> Iuly? <hi>Quantulacunque estis, vos ego magna voco.</hi> As I said to some, none of the most obscure of our Ecclesiastiques, who blamed the Puritans for troubling the people with abstruse points and novelties, that there was order enough to bee taken with them, so that themselves upon whom wee have no coertion would let us bee quiet, and that my selfe who had been long learning the hard lesson of Religion and conscience would bee loath to bee set to seek in my older dayes. So can I not but still continue it my prayer, as it is said to have been once used at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, that it will please God to make our temporaltie more spirituall, and spiritualty lesse temporall. God is a Spirit, and decency of worship is all that is required in Christianitie. Abundance of ceremonies were a loade to the Jewes, and the exercise of Religion more by the outward senses then the inward, is too much the way of Rome and a visible object of adoration. The time was when my charitie led mee, to wish Churchmen might agree amongst themselves, and shine to us in their good <note n="*" place="margin">Ill living Preachers like evill Cowes, kick downe the milk they give.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which would (sans Ceremonie) best supply all wants that they finde in our devotion. But now they put me to pray and thinke it no small happinesse that my self may be quiet in the wayes of God; There is a disturbance in all changes though to the better, and often might better bee forborne. You see how prone I am to fall upon the Church, wee cannot travell but a Church will come in our way; are you not affraid it will prove to mee as is written of Christ, that hee is such a stone, that who
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47776:34"/>
falls upon him shall be broken, and whom hee falls upon, it will grinde him to pouder? I have, you know, of late been at some cost with Churches within and without, I had ill fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> I am yet as conformable as any, how long I shall continue so upon further alterations I know not, I love not to bee put to my bearing, I hope I shall not; The abundance of my heart will say something, and I have often fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon some touches of this discourse in the confused peeces which you obliged me to take into your view and consideration. If Church-men will doe things scandalous and unwelcome to us, they must expect to heare something unwelcome to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; I professe to honour nothing more then a good, and abhorre nothing more then a bad Christian amongst them. I have met with some friends who have prest mee to the presse; over-flattering me that it were pitie my conceptions should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish in a private Copy or two, and that I may otherwise be wronged either alive or dead by some false publication: I cannot become perswaded therein, I suspect fame and abhorre vulgar cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I am conscious of my precipitation and Crudities, and will not give the silly and malitious world a priviledge to arraigne me; Besides, our Clergy preside and over-rule Printing, and will disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all that conduceth not to their owne advantage; Be my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions never so good, the Arke must <note n="*" place="margin">Yet divers passages of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment give such high priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the child of faith as come little short of the Priesthood, whether for illumination or powers.</note> not bee touched with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane hands, they will bee p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I thought it too light and licenciously Poeticall for such a subject; I love not excessive Hyberboles, much lesse over bold and prophane expressions. I deceive my self if I give not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament therein beyond the ordinary; though neatnesse, form, beauty and fancy work as sensibly upon me, as upon others; yet have I never willingly complyed farther with them, then as I finde them to comport with conveniency and other good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. I affect to write more reason then conceit. I hope short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy you farther, and refresh my self in your company this winter at <hi>London,</hi> indeavouring to avoid the sadnesse of this place, and the approaching season. What with the sight of my Sons extreamity, lying as I thought (and little lesse it was then) strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with death; and what with the immediate preceding heavy losse of that incomparable Lady in the same my unhappy house, I am confident that since I was a child, so many teares have not been drawn from me. I want comfort and diversion; but I almost despaire to finde them. I have long since lost the best and dearest of my conversations, my fate hath been such, that I have seldome failed to finde distaste and discomfort from whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have most pretiously affected: such conversation as can give me contentment, is so rare, and out of my way to enjoy, that I can little flatter my self therein. You were a witnesse at your last being with mee of a most extravagant and undue distaste cast upon me; God in all my course hath blessed me with a great portion of charity to passe over offences, to construe and hope the best; my discretion may be something questioned in my patience, but I chose the better and more Christian part. If I once become lost, I am hardly recovered; who well considers humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will the better beare it: wee are little better then halfe witted; it is good to be circumspect, but we are not thorough sighted. I would the very texts of Scripture and Aphorisms of State were not too frequently taken by halfs, my writings are but parings and scrapings, (I mean in respect of matter, for I neither skim nor copy others) I dive not to the bottome of my selfe. I had need gather something, as I doe, whilest I write and scatter, for I lose much of my own fancy by the way. I take not time to consider
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47776:35"/>
and digest, I hope you will as hastily read me. Time and the pillow are excellent Counsellors. Sudden resolutions are subject to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and repentance. Serious, deep and iterated ruminations are troublesome chiefly to impatient spirits, and the lighter sort are incompetent and incapable to undergoe them; even the most intent and solid minds shall be often occasioned to say, Had I thought or knowne. Men addicted either to delights or much employment, have neither leisure nor patience to give weighty and implicate deliberations their full and due examinations: how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have I tost a consideration, as I thought, on every side, and in all its aspects, and yet found new and important discovery upon return! Though the <hi>Spaniard</hi> be often a loser in not taking the advantage of present opportunities, yet his constancy and patience in timing, maturing, and pursuing his deliberations and designes makes much for them and their ends; their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodies of Counsels, for severall Kingdomes and affaires, are of great effect: Our late practised peculiarity of delegations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, with a choice respect to the wits, capacities and experience of selected persons and junto's, are greatly to be approved. Trades and professions must of necessity be more exact in such Countries, where as we find it written they are lineally continued. If the Art of Physick were distributed, as to Oculists one part, so other parts and diseases had severall professors, particularly to attend them, their Anatomy and cure, though it savour of the Emperick, it might be much more happy unto us. But what make I then so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie out of my Province? a Justice of Peace, as some will think, is the utmost of my calling: Yes, a Gentleman is a little of every thing, and peaceablenesse in Gods service concernes every man; Mountaines are as well surveyed and judged from below, as vallies from above, and an impartiall by-stander may often see more then the Gamesters. It is more then time that <hi>I</hi> untie your attention from my importunity and trash: it is to me lesse trouble to write as it were without thinking, then to think without writing; possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly an active life like yours would prove more easie and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mee, then either of both; but I must take my self as I am, and as wee see little Birds in their Cages, and Apes and other Creatures force an exercise in their restraint, so, <hi>Si fortuna negat facit indignatio.</hi> I have both envied and emulated a Cat or Dog, in the tranquillity of their spirit: it shall still bee my aime, and I hope to become no more troublesome to you, my self, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this way of writing: But I must stay my time in all things. Farre better then my self, have profest themselves subject to doe the evill which they would not, and not the good they affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As I am informed, you have wished I would bestow some further labour in polishing and better digesting what I have written; but by that time you shall have read mee thorough, <hi>I</hi> hope you will bee otherwise satisfied: and I have, as you may find, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much wit in excusing the naturall deformity of my writings,

No ancient brave Romane was ever more free and prodigall of his blood in the way of honour and his Countreys defence, then our English gluttonous Gallant and Epicure is easily and insensibly parted with his money (another blood to the wise) for fashion and sensuality.

There is I confesse a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, so also of us, therein is our choice and judgement to bee exercised: The company of the best men best at leisure is to be enjoyed and found amongst them; the very best things are often subject to abuse, contain and make a Covenant with your eyes, and take but a preservative of <hi>ne quid nimis</hi> along with you, and you are safe and happy: They are generally better affected to the times, and lesse possest with base and prolling designes then we; Their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with us and over us, proves their wit to bee above ours, finer, clearer, stronger: They are not destitute of Art, but are more friends and instruments of nature, and shee theirs.

Spectators and Censurers of lives and action, exercise a Trade as easie as lazy, Scepticisme, Criticisme, and Satyrism seldome miscarry.

He leaves all favour, ill will, and partiality at the entrance, and considers the good of the King combined with that of his people.

Honour and vertue shall bee his chief aime, nor will he draw a note upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for any thing but tending thereunto. He will by his curtesie make continuall purchase of affection, but especially in his owne house where he can hardly over-act it. Yet towards men of inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent demand and carriage it were but unmannerly to imploy it. Civility is an important piece of Society, especially amongst the better sort, and like other qualities, it is to be exercised with great discretion, and good temper. High and braving spirits unseasoned therewith, would like Cocks and Mastiffes, impatient of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of one anothers eyes, uncollected and unrecalled, assault each other with blowes instead of Salutes. There have been divers books written of the institution of a Prince, of a Courtier, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ridiculous and tedious kinde of complements, which some

Hee will not shew that brutish sensualitie to carry his mind in his belly, nor his soule upon his backe, much lesse let it transmigrate into a horse or dogge. Bookes and women hee will use with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moderation, left they devoure and confound him, nor shall hee make right use of either who beareth not himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them; All these are to bee used for life, and not as if wee lived onely for them. Hee will educate his sonne to be like himselfe, and not infuse Grammar and Philosophie into him in such sort as if nothing else concerned him and his well-being. And therefore hee will bring him up to the true understanding of honour and true reputation, and make him no stranger to the managing of a house and fortune which as much importeth him; and the strangenesse whereof to young mindes wholly ingaged to other studies and delights, is one of the greatest causes of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ruins to private fortunes. What is most comely and right shall bee his study, and to discerne of truth and right requires a fulnesse as well of acquisite as naturall furniture. Judgement of comelinesse comes the more easily upon common observation. That becomes us best which is most our owne, most proper and proportionable to the circumstances of our fortune and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is over incident to many to trouble themselves, incurre contempt, and ruine their estates by an erroneous affectation of greater expense, curiositie, and bravery, then would bee expected from them: such breed and feed the Canker that consumes them. What is observed and approved by the best, most sober, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, and neither to leade nor contemne to follow the fashion is the best rule: to be outwardly too different is monstrous, to be affected and curious, light and ridiculous.

Nay, it is ordinarily seene, that even the brute beasts themselves in their courses doe lesse digresse from such reason as concerneth them, then many an inordinate and wilfull man. His course and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour shall bee ever constant, equable, and correspondent to his fairest ends and pretences, as flowing from the same foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, all of a tenure, all of a peece, avoyding that just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension which falls often upon none of the least eminent, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in publick, other in private; now brave and generous, and presently unworthy and sordid; unweaving their owne web, and unadvisedly clothing themselves in such motley as they would otherwise disdaine to put on.

and most pernicious to himselfe and others. All disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of an affected humour detract from him in the censure of the most judicious. Wherefore hee will decline them, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his cloathing, for it argues too great levitie to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein, and too poore a diffidence of his proper worth to seeke esteeme and valuation from it. I will little esteeme the respect of man or woman who shall respect outward more then inward bravery, or rich apparell more then a rich mind, though both doe well with women, the best of them are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with showes. He will not easily upon argument enter into passion, which but argues his owne doubt and weakenesse, for a cleare understanding will pitie or endeavour to rectifie, but not bee troubled at others ignorance; and calmenesse maintained with a friend is better then to prevaile in the cavills of dispute. He will examine his owne sufficiencie and goodnesse by the best Authors, and the wisest and best men, and approve of himselfe onely so farre as hee proveth conformable unto them, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe fit to doe service to God, his King or Country, hee will put off all restinesse and floath, and set himselfe forward to the imployment of his best industrie and abilities for the common good, yet ever so that hee regard due opportunitie, and modesty, and make use of meanes just and honorable towards his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and imployment: for though audacitie prevaile often upon others weakenesse, yet it is more secure from disgrace to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest and considerate, then overbold and presumptuous; nor will preferment unduely attained bee valued and respected by mindes truely worthy and noble. There are amongst us a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous kind of gallants who conceive it great bravery to looke big and contemptuously especially upon strangers, towards whom in truth a formalitie and curtesie of fashion is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite; and many women are not free from taxe, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have neither freedome nor civilitie in store but for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they thinke to endeare and set themselves off by such car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, though often voyd of other worth; wee become accessary to their rudenesse by terming it rather pride then rusticitie, which it truely is: They are proud to be thought proud, but should be taught better manners by a just and out doing scorne and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; we nourish it in them by sinking under it, and blame what wee breed, as wee doe Children whom we first teach to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorish by giving them what they otherwise had not affected.

Though it bee true that there is nothing whereon worthily to fix our affections in this world, nor valuable to the fleeting and uncertaine life of man, yet hee will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

And howsoever wealth, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of title, and the chiefe honours of the Kingdome where hee moves, are not more due to any then to himselfe, yet hee will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve such a slow and graduall accesse unto them, that his investing himselfe therewith shall rather appeare an unaffected or unlooked for favour of his Master, or a seisin and livery after a due purchase made by his vertue and merit, then a sudden, affected, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable elevation; which will so bee his advantage as it is seene in nature, that high objects, bee they never so loftie, doe not yet appeare so much to the eye, as such as are much inferiour and of a suddain ascent. Hee will recommend to the favour of his Master, and cherish such as are vertuous or excell in any commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable perfections, and such onely himselfe will bee noted to have about him. For wee ordinarily conster great men by such as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their company and good affection, and according as they shall entertaine the good advise, at least the persons of such neere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, their ends may be calculated.

                     <p>A Divine is Gods ordinary Ambassadour residing with us, not to exercise the pompe and state of one, nor to represent Gods Majesty and glory, but to use the order, care, vigilance and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of an Ambassador, by being a faithfull Minister in his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and charge. Though he be termed <hi>Theologus,</hi> he will be <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus,</hi> a zealous lover, as well as a verball Preacher of God; and he may be defined with a good Oratour, <hi>Vir bonus dicendi peritus</hi>: for if he preach not first to himself, and that his life be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his exhortations, his one day Sermon in a week wanting true life and spirit will not so much animate his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to holinesse, as will his six dayes example (the Book that the people better understand) lead them to dissolution and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. God hath required that he be not outwardly, much lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly imperfect and deformed, and it is he who must make ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue visible, and the visibility that will inflame our affection. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall in others is error, in him a monster, no corruption being so bad as what proceeds from the best. He cannot be fit for the charge of others Soules who is carelesse of his own; and who will beget affection in others, must first put it on himselfe. Wee would hisse him from the Stage, whose action were grossely dissonant from his words and part; nor is he better then a cheater of God and the World, who accepts of a spirituall living, without performing the duties of the Spirit. It is questionable whether an evill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister be not inferiour to the holinesse of his Bels, and much more miserable, for he is like them in calling men to Religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, in sounding to please their eares, and in flattering, and solemnizing the times; but questioned upon a due accompt, in this world, or the next, hee will finde himselfe much more unhappy. But a truly Religious professor will abhorre the indecorum of being unsuitable to his Doctrine, fearing lest thereby as much as in him lyeth, he render both it and himself so seeming unprofitable, that men if it were possible would become distasted of his calling, and Religion it self. He will rather shew himself Gods Minister in godlinesse and humility, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Chaplaine in his first sin and impiety; and therefore casting off all pride, vanity, ambition, covetousnesse, and the corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men; he will conform himself to the purity and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Primitive Church, and become as awfull to wicked men in his presence, as a Magistrate or Commissioner of God, sent to take vengeance on their obliquities. Hee will Preach God in sincere Devotion, and not himself in vain affection, and will seek the advancement of Religion, more then of his own order and Hierarchy; for it is the splendor of the good and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47776:51"/>
sincere lives of the Clergy, and not their pompe and state that must work upon our consciences. He will be an obedient Child unto his Mother Church, for she cannot think him worthy to live upon and serve at the Altar, if he shall think unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it to be observed by him. He will feed his flock more with plain and sound Doctrine, then with abstruse points of Divinity, and janglings of controversies, or the empty sound of language and conceipts, (which become not the gravity of the Pulpit) and will value the peace of the Church, before any particular conceited fancy of his own or others. Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and niceties, he will confine to the Schooles and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his own profession: The mysteries of Religion once received, being rather matter for faith, then to be controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and disputed, especially among the vulgar, who in no sort ought to be taught or acquainted to subject the transcendency of their Religion to the grossenesse of their reason. He will not, if he preach before the King, ingratiate himself by an invective incensing him against his People, much lesse in a popular As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly be Satyricall against Magistrates, but will better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty by instructing such as are present in theirs, and forbeare his Castigation upon the absent. He will be cautious of alledging in the Pulpit out of whatsoever Author, their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bold and profane conceits of Religion, as also of using (especially insisting upon) the plain and naked expressions which are found in the Scriptures concerning women: for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Bible becommeth not the Pulpit, and there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of leaving ill impressions in corrupt minds. He will use his best judgement in tempering his Sermons to the best profit and health of our soules: And considering it is naturall for the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and pleasantest things to be the most nourishing, he will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly season and order them, as well to the good relish of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as helpe of memory: and remembring that the yoake of the Gospel is easie, consisting of comfort and glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and that a tender and wounded soule hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leisure to heale with the continuall application of Cauteries and Corrosives; he will feare to bruise the broken reed, and beget more discomfort and despaire then faith and true consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the best and most attentive soules. Briefly it is only such a good man that deserves preferment, but he will rather goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, then to buy it corruptly, with the price of his Soule. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no miracles from him, nor can he expect good life, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from us, except according to his profession, he shew us the way.

He will be sorry, that by a surprize of his over-deeming election, he findes himself imbarqued in a profession, where it is hard to thrive and be honest, in giving Physick only where there is reall need, and a good confidence in himself, that it shall doe good to his Patient; for he will have discovered that his title is but as of a Mountaine from not moving, and that nature is the true Physitian placed by God in every man for his preservation, and himself but a Professor of a most conjecturall Art: so that who commits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from nature to him, takes himself from a seeing to a blind guide. Though it be incident to his Colledge to be over peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as being used to the authority of prescriptions, and prostrate sick Patients, yet he will avoid it; for a discreet, plausible, and winning carriage upon the Patients good opinion and affection is the one halfe of the Cure. He will not contemn an honest Emperick, knowing that his own Art grew but from experience often casuall, and that Gods blessings are not restrained to their Colledge and old Books. He will not bee sparing of his interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, nor of his attention to his Patients relation, who being sick, and paying, ought to bee born with and humoured; But an humorous Physitian is a most intolerable disease, for all is but too little to effect a true information, and to doe well, he will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten suspect, that the disease may grow from the minde. In case of which discovery he will no lesse industriously indeavour the Cure of the body by it, and his good precepts and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoroughly urged to that purpose, then by any other means, it being often the onely way of Cure, but nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily neglected by such as only affect to say something to draw a Fee, but wil be sure not to trouble their own mindes to cure their Patients: But from such God deliver me, who will as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle admit them to the tryall of my disease and constitution, as the Law doth a Butcher to be a Juror. Purging Medicines shall bee his last refuge, after prescription of convenient exercise, order, and dyet, which by some of the best are affirmed to bee sufficient to cure any disease curable. Hee will affect chearefulnesse of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

and fashion, for it is a Cordiall to the sick, but he will take heed of an unseasonable merriment, which is often as absurd as unwelcome to the seriousnesse of a sick man. A thousand things have been, and might be said to his instruction, for no art more requires it, but this in summe shall serve my turn, who mean only to say something of a good, but not to work a cure upou a bad Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian. I conclude that Physick had need have a God as well to the practice, as to the invention of it, for errors are so grosse, and ordinary diseases and symptomes so complicate, Indications so crosse, nature and constitutions so diversly affected in Crisis and evacuation, nor doth she ever powerfully shew her self, till she be put to it for life; Purging and blood-letting, prove so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily diverters, impediments and weakners, in stead of helpers to nature, and seeing by a mistaking we call those our diseases, which are in truth the working of nature towards our cure, and the discharge of her self, as in fits of Agues, Collicks, the Stone, and the like; for my part, I chuse rather with <hi>David,</hi> to put my self into the hands of God then man, whose endeavours of cure and errors make us ordinarily more misreable then our disease it self. I end to my good Doctor, with that Counsell of the Scripture, whereupon it is to bee hoped that hee will guide his practice, namely, that hee and his Art are to bee employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on necessity, which I think to be (for the sense is ambiguous) in such Cases where nature and dyet have ever appeared defective to work a Cure, and that his art upon infallibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He will make his Science compatible with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and so runne her course, that at the length he may bee thought a fit Judge to preside her high Court of Chancery. Hee will have a greater feeling of the cause and interest of his Client then of his Fee, and entertaining the defence of it for just, will affect more the gaining of it to him, then to himself reputation. His carriage shall not bee onely perfunctory, neither in the taking notice, nor in the pleading of the Cause, but hee will both search and pleade it home without tendernesse either of his paines, or of the Judge his displeasure. Hee
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47776:53"/>
will not so much frame his practise to corru t custome as to honesty, nor beare his eyes on the papers of his present Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and his mind on the Fee that presseth at his Closet doore. Hee will esteeme his taking no better then theft, without the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of deserving, and of himself worse then of a theese if his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent relying upon him hee appeare not in his defence, yet goe away with his money. Wherefore hee will entertaine no other causes then hee can honestly goe through, nor take Fees without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to discharge his dutie for them. Though the Law bee an imperious Lady and unsociable, yet hee will endeavour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her with the study of other literature, whereby to breed her better respect and his owne prevalence: and indeed the study being somewhat dry and dull requires other learning, wherewith to lard and grace it. Hee will rather fast from Imployment then become patron of an unjust cause, especially without having first delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Client his opinion of the nature thereof, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the successe. Hee will not make a jest of his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as some of them doe) affirming their practise a pretty tricke to get money, a contention of wits and purses, a politick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime to entertaine busie braines, an a duell where the greatest stroakes are given underhand; but will so defend right and Justice, as hee would wish to be defended by them in his best titles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</p>

                     <head>A Souldier.</head>
                     <p>TO bee a good Souldier and Commander hee must know well how to obey: and command himselfe. Hee must temper his judgement with courage, and valour with discretion, he will not bee greedy of other imployment then such whose issue is likely to breed his honour: and though he owe obedience to his King or superiour, yet if any such execution shall be imposed upon him as appeares not feazable unto him, he will first discharge his duty in discovering the improbability, but being pressed by their authority will undergo the charge with all alacritie and forwardnesse. Hee is constituted a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of vice and disorder in others, and therefore must in no sort admit them in himselfe, especially that of drinking which is too or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily incident to his profession; for if it were possible, hee should bee more then a man, but that makes him lesse, and it is to bee admired how such as professe and are generally in love with honour and reputation so farre as they will venture their lives upon small puntilio's to the maintayning thereof can consent to overwhelme themselves with such a vice as drawes an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing contempt and scorne upon them, even from the meanest
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47776:53"/>
sort of people. Though it bee most unfit for a good Commander to bee prodigall of his owne life or his Souldiers upon an undue hazard, yet their condition being such as to have sold themselves to mortall adventure, hee will bee ambitious of nothing more then to meet with a faire occasion of dying in the bed of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and who feareth death will never bee fitting for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and therefore will maintaine himselfe prepared for it. Hee must in the exercise of his calling bee an enemy to sloth and idlenesse, and keepe them from creeping upon him as hee would doe his blade from rust. A continuall vigilance must bee the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell of safetie to himselfe and the Troopes under him: his taking notice of well deservers, his good example, and faire promises will animate his Souldiers, and he will ever prove himselfe just of his word, both to them and the enemy: for if he often deceive and forfeit the trust and confidence that ought to be reposed therein, he must impute others diffidence to his owne fault, and will finde it a perpetuall prejudice unto him. He will make it a principall care to well discipline his men before hee bring them into service; for that makes the difference between a rable of Clownes and Souldiers, and what can be expected from such as are strangers to good order, and the use of their Armes? He will assist himselfe with good Commanders and officers, for what is it else if their men bee <hi>Bisonians</hi> then for the blind to lead the blind? It concernes him to know all things necessary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and to make sure that they bee fully supplyed; for as the greatest honour in good successe, so the greatest blame on the contrary will fall upon him that commands in chiefe. As want of courage will bee one of the greatest imputations unto him, so a sordid avarice and parsimony would bee none of the least; for there is nothing more unanswerable to a publike exercise of an Honorable profession, nor nothing more deprives a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that affection and esteeme which are most condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible unto him in all his actions and exploits. But the warre is an Art by it selfe, Commands in warre are of severall natures, occasions infinitely vary, and they require a well experienced pen; wherefore, though I have said something to answer a request, yet I forbeare to proceed further, for I know it misbecomes mee: and in truth were my abilities the greatest that ever any man pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, yet I finde the world so full of writing, and so little effect from it, every man flattering himselfe upon his owne braine, and partially carried away with the undivertible torrent of nature, which suffers nothing to appeare good unto him but what is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to it selfe, that they must either bee more in love then I am with the exhibiting the unsatisfactory fruite of their conceits, and better natur'd in bestowing much labour to little purpose, or else they will (as my selfe intend) finde out a more healthfull pastime for idle houres.</p>

                     <p>GOOD God! what, and where is the good use of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> just men have the Character of thee and thy goodnesse, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in their hearts, whose vertue alone produceth reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, and charitie to their neighbour, the Sum of Religion: but they are few, the wicked abound and prevaile, such as make a Stalking horse of thy word, and a scorne of such as make vertue and pietie their direction. Good men are a prey unto them, and they sacrifice to their owne nets, falshood is their levell, private advantage their marke, and like the Fowler they applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their deceitfulnesse. They prosper in their evill and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Arts whilst uprightnesse is an unthrift. How little wit there goes to the wayes and language of infidelitie? and how little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to the exercise of truth? Shall I therefore abandon the good lessons of my soule and habit of vertue? smother that fire of grace and charitie which hath enlightned and warmed my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Shall I in a base applause of the prosperitie of such perverse spirits, like unto them sell my selfe to worke iniquitie, and esteeme the practise of Religion a Melancholy superstition, Hell but a scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow, and vertue a politique fancy? No, I humbly thanke God I consist of a metall and stampe more refined and divine. The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-hearted man cannot more delight in his craft and cunning gaine, then I joy in my simplicitie and truth; nor can hee more deride my integritie, then I scorne and detest his false turpitude and impietie. Let him esteeme of wit and discourse as an engine bestowed upon him to advantage himselfe as well over the more innocent sort of men, as over other creatures; concentrate his goodnesse within himselfe; become his owne idoll, a voluptuous and barbarous beast of rapine and prey; emancipate himselfe from all Lawes, civill, morall, and divine; shake off the bridles of fame and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or elude them by Hypocrisie; whilst I acknowledge my great Creator the author of all benefits and goodnesse (as I doe the devill of all falshood and uncharitablenesse) whilst I rest infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the heavenly love of that blessed fountaine of joy and beneficence, and for his sake love the affections of charitie and goodnesse, and extend their value where I find them, as I prove them more or lesse extensive and communicable in their Subject &amp; activitie. Let the ignoble minded man conclude knavery for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, sordid gaine a discreet policie, and if he will, let him account cowardise a warinesse for self-preservation, and valour a foolish prodigality of life: I am no such wittall.

                     <head>An Essay concerning Musick.</head>
                     <p>LEt him that tafts not Musick beware of the Tarantula's sting, which is cured by an affectation of some Geniall point therein. And surely hee is so farre from a perfect quintessentiall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, that I doubt whether in such minds some undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested lump of the Chaos bee not yet predominant. It is to me an Argument of a soule well in tune, to bee understandingly affected therewith, nor is any one affectation more likely to be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a detestation of such vices as discord with the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and received vertue. For a disposition once habituated in a delight of harmonious proportion, must consequently distast such uncomely dissonance. If earth afford any resemblance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable joyes of heaven, it is not improbable to be in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick. For I cannot name an earthly delight, where the mind is so disjoyned from grosse and terrene objects, nor so sublimed (as it were) to an upward center, which surely is God, the Center of the heavens and heavenly-spirits. No small testimony thereof is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47776:55"/>
exhibited in divine service, where Musick hath been ever thought fit to elate and prepare the mind to celestiall contemplations. But whatsoever it is to divinitie it hath ever beene a child of the most civill nations and times, and they that like it not, are in that point Brothers to the Savages. It hath beene blamed to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and over-soften mens minds, which whence it is gathered, my selfe could never conceive, except in that substraction which it makes from inhumane, barbarous, and uncivill inclinations. For it certainly heates, cleareth, sharpneth and erecteth the spirits, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them dance in the veines, with such disposition of activitie, as when the Musick ceaseth the heat thereof yet remaines, not much unlike that of wine, in a Dutchman, which Alarums him to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fight, though hee know not with what. Allow it to heate, and you can hardly make it seeme to quench courage, whereunto heate is even the forme. <hi>Alexander</hi> might bee a proofe, or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall sorts of Musick, whereof some definitively exempt it from that Tax. But Musitians are knowne generally fantasticall and light. This indeed is a fault, but in the Musitians, not in the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which doubtlesse is often lodged in most judicious and grave spirits: Of <hi>David</hi> you will not deny it. Nor is it verely more to bee accused, then the best wine, for infatuating weake braines. Divine Inspirations have beene generally seene accompanied with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportation of the weaker spirit that received them. They who least love it must at least allow it to bee a pleasing dreame, and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pastime, wherein if the body and spirits receive no nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may be yet after other defatigations be delightfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained without wast or expence, in freshnesse and alacritie, for the embracing imployment in either. It is commonly as of women, the worst are to bee had for money, and often the pleasure scarce worth the tuning. The haters of it thinke it but a noise, who are the more brutish, being uncapable of beautie, whereto the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall with the instrumentall part is requisite. The Scripture hath assigned a great property and delight hereof to the time of banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for it is indeed a kind of banquet, and like wine, a moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof pleaseth, recreates, and is allowed to the most austere; but long set at, and made too frequent, destroyes both the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers relish and good esteeme. Nor are all banquets (no more then Musick) ordained for merry humors, some being used even at Funeralls.</p>

Thou under God art the giver and preserver of health and riches, rules of health and thrift are little acknowledged but upon infirmitie and sufferance; Nature makes us passionate, but thou compassionate. A man that knowes the bearing of his beast will not overload him; had I enjoyed thee I had enjoyed my selfe, I had made thee and nature my Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they pretend to be her props and helpers, but they rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and ruine her; they are her Apes, her Zanyes, deformed and mischievous; inexperience, impatience, lazinesse, opinion, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome maintaine their credit, and make us their Patients; the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish proverbe is a good one, that God cures the disease and the Physitian takes the money.

had made thorough triall at home; the Art is uncertaine, but their ordinary ignorance and carelesnesse makes it worse; if they did not love our money better then our health, they would not neglect their ancient breakfast. By exercise and agitation to stirre up na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat to worke digestion and expulsion is Physick farre beyond them. As <hi>Archimedes</hi> said, that if hee had other ground to place an Instrument hee could remove the earth: so could I as well and safely worke upon the parts within the Ribs as below, I would not doubt to doe wonders in cure, and without it there may be so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The very thought and consideration what Physick and Phyfitians to use, is alone a disease, <hi>à nocentibus &amp; juvantibus</hi>: observation of what helpes and hurts, with the ordinary benefit and communication of others expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience upon free cost, is Physick often more then enough: for as truth is said to bee often lost by much altercation, so health by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too superstitiously sollicitous. A medicinall life is a miserable life, I desire as much not to live as to live by Physick, and when nature is so weake that it cannot beare or worke out a little disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, let her take her course, it is at the worst but giving over a game that must be lost, and going to bed a little before the houre. There may be meanes to temper the blood without drawing it, and many make fasting their cure against repletion: diseases of Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more difficult, yet they may have and find their restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives without a Doctor. As exercise is the best Physitian, so is rest the best restorer; my complexion is active, and I have suffered much in want of sutable employment: waters corrupt, and Iron gathers rust, and the Moth is bred by want of use and stirring: yet motion without moderation and a proper subject is often pernicious, as to milstones, which grind out themselves for want of Grist, and the best metall weares out with much whetting. A discreet ordering and alternation of motion and rest is a great preservative; Nature hath instructed other creatures in their strength, and the use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beyond what we finde for ours, in our Arts and practise. Their undefaced instinct outgoes our outfacing inventions and conceits; Beasts have much of man in them, and man too much of (nay of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worse then) the Beasts. It hath beene observed that most men have in their aspect a resemblance of some Beast or Bird; confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of soule depends much upon the conformation of the bodily parts, complexions are not so various as soules; crueltie and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are invincible in some, ignorance in others, choler in some, flegme and melancholy in others: I may bee incorrigibly melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, but it is not of the Asinine kind.

                     <p>SInce I writ the preceding piece, it hath fallen out to my extreme sorrow and affliction, that one of the fairest, most noble and vertuous of Ladies, is dead in my unhappy house under the hands of the Physitians. Shee was such, that as it was said of one (none of the best) of our Princes, that if vices had been lost in the world

they might have been recovered and found in him; much more truely may it bee affirmed of her for all such vertues as either ever were or can bee Ornaments and bring a valuation to her Sex. As shee neither loved nor needed flattery, so was her worth so farre beyond it, that what had beene such to the best of others, applyed to her was but lame abatement and defalcation; not onely they who knew her with any happy interest and relation, but the very frame of vertue and the world that wants it suffer in her losse; it hath been long sicke of a consumption of vertue. Shee was of so sweet, so winning, so powerfull example, so serene and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate an Ayre, that vice and venome were never so maligne, and contagious, as her admirable vertue and goodnesse would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cordiall and restorative to the worlds recovery; But shee who was in a way of being the worlds. Physitian, is lost under the hand of Physick; her memory is not more happy in her deservings, then her losse sad and indigestible; yet let us, as there is just cause, feele it to the quick, to the heighth, there is a kind of sweetnesse to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the death, but more in the memory of her sweetnesse, let that ever flourish, never die in those that had the happinesse to know her, let us continue our selves a kind of sacrifice unto her, as well dead as alive; As wee water her memory with our teares, let us keepe it alive with our breath, and still serve her in loving and serving whatsoever and whosoever hath relation unto her; her worth and contemplation are infinite, I should never finde a way to leave so full, so pathetique a subject, but by breaking off to fall upon her Physitians; Shee is an object so excelling as confounds and oppresseth mee, I would you could like mee as much as I love my selfe better for such confusion, I hope I shall be clearer sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my doctors, I would for the sakes of the credulous that they could see as well into diseases and constitutions as I see into them and their common course and practise; I would there were not as much mischiefe and murder as vanitie and blindnesse in their sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and profession; the <hi>Aruspices</hi> were not more fraught with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture and delusion: they applaud themselves and may justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride us, they must get and live though we lose and die for it, they must bee still the same or nothing; but shall the world and we grow still older, never wiser? The better sort should be the wisest, shall wee still turne our wealth to our bane in feeding and feeing them to starve, destroy and make us miserable? shall wee never resent what hath beene long time said, how there is more danger of the Physitian then of the disease? doe we not daily see the poorer people fall sick and recover, whilst the richer make themselves a sacrifice to the Physitians Art and tyranny?</p>

the one to the other; Is any man who hath experience of their proceedings ignorant of the almost infallible fallibilitie of their Art and conjectures? I have found it so frequent, that excepting some few symptomes of death, which they get by being about those whom they kill, I might almost (as in Kalender predictions and Prognosticks) take more truely the contrary of whatsoever they affirme. I have often paid for their counsell and assistance, when my owne judgement and confidence hath proved farre truer then their threatnings, and my feares, then their hopes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. They may bee ashamed to bee so insolent and peremptory, finding their errors and acknowledging their Art to bee so conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturall as they doe. What is more ordinary then for nature in such a disease and such a body to affect her discharge downeward when their operation is upward, and so contrary, shee to incline to a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall sweat when they in stead of our disease draw out our best Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with our our blood, and so forth; what a distraction, what an oppression, what a disturbance and disease doth poore nature our sure and seeing Physitian suffer from them? False friends, true ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they are unto us; It hath been no ill Dilemma framed in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures behalfe, that either shee is too strong for the disease, or it for her: in the first shee ever prevailes, if the Doctor doe not hinder; in the last, have wee not howerly experience of the Physitian cal'd in time, the Patient young and strong, the disease common and knowne, and yet death ensues? where is the saving, where the benefit, where the advantage that their Art and they pretend? even in their owne purses impassible incompassionate as they are. How many have they antiently destroyed by cruell denying coole drinke in burning fits, conspiring with the fire and malignitie of the sicknesse, to possesse the spirits and vitall parts which might thereby have beene prevented, intercepted, allayed, and temper'd? They pretend to starve the disease when they starve the Patient; How is it possible for nature to worke for her owne sustentation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by medicine or otherwise, when you allow her not the least supply? It were a miracle for her to subsist, weakned by malady, by blood-letting, by purges, and by substraction of nourishment, shee is wiser then our Art and discourse, and will refuse meate and drinke when shee cannot beare them, and hold in, her treasure of bloud many times in spite of the Chirurgion, and give convenient effusion of blood without the Physitian. If sometimes shee erre in her demands it is by accident, and that lesse dangerous to satisfie then the Horseleech Doctor. Experience hath taught them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne method, that to give way to the violent appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Patients is ordinarily successefull contrary to rules; nature never requires any thing but is respectively and in some sort good and fit for her, howsoever otherwise bad, where the Doctor runnes a course simply and absolutely destructive. We are all borne with a Physitian in our belly, <hi>Adam</hi> had no other, if God
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47776:59"/>
had judged them as necessary helpes as a woman, he would also have created one for him. I have otherwhere with much lesse cause discoursed of this subject; their Impatient I justly am, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient I will never be, I hold my life by Gods mercy, and desire no longer to enjoy it then he shall please to give it, and maintaine it in mee, without becomming their Tenant. They who will give themselves up to their conceited usurped authoritie, <hi>Stultos jubeo esse libenter,</hi> let them live as miserably, according to the saying, as medicinally. It hath been observed of some Countries that sicknesse and complaint in that kind were never frequent amongst them till the profession of Physick brought it: wee are gulled with their golden promises of health, as <hi>Alchymists</hi> abuse many with the hopes of the Philosophers stone, whereby like <hi>Aesops</hi> Dog they lose the substance for the shadow, true gold for false hope, and health and life by revolting from nature and relying upon false imposterous pretences.

Presse and observe them neerely, and you shall not faile of matter enough from them to aliene as well your affections as good opinion of their science: I too lately had occasion to heare one of them discoursing of giving his Patient a sweat, disallow of forced and unnaturall sweats as ineffectuall,

                     <p>MY perverse fortune from my youth, with my melancholy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, (fruitfull in nothing but thoughts, and those not ever the most necessary or naturall:) have often occasioned me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon my self, to write something, not so much to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize (for alas, it is vaine where there might have bin prevention) as to give some ease to my self, and extenuation in what I may mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeare to the world; but I have often bin diverted from such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, by the overgrown wildernesse, which long time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion have brought upon me. Yet thus much let me say for my self, (and wonder at my selfe in that I may truely say so,) that neither carelesnes, prodigality, nor an humor disposed to riot or luxury, have bred my harme. Nay, (if there be any truth in me) nothing hath more procured it, then a misguided sobriety of diet, with such an inordinate care for the ordering of my fortune in my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, finding my self pent and ingaged to wife and children, as (whatsoever may bee conceived I dare affirme) no man of riper yeares and judgement, but might have falne into, and will, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it shall please God to entangle him in divers and strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, inward and outward, which in the circumstances of my condition so malignly concurred, that being something by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more by accident, mis-diet, over apprehension and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse, disposed to a strong melancholy, it was impossible to extricate my self, without such an aggravation as rendred it incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and me most miserable, in the Shipwrack of all joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Wherein finding my self thus plunged, one while my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge was to the helplesse Physitian, and another at last to strong di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions; such as <note n="*" place="margin">I chose to entertaine my mind to build in dividing my <hi>London</hi> house where (in al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents) there would be least losse, and then lived many years in the lesser part.</note> building, Court, company, travaile, and the like, which all proved but such miserable helpers as melancholy men use to finde, full of expence, which till then, (about my age of 25. from 18. when I was married) I had avoided.

It is questionable whether I did more hurt my self with my thoughts, (which many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether long since, brought me often, even to an utter exhaustion) or whether with Gods assistance, in a strong constitution of body and minde, (for had not God furnished me with as strong and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent supply of extrications as intrications, I must often have perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) I more extraordinarily relieved and supported my self to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist against the impetuous <note n="*" place="margin">I meane not a curiosity of ostentation or daintinesse, for such never possessed mee: but only of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and rectitude.</note> curiosity of my disease and nature; but my unhappinesse hath also bin such, as in criticall times of my life, to have met with such unluckie crosses and connexions of fate, to put me out of my course, that the consideration thereof would make any man (not otherwise superstitious) take knowledge of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand therein; whereunto (I humbly thank God) I so submit my self, as that for my spirituall good, I acknowledge there ought to have gone no lesse, to work a total conversion in me, so hard is sanctification to be wrought even in men of religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. For my posterity, I must crave their pardon: hoping they will with me submit to the Almighty hand, which can at its good pleasure as well raise as ruine. Worldly confidence illudes, nor can any thing confirm prosperity in this and the better world, but a firm faith, and resolved obedience to God and his Son, in whom alone is salvation. That, that alone can reconcile and calme the contrarieties of our complections in the distractions of pleasure, profit, conscience, honor, decency, authority over others, or a self-injoying: making true Religion the only starre of our course, whilst others for want of it, sometimes wildly flote, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sink in the confusion of their passions. Good intentions without firm resolutions are insufficient. No man hath meant more thriftily then my self; but alasse! in what a mist of contrary indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and contingencies doe we live? when I concluded against hous-keeping, I have bin indulgently over-ruled by others to the contrary. And this I have found a great error in my nature, to have bin more apt to gratifie others then my self, and to beleeve them often more wise and trusty, <note n="*" place="margin">To judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by our selves may be a rule of charity, but not of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> then there was due cause; a miserable condition of the better natures: Engagement to wife, and servants made over-necessary take away the liberty of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions; to intend thrift is commonly enough to enrich, but wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience teacheth me that diseases and crosses such may come, as shall turne the strongest out of his way. No man more abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red debt, felling, and felling, then my selfe: yet few have more incurred them. No man almost hath allowed himselfe lesse cost or sensuality then I: yet the diversions my disease hath urged me unto, have set another face upon mee, towards such as were not acquainted with my inside and native affections. Few have more affected the service of King, Country, and Freinds: not have by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47776:64"/>
bin more unserviceable. I ever extreamely fancyed my chief feat; yet fear of cost in fitting the house, and heighth of charge in living there by occasion of such an eminent fear, with other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall considerations, kept me thence, till such time as my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was most unfit for that, and it for me: and yet against much reason and interest of my own, I was drawn with relation to my predecessors and posterity to settle my self there, with so much cost and <note n="*" place="margin">In truth, half-hood of materials and workmen, their mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and loytering, make building much more vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</note> trouble, as (but by the grace of God) it is a wonder how in such indisposition and lownesse, I have undergone. This the good God can doe, and howsoever it shall please him to dispose of me, (whose preserving hand I confesse I have wonderfully found) may it please him to make my life and death to his glory, it is all my ambition, Many unluckie circumstances, like that of a free minde entered into Court with a pent fortune, I omit, partly in respect of others, and partly as fit to be confined to my self, who have suffered their perplexities and contrarieties. Gods grace is all in all, for the best of us is subject to be carryed away, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst what we know, and what we would. Such a blindnesse steales us from our selves.</p>

                     <p>The good God be pleased to blesse my Sonne, and make him as happy, as I have been unhappy.

                     <p>Good God, how vaine and miserable a thing is man without thy good Spirit to direct him? by nature corrupt, by Art Sophisticate and confounded: how lost in the ignorance, and inexperience of youth? how short of the tranquillitie of other creatures? how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ruin'd by accident, by mistaken courses; I, by that which men call good nature? yet happy (in worldly account) are they whose natures lead them, not only to affect thrift, (which many by reason of other, not bad affections, imperfectly doe) but to make it their pleasure, their felicity, which humor throughly possessing them, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, profiteth, and advanceth them in fortune and reputation: whilst others bred to more ingenuous and faire appearing waies and studies unthriftily miscarry.

The use of my fortune in the Country was by want of meanes to keepe a comely house, and other many crosse respects, not free unto me; and though afterwards I was drawn to house-keeping against my will and Discourse, yet both in my estate and disease (by the care &amp; retirednesse incident thereunto, especially in a short fortune) it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved most pernicious unto me. My disease likewise was much, if not originally occasioned in my body by an over-using of new Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle against a danger of the Plague, which I fell into by Mr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> his death thereof neere to me in his travell with me, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>London,</hi> the first of King <hi>Iames.</hi> As also by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spare and evill diet, who for long together fed on little meate of good nourishment but only fat, dredgings, Skinnes, and such like, and in truth, scarce ever man of my strong constitution and health gave lesse way to himself in pleasing his appetite. This, and much more wrought an alteration upon my minde, and made me seek a supply of former pleasures, by entertaining my self with studies, and my importunate thoughts, which (by my ignorance how the minde might over-presse and wrong the body) I made most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous unto me. These oppressions cast me upon costly diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with disease and expence of spirits brought me so low, as I could never recover. So that all the effects of melancholy, as

weaknesse of memory, countenance, and faculties, with oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minde, which long and miserably afflicted me, proceeded from nothing more then the waste of my spirits, losse of blood, and over-thinking, with extraordinary obstructions of all my inward parts. I contesse I have been a most intemperate man, but it hath been only in the excesse of my thoughts, else I think no man can charge me that any vain inordinate humour hath transported mee. And so my minde (as I have often been charged) and that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Master, fancy, and a naturall doubtfulnesse (especially upon hard and questionable termes) have afflicted me.

                     <p>WHen I think what my fortune hath been, and how long and continuall the afflictions which I have indured, as well in minde and body, as in my estate, I make question whether many yeares (if not ages) doe not passe in the whole world, without paralleling my sufferings. None but an extream melancholy man can conceive them, which yet have been aggravated in me by a contrary and most sensible complection; no body, but of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary strong constitution, could have undergone them. How often have I thought my self at my end? How often wished it? and yet hath it pleased God miraculously to preserve me. Oh that it might please him thereby to worke his glory and service! O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise how long have I been, and now am, from desiring it? I confesse my self infinitely faulty, both towards God, Man, and my self, but withall strangely unhappy in the occasionall circumstances and concurrencies of my mischiefes; I have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently discerned an extraordinary and high hand therein, and I most humbly thank God, who hath by degrees brought mee home unto him. I have long subsisted only under the shelter of his wings, and desire nothing but his favour to my end. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else hath supported me, nor could, nor can; my minde and fancy were naturally active, and for want of outward imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment besitting them and mee, turned and wrought upon my spirits. If I had, notwithstanding all objections, settled at at the first, I had found that center

I at last gave way to prevent the like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of trouble of minde and cost, which might befall my Son in a just affection of setling there. I confesse that in projecting what concerneth us, it is not unnecessary to be possessed of a summary disposition therein, but to descend to an exact punctuality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars (in a precautious speculation) before time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of acting and execution, is commonly as vain as troublesome. Fancy may please and infatuate it self therein, but the present view and circumstance of things to be presently acted, is that which gives the finall order and determination, with a contradicting and retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nullity, to our prepensed conceits and resolutions.</p>

abhorrent, my naturall curiosity (whose minde was never quiet till all circumstances and conveniencies were run over and over, and accommodated by me) made all things, (especially in a seat of my own) most troublesome.</p>
                     <p>To the melancholy tainted spirit nothing is more unfit then idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nothing more troublesome then its curious discoursing upon resolutions, nothing more unfit then confinement to one place, yet nothing more hard, then to resolve and digest change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
                     <p>Once marryed, I was set to seek how to live, where to live; my birth and breeding was in the City, my affection and chiefe seat in <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> but many strong considerations diverting mee from it. The Court where I was young entred, followed, might have kept me from that depth of melancholy; whereunto travaile, study, and retirednesse in care and fancy of what belonged to a house drowned mee; but that also by accident was unfit for me, yet at length for a strong diversion, and under so brave a patronage as that of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> I readventured upon it, but his immature death, and much sicknesse of my own, following upon it, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disproportions finally aliened me from that course.</p>
                     <p>Thus and much more hath my life been a conflict with disease and fortune, I have formerly touched many more particulars, yet not all, nor the worst.

I have dedicated my self (next to God) wholly to my Son, and have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years endevoured his good beyond my own. I have now made my self his Pensioner, and I wish no worldly happinesse more then his prosperity: thus with a running pen I ease my minde, which though with no serious exactnesse, yet with little prejudice to my health, for otherwise the strength of my disease would not suffer me to beare the strength and curiosity of my own discourse.</p>

                     <p>Thou, Oh God, art the God of nature, but the wayes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Religion are so diverse, that it is a kinde of irreligion to seek or measure thee in natures course, the course of thy Spirit and judgement run another way, they, thy decrees, thy graces, are all supernaturall and wonderfull, to thee be ascribed all wisedome, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, power, and Majesty.</p>
                     <p>And here my most gracious God, I humbly thank thee for thy mercifull and wonderfull support through my whole course, to my body, to my minde, to my fortune; for it equals any thing that I can call strange, that I have subsisted through all my stormes and sufferings, without having incurred utter scorn and ruine: shipwrack is not ill escaped with losse, and a good haven at last is not a little joy, though thy storms have all past over me: and seeing I have used this term of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> I cannot let passe how most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit and accommodate, I have found many of them to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the 88. and divers others, in my friends being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved farre from mee, and sundry other passages. Lord I humbly thank thee, that thou hast so made my face ashamed, as that I have got and found thee, and found that of thy very mercy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse I have been troubled; I can now call thee the God of my Salvation, my countenance, and confidence, for I have found the beames of thy mercy, so to comfort me in darknesse and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that I doubt not to apply to my self, as well the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of consolation, as I have done those of complaint and distresse.</p>
                     <p>I can now look upon all this worlds glories, pleasures, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, with contempt and pity: continue thy mercies, and I have heaven upon earth, thou art perfection of Philosophy, thou art the true <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> in thee is all fulnesse, all joy.</p>

the allowed proportion; indeed there are many wayes incident to this worlds course, and we have a latitude of disposings, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selves; but the <hi>unnm magnum,</hi> the <hi>unum necessarium</hi> for this life, is not to over-spend.</p>
                     <p>This was in my discourse, this was in my affections, but my want and infirmity in health, wildered and overthrew me: God be prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you yet injoy <hi>Mentem sanam in corpore sano,</hi> moderate your self, and hold so, and make no question of well-being and fortune; maintain your self ready and capable, and Fortune seldome failes to present her self. God multiply his blessings upon you; and receive the blessing of your wholly devoted Father, <hi>Amen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have set you even, I have set you before hand, contain and run not behinde; never make your self such a stranger to your fortune and course, as to make anyone servant necessary unto you, you shall in truth become enthralled unto him, and it is both preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ruinous. Whether you take a Country or other life, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not, so you hold your self within your bounds. Place forceth no man.</p>
                     <p>They have their severall advantages and disadvantages like other things, and are to be embraced as discretion and affection shall lead. Certainly the travailing course used of late (especially in the most spirituall and Academicall mindes) breeds a great partiality to the equall conversation of Townes, but not without danger of being aliened from the knowledge of your own, and as much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein by others, as of abusing your self in being carryed away with the City vanities, and unfruitfull idlenesse. The Country life is assuredly most naturall, pleasant, setled, and profitable to the <hi>English</hi> breed and course. Doe but you care for your self, as I have cared for you, and all shall (with Gods blessing) goe well with your minde, and well with your fortune; seek your happinesse from Gods grace and bounty, he will not faile to give it you, make Christ your Rock, and you have a sure foundation.</p>

There are divers kindes and degrees of Faith, the generality of such as call and think themselves Christians, go on in a course childish kinde of Faith, which gives little tincture to their affections, and lesse to their actions, yet according to their nature, in some things they make more, in others, lesse conscience: in a farther proceeding and consideration of Religion, they lay hold on Christ, and use him as a salve for their sins, and sinfull propensions; but when the good Spirit of God, by meanes of affliction, or otherwise, throughly awakeneth them, and workes upon their Soule, then, and not till then, are we truely converted: then are our eyes opened to see and feel the uglinesse of sin, with the sweetnesse of his saving grace and favour: And thus (Oh Lord) hath it pleased thee (in thy infinite mercy) to work upon me. Now I see, and pity the worlds vanity and corruptions. Now, as thou hast dyed for me, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye a thousand deaths, then to grieve thy good Spirit by my least consent to sin.</p>
                     <p>As thou hast done to me, so vouchsafe to extend thy extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hand of mercy upon others, with-hold them from sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating thy sincere Religion, with their poore and rotten policies: we may say of it (as some use it) as is said of Tilt and Tourney, that it is too much for jest, too little for earnest; it cannot be expected that the people will follow, except their Teachers lead, and in the sincerity of their lives shew the way; their Tithes are substance, their shows, and ceremonies alone in thy service deserve them not. Magistrates when they obey thee, may more justly and exactly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our obedience. A grosse affectation of policy in Religion, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters too much occasion to weak Christians to judge and conclude of Religion, rather as a humane Policy, then Divine Truth.</p>
                     <p>If any sins were veniall, such appeare most pardonable as carry with them a kinde of warrant from Nature, and a gratification to others; and thou, O God, art least indulgent to such as offend of malitious wickednesse.</p>
                     <p>They are like the Planets and Starres, in the Heavens, to guide and comfort us by their sweet influence; when they prove maligne (which the Starres seldome doe) they are our mischiefes and our Plagues: and as the Starres have their shining and influence more for our, then their own good, so ought they to exercise their power.</p>

In the diseases of our bodies, where an evill habit prevailes, and ill humours abound, some are rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by purgation, some &amp;c. and some by the very distempers which they breed; A burning Feaver remedies a Palsie; and Agues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily cleare the body. We see also, that a disordered, and ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated Common-wealth and State, but upon extream necessity and violence, seldome grows to reformation. A vicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved minde corresponds to these premisses, as well in disposition as cure, till extremity, distemper, and affliction work upon us, till God the good Gardener of our soules cultivate, weed, alter, and subdue us, we insist in our corrupt naturals, we remain obstinate in our errours, impatient of good and healthfull counsell, perverse in all our courses; Happy that Soyle, Body, State and Soule which finde him their Gardener, Physitian, Reformer, and gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Paradise was our first plentifull Garden; Health, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Justice and integrity, our condition; till he renew, heale, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, sanctifie and reduce us to our principles and perfection, we are barren to goodnesse, unsound, corrupted, tainted peeces. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, Oh Lord, in such thy grace, as I have haply found towards me, be it by breaking, sicknesse, confusion, or humiliation, so thou make me good, and make me thine, I shall be faithfully fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Athletically vigorous, prudent, temperate, just, religiously vertuous, and already in Paradise and in the Confines of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

Thou never wantest means; Melancholy, confusion of face, defection of the eyes, crosses have been thy instruments to make me thine: I was a house built for pleasure, but thou hast made me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of all calamities. I was not that crooked peece of knee tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fitted for distresse, I was framed for the Pacifique Sea, but thy stormes have all past over me, and yet by thy favour I am a greater wonder to my self in what I have born, then was that Cock-boat which safely transported from the <hi>Bermudaes,</hi> such as committed themselves unto it. Free spirited Horses doe often brook worst the bit and curb, and soonest tire themselves engaged to a Moorish pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, when a Fen Mare, and an Asinine patience, better complies and extricates it self: no sweetnes is comparable to thy grace, nor strength to that which thy good Spirit gives. Naturally I am impatient to tread my shooe awry, I have abounded in errors and exorbitancies, but thy mercy hath ever opened my eyes, and recalled me to disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, and at last to detest and abjure them.</p>
                     <p>It had been else too hard for flesh and blood, they can never cast out, nor cast off themselves; as thou hast said, A Kingdome divided in it self cannot subsist: but be thou with us, and nothing can prevaile against us; invincible is that body, that minde and estate, which thou assistest.</p>

much experience of the little good, that the best preaching workes upon depraved mindes; grant that I may not offend thee, in hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my self by an immoderate and indiscreet affecting of others good; Give me a chearefulnesse without oppression of my spirits in thine, and my wayes.</p>
                     <p>Blesse the sincere profession and Professors of thy sacred Word, teach them that they may truely teach thee, with-hold them from mingling policy, and self-interest with thy Religion, with-hold them from shaking the foundation of our Faith, and peace of thy Church. It hath formerly been too great a tax upon our Nation, to have been too inconstant and troublesome therein. Maintain the true Light and pure exercise of thy Gospel amongst us, our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deserve the punishment, of a most grosse relaps to discovered and escaped superstition and Idolatry, but of thy great mercy give us true wisdome and repentance, and avert thy Judgements. One pious Church-man is sooner to be beleeved against their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected authority, then twenty for their usurped power and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Luxations in Religion breed a long subsequent weaknesse, and the adversaries of our Religion, as well as Atheists, take too great advantage from such occasion. Contain us, Oh Lord, from over-pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, and censuring thy secret Counsels, Predestination, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, strike the same stroak upon our lives. Our comfort must rise from our endevour, in either opinion; The most subtile Writers lose and confound themselves on either side, and make too bold in concluding of thee by our blinde fantastique rules of Justice.</p>
                     <p>Thou dwellest in the Clouds, and hast cast a mist about thy self, which our fraile fight cannot penetrate: how can man hope to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thee, whose poore finite capacity cannot so much as in his imagination conceive either way of that, which he sees and knows of necessity must be either so or so? As for instance, we know that this sublime Candens must necessarily either have bounds, beyond which there is nothing, or else go infinitely on fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally unbounded, and one limit still succeeding another; but I am much deceived, if the strongest imagination can conceive either way, though one be most necessary: much lesse can we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and compasse the essence and infinity of God, obedience and reverence to his revealed will, and not an over-bold and curious search, belong to his incomprehensible Majesty: But I have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my paper, and almost my self, vouchsafe (Oh Lord) to give me modesty, moderation, Faith, Charity, and Conscience to guide my wayes, and guide that guide, that I may live and dye in thy truth, and to thy glory, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

It is more potentially then actually that we enjoy them. We acquiesce in a stupid and corrupt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are fed and pleased in the impure nutriment of earthly and false delights, we draw our nourishment, by the Navill of our sensuality, we are wrapped in our uncleannesse, and of our selves we neither know nor affect any other being. But when God of his great grace calls and urgeth us to our true and second birth in his Spirit, he changeth our affections, cloatheth us anew, brings us to another light, another Aire, another condition. He worketh in us a sight and feeling of our former infirmities, and corruption, he purifies, refines, and fits us for a more excellent life and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: He displayes unto us his farre more excellent beauties and glory, we draw our nourishment by another roote, more coelestiall, more defecate, we loathe and scorn our former being, and become ravished in the joy of our change, which is not without difficulty and cryes, happy cryes, happy distresse, most gainfull change.

Our first life is vegetable, sensuall, common with beasts, dark, base, cumbersome, our regeneration is the only true and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life of the Soule.

                     <p>By thy grace (Oh Lord) am I born, and without it better had I been unborn. I was wildred in a Wood, entangled in a dimme light amongst Bryers, Thornes, and wilde beasts; but thou hast freed me, and brought me into the faire, open, delightfull fields of thy grace; I was engaged to a Sea of raging waves and stormes, but thou hast instructed me to strike my greedy sailes, to cast out my vaine lading, and brought me to a most happy Port, in thy most happy Climate. I was an executor of the worlds trust, but found the estate so entangled, so subject to debts, that thou hast taught me to renounce and free my self: I will by thy Divine assistance avoid the Wood, and be free from the Bryers, the Sea, and be free from Sea-sicknesse and stormes, the worlds common courses and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, and enjoy thee and my self, exempt from troubles, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debts and importunate vanities; The world does in Truth (for the most part) but <hi>magnas nugas magno conatu agere, &amp;c.</hi>

It is full of various, many unclean beasts, and too floating and unsetled; I would rather prove it a City built upon the Rock Christ Jesus, firme and unchangeable; he is the sole and all-sufficient fundamentall of our Salvation, and whilest we confound our selves and seek for other, let us take heed we lose not him, and betray our selves, not only to infinite uncharitable, indiscreet, fanaticall opinions and Schisms, but even to Turcisme, and Atheisme; our wilde unsettled dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions expose us too much to both. Lord of thy great mercy teach thy Church and me, to fix in a firmitude of thy saving Faith and Religion. Banish undue policy, banish will-worship, and teach us to serve and honour thee in unity and truth of Spirit, instruct and guide me in thy wayes, and seeing thou hast made me a sociable

                     <p>Thus did Melancholy and retirednesse work upon me, my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy wrought my retirednesse, and that by removing me from the common delights and course of young men, my farther Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, <hi>removens prohibens,</hi> goes for a cause. I affected the Tree of knowledge, tasted of the unnaturall fruit, and lost my earthly paradise: though labour, toyle, and affliction have been my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such losse, yet Christ hath proved unto me infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. He is the Christians eternall Paradise, in him we finde a new Earth, new Heavens, Peace, and joy incomparably more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, without him all is vanity and vexation of spirit; Happy the fall which meetes with him to raise us, happy the losse which finds him to guide us. Since the first fall man discerning his nakednesse, of himself hath sought Figge-leaves for cover and advantage, a partiall cloathing in humane policies, Arts, and inventions, which all but make us feel the more the weather, and our wants. Nature is lost in artificiall affectations, and our false-acquired knowledge proves our true and reall misery. Thus plunged in vain deceiving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and wretched perplexity, no exemption, no redemption remaines but in and through Christ, and the true knowledge of him: By him we turn our first nakednesse and ragges into a full and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious garment, by him our darknesse and confusion becomes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect illumination, and in him our vain pleasures and fraile troubles become a solid continuall feast of joy, peace, and contentment. That Sun of Righteousnesse is the only true Sunne, that lighteth every man to true happinesse: the Sunne is the life of flowers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them open themselves and turne towards it; let us learn from them to open our hearts, and turn to God. He alone can disperse in us the clouds of ignorance and light vanities, in him alone is that tranquillity and true joy to be found, which by our disobedience,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47776:88"/>
and foolish affectation we have lost, all our other curiosities, all our sensualities do but more wilder us and set us further to seek. The wiser sort of men in a humane way have sought for immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to peece out their frailty, but in Christ alone it is to be found; and without him, it were better to want it. Poore creatures that we are, poore happinesse that we seek, without him who said, Seek and ye shall finde. But do not such appeare to doubt too much of the soules immortality, who will rather deny it to become infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with originall sin, by way of propagation in a probable analogie to Faith and Gods Justice, then acknowledge a naturall way of one eternall Soule to beget another, eternity being the only gift of God, and as easily and more reasonably flowing from him the one way then the other? Is not this, leaving a faire, naturall, rationall, and religious way, a kinde of teaching to doubt and mis-beliefe? Why stick they at that which is most reasonable, teaching neverthelesse Faith beyond reason; such as deny the earth to move and turn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sun for its own advantage, upon pretence of Text of Scripture for the earths stability, which as a thousand others, they might as well and with farre lesse straining interpret in a way of common <note n="*" place="margin">Besides other Texts which make &amp; consist with a different opinion.

                     <p>MY good Friend, you have obliged me, in the reading and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using of these my confused crudities, and you have in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to them and me, and their innocent spirit of ingenuity, commended some things in them farre beyond their worth: and wished some more labour of mine to be imployed in their more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and perfect digestion, and a farther communication, but I am over-weak and lazy, and they too incorrigible, they are misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen lumps of an imperfect conception, which howsoever it might be fit for me to be delivered of, yet are they most unfit for other, then a friendly view and judgement; I put them into your hands, but am farre from wishing any your farther patience or labour upon them; They are such Beares whelpes, that if they were capable of any good shape, yet were it most unfit, that any but their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Parent should lick them into it; notwithstanding if out of your good affection to any part of them, and the propagation of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, you conceive a tolerable <hi>Mercury</hi> may be framed of them, for the view of a more remote well-affected friend, I submit them to you. Hew off, and fashion them at your pleasure, if you should prove so idle, as to make such an undertaking, I feare you will finde so shaken a piece of Timber, as is nothing but chips before-hand. I thank God, I have ever superlatively loved goodnesse, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, then to be an instrument of doing good: but my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and opportunity have not answered my affection: Nor can I now, either so flatter my self, or the world, to hope the least good effect from any production of mine; you have often in your course and profession, given, and daily give better and happyer proofe of your self that way. The stuffe <note n="*" place="margin">Imperfect in the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, not to be perfected in the second.</note> which you finde in my peeces, is in truth (and so ever I conceived it) most unfit for the sight of any other, then a cordiall and familiar Friend. The presence of sores, infirmities, and criple diseases, are fitter for an Hospital, or Almeshouse, then the stage, they excite pleasure in none, and compassion but in few, and well-disposed persons: I affect priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and love not to expose my self and my errors to censure (guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my imperfections) especially of fooles and depraved disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In truth, Melancholy and humaine frailty and dysaster, will hardly meet with anyother idoneous and compassionate Judges, then such as have felt and smarted in their sad unhappy effects; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very peece was intended the last, and they are too wilde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent, to make a Teame: But (as I have formerly said, use your pleasure, reduce (if you will and can) my <hi>Chaos</hi> into method, cut off repetitions, there is matter enough to prune and burn, little for fruit; correct, destroy part, or all; if you retain anything, the labour will be the lesse, to let it be meerely mine; And thus I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my self and it to God, and you, his will, and yours be wrought on me and mine.</p>

Thy goodnesse, Oh Lord, thy love, thy glory are the only subject, wherein I would be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to write and spend my self, but thy glory is too bright for my feeble eyes, I must again sound my retreat. In thy own holy Scriptures thou hast revealed thy self sufficiently for our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for our eternall happinesse and salvation.

                     <head>To my above mentioned Friend. The Conclusion.</head>
                     <p>YOu have formerly seen, how I engaged my self to Verse, and broke loose from it; there is indeed a kinde of wantonnesse and constraint incident to it, which agrees not with my austerity and affected liberty. I am even in prose too much a Libertine, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of method, abandoned to confusion; I have partly, though imperfectly, made to appeare the calamitous progresse of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, with the happy and admirable deliverance and issue, to the good of my Soule, and no incompetency in fortune, wherein I doubt not but I shall move as well joy as compassion in such as are good and well affected towards me.</p>
                     <p>I have not been formerly void of good inclinations, (my best was ever an affection to God, good men, and goodnesse) but my disposition therein was so imperfectly sanctifyed and fortifyed, that it pleased the Divine power to cast down all my fences, to turn my best wisedome and intentions to solly, and to expose mee to the scorn of such as in my naturalls I might have scorned: such ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is the world, and the corrupt disposition of man (especially the worst and most degenerous) that we over-measure our selves by our own foot, like lewd filthy boyes we sport our selves in cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dirt one in anothers face; He thinks me foolish, I doe as much for him, we gratifie ourselves in taking advantage at others infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and mis-fortunes, we think to inhaunse our selves thereby; In truth scorn grows commonly from such to whom it most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from others, and they exercise it without self-reflection, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, compassion, or discretion.</p>
                     <p>Care undermined me, improsperous courses blew me up, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick was my bane, and diversions my confusion; How miserable, Oh God, is humane frailty? How wonderfull are thy wayes? It is said, that if in case of Physick, of these three, Physitian, Patient, and sicknesse, any two conspire, they prevaile. In me the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy hath been in all against me, with Body, Minde, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and yet Gods extraordinary grace and mercy have suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and delivered me. There is no despaire till we become incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all manner of cure and subsisting.</p>

                     <p>I Have often deceived my self in thinking my self at my end, the like hapneth in my writing, and before I shut up these ill-favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, imperfect representations, though what I have already said, may partly satisfie my intentions, in expressing that it hath been more my disease then my self, which hath been the chief Actor in my misfortunes, yet know that the worst, the strangest, and most of my story is not brought upon this paper stage; it is too tedious and unfit for view; not only in the story of particular men, but even of State-resolutions, and publicke actions, and especially of natures course and proceedings, their true and reall motives, springs, and wayes are in most important effects, secret, concealed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, ordinarily hidden in their originall, even from our selves that act; we may take copies of others faces, but not of their hearts with any assurance. It hath been an honest advise to keep a corner of our heart to our selves; and if an honest heart ought not in point of discretion to expose it self, what truth is to be expected from hypocrisie and dissimulation? One absurdity admitted, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand follow, and to the foundation of my disease laid in the excesse of Treacle, infinite have been the effects, and my sufferings, which have flowne from that and other concurring circumstances. I have at the entrance of my alteration, been ready to sink at the Table, I have many yeares since travail'd and slept with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls at hand to keep me alive; nor left I them, till a hearty friend told me the heart must comfort the heart, which yet was lame and ineffectuall in my strongest resolutions, till I had recourse to God the onely true spirit of courage and resolution; to a curious and well-affected minde, and a weather-beaten Soule, there is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge or harbor of safety, satisfaction, and tranquillity. There are Climates, where it seldome or never Raines, others which clouds <hi>malusque Iupiter urgent.</hi> In one and the same Country, where the earth and heavens in their constant seasons should bee as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly disposed, yet doth the same time of the yeare prove some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cold and wet, sometimes hot and dry, the materials and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances appearing the same; this must rise from secret Springs, and combinations above the reach of our discourse. The same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and contrariety of effects befals men in their fortunes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in appearance equally constituted. God is the cause of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; He hath in all times and Countries provided wonders above the ordinary course of Nature, to humble and convince our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane presumption. I had a body and a minde so strongly built, that had not my spirituall and intellectuall parts predominated in me, to withdraw me from a base vulgar abandoning my self to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, no man in probability could better have subsisted and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained himself against ordinary course of dissolution and debauch. I had a Spirit naturally tempered to contain and contract it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all excesse, but its own; And even that as well as another, it might have bridled, had not Melancholy and other adverse condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Innocent and groundlesse blushings proceeding from the tenuity and waste of my blood and spirits have been none of my least importune and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall symptomes. Such weaknesse joyned with a strong fancy hath made me subject to blush not onely to my self alone, but upon any surprise of mention and conceit; not only upon any reall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but upon what there might be so much as a possibility of in the apprehension of another. I have taken my self blushing at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing or name of a woman, who had shee been <hi>Eve</hi> and I <hi>Adam,</hi> the humane race would have been in great danger of failing, at length custome and complying with a conceited expectation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, produced it, &amp;c. God hath by his extraordinary grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my humiliation furnished me with as strange meanes to subsist, as I at the first found extravagant means to keep low and oppresse my self. In the depth of Melancholy, I have not found so much as a melancholy dream, my spirits have taken root from above and have grown upon it. Long since, after a great disease, I had such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of spirits and humours, that a thick cloud could not passe over me, but I felt an alteration upon it. It is strange how a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient thought will work, and give a suddain stroak to a remote and ill-affected weakned part of the body: the minde workes not alone by the heart and brain, as is vulgarly conceived, but the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and all parts more or lesse contribute, and are affected therein, and God hath blessed me with a minde so strong that it ever discharged it self in its passions and errors, more in my body then its own suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; but they are still <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twins, and must weep or laugh together. I have now disburthened my self of all trouble, but this of writing, I am too inexhaustible therein, weary me it doth, satisfie me it cannot, I will change the Scene, and seeing I finde my self so ill a Companion, I will seek better company. I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been over-hard to please in conversation, my present affections and habit make me now more dainty, what shall I doe? I have by Gods great grace recovered in great part, those Jewels of peace and health which I had long lost. Therefore I will no longer rake in this puddle, nor abuse his grace in over-bold and indiscreet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; Like the stranger belonging to another Country, I will transitorily please my self, and converse with the common passions and Interests of this world, I will spend my time in search of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and will make much of it where I finde it, I will wash my hands in Innocency, my Soule in my Saviours blood, and wrap my self in my own vertue, and his merits, relying on his neverfail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

effect a pleasing reflection. Many Preach in the Pulpit, few in their lives, and fewer make it a businesse particularly to labor particular Reformations in their common conversation: Christianity is taken up rather for outward fashion and profession, then for any inward essentiall form and habit; if we were really what we pretend to be, we would not rest satisfyed in our perfunctory proceedings. We would actuate and propagate our Faith and Charity upon others, and improve our felicity in a spirituall way, according to that rule, which affirmes him to be born in vain and unprofitably, <hi>per quem non nascitur alter.</hi> We are all ordinarily charitable to such as we see out of the way by our directions and conductings, we are apt to rectifie errors in any thing rather then piety and Religion. It is a preposterous affection and modesty, seeing there can be nothing so important both to Gods glory and our own good, as a due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his will and our profession. We love the children of our beds, and of our braines, and they are often happy unto us: But certainly it must be an incomparable and superlative contentment, if it hath pleased God to make us the children of his good Spirit, to become happy instruments of raising up and begetting spirituall Children to him; nothing conduceth more unto it, then that our light so shine before men, that they may see our good workes, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. Light is most diffusive, and flame incentive, if we be truely enflamed our selves, we shall hardly faile (at least we ought not) to communicate and extend it to others, who often consist of matter well disposed and combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but want good kindled Coales of Devotion and blowing to be applyed and work upon them. I have formerly lived in <hi>London</hi> with hurt to my self, and no good to others, I feare not now my own prejudice, and am ambitious of others good, could I meet as well with opportunity and conveniency of living in it with a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and seconding in my affected course, as there is too much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and subject of corrupted times, and matter to work upon, I should be much the more happy.

Blesse mee, Oh God, in this, and all other thy good motions, perpetuate them unto mee, teach me to scorn the contempt and glory of the world, to preferre and exalt the sincerity of thy truth and Religion, above all earthly considerations, let me be none of those, who beleeve thee no farther then they see thee, and their own imaginations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, confirme and strengthen me in all good endevours, and accept my most humble thanksgiving for thy wonderfull grace and mercy upon me, and that for thy deare Son our Saviours sake, to whom with thee and thy holy Spirit be all glory for ever, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

The blessing of God must goe to the finding and improving of his blessings upon us; I intend not to discourse of our pronenesse to evill, and the difficulty of vertue and piety, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have handled it at large, onely I will say of my self, that if I be not of a vitious inclination, it is Gods good grace and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter upon me. I know as well as another the advantages and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie wayes of dishonesty; I could hide my claws like a Cat, till I met with an opportunity for mischief, I could transforme my selfe into an Angell of light, and play the Devill in my heart, but my ends, end not in my self. I confesse every man loves to walk on the ground of pleasure and delight, nor ought or can a self-consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and interest be excluded, Fancy must and will be humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; some have imagined pleasure to consist in indolency and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selves out of pain, by the satisfaction of our longings, but some delights are even naturally and indiscoursively such, by the impression wherewith they surprise and affect the senses inward and outward, they are indeed intended and exalted, or remitted and extenuated according to the fancy and other circumstance, that gives them entertainment: not only delights, but variety is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to humane nature, many are so tempered and elemented, that not only seeming pleasures, but such as are hot, full and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous are required by them, they must have their load, and be put to their strength, or they finde no relish. What is now to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we exclusively usurpe the reasonable form, if we use it not in elections and moderation; I consider not my self in my naturals, as a savage, which I might have been, but as I finde my self, a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,

a moralized Christian, moderatour to my own disputations and actions. Drunkennesse may be pleasing, but is ugly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth us to inconvenience and scorn: I will endevour to avoid that and the like, I will make a Harmony of discord, reconcile Nature, Art, Religion, my owne and others interest: This you will say is a work, but it lyes upon me, I drew it not upon my self, and I must comply with my condition, I will bridle my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and willingly give way only to such contentments as are most cheape, cleare, safe, and lasting, such as allow me most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery over my self, my ambition is to possesse all, by desiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if I can finde contentment at home, I will not seek it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; I love not to part with my freedome and power over my self, to exercise a conceited power over others, such kinde of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power may be sweet, it may be brave, the other I preferre as more firm, more sound; I can willingly forbeare the giving of ten blows, to avoid the taking of one, which consideration is said to have established Justice, and by the same I will endevour my quiet. A private course is neither void of pleasure or variety; Place forceth no man to expence, but well chosen, gives as well change as cheapenesse of food and pleasures, the same affections move in little as in greater creatures, and may bee entertained as well in a Country, as Court course of life, they who use to play small game, can do it as seriously as others the greatest. Businesse is many times rather a diversion then exercise of life, let us be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so impatient, wee cannot shake off our naturall condition, if wee could be contented to bee but our selves and soberly enjoy our selves, wee should prove better and easilier contented then we are. I will first improve my self and my own to the best, before I make an alienation, I will be weary of my self, before I passe my self away, I will not willingly subject my reason to my own, much lesse to the fancy of others; there is motion enough to be exercised within our proper locality without those excentriques and trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein many violate their own and natures Laws: it must be an exorbitant fantasie that cannot entertain it self in its owne <hi>Apogeums,</hi> and <hi>Perigeums,</hi> contemplation of Heaven and Earth, and a conformity of action. If ever I affect farther, it must bee by a faire calling, and shall be with an affectation of others good more then my own, or good, or fancy; I finde few such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions granted, <hi>Cum libera potestate,</hi> as would suit with my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, wee shall finde enough to doe to make good our account in a private, much more in a publique course; power and gain, which are strong motives to other men, are too vain and sordid to become my objects, quiet and good are my ends, as motion and gain theirs, my disposition was never lazy or timorous; But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny a kinde of restinesse and Epicurisme in honest, sober self-pleasing and Idolatry; it must come faire and walk fairely with me that will be mine and hold me. My wit and discourse are no farther at my command then I approve my object and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

Though I bee not Mercuriall, I resemble the Planet <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in this, that my conversation is much according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Every man hath much of the Ape, much of the Chameleon, much of the Parasite, too much of the Serpent and envy in him, opportunity and necessity are strong Agents. I cannot speak half so well <hi>French</hi> with an <hi>English</hi> as with a <hi>French man,</hi> nor exercise half so much freedome or ingeniosity with a dull, common, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicating, as a lively, generous, and sincerely expressing spirit: <hi>I</hi> well endure not to sow my seed, but on good ground, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good return, nor to converse with such as are so wedded to their own opinions, and full of themselves that there is no room or indulgence for any other. I am as tender of giving the least distaste or offence to another, as to my self; Though I love conformity, yet no more then needs must to an absurd fashion, and not at all to a vitious temporizing. Here you may finde no small perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Art is long, multiform, infinite, Nature short-sighted, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are obnoxious to a world of crosse indications and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Art, and Inventions owe us a faire amends, for we suffer and are confounded more then a little by them; were it in my power I would recompence, restore, help, and piece out Nature by my Writings, but I feare, the best Authors often more disguise and confound, then better and improve her: Shee hath, I confesse, found some advantage from Invention, as appeares in the extent and multiplication of Perspective Glasses, Catacousticons, digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Language to bee conserved by writing, regulate and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime observation in Astronomy, and the course of the Heavens, as the Ephemerides, and exact prediction of Eclipses doe witnesse, but how well shee might have subsisted and walkt without a <hi>Iacobs</hi> staffe, and these helps let others discourse, I acknowledge them much better then the invention of high heeles, head dresses, and training Gownes, &amp;c. But may it not be a shame to Art, that all this while it hath not taught us to flye (and for swimming, we are rather dis-taught by our Discourse) and that cutting down and destroying great Trees upon otherwise barren soyles, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to teach them to bring forth Corne and inferiour Plants: Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Melancholy humour, are great Inventors, but as the Melancholique humour breeds an Appetite, so doth it ordinarily hinder digestion; a stomach that surchargeth it self with variety, digesteth ill, and breeds crudities; It is hard to make a just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and distribution of our unnaturall superinductions. The craftier sort of people strip themselves of such clogs and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and insist too often in a corrupt and unreformed nature. They look upon God (if at all) no farther then they finde him in Nature, and in his Workes, they passe over his supernaturall revealed Word and will, as wanting the eye of Faith to discern it, and either question the recommended interpretation, or wrest it to their own sense and interest, they admit no Law but their own Nature, and worldly and sensuall advantage; No man can
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47776:96"/>
know God and his will, and contemn or slight it; But Religion, like Nature and the Senses, is indemonstrable, because nothing proportions unto it. Every man frames God unto himselfe, such as either his grace or our owne interpretation and sense deliver him unto us. If our Divines were either so consonant in their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or lives, as were requisite, wee should become better Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians then we are. His will would not be so indifferent to us, nor would we conceive him so indifferent as many do to our wills and actions; Excepting Religion all other knowledge is so painefull to attaine, and so troubled and muddy when wee come to stirre the bottome, that the game is hardly worth the Candle; God of his great mercy enlighten us and mend us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <head>To my best Clergy friend in relation to the best among us.</head>
                     <p>IT proveth according to your conceit for this my farther writing, I affirmed to you as I then thought that nothing lay upon mee requiring farther vent. In truth for the particular which I now fall upon, it hath beene long since in my affections to write something therein, but the tendernesse and daintinesse of the matter, and censuring ticklishnesse of the time with-held mee; possibly I have been too pusillanimously injurious to truth and ingenuitie, too much misdoubting my owne strength, and over prejudicate upon supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in such restraint. Religion, as it now stands betwixt us and the Papists, is the subject. There have not beene wanting on the one side some who out of a Romish presumptuous and overflatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring disposition, and on the other, some, who out of a Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish jealousie and distrust, have over-boldly apprehended (if not concluded) that both our King and many of our Bishops are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne and our good and quiet too much affected that way. I have formerly understood from you your opinion to the contrary, and that grounded upon sound reason, and mine hath runne with yours; None should prove so great losers by such a change as our King and Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and they are both of them too wise and sensible of their owne power, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and splendor ever to consent to reenthrall themselves to those great usurpations and abuses which the Monarch of Rome exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth over such Princes and States as acknowledge him. It is little that we of inferiour calling should suffer under him, in respect of the continuall reluctancy wherein they would find themselves plunged. Our King and State enjoy now that happy freedome which hath cost others full deare to have attained and have failed in their endeavours. Yet a King of <hi>France</hi> is mighty even in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47776:97"/>
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> so farre as to bandy against the Spanish faction, which is commonly great enough to be troublesome to the Pope himselfe. The power of all other Princes and States are petty Planets in comparison of these, of so little sway and eminency that their influence and operation is very little more, then as they side, adhere, and involve themselves to the others interest. Our King is now one of the most free and eminent of Christendome, nor can there bee the least just feare that his wisedome and spirit upon whatsoever Antipuritan suggestion can consent to bring over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an unbridled and unlimited jurisdiction and controller. The usurped vicegerency of the Pope as God on earth is too imcompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the just temporall power of Kings, to be willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The strained grosse and injurious pretences of the Roman Church have been too clearely detected, and Christian rights and truths too strongly vindicated to relapse to former delusions; whatsoever future remisnesse and indulgency the Pope may pretend, <hi>nunquam ligat sibi manus,</hi> there can bee no securitie against him, and naturally (as well as for their pretended truth and uniformity) they will ever tend to recover their losses and pristine authoritie. Many carry a reverend respect to that Church more out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of what primitively they were and now should bee, then what they long have been, now are, and are likely to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. Unitie in truth and sincere Religion were indeed above all things to bee wished, as nothing is more to bee avoyded and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred then falsehood, prevarication and imposture. Whatsoever pretext of policy and devotion there may seeme to bee in part of their discipline and Tenents; certainly there is little Christian wisedome and lesse devotion, to admit corruption and falshood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any policie; Gods truth stands not in need of our simulation and lies: a discovered Woolfe and Impostor, let his cloathing be what it list, shall never deceive mee, and in a sincere way I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as easily consent to be of no formall Religion, as of a false one. But they will tell some of the wittiest amongst us that there is no assurance, no alacritie in a <hi>Calvinist</hi> spirit. Indeed their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is very kind in charging their owne soules to seeme to ease ours by an implicite faith and absolution; If I were to chuse a religion for my ease and libertie it should bee theirs, but I know too much of Religion and them to be of that mind, I cannot but make use of my owne eyes in a way that so much importeth mee, nor can I yeeld to resigne them <note n="*" place="margin">God requires the reading of the Scriptures, for they t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now as it is my prayer, so will I endeavour to retaine a confidence against such apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and will persevere with you as well to judge as hope the best. This discourse though I am more unfit for it then it for mee, I have adventured upon in full discharge of my heart and soule, nor will I forget to put you clergy men into my prayers; for next to Christ and the King, from your sinceritie of doctrine, spirit and life, must flow our peace, happinesse and salvation. If you preach Christ more then your selves and teach inward more then outward holinesse,

wee shall learne from you to become more truely Christian then hypocritically pharisaicall, you may otherwise confound and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine your selves and us, from which mischiefe and misery may it please our mercifull God and Saviour to deliver us. <hi>Amen, Amen</hi>

                     <p>THere is an admirable communication and intelligence as well as league and Colligence betweene the body and soule. They Act the one upon the other, they suffer the one from the other, sometimes the one, sometimes the other leads the dance; If the mind be sad, the body is heavy, if rejoyced, active; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise the sicknesse of the body dejects the minde, and health gives it alacrity. The Oeconomy of the bodies concoction and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties is disturbed and hindred by the trouble of the mind. So is the working of Physick. Onely the vertuous temper of the soule maintaines it selfe incorruptible and firme, in despite of all bodily infirmitie and distemper. A mind habituated to valour and vertue will never degenerate to cowardise and basenesse from its ingenit and naturall Character. The body may incline, it cannot compell: it offers to lead, it forceth not to follow; in our dreames a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confirmed mind maintaines it selfe against vitious transportations; Yet may the state and temper of the body be much conjectured from our roving and raving fantasies in our sleepe or sicknesse. Rheume, Choler, and Melancholy may be concluded from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish, fierie, or dismall representations, or the intention and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a paroxysme and disease from the suitable pleasing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing impressions and objects whereby they will finde meanes to impart themselves unto us. (I speake upon experience) in the malignitie of a fit or humour, wee are full of perturbation, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, and unluckinesse, in the decrease all goes faire and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. More wonderfull are the influences and impulsions of God upon the soule, such as are rather to bee felt then related, they are unexpressible and indemonstrable. The leadings, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdings, the comforts, the relievings, the deliverances, how sweet? how incomparable? Our spirits are nothing but as inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from him. Hee is the incomprehensible Spirit of spirits and the world, the giver and ruler of our thoughts. True joy hath no other Spring or Center. Hee is the uniter, consolidator and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune viuculum</hi> of soule and body, the heavens and the earth, the elements and universe.

then my selfe. I shall bee happy if he please to continue me thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and exempt from abusing it. Which that I may not doe in further prosecuting this insatiable humour of writing, I resolve by his good grace and assistance to make this my peece of farewell. I know how short I come in matter, how short of what my selfe could write, I will not too much presume of his mercy and my owne strength and ordinary preservatives. Subjects of writings are as various and endlesse as obscure. If you will reade the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or more full and Divine writings of our present Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> upon originall and actuall justice, it will abate our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and discover so the vast perplexed intricacy and nature of things and questions unto us, as will beget a modestie and restraint as well to our contentious discourse as scribling. God hath put me as well into a way of health for my body as my soule, if I wrong not the one by the other. Hee hath cleared my mists and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Sunshine of his grace. God make me constant to my self and him. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

long a wrastle with God, and not to beare his markes: I am none of the miraculous three Children to come out of the Furnace and not have my body and garments savour of the fire. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and obduration had been my soules losse, and would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it selfe in such a profligate wickednesse as I hope shall never be mine; If I be not totally reformed and refined, yet as farre as the condition of a fraile passenger admits, I will as well endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor as hope to give proofe of a bettering in my affections. Hee is an evill Scholler to God and the world, who learns not to improve his talent, they both expect from us according to what we pretend and have, not according to what wee make no show of nor possesse: hee carries a great loade who hath charged himselfe with a great expectation, whether in vertue, curiositie, expense, or oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of knowledge; a little wit, money, or goodnesse, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, sobrietie, and well managing will goe farre, and often finde better ease, plentie and acceptance, then a greater abounding. I would be sorry not to have improved my experience to such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of expence and affections as to bee able and as well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in shortning the one, as stretching out the other beyond a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or common course. Time is an excellent Shoolemaster of <hi>Lezany,</hi> and ought to be of pietie, good improvement in any kind is one of the sweetest pleasures to a good mind, and it is one of the most happy conditions and nearest to God, to actuate a power of beneficence. The greatest felicitie of Princes, is their power to doe good; there is nothing more easie with Gods blessing then for a King and people to flourish in honour and welfare; the more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the consideration that such power should so often miscarry by falling into either unskilfull or ill affected hands; Immense and infinite are the good effects of a power judiciously and constantly well imployed; If the fortune of private men in a constant way of thrift and course succeeds as wee often see, what will good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and industry produce in a State and Kingdome? If wee were as intent to provide remedies for publique as private defaults and inconveniences, Plenty, Justice, Honour, safety, strength, and the contentment of good men would flourish in the world more then they do it shall recompense all improsperitie in my selfe if I may see prosperitie in the service of God, my King, and Country; As he is good, may his Counsell be such and we are happy. Age is a disease and breeds a morositie, yeeres and experience of good and bad, right and wrong, have made me nice and hard to please, whether in diet, conversation, or good order, wee have much adoe to become pleased in our selves, as much in others. It is a discourse that hath been taken up against marriage, I have felt and could say much therein, but it is a jarring string; the best of us are clogs and remora's to our selves, much more to others; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the best of us be so good as we would and should, I will yet wish well to others and bee as good as I can. <hi>Curantem quicquid dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num sapiente bonoque est,</hi> is that I affect to finde in my selfe and

others. Moralitie leads us to faire grounds, Christianitie to the best and soundest; It were well if wee could be constant to either without being at every turne of feare, hope, fancy, and our owne false appearing and flattering advantage, shaken in our resolutions, and abandoning God, Religion and goodnesse. But alas, wee call upon many men to be good, and to be wise, who have it not in their power; they want a conformation and temper of parts, they have <hi>Laesaprincipia, vitiosa praecordia</hi>; It is proper to God alone to bee exempt from error and frailtie. Many men erre by inconsiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and want of Judgement, many by following their inclination and judgement, in nature right, but wanting experience or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall illumination and grace; the first are wholly in the darke, the second want the true light, the first want judgement as well to <note n="*" place="margin">Many of us must seele our errors before we see them, not ever then; we will blame fortune or somewhat else rather than our selves.</note> correct and recollect as at first to discerne and design, the second want not discourse and understanding, but first suffer it to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast by their carelesnesse, sensualitie and affections; the first suffer in their frame, the second in disease, and distemper: no wonder if the first bee incorrigible, they are blind and have it not in them, the other have, but sometimes cannot go about to find it, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will not use it. Though to me errour hath ever been essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, yet at the worst have I never been so dissolute as to enthrall my selfe to the tyranny of any delight, vitious, or other, I have in truth been such a Sceptique as not to have been sure in so much as what was my pleasure, I have brought it to the rest of reason, and judged common delights too base and bestiall for a cultivated soule. But why was not I more scepticall against course of reason, then pleasure, which seemeth to admit of least doubt and dispute? reason is indeed too multiforme, fancy, interest, preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, misunderstanding sway it too much, yet not so farre, but this conclusion may be raised. Experimentall and naturall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences must bee acknowledged, and they who order their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and actions with least prejudice to themselves in either present or future respect may bee tearmed the wisest. But to distinguish, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine according to truth and realitie, <hi>Hic labor hoc opus.</hi> God and nature must and will bee our leaders; God originally, Nature instrumentally; fantasie and discourse are peeces of Nature, and well instructed, well habituated may over-rule her. Perfection of soule consists in found understanding and affections, in conceiving and affecting our selves and other things in due measure and as wee ought; Regulation and moderation are the great businesse, right understanding begets them, and powre in them our practise, God, Justice, Honour rooted in and seasoning our soules will have an influence into, and steere our course and actions; Beautie is not faire, nor received pleasures sweet, but as they insinuate themselves and comply with our predisposed Fancy, which gives them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and tincture. Great and eminent beauties and Physitians are idly supercilious towards such as regard them not; their operation exists much in our conceipt; they are much beholding to Princes

Yet I cannot but compare it to a Rope-dancer whom I have seene doe his tricks, and show his Art in a Sack, if his footing were right, good, if other, hazard for a neck or limbe: But here if their learned blindnesse mistake, the poore paying Patient must suffer.

                     <p>MY true fair-minded Friend; I beleeve you now in labour to Preach and mend the vitious world, I also wish, but little hope to doe it by writing; you sow, and I write in the Sand, wee both dwell at the sign of the Labour in vaine, the <hi>More</hi> will not change his hew, nor the Leopards their spots, they cannot, nay they would not, you shall not perswade them they are blemishes no more then the Lady her affected patches on her face, they are in fashion and appeare faire in their own eyes, as every mans way and pleasure to himselfe: we may lament one anothers endevours, others will deride us, or possibly, some will be so good as say, Well said, well writ, and as they use their feasts, eate, and forget; the sober diet breeds the better nourishment, example is the better Teacher, but it must bee numerous to prevaile; Vertue is grown but a name, and that neither well understood nor agreed on; Some honest men there are, <hi>Rari nantes in gurgite vasto,</hi> they may make much of themselves, and wrap themselves in their own vertue, a habit God knows out of fashion, they are fitter for Cloysters then the worlds traffique, and like square playing Gamesters shall be sure to bee made a prey and sit down by the losse; their strong constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may resist the corruption of the times, they shall not alter them, their innocence shall have as little power (howsoever commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) as fresh waters upon the Seas saltnesse, the worlds antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis may better them, not they the world. But how comes it that so few are honest? is it that perfection must bee as rare and hard in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as in Art? is it that our artificiall confused meat and drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our bodies, and they our soules? is it the perniciousnesse of example in great and powerfull persons, who sway the times and seldome originally attain to riches, honours, and greatnesse by just and honest wayes? Or is it that as some species of creatures are of a perverse and evill nature, such as live by rapine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; such as Apes, Wolves, &amp;c. so man is naturally of a mischievous kind? if so, them may a good natured man be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Monster, and rather an error then perfection of Nature: Is it these, or is it not rather the corruption of our mindes and affections by having changed and perverted Nature from her first purity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Artificiall fancy and affectation of enthralling others and inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves? So that as women are in respect of their attire, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the least part of themselves, the like may bee said of man in the disguise of the minde: So it is, and such punishment is deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in our desertion and rebellion against God and Nature. We are one anothers scourges, wee are scourges to our selves. If you and I and others are rather Sheep then Wolves, let us thank God whose grace it is; let us cloathe our selves in our own wooll, short Pasture will content us for food, little drink more then the dew

They are ugly to God, ugly to goodnesse, often ugly to one another, and ugly to themselves, especially when affliction, sicknesse, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity lets loose that Band-dog, <hi>Conscience,</hi> upon them, which they had formerly in their prosperity tyed up and kept in darknesse and sleep; hating and hated, flattering themselves with strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to one anothers torture for the present, and eternall torment hereafter I leave them, committing you and all good men, the Sheep of God, to his inviolable, infallible protection. <hi>Amen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

I thank you for your visit and spirituall comfort you imparted to my relapsed Son, hee still needeth it, hee hath not wanted naturall heat and courage; temper, moderation, and a well concocted discourse, as well as a thorow digestion to some peccant humours of his body, I feare he doth: Time, and conflict with evills have not confirmed and wrought upon him, exchange of liberty, health, and pleasures, for disease, restraint, and paine, with an apprehensive contemplation of imminent death this mortall yeare, work a melancholick dejection upon his minde, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his infirmity, appeare at this time his greatest danger. A little ease, strength, and alacrity of spirits, animate his naturall presumption to his harm, and a little cloud overcasting him, as much exanimates. If God had not furnished me with as strong a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to flight, as I have ever been apt to apprehend the worst events, I had a thousand times miscarryed; there is no slavery like the feare of death, no bravery like the contempt of the world and fortune; I have lost possessions, friends, brothers, children, but I have found God and have not lost my selfe; I have sowed kindnesse, and reaped dis-respect, my good intentions, charity, resolution and the grace of God are my reward and ever-relieving cordials.

Evills are said not to goe alone, and distempers purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more then their causes; But it is good, as well in state, as soule and bodies, to maintain themselves in such a freedome from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounding in evill humors, that misaccidents when they come, and there can be no security against them, may not endanger the whole
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47776:110"/>
frame; Thus much of cold: but what shall we say in surprises of heat and fire? wee have lately seen many misfortunes thereby, shall we therefore not build, or not make fire to warm our selves? such resolution were to defraud our selves of the naturall commodities of our reason, and discourse, which teacheth us rather to confine and moderate the use of things, then utterly to decline them. It is the property of wilde beasts to feare and fly from fire, and of men to use it. And now to revert something to our other nights discourse of Love, (which certainly hath some Divinity in it, or otherwise it could never, as it doth become a fresh and infinite Theam of our best spirits) Love and anger are the fires of the Soule, if inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as well dangerous, as vitious, shall we therefore shun them as a Plague, whose best antidote is to fly quickly, farre, and return slowly? is love as incompatible with reason as is pretended? and may not Religion, though supernaturall, admit of a naturall and free vertuous affection betwixt the two Sexes? Religion saith, Be angry, but sin not; and is rather a rule to rectifie then extinguish af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they are the wings of the Soule, without an object they are nothing, and without the use of them we fall flat to the ground, like disfeathered birds. The Lady and Nation of Ladies, which your Ladiship mentioned, are not reasonlesse not to bee without a servant, especially such as are or have been beautifull, for it is a commanding Character, certainely instituted for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull entertainment and admiration. It is an unnaturall stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity not to be affected therewith, and a kinde of injury to its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, not to exercise such affection. I ever mean without abuse; but this concludes for women, not for men, our affections have more fire in them, matter more combustible, and women are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as well in effect as in title too much our Mistresses; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and fooles are not allowed to play with fire, it had need be a strong, well-prepared, and well-habituated Soule that entertaines it; we are no Salamanders, to thrive and be safe in the flames. What now ought a man that would be wise, to doe, affecting to give as well his nature as Religion their right? Platonique Love is explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Love is corporeall, and entreth at the eyes. Lust cannot be excluded for an ingredient, which yet admitted, it follows not that it must be predominant, as I discoursed unto you, some other over-ruling affection may contain and represse it, either in a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, civill, or other self-interessed consideration, nay, even in a divers prevailing respect towards the very subject of our love. I can be affected with the objects of my palat and eye, and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare them, burn with a surprizing desire of mortall revenge, and yet refrain: Fear and awe will prevaile even with dogs and beasts, and why not in Love? but how farre this is to be allowed in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, I submit, with a good morrow to your Ladiships more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined discourse, and judgement. I send you the Verses, humbly kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your hands, and end with my Paper.</p>

                     <p>IF I deceive not my self, there is somewhat of power from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, urging my addresse unto you; I have now, by Gods grace, finished that my designe of Verses which I had propounded to my self; they are upon presumption of your Ladiships favour to goodnesse, and your humble servant their Author, at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: expect not the strong Master-pieces and quintessentiall lines, which these curious times, and the refined ambitious Spirits of our age produce, in defiance of Critiques, my births are naturall, easie, and hasty, sometimes foure peeces to my breakfast in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a morning; I am as impatient as any woman of a long and painfull labour; I haste to my journeys end, and can as little hope or goe about to remould any of my first births, as your Ladiships your children once brought to light. I love not Verses of the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged staffe, but wish them fluent and gentle, which was wont to be a commendation. If my walls want strength to support themselves in their naturall stuffe and scope, they shall rather miscarry then borrow the supports of inwrought strange conceits and butteresses of Art: if I would undergoe any affectation, it should be to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over ingenious notions, and materiall, instructive, rationall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, with an ingenuous and genuine elegance, and some depth of prospective in my termes and expressions, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and perspicacity of my Reader. But I am now too old and serious for Verses, and have wholly given them over, only these my late peeces I conceived my self to owe to my Maker, and I am sorry they were not my first fruite, which are more properly his due; <hi>Autumnall</hi> fruits are neither the most pleasant, nor whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; I have in great retirednesse and confusion employed my time of late, in the dissection of my self and fortune, our observations in the Anatomy of the body grow from the opening of others, but of the minde from our selves, as the Starres of heaven and Globe of earth, they are as yet in great uncertainty and undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; some rules we have attained, and Eclipses we can foretell, but for sound and infallible knowledge and judgement, we daily finde our selves as erroneous as our common Almanack-makers, whose prognostiques are as ridiculous as false. And now finding my selfe in motion betwixt heaven and earth, give me leave to impart a contemplation of Characterizing such a perfection as yours, in relation to them; in <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rel.</hi> to the La. R.</note> comelinesse and beauty like the Heavens, in motion regulate, in order faire, powerfull in influence. A well ordered minde resembles the clearenesse, serenity, peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47776:111"/>
and harmony of the upper Spheres, and Crystalline Heaven; a faire built body, the beautifull variety of the earth, delightfull, fruitfull, well drest, and correspondent to the Heavenly motions, in season, order, and constancy; yet such little worlds there are, which seem to enjoy in some exemptions a priviledge above the lower heavens, and the earth; for they are free from storms, scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of heat, nippings of frost, inundations and other disorders; such Comets are sent sometimes to be admired, and to awake the dying vertue and reputation of your sex. <hi>Phidias</hi> an excellent sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, is said to have composed such a <hi>Minerva,</hi> and such a figure of himself in the center of her Target, that the whole work bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, it could be no lesse permanent, then the main peece: I have here presumed to place you as a precious peece of preservation unto me. The abridgement of my story shall now follow like a cloudy storm, after a faire Sun-shine, that I have been most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily miserable more then the outward face of nature, or fortune dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in me, is known to all that know me, but true and secret cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are so obscure, that it hath been even to my self a most intricate disquisition to finde them. Yet, besides what may be attributed to the Starres, Fate, Complexion, and an over-ruling hand, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer papers, though disorderly, I have made to appeare. They may be partly reduced to an unseasonable and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, accidentall, inordinate, and indiscreet use of Treacle, long and unfavourable dysaster, in respect of the Court, where I had my Introduction, a fortune unproportionable to my quality, spirit, and ingaged condition; A minde curious as well to its own furniture, as election of course, and no course obvious or faire unto me, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the distracting ambiguous considerations of my seats; (and above all) for without that I could as well as another have passed over all the rest; a super-induced Melancholy from the abuse of such Treacle, which wholly altered and disanimated me, urging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirednesse, study, thoughts, care, and a distastednesse upon me. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, instead of releeving me, was my bane, over-drawing of blood, and over-working my active minde, brought and held me in such a lownesse and consumption of spirits (whereunto also an over-slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dyet for feare of fatnesse, much conduced) that howsoever a free boldnesse of spirits and conversation was naturall unto me, I have been forced to live so farre under my naturall rate and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Soule, that I wanted spirits to counterlook a Cat, confusion of eyes, memory, and gesture, with infinite other incident malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant symptomes, were the pernicious effects of my disorder; my naturall strength and violence of spirit, aggravated my disease, bred my continuall mischief, and by the same strength and Gods better grace, I as indefatigably resisted and subsisted; long and dangerous Feavours took advantage upon the matter and occasion of my infirmity, other desperate accidents in fortune I suffered, and much more then all this in the contrarieties of my contracted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and misgoverned errours. It hath pleased God as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47776:111"/>
to support me, as by extraordinary and strange wayes to confound, deject, and bring me towards him. No man ever became extream bad in an instant, supernaturall goodnes is harder to effect. Being now at length throughly conscious of my infirmitie and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in all my affections, and as throughly wrought upon by Gods good Spirit and grace, that which I put in execution remained onely fit and necessary for me, which is as this King of <hi>France</hi> hath lately in consideration of extraordinary troubles, and in them as great protections of God towards him and his people, solemnly committed and devoted himselfe and his kingdome unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our blessed Lady, though somewhat preposterously: so have I wholly resigned and consecrated my selfe to God, having withall put off or made indifferent unto mee, all common and worldly affections and ambitions, by meanes whereof I am now as quiet as I have formerly been agitated and troubled; abstinence is often lesse difficult then moderation, diversion is a powerfull meanes of cure, active affections must finde a subject, and there is none so happy, none so satisfactory as God; not to bee affected with goodnesse is not to bee affected with him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne or bee insensible of beautie were to slight one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster peeces: such onely of my ancient concomitances I cast not off; vertue is ever to be prised, but most when fairest set. Grace, goodnesse, and beautie are his brightest beames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring they move to veneration and delight. My thoughts shall at this time no further follow such an alluring subject, what I would be and resolve I declare, what I have been I cannot help, possibly I could not, many solutions are brought against the arguments of Fate, which more confound themselves then avoid it.

It is hard for two ships in motion to hit the one the other; it is true that some see clearer, and are more circumspect then others, yet old and long experienced counsellors are often rejected, as the worst resolvers, they apprehend too much, chance and boldnesse give often the best successe, chance according to us holds a predominancy, but God is all in all.

                     <p>THinking this morning of worldly power and pleasure, and of the pleasure of power, I tooke into consideration what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were conducible and necessary to a happy condition, and grew to state every man in a naturall and just dimension of his proper qualitie. For a man to have a grant of or to assume power and pleasures beyond his capacitie and use, were but supervacuous, troublesome, and often pernicious; That clothing is best that best fits the body, warme, comely, and easie, is I confesse to be wished, more is but cumbersome, enough is affirmed as good as a feast, what am I the better if when a pint is the uttermost my thirst requires, one give me leave to drinke a Tunne? If we suffer our selves to bee transported by an extravagant fancy, wee shall never bee rich; Reason ought to bee as well our bounds as our boast; Limited wee must bee when wee have done what wee can, a man is but a man; if the King would give mee vast possessions and power of life and death beyond my conveniencie, I should value it but an unprofitable load; It is pleasure sufficient to bee out of reall paine, power enough to bee safe, possession enough that corresponds our just occasions, what exceeds runnes more to others use then ours, and serves onely to plunge us to inconvenience and swell our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. The true advantage of power and Riches is the enabling us in meanes of beneficence: To win hearts is indeed a supreame delight to all natures that participate more of God then his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, the devills damnation grew from a sinister affectation of power to doe mischiefe rather then good, our affections are devillish when they terminate not in Charitie: there pitcht my thoughts, thither confin'd I my discourse of power, pleasure, possessions, and the pleasure of power, which casting mee upon the 13.

I have found thy blessings, as well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall as spirituall, in the sustentation of me and my fortunes fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proportionable to the constant moderation of my minde: I am now by Gods grace and the Kings, returned to my home, where Church, Chappell, and my home-stall are like to bound my thoughts and course, the Oeconomy of my Soule and Family will abundantly employ me: Let the Schooles and the world make oftentation of their Ethicks, Politiques, and Theology, whilst I wrap them in my plain habit, and act them in my Soule and life. If I have ever written any thing beneficiall to others in either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, wholsome or Religious discourse, I shall bee glad, but my end was my own provision and discharge; I have been so much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the world, and conversations, that I am no longer fond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, I am neither ignorant of their vanity or solidity, it is no unnecessary Schoole of experience, I have bought it, but am sorry that others with my self have paid for it; It is of no small use un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to me; God, that, and yeares, have taught me so to contract and prune my self of superfluities, that a little root and sap shall stretch further with me, then more with another, and I hope to give proof that God hath not made me incapable of governing my little hive; my minde and studies possibly were larger, but this is the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, easie, and pious course; God, and my unsitnesse for the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gednesse of the time, cut off distractions and make it faire before me; Besides my want of health and failing in my hopes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours of recovery, and others improvement, and due discharge, I have formerly suffered by trusting them too much, and my self too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I have made triall of all performances but my own, to that I am necessitated, and that they have cast me upon; if God and my health enable me, I will so play the super-intendent, as to carry a through tempered eye to all duties, and expenses, making my way as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly easie, and my houshold as undispensably orderly, as I can: The diversions of Fancy which obtrude their service to the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a present perplexed condition, shall no more predominate me; God who knows better then our selves what is best for us, hath contracted, satisfyed, and setled me; I am no more a stranger to the worlds market and my self, nor to seek as I was, in rules of proportion, commodities, and stock to drive an honest Trade. Few servants, religiously and orderly affected and chosen, make much of a little; and be they never so few or hard to finde, others I will not admit nor continue. My Friends shall be so entertained and welcome, that by their curious and wastefull reception, I make them not in effect my enemies, and fare the worse a moneth to feast them for a meale. This is my intention and resolution: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I implore my good God to continue propitious unto me, and I desire no other worldly felicity: to him the Authour and perfecter of all blessings, be all glory, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

Our forefathers were not yet without reason, who meeting with a world and wildernesse of woods and wastes, assigned an otherwise uselesse part thereof to Parkes and Forests: It is not so with us; want of Tymber and Woods will tame our wildenesse, and reduce us to an usefull compasse. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Land bought dearer then I have paid for my own, (may house and land prove more happy to my Successours) how many years of my life it hath cost me, I know not, nor much (as the world is) care. This and much more, retirednesse, Melancholy, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47776:115"/>
have brought upon me, yet considering how ill a wandring or publique course of life would suite with mee I choose rather to suffer and compose as well as I may all incommodities within my selfe, then to expose my selfe to such as others finde, and thrust themselves into abroad, and which would bee to mee more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. Quiet is not ill bought at any reasonable rate: <hi>Vt habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as quietum tempus, perde aliquid de tuo jure,</hi> is a saying, which if the Spaniard had practised even to the quitting of the 17. Provinces, or I in sitting downe by some forbearances, wee might possibly have been both more at ease. God hath given him a strong state of dominions, and me of body and mind, to our owne as well trouble as subsistence; Hee maintaines his strength by exercise, and so have I done by extraordinary motion, agitation and disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, such as to a man of an evener minde and fortune then mine are I confidently affirme shall keepe in health, strength, free from great inconvenience of colds, feavers, fulnesse, or putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors, &amp;c. vigor of spirits, and length of life, better then <hi>Lessius</hi> or <hi>Cornarus</hi> their staticall diet, which is most unnaturall, servile, subject by their owne confession to great distemper upon the least change, or excesse, (whereas the other comports with any tolerable diet) prescribed in reason rather for Monkes, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Votaries and persons of a sedentary life, then such as are to use the world and labour. Thus much have I written in this early of the morning as hastily and wildly, and perhaps to as little purpose as Foresters follow their chase: which to my owne better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and use of my selfe and mine may it please God to blesse. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you are at leisure, I will tell you my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings dream, which was, that in the quality of a Soliciter for Old <hi>England,</hi> in a cause that concerned him for limme, life, land, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which were all drawn to stake, by I know not what Promooter, I cast my eye on a Friend as I rode into <hi>York,</hi> with the Chiefe Justice of Assize there to be held, and desired him to help me to some good Counsellors to plead for me; he lookt about him, and spyed some portlike men, riding on <hi>Scotch</hi> pads, but said they were not for me, for they favour'd of the others near them were on hard <hi>Scotch</hi> saddles, but had long since given desperate the cause of Old <hi>England,</hi> and were now packing and posting for <hi>New-England</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Providence.</hi> Some he saw upon <hi>French</hi> pads, who came this Circuit only for Company, to laugh, make good cheer, and advantage of the times, but not to meddle till the cause became their own. A greater number were mounted on the <hi>French</hi> great Saddle, with Pistols at the Bow, but my desires were peace, and their word was <hi>Vive la guerre.</hi> Then the <hi>Spanish Morocco</hi> men presented themselves to our view hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to me, for Warre was both naturall and profitable unto them. Next I eyed a grave Gown-man, fitting in Croop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a side Saddle, I liked him for a good forward man, but my Friend told me he was a <hi>Scotch</hi> Bishop, and had too much to doe for himself. Not farre from him rode a pretty pert luking man, upon a lean bare horse back, and I was informed he was a <hi>Scotch</hi> Recusant, and could not speak good <hi>English.</hi> Then I observed a Coach drawn by six Mules, with well-stuffed provender bagges at their noses, a long-Coated Postillion, with Pistols upon the foremost, a solemne robed personage, in place of Coach-man, the first a short whip in his hand, the second a long one which was somewhat tangled in the carriage, a company of Gown-men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, concerning whom I enquired, and found the fore-men were Church-men Militant and Triumphant, and those in the Coach were High-Commissioners, and the Kings learned Counsell, who were not used to plead in common Causes. After them came a company of plain fellows upon Pack-saddles, who proved to be out of favour for the present; yet followed on in hope of better Grace. In this distresse I fastened on one of my <hi>New Englanders,</hi>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:47776:117"/>
and prayed him for old <hi>Englands</hi> sake to stay his journey, and speak for me: he replyed, his tale would not be heard, and that he came this way only for his safety to defend himself and no body else: Whereat in great despaire, I asked if there were no conceit of a kinde of Parliament to be held here. My Friend told mee no, and that another <hi>Faux</hi> had long since blown up that hope with white Gun-powder. One while he advised me to sue in <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> and procure my self Counsell to be assigned, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-while to suffer my selfe to be non-suited for this time, pay charges and expect a better advantage; But at last he encouraged me, saying, that counsell or not, I needed not to be dismayed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Judge was both good and wise, and too much interested himself in the consequence of my cause, not to relieve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate me, which gave me such a joy of heart, that I awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>

                     <p>AS I travailed along in my earthly pilgrimage to the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi> accompanied according to my wishes by a good old Minister or Priest of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, (I know not now how to terme him) there crost upon us in our way a supercilious perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage with an high cornerd bonnet (his name and nature did little agree) who questioning our intentions told us wee were out of our way, and that if wee would take him for guide and company, hee would carry us a sure smooth and pleasant way to our Journeys end, and if wee turned a little aside now and then it should bee at his charges, wee should not need to trouble our thoughts, hee would take all the care: Hee was witty-facetious company, and when my old companion would have replyed, I told him I thought hee was but in jest, and not to be dealt withall in good earnest, for whatsoever he pretended hee had a plot upon us for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and wished to take our leaves of him, for hee had a Pistoll by his side that hee trusted to beyond his wit, which was great pitie; and what ever good companion hee seemed, he would make roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat of us if wee appeared not in every thing of his mind, and that all our good and true heart to God ward would not excuse us: whereupon leaving him and walking on, there crosses upon us on the other hand, as wee found him upon speech, a <hi>Banbury</hi> man who scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to desire our company, but taking notice of our designe told us wee held too much of the left hand, that his was the onely right course and (whatsoever wee thought) not so rough and uneasie as some esteemed it, with much more; wee thanked him and told him his Sabbath day wayes and ours lay not together, and that if
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47776:118"/>
hee would have been lesse nice and censorious over good men (none of his Brotherhood) and more sociably attractive hee might have had more company along with him. Then crosseth us againe on the first hand an odde kind of person, I knew not well whence hee came, nor whither hee would, his fashion and habit were likewise ambiguous, sometimes formall and cringing, and sometimes staggering and licentious, hee forsooth would have eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us out of our beaten path into a pretended better discovered by-way of his finding out, telling us it would prove much for our ease and forwardnesse: wee were thankfull for his good will, but told him wee did not love to follow wee knew not whither, and that his course sided something too much with the high cornered cap whose company wee had considerately forsaken. Our next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter from the second right hand country was a grave man in the <hi>Geneva</hi> print, a little more conformable and lesse rigid then hee of <hi>Banbury,</hi> hee tooke notice of our voyage, and much desired our company, intimating unto us that his way lay close by ours, but was much more plaine, certaine, and peaceable, as having more of <hi>terra firma</hi> then the inconstancy of a floting Iland: hee said hee had an invariable sure Cart and Compasse to direct us, and that hee was sorry to see us English whom hee loved, so apt to change that wee might bee as well painted with a paire of sheares in our hand for our Religion as our cloathing, that wee never knew when wee were well, and that it was ever a great fault with us to bee apt to overdoe, that ceremonies and indifferences grew so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall unto us that it was to bee feared Religion it selfe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at last with us, but a ceremonious formalitie. Hee wooed us heartily and somewhat to the purpose, telling us he had no ends upon us but our journeys end, that hee would not trouble us with much complement, but much desired our company, which if wee refused, we should bee in danger of being entised or forced and justled out of our way, which was already also growne so little trodden that it was hard to hold: with our thankes wee dismissed him, telling him that having as sure a Cart and Compasse as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and as learned and pious directors as hee or any other, wee doubted not of our way, which wee had hitherto found right and good, but if wee met with force and opposition wee would carry such an eye towards him that being as well in breath (otherwayes called spirit) as the best, wee would soone overtake him: his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement was little, ours not much more, and so with heartie short and comely prayers for our welfare, and industrious instructions, which none of the other would afford, (except the second, who was very tedious to us in terror and threats) wee parted, continuing our way with a resolution not to stumble at every straw, nor bee drawne by any zealous example or otherwise to leape over scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Christ-masse blocks.</p>

                     <p>I Have gotten a little leave of absence from the Parliament, to lay hold of your promise for the favour of a visit, and I hope not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all feares the carriage of affaires will be such as to give no suddaine occasion of my recall: Gods grace and his Majesties wisdome, goodnesse, and constancy, must be the Authours of our happinesse, our distractions and distempers are otherwise such in the State Ecclesiastick, Civill, and Military, our spirits in all parts so peremptorily and uncharitably divided, men so superabounding in their own sense, and so little indulgent, and communicable to others, and parties daily growing to a stiffer opposition, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a prop I should utterly despair of any good or quiet: If some men chance to finde a strength rising against them, they may partly blame themselves in their reservednesse, a Cause may be starved at Law for want of fees, and so may power by being over-sparing in a winning familiarity, it is harsh to a noble Nature to think it self slighted, a good Judgement may manage it self in an open free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without profusion or betraying the bottome, and there is the greater need to use it where there is little else to pay.</p>
                     <p>It is true that the King may seem to have made himself a great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, by giving ground so much from the way of his former course, but it must first be cleared, that it was the right way of his advantage, and well examined, others, more their own Friends then his, may prove the greater losers, and his parting may be like <hi>Abrahams</hi> in the conclusion, rather with the Ramme then the Childe: The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Laws of <hi>England</hi> are no such churles, and niggards to their Prince, as not to leave him a Royall power, and splendid state: but there must be at this time more then leaving, after so much alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, exhaustion, and contraction of debts, there must be a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull supply and support, this indeed after all our other payments, will be a work, but so it must, nor doe <hi>I</hi> doubt but suddainly it will be vigorously undertaken, if new jealousies interpose not themselves. His Majesties condition requires it, his goodnesse deserves it, and his faithfull Subjects affection, duty, and reputation can doe no lesse. It is true, that we have already had a long time, and paid dearely for it; possibly there might have been a better husbanding, but a good end will make all good, and for the best. As I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Grace of God, and wisdome of his Majesty, which have hitherto assisted us, are my hope and confidence, the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Kingdome doth as yet extraordinarily need them: The consideration of Divine Service, Episcopacy, and Recusants, in

the scandall that these late times have drawn upon them (or they upon the times) is yet to be regulated, and the conceived offence and danger, springing from them, to be prevented; this you will say is a businesse, and the greater by the greatnesse of the parties se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally affected in them: For the Common Prayer Book, you know how the <hi>Scots</hi> esteem it, multitudes of our own growing in all parts no lesse incurably impatient of it; Bishops are in the same predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but so much worse, by how much a dead Letter hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so much imputed to it for our past troubles, nor apprehended from it for a future propension to Popery. But it may be said, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish then the men without rejecting that calling which certainly is more ancient then the Papacy; and that surely might serve, if there were not such a connaturality in the reasons for the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that admitting the one, the other will ever bee in danger to follow, as hath been seen: The Common-Prayer-Book hath also unquestionably much good in it, but the scandall considered, whether another forme of another tenure and extraction, more of a peece, and conform to the other Reformed Churches, be not more fit and necessary to our quiet, I referre to better judgements. Gods Service and Worship is the substantiall and Morall part. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy, and this or that Form, but the Ceremoniall, and I would be sorry to see cutting of throats for Discipline and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie: Charity ought to yeeld farre in things indifferent: But must all the yeelding be on the Governours part? God forbid, that we should yeeld to every fanatical opinion, and to fal into a way of <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> without any set Form of Directory or Liturgy. Freedom of zeale, and inspiration may be reserved to the Sermon, or an after Prayer, without engagement through the whole time of convention, to go along and say <hi>Amen, upon surprise.</hi> The other great bodies of Reformed Churches, are in great part prescript and regulate; and as the ancient <hi>Druides</hi> who ruled the Religion of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> were said to hold their chiefe seat in the Isle of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> so may his Majesty, I perswade my self without going farther then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of his Crown of <hi>England,</hi> take from his Islands of <hi>Gern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> and <hi>Iersey,</hi> in this rare necessary some such modell (at least with little alteration) as may fit his greater Island, and immaterially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our Brother Churches. But howsoever, it is necessary to come to a resolution, and settlednesse, whereby to prevent the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous spreading of obstinate Sects, which are said to grow too much upon us, amongst which multiplicity it is somewhat strange unto me, not to heare of any <hi>Lutherans,</hi> considering our late Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was according to her Country, conceived that wayes affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now for our Recusants they have Petitions in Parliament to move a relaxation of the Lawes, and a Commiseration in their behalfe. And truely for the better and devoutest sort (such as turne not their Religion into wantonnesse and malice) I am moved to pity them, but as they affect to move us to pity them, I wish they would no lesse reflect upon us, and consider the troubles and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable

condition that their leaders have affected, and will ever affect to draw upon us, and what a difference there would be in what we should suffer from them in respect of that being and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation which they have injoyed amongst us, to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Inquisition against us, I referre you: Charity begins at home, and let them in the first place pity their abused selves, let them crave the pity of their Pope and Priests, who for their own unjustifiable ends are guilty of all their sufferings. I spare them who spare no man, and whose policy, incompatible with all Monarchy and Government but their own, enforceth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of others, in the preservation of their true faith to God, and their own safety: Thus after my manner, I runne and write, with a light hand, I touch, but not to the quick; You who carry a Key of my thoughts can further open mee, and will, I hope, as you use, bee indulgent unto mee: <hi>London,</hi> and the Parliament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford much company, but to mee little conversation; I am now in an opener Aire, and with you I lye more open. The truth is, Carriages have been so Cabalisticall of all sides, so unpleasant, and inconvenient to participate or comply with, that being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued to a concurrency of results, I found enough to doe to look to my self, as little desirous to counsell, as affected, or thought fit to bee called unto it: No man ever acted lesse, or suffered more, then by my infirmity I have done this Parliament; My good God hath still wonderfully supported mee, and it may bee all to the best. Much good may others finde, and wee in them by their advancement. My ends are onely to keep my self an honest man, with an untainted Conscience and Reputation, nor am I, as I hope, unhappy therein, at least from the best. A faire and quiet retrait from the world, and worldly cares, hath long been, as you know, and still is, all my ambition, it is easier to wish then to finde; my appetite to the world was never much, (howsoever I have appeared) if ever it had been any thing, it is now past; My conversation is more in the other world then this; and that the rather, seeing (if my distaste misleads mee not) the generality of mens spirits is not possessed with that sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Courtesie, Familiarity, Indulgencie, and love to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as was wont to bee.

                     <head>A sodaine, free and opportune discourse to the present 28. of March, 1641.</head>
                     <p>OUr weather is said to have been much more gentle then in the more Southerly neighbouring parts, the entrance of the Spring proves faire and more seasonable then of late yeares, our stormes and distempers possesse our spirituall and politique part; This Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is our Crisis and time of Physick, which if unlucky our State is desperate, and health in truth is never to bee despaired till the body cannot beare the remedy: acute and pressing diseases hardly admit of long and preparative courses, and often as little of violence: the faire and just temper of our Spirits hath cast us upon more regular, though longer wayes of reformation and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the practise of former more tumultuous times, but in the meane time our Physick and Physitians prove so costly as offends, whilst it mends: such may bee the Peccant humours, as the body may be sooner overthrown then they extirpate; to put off the present paroxysmes, induce a good diet, and abate predominant maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, may possibly suffice to overcome danger, and exempt the body from being obnoxious to every residing venome. Our disease hath consisted in the troubles of our Church and liberties; for Church matters, as we have gone slowly on, so still they stick in our own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions. God be praised, our differences are rather about discipline then doctrine, and certainly so far as the Scripture prescribes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent generall rule therein, it must and ought to prevaile, where it leaves a latitude, wee may respect our selves and the times, not without charitie to others scruples, and as farre as may bee an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of conformitie and harmony with other reformed Churches; if our Bishops would have held the same course, it might have been better for them and us: we shall hardly attaine quiet without hearing all parties amongst our selves, nor are there wanting divers learned Ministers of other Nations resident with us: Judgement of private discretion holds a necessary sway in particular mens election to what Church they will incline, nor doe I see why a considerable number may not bee admitted to the same libertie. I meane the body and head of a Kingdome howsoever Layick: The Clergy having ever overmuch assumed to bee judge and party in their owne concernings hath ever bred a great disturbance in the world. Wee are now by Gods grace and the Kings in a happy way; Peace and truth are likely to kisse, may justice and mercy as well: wee are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an indissoluble conjunction of King and people, <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> reconcilement in Religion, and a marriage with the young Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his Majesties eldest daughter. And now as it hath pleased the Almightie miraculously to effect, that Scotland and England severally within themselves have passed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thorough their late great troubles, as also their forces raised
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47776:123"/>
one against the other with an in consider able bloodshed, how happy I say would it be if any expedient &amp; securitie could be found to save time, cost, and blood, with a celebration of all these happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summations in some other accommodation, such as a submission to Fine, Banishment, exclusion from all publick businesses and advises, to the satisfaction of justice upon transcendent misdemeanors, and this to bee the better assured by manucaption of friends, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Pitie it were that this expected Jubile should not passe, if reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, without staine of blood: and surely His Majestie is too good and wise ever to readmit (though it were left free unto him) Ministers so hatefull, prejudged and unhappy, as they who now are questioned have been unto him; But this is rather my wish then conclusion and hope. I have in my hasty unaffected manner disburdened my selfe, I have I thanke God no affection or passion, but what is requisite to a good Christian, Subject, and Patriot, so in despight of all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicacy and sinister misconstruction I will ever bee found, and so I submit to better judgements.</p>
