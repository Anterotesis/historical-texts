            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>IN searching famous Chronicles,</l>

               <l>A worthy storie strange and true,</l>
               <l>whereto I tooke good heed:</l>
               <l>Betwixt a Farmer and his Sonne,</l>
               <l>this rare example standes:</l>
               <l>Which wel may moue the hardest harts</l>

               <l>in <hi>Paris</hi> for to dwell:</l>
               <l>Where he became a Marchant man,</l>
               <l>and traffique great he vsd,</l>
               <l>So that he was exceeding rich,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>For hauing now the world at will,</l>
               <l>his mind was wholly bent,</l>

               <l>did set his action fast.</l>
               <l>There lay he locke in Irons strong,</l>

               <l>Unable while his life did last,</l>

               <l>Deare Father come therefore with speed</l>
               <l>and rid me out of thrall,</l>
               <l>And let me not in prison die,</l>
               <l>sith for your helpe I call.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The good old man no sooner had,</l>
               <l>perusde this written scrowle:</l>
               <l>But trickling teares along his cheeks</l>
               <l>from watry eyes did rowle:</l>
               <l>Alas my Sonne, my Sonne quoth he</l>
               <l>in whom I ioyed most:</l>
               <l>Thou shalt not long in prison be,</l>
               <l>what euer it doth cost.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Two hundred heads of well fed beasts</l>
               <l>he changed then for gold:</l>
               <l>Foure hundred quarters eke of corne,</l>
               <l>for siluer there he sold.</l>
               <l>But all the same could not suffize,</l>
               <l>that haynous debt to pay:</l>
               <l>Till he at length constrained was,</l>
               <l>to sell his land away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then was his Sonne released quite,</l>
               <l>his debt discharged cleane,</l>
               <l>And left likewise as well to liue,</l>
               <l>as he before had been.</l>
               <l>Then went his louing Father home,</l>
               <l>who for to helpe his Sonne,</l>
               <l>Had sold his lyuing quite away,</l>
               <l>and eke him selfe vndone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So that he lyued poore and bare,</l>
               <l>and in such extreame need,</l>
               <l>That many times he wanted food,</l>
               <l>his hungry corpes to feed:</l>
               <l>His Sonne meane time in silkes did swim</l>
               <l>whose substance now was such:</l>
               <l>That sure within the Cittie walles,</l>
               <l>few men were found so rich.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But as his goods did still increase,</l>
               <l>and riches in did slide,</l>
               <l>So more and more his hardned hart,</l>
               <l>did swell in hatefull pride:</l>
               <l>But it befell vpon a time,</l>
               <l>when ten yeeres woe was past,</l>
               <l>Unto his Sonne he did repaire,</l>
               <l>for some reliefe at last.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And being come vnto his house,</l>
               <l>in very poore aray,</l>
               <l>It chaunced so that with his Sonne,</l>
               <l>great states should dine that day.</l>
               <l>The poore old man with Hat in hand,</l>
               <l>did then the Porter pray,</l>
               <l>To shew his Sonne that at the gate,</l>
               <l>his Father there did stay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Wherat this proud disdainfull wretch</l>

               <l>He wept, he waild, he wrong his hands</l>

               <l>Woe worth the time when first of all</l>
               <l>thy body I espide:</l>
               <l>Which hast in hardnes of thy hart,</l>
               <l>the Fathers face denide.</l>
               <l>But now behold how God that time,</l>
               <l>did shew a wonder great,</l>
               <l>Euen when his son with al his friends</l>
               <l>were setled downe to meate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For when the fairest Pie was cut,</l>
               <l>a strange and dreadfull case,</l>
               <l>Most vglie Toads came crawling out</l>
               <l>and leaped in his face.</l>
               <l>Then did the wretch his fault confesse</l>
               <l>and for his Father sent,</l>
               <l>And then his great ingratitude,</l>
               <l>full sore he did repent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All vertuous Children learne by this,</l>
               <l>obedient hartes to show:</l>
               <l>And honour still your Parents deare,</l>
               <l>for God commaundeth so,</l>
               <l>And thinke how God did turne his meate</l>
               <l>to poysond Toades indeed:</l>
               <l>Which did his Fathers face denie,</l>
               <l>because he stood in need.</l>
