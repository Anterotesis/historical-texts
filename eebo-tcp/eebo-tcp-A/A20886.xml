            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then diuers traitorous and dangerous
Papers were ſhewen, which had bin taken
in his cuſtody, and whereof he would gladly
haue acquitted himſelfe, but that they were
manifeſtly prooued to be his. One of them
ſeemed to bee <hi>Parſons</hi> opinion, concerning
the oath in the late made Statute, which he
vtterly diſalowed any Catholique to take,
appearing to haue vſed the Popes cenſure
therein, wherevppon the Bull or Breefe to
that purpoſe ſeemeth to take effect.</p>
            <p>The others were alſo of traytrous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
tending to the abuſe and corrupting
of poore ſimple ſoules, and ſtealing all duty
&amp; allegeance from them. There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
two Letters openly read, the one from
certaine Prieſtes, Priſoners ſometimes in
the <hi>Clinke,</hi> to the Arch-Prieſt maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
requiring his iudgement in matters,
when they laboured and hoped for tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Religion: The other was Maiſter
<hi>Blackwels</hi> anſwer therto, both which though

what reckoning he made of them.</p>
            <p>When he had anſwered for himſelfe ſo
much as he could, relying ſtill vppon his
Prieſthood, &amp; vrging that to be the cheefeſt
matter of his offence, though many times
the contrary was deliuered to him: the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:10492:5"/>
paſſed vppon him, founde him guilty of
high Treaſon, whereupon he was ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
till the time of Iudgement: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was not til Wedneſday following,
it ſhall not be much differing from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,

in Alderſgate ſtreete, in the companie of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

impatience.</p>
            <p>

But it was deliuered in euidence that ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
concerning Religion paſſed beetweene them,
wherein <hi>Morris</hi> touched <hi>Lloyd</hi> to be a diſſembler, as
neither hot nor cold, but if any thing at all, it was
(indeed) beſt affected to Popery, as afterwarde it
plainely appeared. It happened that the lie was
retorted between them, which vrged <hi>Morris</hi> to caſt
a cuppe of Wine in <hi>Lloyds</hi> face, and <hi>Lloyd</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

A further and more dangerous ſtrife had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

beeing preſent, did ſo diſcreetely deale with them,
that they grew friends againe, drank to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and no hart-burning outwardly perceiued:
till at the length, <hi>Lloyd</hi> renewing remembrance
of the former ſpeeches, a more heauier falling out
had thereon hapned, but that the friendes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pacified them again, but yet menacing words

he pleaded, that hee did all this, but in hys

            <p>All this which hath bin breefelie reported
being much more circumſtantially deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

face: he ſought to extenuate his offence by
verie ſhalow ſpeeches, vtterly impertinent,
and moſt againſt himſelfe. in due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

bin a man of more dangerous quality, then

            <p>It was alſo told him, how farre hee had

in all which, the mercie of his Maieſty had

And ſo at Tyborne he did in like manner,
calling to Romaine Catholickes to praye
with him and for him, but no other prayers
would he accept of. But the Lawe hauing
cenſured him, and Iuſtice likewiſe beeing

made ſuch a free confeſſion, of the Oathes
lawfulnes, and ſafety in taking, himſelfe
was willed to take the Oath, which he had
thus cenſured: to let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world perceiue now
publickly, whether his hand and hart held
true correſpondence together, and whether
he were ſo honeſt and good a Catholick, as
but to expreſſe the loyalty of a Subiect, and
giue <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due. Now plainly appeared
both what he and ſuch of his profeſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
are, for he plainly refuſed to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Oath, hauing the Booke deliuered into his
owne hands, and willed to take and aledge
what exceptions he could againſt any part
or particle of the Oath, his anſwere was,
that hee did but deliuer his opinion of the
Oath, what any good or honeſt Catholick,
might do, excluding himſelf out of any ſuch
titles: neither (quoth he) can it be any waye
aduantageable to me, being condemned as
I am, &amp; therefore I haue no reaſon to take
it. But then to meet iuſtly with ſuch cuning
diſſembling, and equiuocating, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
ſuch apparant falſhood: that no leſſe

<hi>Henry Mountague,</hi> Knight, Recorder of the

Citty of London, as he had many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſo ſtill he continued, in diſplaying the
ſubtil ſlights of ſo dangerous a perſon, and
what hurt enſued to the ſtate by ſuch as he
was. To driue him nowe from theſe ydle
ſuggeſtions, and to lay open the kings moſt
Royall Mercy, though not ſo much (as in
<hi>Truth it deſerued yet ſufficiently able to conuince
ſuch impudence: he told him, that he was a poore
Miniſter of Iuſtice vnder his Maieſty, and hadde
ſuch true acquaintance with his euer-royall</hi> and
mercifull inclination, that harty ſorrow or
repentance in an offender, no ſooner coulde
be diſcerned, but he was euen as readie to
giue pardon and forgiuenes, and rather did
ſuperabound in grace, then ſéek after blood,
and therefore willed him to let all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there perceiue, whether he would accept
of this proffered grace or no. Nay more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
euery one was not acquainted with
the Oath contained in the Statute, and
(perchance) might conceite otherwiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

This Oath, which no good ſubiect will
refuſe to take, hauing beene very audibly
read, well neare in the perfect hearing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one there preſent, hee was required to
alleadge or inferre againſt any part thereof
what he could. But he inſiſting vainely, as
he had done before, that hee had but giuen
his opinion thereof for others, and refuſing
vtterly to take it himſelfe, gaue euident and
manifeſt teſtimony, that ſuch Prieſtes as
himſelfe was, were not included in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ranke
of honeſt or good Catholikes, but apparant
Traitors to the King and ſtate, in ſaying
one thing, and dooing the contrary, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an outward ſhew of duty &amp; obedience
vnder hand writing, and reſeruing a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous
intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their cloſe boſome Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the groſſe deceiuing and abuſing of too
many ouer-credulous ſoules (being falſely
perſwaded of ſuch men, otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are indeede) is very much to be pittied and
lamented: for they do but iudge by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
habit of ſmooth ſanctitie and holines
and not by the cloſe ſeducing of them and
their ſoules. Religion is the Cloake caſt
ouer intended treaſon, and holy proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hide hollow harted practiſes, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilliſh
then (in plaine meaning) can eaſily
be doubted, and far more dangerous, then
weake capacities are able to diſcouer, as
very excellently and elegantly, was there
plainely approued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10492:12"/>
Another allegation alſo (as impertinent)
did <hi>Drewrie</hi> make, in ſaying: that a French
Prieſt, or a Spaniſh Prieſt, comming into
this land, to exerciſe their function at either
of their Lord Ambaſſadors, or otherwiſe,
they might in like manner be tearmed trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
whereat all the by-ſtanders were euen
ready to hiſſe him, Knowing very well, and
as it was with good diſcretion anſwered
him, that ſuch prieſts, neither were, or could
be reckoned ſubiects to this ſtate, nor were
they enabled to deale in ſuch daungerous
manner with our people, wanting our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and credit in ſuch a caſe to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
them, as (by their ſlye inſinuating)
they being borne ſubiects, &amp; credited more
then beſeemed, did too much preuaile by.
And as freely might ſuch Ambaſſadours
haue men of ſpiritual office about them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their owne country, as ours are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the like, within their Maiſters Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.
So that ſtill he wold haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that Prieſthood, and not the treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
complotting and practiſes of Prieſts,
in his vnderſtanding, was to bee helde for
Treaſon. The ſame grace &amp; fauor which
had beene before extended to <hi>Drewrie,</hi> in as
ample meaſure was offered to <hi>Dauies</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prieſt, and hee was demaunded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would take the Oath or no. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
that he was a poore ſimple ignorant
man, and could hardly cenſure what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:10492:13"/>
belonged. For there were many learned
Prieſts, whoſe iudgements (in this caſe) he
would firſt know, &amp; then perhaps hee might
be otherwiſe altered. Wherein appeareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
one onely <hi>Romiſh</hi> rule and obſeruation, is a
leſſon or direction to them all, and the Buls
or Breues of the Pope, are more regarded
and reſpected by them, then the natiue loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and obedience, they owe to their King
and Country. But mercy hath beene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mild
too long, and won no ſuch grace from,
as iuſtly was expected, but rather hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them with more boldneſſe &amp; inſolence,
then either is fit in them to offer, or ſtandes
with the wiſedome of ſo great a ſtate to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure:

and indicious admonition was made
vnto them, containing breefely the many
&amp; extraordinarie great graces of the kings
Maieſtie towarde menne of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and howe after graunting them firſt
his free and generall pardon, hee neuer left
off, but purſued them ſtill with all fauours
that could bee deuiſed, as not deſiring the
death of any one, but rather to liue quietly,
like a godly, peacefull, and religious King:
<pb facs="tcp:10492:13"/>
not enacting any new or ſeuere Lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch daungerous Perſons, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfieng
and confirming them that he found

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
and enforced to make againſt them.
And yet the Iuſtice of thoſe Lawes, which
had beene of ſeauen and twenty yeers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
before, his Maieſtie did forbeare
to execute: and finding manye, whoſe
liues lay vnder the forfeit of the law, not
onely did hee remitte them in grace, but
likewiſe gaue his free pardon to all: Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſo manie as were in durance away at
his own coſt and charge, and publiſhing the
like offer to all other, that woulde except of
ſo kind a benifit: as loath to meddle with
their blood, that were enemies to his life,
and deſirous to win them by mercy, if they
were not too monſtrous. Nor hath he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
any Prieſt with death ſince his
comming to the Crowne, but ſuch as were
men of moſt dangerous qualitie, &amp; had their
hands ouer deep in moſt barbarous &amp; inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

will ſerue, to keepe ſuch dangerous men out

The many and excelent parts contained
in Maiſter Recorders learned and elegant
ſpeech, I am not able to ſet downe, and
therefore doe humbly craue fauour, for but
glauncing as theſe few: which thogh they

haue fauour to ſpeak, and (moſt honorably)
it was anſwerd that he might, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings
mercy was neuer too late: therefore he was
willed, not to trifle the time in friuolous
ſpeeches, but if he would yet take the Oath,
do it. and afterward ſpeak what further he
would, which made al the ſtanders by, euen
confounded with amazement, that Grace
ſhould be ſo aboundantly offered vnto ſuch
froward and wilfull refuſers. <hi>Drewrie</hi> wold
not yeeld to take the Oath, whereupon the
