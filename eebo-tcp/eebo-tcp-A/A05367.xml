         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

touching my self, and the reasons
<pb facs="tcp:13691:4"/>
that have moved me to the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these ensuing Treatises.</p>
            <p>The middlemost of which, as it
was first written in order of time,
so it was in translation; and therefore
I will begin with it.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>George Herbert</hi> of blessed
memorie, having at the request of a
Noble Personage translated it into
English, sent a copie thereof, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moneths before his death, unto
some friends of his, who a good while
before had given an attempt of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
themselves in matter of <hi>Diet:</hi>
Which, although it was after a very
imperfect manner, in regard of that
exact course therein prescribed; yet
was of great advantage to them, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they were enabled, through
the good preparation that they had
thus made, to go immediately to the
practise of that pattern, which <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narus</hi>
had set them, and so have
reaped the benefit thereof, in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and eminenter manner then could

in so short a space.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13691:4"/>Not long after, <hi>Lessius</hi> his book,
by happie chance, or, to speak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by gracious providence of the
<hi>Authour of Health</hi> and all other
good things, came to their hands:
Whereby receiving much instruction
and confirmation, they requested from
me the Translation of it into English.
Whereupon hath ensued what you
shall now receive.</p>
            <p>It was their desire to have the
Translation entire; and finding no
just reason to the contrary, 1 have
been willing to satisfie them therein.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r <hi>Herbert</hi> professeth, and so it
is indeed apparant, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to leave out something out of
<hi>Cornarus:</hi> but it was not any thing
appertaining to the main subject of the
book, but chiefly certain extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

               </gap> of the Authour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Reformation of Religion,
which in his time was newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
Neither his old blinde zeal,
nor the new and dangerous profession
of <hi>Lessius,</hi> will (as we hope) breed
any scandal or discredit to these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

of them, with any discreet and

both <hi>Papists,</hi> and the one of them a
<hi>Jesuite,</hi> is no prejudice to the truth
of what they write concerning <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance:</hi>

of the Authours, but rather to
give notice thereof; esteeming, that
as Treakle is made of Vipers, so
from this very poysonous superstition
on their parts, an excellent Cordiall
may be extracted, for the benefit of
all that truely feare God, and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire to serve him: who cannot but
make a conscience of being <hi>inferiour</hi>

will not finde any cause of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at his commendation of some
persons, or institutions, nor at his
use of some kinde of phrases answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Religion. That which was
of notorious scandal, hath received
correction. In those thing which may
receive a favourable construction, or
are not of any great moment, it hath
not been thought fit to make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;

<hi>Monkes</hi> are perhaps offensive to
weak mindes, that have onely heard
of the superstition and villanie of
the late professours thereof, and have
not heard, or do not beleeve the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue
and true holinesse of those in the
Primitive times. But since they are
not brought in here for proof of any
controversall points, but onely as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to confirm the vertue and
<pb facs="tcp:13691:6"/>
power of <hi>Temperance,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Health;</hi> there
is so little cause of scandal to the
most scrupulous-minded that can be,
as it must needs be interpreted desire
of quarrell and contention in any that
shall sound Alarm on this ground.
And for the surer binding of such

               </gap>hing fingers (if any such shall be)
to the Peace, I have thought it not
amisse to make use of the <hi>Decree</hi> of
that Great <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>Law,</hi> the lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>Vicount S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Albans,</hi> as I finde it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
in his Book which he entitles,
<hi>The Historie of Life and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, serving not onely to bear
me out in this particular, but sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
ratifying the whole busines, I
have thought fit to prefix as a generall
Approbation; sheltring my self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as upon a warrant under the
great <hi>Seal</hi> of Learning and Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>And so I come to the third Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
which is added to the other,
as a banquet of Iunkets after a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Feast. The Authour thereof was
<pb facs="tcp:13691:6"/>
an <hi>Italian</hi> of great reputation, living
in the same age which <hi>Cornarus</hi> did.
The change of the time, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of our fashions, hath necessarily
caused some alterations and additions
in the English translation, to make it
more Domzon-like. If it give any
delight, we have as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
although there is no reason to
exclude the hope of benefiting. For
however it seems to play, yet in very
truth it strikes home, and pierceth to
the quick.
<q>
                  <l>—Ridentem dicere verum</l>
                  <l>Quid vetat?—</l>
               </q>
Oft-times lighter arguments effect,
what stronger and more serious can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do: and that is taken in good part
by way of mirth, which being done in
earnest would by no means be brooked.</p>
            <p>Thus (good Reader) thou hast as
much as I conceive needfull to be
known touching my self, or to be said
touching the work. As for the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners,
they forbid any more to be
spoken of them then this, That as
they finde all the benefits, which are
<pb facs="tcp:13691:7"/>
promised by <hi>Cornarus</hi> and <hi>Lessius,</hi>
most true and reall; so by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
they finde no difficultie at all in
the observation of this course. They
are sufficient witnesses in their own
affairs, and I hold them to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
And therefore making no doubt
of the truth of the latter part of their
report, as I can abundantly give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the veritie of the former, I
commend both to thy belief and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
and so commit thee to
Gods grace.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seems to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by experience,
that a slender Diet,
and well-nigh Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean,
or such as is
answerable to the severest Rules of
Monasticall life, or to the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Hermites, who had Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
and Scarcenesse for a Rule,
doth produce long life. And to
this course appertains, drinking of
water, cold air, slender food (to
wit, of roots and fruits and fish, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then that which is fresh and
hot) the wearing of hair-cloth, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fastings, frequent watchings,
and seldome enjoyment of sensuall
pleasures, and the like: For all these
<pb facs="tcp:13691:8"/>
do diminish the spirits, and reduce
them to that quantitie, which suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
meerly to the services of life;
whereby the consumption of the
Radicall humour and Vitall heat is
abated.</p>
            <p>But if the Diet be somewhat
more choice then these rigours and
mortifications allow, yet if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
equall, and after one constant
proportion, it will afford the same
benefit: For we see it to be so in
flames. A flame that is somewhat
greater, if it be kept const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(Reverend

what hath moved
me being a <hi>Divine</hi> by professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a <hi>Religious,</hi> to write
concerning <hi>Health,</hi> a subject
proper to <hi>Physicians.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter, I doubt not
to have given so just reasons in
<pb facs="tcp:13691:13"/>
the <hi>preface</hi> of this work
(where I have set down the
aim of my undertakings in this
kinde) as will take away all
ground of wonderment. Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is not my purpose to
write like a Physician concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preservation of health;
that is, setting down a thousand
observations &amp; cautions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>qualitie</hi> of meats and
drinks, and of their proper <hi>use</hi>
according to the severall <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of the yeare, and of timely
<hi>purgation</hi> of humours, and of
<hi>sleep</hi> and <hi>watching, bodily
exercises,</hi> and <hi>medicines</hi>
whereby the severall humours
are to be corrected, and whereby
the <hi>Head, Stomack,</hi> and <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells</hi>
are to be comforted and
strengthened: I say, it was no
<pb facs="tcp:13691:13"/>
part of my intent to enter upon
the handling of any of these
matters. For how ever it would
have been no great difficultie
perhaps to have gathered these
things out of sundrie <hi>Authours,</hi>
and afterwards to have with
judgement digested them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to order and method:
yet, that I might not seem to act
the part of a <hi>Physician</hi> rather
then of a <hi>Divine,</hi> I have
thought fit altogether to omit
the mention of them. There was
a higher matter in my designes,
and that which is proper to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:</hi>
that is, to recommend to
all (and in particular to the
<hi>Religious,</hi> and those who are
studiously addicted to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of the mind) that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sobrietie,</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
<pb facs="tcp:13691:14"/>
of so many singular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
both to the mindes &amp; bodies
of men. For besides that it
brings <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>long life,</hi> it
doth wonderfully conduce to the
attainment of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> to
the exercises of <hi>Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

to the preservation of <hi>Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>

It befits not a <hi>Divine</hi>
to busie himself in trifles, which
appertain to the bodie, and to

have an eye to those good things
whereby we may become acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable

as <hi>Holy Sobrietie</hi> doth bring

            <p>I have annexed a Treatise

to such a one as hath so stoutly

as by the help thereof to

by whose example &amp; wholesome

with so many rules, and exact
so much observation and
caution about the qualitie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13691:21"/>
and quantitie of meats and
drinks; about aire, sleep, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
seasons of the yeare,
purgations, bloud-letting, and
the like; and over and above
prescribe such a number of
Compound, Opiate, and other
kindes of exquisite remedies,
as they bring men into a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth
of care in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and unto perfect sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
in the endeavouring to
perform what they do in this
matter enjoyn.</p>
               <p>And when all is done, the
issue proves commonly much
short, oft times clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to that which was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in regard perhaps that
some smaller matter in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
yet wherein the
chief of the businesse indeed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13691:21"/>
lay, was not observed and
practised as it ought. For men
forsooth will have their own
mindes, eat every thing that
likes them, and to their fill:
they will shape their diet
according to the ordinarie
usage of the world, and give
in every thing satisfaction to
their sensualitie &amp; appetite.
Whereby it comes to passe,
that all their other care and
diligence touching these
physicall precepts and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
comes in the end to
little or nothing at all for
matter of benefit.</p>
               <p>Hereupon most men bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
adieu to Physicians
counsels &amp; injuctions, leave
all to nature and successe.
They hold it, according to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13691:22"/>
the common<note n="*" place="bottom">Qui medicè vivit, miserè vivit.</note> Proverb, <hi>A
miserable life to live after the
Physicians prescript;</hi> a great
part of unhappinesse to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
in a mans diet, so that
he may not eat freely, and to
the full, of what he hath a
minde unto: To be kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
as it were in aw, so
that he dare not content his
appetite, nor give satisfaction
to his bellie, they fancie to
themselves to be the most
wretched condition of life
that may be. Upon this
ground they fall on eating
twice or thrice a day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stint or restraint in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or qualitie of food, but
as their appetites leade them
on.</p>
               <p>Having thus filled their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13691:22"/>
bodies, they instantly apply
themselves some good space
to their businesse, exercising
their mindes, and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
thereof in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
&amp; pursuit of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and important matters:
Nor can they ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to purge at fitting
seasons, or before the disease
oppresse them, imagining all
to be well with them, as long
as they feel nothing plainly
to the contrarie. Hereupon it
comes to passe, that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in tract of time grow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
with crude and ill
humours, which are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increased by continuance,
but become putrified, and of
a malignant temper; so that
upon every light occasion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13691:23"/>
either of heat, or cold, or
weather, or windes, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
labour, or any other
inconvenience or excesse,
they are inflamed, and break
out into mortall sicknesses
and diseases.</p>
               <p>2. I my self have observed
many excellent men on this
ground onely snatched away
by death in the prime of
their age; who undoubtedly,
had they used the right
course of preserving their
health, might have many
yeares prolonged their lives,
and by their learning &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
deeds have notably bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
the world, and thereby
(it may be) added to their
own glorie in heaven. There
are questionlesse likewise a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13691:23"/>
great many of all kindes of
persons, both of those that
enter into religious Orders, &amp;
of those that live at large in
the world, who through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this matter enjoy
little health, and through the
want thereof remain much
hindered in their studies, and
in the performance of those
offices and functions of the
minde, which they most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and are bound to do.</p>
               <p>3. Having therefore of a
long time and in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
taken this matter into
diligent consideration, I
thought with my self, that
it would prove a work of no
small benefit, to give notice
to the world of that way and
means for preservation of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13691:24"/>
health, whereby I my self
have for many yeares past
been kept not onely found in
bodie, but expedite to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
and exercises of
the minde: although I have
all this space laboured under
many corporall inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and before I entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this course, was so farre
gone, as by the judgement
of very skilfull Physicians I
was not like to have lived
above two yeares at the
most. The same good effects
that it wrought in me, have
divers of our Societie and
sundry others abroad made
happy proof of, maintaining
themselves in constant health
and cheerfulnesse by this
means; being indeed the very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13691:24"/>
self same, which was of
old practised by Holy men &amp;
sage Philosophers. And it
consists chiefly in a <hi>right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of the diet, and in a
certain Moderation of our
meat and drink:</hi> such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
I mean, as is no way
troublesome, nor breeding
weaknesse or distemper; but
on the contrarie very easie
to be undergone, and such as
brings strength and vigour
both in Minde and Bodie.</p>
               <p>Being very intent on these
matters, there was brought
unto me by a noble person a
little Treatise concerning the
benefits of a Sober Life, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Italian by <hi>Lodowick
Cornaro,</hi> a noble Gentleman
of <hi>Venice,</hi> of great understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13691:25"/>
Honourable, Rich in
estate, and a married man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In which book this course is
marvellously commended to
all men, and confirmed by
much &amp; certain experience.
I was much taken with the
reading thereof, &amp; held it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well worth the translating
into Latine, to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all men; and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
it to this explicative
Treatise of mine own.</p>
               <p>4. I would not
have any man to
think strange of the
matter,<note place="margin">That this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befitting a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</note> that I being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
Divine should take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to write of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
For besides that I have
long ago made some good
progresse in the Theorie of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13691:25"/>
Physick, this matter is no
way discrepant to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a Divine: in regard
that it is the divine vertue of
Temperance, which is chiefly
in question; to wit, Wherein
it consists; what is the right
way to attain it, and what
may be the true measure of
its object; how this measure
may be found: and lastly,
what benefits will arise
thereby. The search then
and consideration of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
is not altogether Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall,
but in great part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to Divinitie and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Philosophie.</p>
               <p>And over and above, the
end and scope which I aim
at herein, is indeed most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
a Divine. For that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13691:26"/>
which I principally intend,
is to furnish religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and those who give
themselves to pietie, with
such a way and manner of
living, as they may with
more ease, cheerfulnesse, and
servencie apply themselves
to the faithfull service of the
Great God, and our Saviour
the Lord Jesus Christ. For
verily it is scarce to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
with how great alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and with what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of inward consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
those men, who addict
themselves to sobrietie, may
(if so be they have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
understanding in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mysteries) attend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service, and the hearing
of Gods Word, their private
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13691:26"/>
devotions and meditations,
and in summe all manner of
spirituall exercises. And this
indeed was my principall
aim in the writing of this
Tractate; this my chiefest
wish and desire. As for the
benefit and help that it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
to Students of good
learning, and to all those
whose employments consist
in affairs and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> businesses ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the minde and
understanding, I say nothing
at present; purposing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to speake more at large
thereof. Whether you take
the matter therefore, or the
end, this Treatise can no
way misbeseem a Divine.
And so, good Reader, thou

               <p>The Matter then about
which this Diet or Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is mainly conversant,
is Meat and Drink, in which
a constant measure is to be
kept. Notwithstanding it
doth likewise reach unto the
care and ordering of all other
things; such as are, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13691:28"/>
heat and cold, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
labour, and the like;
through the excesse whereof
there growes any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in bodily health, or
disturbance in the operations
of the minde.</p>
               <p>6. Now this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is not the same
in respect of the

of people,<note place="margin">The Measure is different, according to the diversiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

according to the diversitie of

to Youth, when it is in

The Sickly and the Whole
have likewise their severall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13691:28"/>
measures; as also the Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
and the Cholerick: In
regard that in these severall
constitutions the nature and
temper of the stomack is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different. Now the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
of the food ought to be
exactly proportionable, as
much as possibly may be, to
the qualitie and condition
of the stomack. And that
Measure is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proportionable,<note place="margin">What is every ones due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note>
which the stomack hath
such power and masterie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as it can perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct
and digest in the midst
of any employments either
of minde or bodie, and
which withall sufficeth to

               <p>

In regard that a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is requisite to him that is
occupied in bodily labour,
and continually exercising of
the faculties of the bodie,
then to him that is altogether
in studies, meditation, prayer,
or other like works and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of the minde: Ina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the exercises &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of the minde do
very much hinder and disturb
the concoction: and that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because in calling up the
whole force of the soul they
do as it were abate and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
the power and actions
of the inferiour faculties, as
experience shews; for when
we are very intent on studie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13691:29"/>
or prayers, we neither heare
clock, nor take notice of any
thing that comes before our
eyes or other senses: or else
because they do withdraw
not onely the animall, but
the vitall and naturall spirits
themselves from their proper
services. And hence it comes,
that for the most part twice
as little food serves their
turn, who are continually
employed in studie &amp; affairs
of the minde, as is necessarie
for them that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to bodily exercises; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
equall age and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
might otherwise perhaps
require an equalitie in both
their diets.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>The difficultie then lies
in finding out this measure.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13691:30"/>
Which S.</hi> Austine <hi>of old well
observed, in his fourth book
against Julian, and in the
fourteenth chapter writing
thus,</hi> Now when we come to the
putting in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ure of that necessarie
pleasure, with which we refresh
our bodies, who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in words, how it suffers us
not to know the measure of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie?
but if there be any of
those things that yeeld delight
before us, it by their means
steals away, and hides, and leaps
over the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounds and limits of

                  </gap>ring health; whilest we
cannot think that to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
which is indeed sufficient,
being willingly led on by the
provocation thereof, fancying
our selves to be about the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Health, when indeed we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13691:30"/>
are about the service of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
so that Lust knows not
where Necessitie ends.</p>
               <p>In these words he referres
the ground of this difficultie
to Pleasure, which blindes us
that we cannot discern when
we are come to the due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
we ought to hold, but
hides the bound-marks
thereof, to draw us past them,
and perswades us that we
do but make provision for
Health, when in very truth
we canvasse for Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Concerning the discoverie
of this measure therefore are
we to treat in the second
place, producing Rules,
whereby it may be clearely
and certainly found out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:13691:31"/>8. But here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
That in Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
societies, such
as are Colledges in
the Universities,<note place="margin">Whether Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or those that live in Monasteries &amp;c. ought to trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about this measure.</note> &amp;c. no
man need trouble himself
touching this measure, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as either the statutes of
the Societies, or the discreet
orders of Superiours have set
down the just measure that
is to be held, appointing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the severall sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the yeare such and
such portions of flesh, egges,
fish, roots, rice, butter, cheese,
fruits, and broths; and such
quantities of wine and beere,
as are fit; all of them being
proportioned out by weight
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13691:31"/>
and measure: so that we may
boldly (say they) take our
allowance in these things
without danger of excesse.</p>
               <p>These men will by no
means beleeve, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs,
coughs, head-aches,
pains of the stomack, feavers,
and other the like infirmities,
whereinto they often fall,
should proceed from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of their food; but lay
the fault upon windes, ill
aire, watchings, too much
pains-taking, and other the
like outward causes. But
questionlesse they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this opinion; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it cannot possibly
be, that any one certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
should be found propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to so many different
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13691:32"/>
sorts of complexions and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,
as use to be in such
kinde of societies: so that
what is but reasonable to a
young and strong bodie, is
more then twice or thrice too
much for an old or infirm
person: as <hi>Thomas,</hi> following
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> doth well prove, 2.
2. <hi>q. 141. art.</hi> 6. and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of it self without proof
manifest.</p>
               <p>These allowances then
both for quantitie and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
are not set out by Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Superiours, as just
measures for every man, but
with the largest for all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
to the intent that the
strongest, and they who need
most, might have enough; and
the rest might take of that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13691:32"/>
which best liked them, (yet
alwayes keeping within
those limits which reason
prescribes) and in those
things which they forbore,
might have opportunitie to
exercise their vertue. For it
is no great glorie to shew
temperance in the absence
of temptations: but to keep
hunger on foot at a banquet,
&amp; to restrain the greedinesse
of the belly in the midst of
provoking dainties; why, this
is a masterie indeed, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Novices, &amp; such as have
not gotten the victorie over
their appetites. It is a great
masterie, I say, and therefore
undoubtedly of no small
price with God. To the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
therefore that the exercise
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13691:33"/>
of this vertue, and the benefit
of the reward that by Gods
mercie belongs to it, might
not be wanting to them that
seek and endeavour the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
of their reward
hereafter, the Founders and
Institutours of religious Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
have perhaps allotted a
larger measure, and more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of food, then is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
or they would have every
one to make use of.</p>
               <p>Touching this matter we
have a very pertinent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the life of <hi>Pachomius,</hi>
faithfully written 1200.
yeares ago, as it is extant in
<hi>Surius, 14. Maii.</hi> Where it is
mentioned, that this <hi>Pacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
in his monasteries, and
especially in those that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13691:33"/>
younger persons lived in,
would have (beside bread &amp;
salt) some sod or rost meat
set before all the Monks, to
the intent that, albeit the
most of them were so abste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious,
that they contented
themselves onely with bread
&amp; salt, or some<note n="*" place="bottom">Crudo aliquo fructu.</note> green fruit,
yet they might have it in
their free choice and libertie,
either to eat thereof, or to
forbear: And so, if either for
mortification sake, or the
better sitting of themselves
for devotion, they should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
they might exercise a
greater vertue; since it is a
more difficult thing to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
when meat is set before
us, and by its presence doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13691:34"/>
provoke the appetite, then
when it is removed out of
our sight. More to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
may be read in <hi>Iacob. de
Paz. Tom. 2. l. 2. de Mortif.
ext. hom. cap. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will it any thing at all
abate from the probabilitie
of this opinion, to say that in
this allowance of varietie &amp;
abundance there was a direct
intention of giving some
kinde of refreshment to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Inasmuch as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment,
which the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutours
&amp; Founders of these
Societies meant, consisteth
not in this, that the true and
right measure at temperance
should at any time be nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
exceeded; but that there
might be now and then an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13691:34"/>
opportunitie of delight mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
through the different
and gratefull favour of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
kindes of meats: yet so
alwayes, as this delight
should be kept bounded
within the limits of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and the appetite never
fully satisfied. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
exceeds this measure, is to
be accounted vice, be it upon
what occasion it will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Marriage, Dedication
of Churches, or any other
solemne Feast whatsoever.
Now that is alwayes excesse,
which proves more in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
then the stomack can
perfectly digest without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

of the right Measure.</head>
               <p>9 NOw to finde out this
right Measure, we
shall make use of these Rules
and observations following.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Rule</hi> is, If thou dost
usually take so much food at
meals, as thou art thereby
made unfit for the duties and
offices belonging to the
Minde, such as are Prayer,
Meditation, Studies of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the like; it is then
evident, that thou dost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the measure which thou
oughtest to hold: For both
Nature and Reason exact,
that the Vegetati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> part in
a man (that is, that wherein
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13691:35"/>
the growth and conservation
of the bodie consisteth) should
be so ordered and cherished,
as that there should arise no
offence or damage thereby to
the Animall and Reasonable
parts of the soul; in as much
as the Vegetative part is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to the service of these
other, and therefore ought to
be of furtherance and help,
and no wayes of hinderance
unto them in their severall
functions and operations.</p>
               <p>Whenever therefore there
is so much food taken in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Vegetative
part, as proves of any remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
offence or hinderance
to the operations of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
faculties, to wit, of
the Senses, the Imagination,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13691:36"/>
the Understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie;
then it is a signe, that
the fitting measure in this
kinde is exceeded. Now this
impediment and offence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the abundance
of vapours, that are chiefly
sent up into the head out of
the stomack: which, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
demonstrates, would
be but sparingly sent up, if
this measure were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>For they who follow a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
course of life, are as apt
and ready to all services and
employments of the minde
after their meals, as before:
as our Authour, whom we
have annexed to this present
Treatise, doth oft times testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
and my self, and divers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13691:36"/>
others of our Societie do day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make proof of. Nay, those
holy Fathers of old, who eat
onely once a day, did it so
sparingly, as they were no
whit at all thereby hindered
in their performances of the
functions belonging to the
minde: How much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
then may it be effected
by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who divide the
quantitie; and twice a day
use moderate refection?</p>
               <p>10. I said before; that
those vapours and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes;
which cloud and oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
the clearenesse of the
Brain, <hi>are chiefly caused by the
meat taken down into the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack:
Chiefly,</hi> I say, in regard
that however this be the
principall; yet it is not the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13691:37"/>
onely cause. For these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
proceed not onely
from the meat immediately
before taken, which begins
to boyl and concoct; but also
from the abundance of bloud
and other humours, which
are in the Liver, the Splene,
and the Veins: which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the meat fall on
seething as it were, and send
up great abundance of these
kinde of sooty fumes.</p>
               <p>But a sober diet doth by
little and little diminish this
<note n="*" place="bottom">Plet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oram.</note> abundance of humours, and
abates this<note n="*" place="bottom">Cacochymiam.</note> ill moysture, and
reduceth them to their due
proportions both in quantitie
and qualitie: so that they do
no more upon eating send up
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13691:37"/>
these kinde of fumes. For
when Nature doth perfectly
govern all the humours of
the bodie by the ministerie
of the vegetative faculties,
she doth so order and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
all things, as neither
any diseases arise in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
nor any impediment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
to the superiour offices
and duties of the soul.</p>
               <p>Nor matters it at all, that
many men addicted to sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
are accustomed to sleep
a while after dinner: inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they do it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
that their vigour and
the spirits, which have been
spent and wasted by any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
either of minde or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
might be refreshed and
restored by the means of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13691:38"/>
sleep: For sleep serves to both
these ends. And then besides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that sleep of theirs is very
short, and such as they could
easily forbear, but when by
wearinesse and custome they
are enclined thereunto. Some
of them indeed sleep a good
while, but those use to abate
as much of their nights rest,
as they take out thus in the
day, dividing as it were into
two parts the rest and sleep
that is due to their bodies.
But indeed generally it is
more agreeable to health, to
forbear all sleep after meat
at noon, according to the
commonly received opinion
of Physicians.</p>
               <p>II. The second <hi>Rule</hi> is; If
so be thou take so much
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13691:38"/>
meat and drink, as thou after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
findest a certain kinde
of dulnesse, heavinesse, and
slothfull wearinesse, whereas
before thou wast quick and
lightsome; it is a signe, that
thou hast exceeded the fitting
measure: except this come to
passe through present sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or the reliques of some
former disease. For meat and
drink ought to refresh the
strength and powers of the
bodie, and to make them
more cheerfull, and no wayes
to burden or oppresse them.</p>
               <p>They therefore who finde
their constitution to be such,
as they feel oppression after
their meals, ought to make
abatement of their dayly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
having first used
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13691:39"/>
good and diligent considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
arise from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of their meat, or of
their drink, or of both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and when they have
found out where the errour
lies, it is by degrees to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
till the matter be
brought to that passe, that
there be no more feeling of
any such inconvenience.</p>
               <p>12. Many there be, who
are much deceived in this
case; who although they eat
and drink liberally, and use
nourishing meats, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
complain of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
weaknesse and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and that, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves, comes
from the want of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13691:39"/>
and spirits: whereupon
they seek out meats of much
nourishment, and provide
breakfasts betimes in the
morning, lest Nature should
faint for want of its due su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance.</p>
               <p>But, as I said, they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
beguiled in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and do hereby adde a
surcharge to their bodies,
which are in truth already
overburdened with ill juice
and moysture. For this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which they complain
of, proceeds not from defect
of nutriment, but from the
abundance of ill humours; as
both the constitution of their
bodies, and the swelling of
their bellies in particular
do evidently shew. Now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13691:40"/>
these ill humours do cloy up
the muscles and the nerves,
through which the spirits
have their course and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage:
whereby it comes to
passe, that the animall spirits
(from which, as from the
most generall and immediate
instrument of the soul, all the
vigour of the bodie in sense
and motion is derived) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
freely take their course,
nor govern and order the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
as they ought. And hence
comes that weaknesse and
lumpishnesse of the bodie,
and that dulnesse of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the animall spirits being
as it were intercepted in
their passage by this excesse
of humours.</p>
               <p>Dayly experience shews
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13691:40"/>
this to be true in divers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
abounding with ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and vicious moystures,
which in the morning are
faint and dull, through the
superfluities of moysture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in them upon their
former nights supper and
sleep: But when these moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
are consumed by absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and<note n="*" place="bottom">Apophlegmatismos.</note> the purgations
of the head, they become
more cheerfull and active;
and this vigour goes on still
increasing till night come,
albeit they take little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all at noon. But in
case they eat, whilest these
moystures remain unconco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the bodie, especially
if it be in any great quantitie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13691:41"/>
or moyst food, the indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is renewed, and they
presently return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
miserie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if a man desire
to be alwayes quick, apt, and
ready to motion, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
other use of his senses,
these humours are to be les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened
by abatement of diet,
so that the spirits may have
their free passage through
all parts of the bodie, and
the minde may finde them
alwayes ready to every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and service in the bodie.</p>
               <p>13. The third <hi>Rule</hi> is; We
must not passe immediately
from a disordered kinde of
life to a strict and precise
course: but it is to be done
by little and little, by small
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13691:41"/>
abatements subtracting from
that excessive quantitie,
whereunto we have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
untill at last we
come to that just measure,
which doth not at all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the bodie, nor offend
and hinder the operations of
the minde. This is a common
Tenet amongst Physicians.
For all sudden changes, if
they be any thing remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
do prejudice Nature; in
regard that Custome gets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the force and qualitie of
Nature it self: Wherefore it
cannot but be very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be driven off forcibly
from that, which a man hath
been long used unto, and to
be put upon the contrarie.
For as that which is against
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13691:42"/>
Nature, so likewise that
which is against long &amp; inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Custome, is very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to be undergone, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
the strength and power
of Custome remains on foot.
We must therefore break off
old usages by degrees, and
not all at once; going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
step by step, as we grew
on towards them: and so the
alteration being not much
perceived in the progresse,
will be lesse difficult in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>14. The fourth <hi>Rule</hi> is,
That albeit there cannot be
any one determinate quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
set for all, in respect of
the great difference of ages,
strength, and other dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in men; as also in respect
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13691:42"/>
of the great diversitie in the
nature and qualitie of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kindes of food: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
generally for
them who are stept in yeares,
and for those who are of
weak complexions, it seems
twelve, thirteen, or fourteen
ounces of food a day should
be enough; accounting into
this proportion bread, flesh,
eggs, and all other kinde of
victualls: And as many, or but
a few more ounces of drink
would suffice.</p>
               <p>This is to be understood of
those, who use but little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of bodie, and are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
addicted to studie, and
other offices and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the minde. Verily

                     </gap>k Cornaro,</hi> whose
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13691:43"/>
Treatise touching a Sober
life we have hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
approves greatly this
measure, having stinted
himself thereat, when he
was thirtie six yeares old,
and kept it constantly as long
as he lived; and that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very long, and with
perfect health.</p>
               <p>The holy Fathers likewise
that lived in the deserts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they fed onely upon
bread, and drank nothing but
water, exceeded not this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
establishing it as it
were by law every where in
their Monasteries: For so
<hi>Cassianus</hi> writes in his second
Collation of Abbat <hi>Moyses,
chap.</hi> 19. Where Abbat <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
being demanded what
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13691:43"/>
was the best measure of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
answered on this
wise: <hi>We know there hath oft
times much discourse been
amongst our Ancestours touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this matter. For examining
the severall manners of Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
used by divers, to wit, of
those who passed their lives one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with pulse, or altogether
with herbs, or fruits, they did
preferre before them all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by Bread alone. The
most equall measure whereof
they did conclude to be in</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">In duobus paximaciis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>two
biskets; which small cakes it
is very certain were scarce a
pound weight.</hi> So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
they did count the
just allowance for a day to
be twelve ounces of bread,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13691:44"/>
which might generally suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for all. For the pound
weight amongst the Ancients
was not of sixteen ounces, as
our pound weight now is, but
onely of twelve ounces.</p>
               <p>15. Some do think, that
each of these cakes should be
a pound weight: and so they
understand those words of
Abbat <hi>Moyses, Which small
cakes,</hi> that is, each of them
severally, and not both joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But that it cannot be so
understood, will be very plain
to them that well consider
the matter. For first, his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to expresse, how
much the whole allowance,
which was in two severall
cakes, did weigh, and not
what each cake weighed.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13691:44"/>
Moreover, that measure of
bread was, as Abbat <hi>Moyses</hi>
teacheth, very scant, and
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ficult to be observed, <hi>chap.</hi>
21. Now if the two cakes
had been two pounds, that
would not have been a scant
allowance for a day, nor hard
to be kept, especially by old
men. For who is there, that
may not be contented with
such a quantitie of bread, or
can be said after the taking
thereof to have eaten but
moderately and sparingly?
Nay verily, even amongst us
of these colder climates, it
would be thought very
strange, if any of those whom
we call Religious, should at
one meal eat up two pound
weight of bread: undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13691:45"/>
such a one could not be
esteemed (in regard of the
quantitie) abstinent or sober,
but rather a great feeder and
devourer.</p>
               <p>Moreover, these two cakes
did not so allay hunger, but
that there were some, who
chose rather to fast two dayes
together, then every day to
refresh themselves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Their reason, as Abbat
<hi>Moyses</hi> reports, <hi>chap.</hi> 24.
(though he much disallow
it) was, that by this double
portion they might be able
fully to content and sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isfie
their appetite. Now what
man (I pray) devoted to the
exercises of the minde is
there, that can at one repast
eat up foure pounds, or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13691:45"/>
eight ounces of drie
bread?</p>
               <p>Lastly, as Abbat <hi>Moyses</hi>
recounts in the 11. <hi>chap.</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
<hi>Serapion</hi> being a little
boy, after he had at meals
with others at the ninth
houre of the day eaten his
two cakes, was still a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry;
whereupon he was
wont to steal a third bisket,
which he used to eat in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
Now what childe can
eat three pounds of bread at
once? It seems therefore very
certain, that these bisket
cakes were but six ounces a
piece, and two of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
weighed onely a
pound.</p>
               <p>Now if these holy Fathers
upon long experience found
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13691:46"/>
twelve ounces of drie bread,
without any other sort of
<note n="*" place="bottom">Absque ullo obsonio.</note> food, to be enough, and
with this diet conserved
themselves healthfull and
sound in all their members
and senses, even to decrepit
age: How much more then
may six, seven, or eight oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of bread suffice, together
with six, or seven ounces of
other choise victualls, which
yeeld double the nutriment
that drie bread doth? Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
withall that in stead
of water (which served their
turn, and of it self nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not at all) we now drink
beere or wine, which yeeld
much nutriment. Last of all,
experience demonstrates,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13691:46"/>
that there are many, who
live with farre lesse quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of meat.</p>
               <p>Now although
our speech here be
chiefly touching
weak persons,<note place="margin">That this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure may suffice (ordinarily) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven those that are healthy and strong.</note> and
those that are declining in
yeares; yet I hold it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the aforesaid
measure is large enough for
the most part, even for those
that are in health, and strong,
and in the flower of their
age, if they be such as give
themselves to prayer, studie,
and other such like operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; exercises of the minde.
And this may be made good
by infinite examples of holy
men, who from fifteen, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
or twentie yeares old,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13691:47"/>
have kept themselves to this
stint, or it may be lesse; albeit
they eat nothing but bread,
herbs, or pulse, nor used
other drink then water: and
yet neverthelesse they lived
exceeding long and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
in the height of labours
and afflictions both of their
mindes and bodies: as is plain
to be seen in many, whose
lives are extant in historie;
some whereof we will set
down <hi>Num.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I encline to
hold this measure sufficient,
in regard it was commonly
established as it were by law
in sundry Monasteries, as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
sufficient as well for
the younger, as for the elder
sort of people. So that those
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13691:47"/>
ancient Fathers, who had the
largest experience of these
matters, and best knew what
was requisite in this kinde
for Nature, judged that this
measure might ordinarily
suffice to all ages. Of the
same opinion is our Authour,
and confirms it by his own
example: for he began to
keep this stint at thirtie six
yeares old.</p>
               <p>Now whereas some may

although it weigh seven, or

not in truth above
three or foure ounces of
bread, or other solid ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:13691:48"/>The Solution is easie. For
when<note n="*" place="bottom">Escul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are to be severally
weighed and reduced to the
making up of the just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that kinde, to which
they properly belong. And so
drinking liquours are to be
put on the account of drink,
and bread and other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
on the account of meat.
But it is not our intent to
prosecute these smaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
it is enough to have
made a generall remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,
that this measure
which we have put, is not
contrarie to reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:13691:48"/>16. The fifth <hi>Rule</hi> is,
That as touching the qualitie
of the food, there is no great
care to be had, if so be a man
be of a healthfull constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and finde that such kinde
of meat as he makes choice
of, doth not offend nor harm
him. For almost all sorts of
meats that are commonly
used, do well agree with
good and healthfull constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if so be the right quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
and measure be kept:
So that questionlesse a man
may live long and healthfully
on bread onely, with milk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

especially if he have from

them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:13691:49"/>But from all those
sorts of food,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

he must abstain, albeit

                  </gap>l: at least he may not use
them in any quantitie. Of
this sort are for the most part
fat meats, which make loose
the stomack, and weaken the
astrictive and retentive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
thereof, so as the other
sorts of meat are much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in their concoction, &amp;
are indeed caused to slip out
of the stomack undigested
and half raw as it were. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
these fat meats do send
up store of fumes into the
head; whereupon follow

Last of all, they themselves,
except they be very well
concocted (to which intent
both a good stomack, and
length of time is required)
turn into evil humours, and
to the matter of fevers; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they are converted
partly into cholerick, and
partly into phlegmatick jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and moistures. Students
therefore are to use these
kinde of meats but sparingly,
and with a sufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of bread taken together
with them: For so the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
which they bring may
be in great part avoided.</p>
               <p>17. Of the same nature
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13691:50"/>
likewise (as experience
shews) are all those kinde of
meats, which in the head
breed cataracts, clouds,
dizzinesses, distillations, and
coughs; and in the stomack
breed crudities, inflations,
gripings, gnawings, frettings,
and the like; and in a word
all those, which any way
breed damage to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Bodie, or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to the functions of
the Minde. For how senslesse
a thing is it, to buy the vile
and fading pleasures of Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie
at the rate of so many
inconveniences! Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man cannot make plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
proof of his thraldome to
gluttonie, then when he thus
thrusts and poures in that,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13691:50"/>
which he knows is hurtfull
unto him, onely to content
his licorish appetite.</p>
               <p>Now when we say, A man
must warily abstain from
these kindes of food, it is not
so to be understood, as that a
man may not (for example)

                     </gap>.</note> slime, and windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
but that he ought not
to eat them in any notable
quantitie. For these being
but seldome used, and in
small quantities, cannot hurt,
especially when they be
pleasing to the appetite. Nay,
it oft times happens, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13691:51"/>
those things which do hurt
being taken in larger quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
do in lesser proportions
benefit Nature.</p>
               <p>18. Amongst all
these kinde of meats
there is none more
fit for weakly and aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">Panada a very convenient food for the aged, &amp;c.</note>
then <hi>Panada;</hi> with
which alone, and now and
then an egge or two, a man
may live very long, and with
great healthfulnesse; as our
Authour testifieth. <hi>Panada</hi> is
the Italian name of that
kinde of pap or gruell, which
is made of bread and water,
or some flesh-broth boyled
together. The reasons, why
this sort of food is so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
are, because it is most
light and easie of digestion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13691:51"/>
being prepared by art, so as
it is very like to that <hi>Chylus,</hi>
which the stomack makes by
the conco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of meats: as
also, because it is most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in the qualities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And further, it is little
subject to putrefaction and
corruption, as many other
sorts of meats be, which do
easily corrupt in the stomack.
Last of all, it breeds abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of good bloud: And if
occasion need, it may easily
by supply of other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
be made more hot and
nourishing. So that worthily
was it spoken by the wise
man, <hi>Ecclus. 29. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
of mans life are bread and
water.</hi> By which words he
would teach us, that mans
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13691:52"/>
life is mainly supported and
upheld by these two things:
and therefore they being the
most fit and proper for the
conservation of life, the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
pursuit of costly sorts
of flesh and fish, serving one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for enticement and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of gluttonie, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
needlesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preservation of
health, doth not allow of
<hi>Flesh:</hi> for thus he writes:
<hi>Crudities are much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon eating of flesh: Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as these sorts of food do
at first very much oppresse, and
afterwards leave behinde them
malignant reliques. It were
surely therefore best, so to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
the bodie, that it should
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13691:52"/>
not require any flesh at all to
feed on. In regard that the
Earth produceth abundantly
not onely those things, which
serve to nourishment, but also
that which may suffice to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight: A great
number of which thou mayst
feed upon without any manner
of preparation; and the other, by
compounding and mingling
them in a thousand severall
wayes, may be easily made sweet
and pleasant.</hi> To this opinion
of <hi>Plutarch</hi> many Physicians
agree; and experience, the
surest proof to go upon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
it. For there are many
Nations which seldome eat
Flesh, but live chiefly on Rice
and Fruits; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they live very long
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13691:53"/>
and healthfully; as the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pans,</hi>
the <hi>Chineses,</hi> the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
in sundrie regions, and
the <hi>Turks.</hi> The self same is
to be seen likewise amongst
us in many husbandmen and
others of mechanick trades,
who ordinarily feed on
bread, butter, pottage, pulse,
herbs, cheese, and the like,
eating flesh very rarely; and
yet they live long not onely
with health, but with
strength. I say nothing of the

it is a common rule of all

is, because change and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:13691:55"/>20. The seventh <hi>Rule.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as all the difficultie
in setting and keeping of a
just measure, proceeds from
the sensuall Appetite; and
the Appetite ariseth from
that apprehension of the
Fancie, or Imagination,
whereby meats are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be delightfull and
pleasant: speciall care is to
be used touching the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and amendment of
this conceit and imagination.
To the furtherance whereof,
two things amongst all other
will most conduce. The first
is, That a man withdraw and
apart himself from the view
of Feasts and Daynties, to
the end they may not by
their sight and smell stirre up
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13691:56"/>
the Fancie, and entice on
Gluttonie: Inasmuch as the
presence of every object
doth naturally move, and
work upon the facultie
whereunto it appertains.
And therefore it is much
more difficult to restrain the
appetite, when good cheer is
present, then not to desire
that which is away. The self
same happens in all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and allurements of the
other senses.</p>
               <p>The second help is, To i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
these self same
things, whereunto Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
allureth us, not to be as
she perswades, and as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they appeare, good,
pleasant, savoury, relishing,
and bringing delight to the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13691:56"/>
palate; but filthy, sordid, evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoured,
and detestable, as
indeed after a very little
while they prove. For all
things, when they are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
into their principles,
shew what they be in truth,
and manifest what it was
that lay disguised under that
amiable appearance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Now what can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
more unsavourie, or
lothsome, then these dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
assoon as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a little alteration in
the stomack? Nay verily, by
how much any thing proves
more delectable to Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
by so much doth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
prove more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in truth, and yeelds the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13691:57"/>
worse and more noysome
smell. Whereupon they who
give themselves to delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
were it not for the help
of outward perfumes, would
undoubtedly be as intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
through the evil savours
that arise from their bodies,
as dead carcases are. Their
excrements likewise are of
most noysome savour, and all
the breathings of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
accompanied with a
most filthie smell. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
whereof is to be seen
in Countrey people, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
artificers, who live
temperately upon brown
bread, cheese, and other such
like ordinarie food.</p>
               <p>And this verily was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
contrived by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13691:57"/>
to the end that we
should learn thereby, so
much the more to contemne
delicacies, and to content
our selves with simple and
plain fare. This matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is often to be thought
upon, and the Fancie by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
meditation accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thereunto.</p>

               <p>21. BUt here
arise two
Doubts:<note place="margin">Whether this measure or stint ought not to be altered.</note> The first,
Whether both the quantitie
and qualitie of the meat and
drink ought not to be varied
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13691:58"/>
according to the seasons of
the yeare. Forasmuch as it
seems a larger quantitie of
food is agreeable to winter,
then to summer; in regard
that in winter time (as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
affirms, <hi>sect. 1. apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism.</hi>
15.) mens bellies are
hotter, by reason that the
cold without forceth the
heat into the inward bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,
as it were from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
into the center:
but in summer, upon a clean
contrarie ground, mens bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
become more feeble; to
wit, in regard that the heat
is drawen out by the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the aire from the
inward parts, as it were from
the center to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and there dissipated.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13691:58"/>
In like manner, drie and hot
meats seem more proper for
winter, in regard of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of phleg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, which
is then bred, and is not so
readily dissolved: But in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
moyst and cooling meats
are better, inasmuch as
through the heat of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
aire there is a great
dissipation of humours, and
much drying of the bodie.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Physicians Rules we
ought indeed so to do; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
not ouer scrupulou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
nor precisely, but as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
serveth: For if oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
be wanting, there is
no great care to be had
touching this businesse. For
if we finde necessitie of a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13691:59"/>
drier kinde of diet in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or long continued moyst
weather, we may easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
the matter by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our stint of bread, and
diminishing the stint of our
drink, or other kindes of
moyst nourishment. For the
abundance of drink &amp; other
moyst food, which is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
in drie weather, will
be of prejudice, if it should
be continued many dayes
together, when the aire is
raw and cold: for it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
breed distillations,
hoarsnesses, and coughs. And
on the other side, when a
moyster kinde of diet seems
requisite, the stint of the
drink may be augmented,
putting a larger quantitie of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13691:59"/>
water into the wine; or in
stead of wine we may use
small beere, which will suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
moysten and refresh.</p>
               <p>The Holy Fathers of old
seem not to have made any
account at all of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of seasons, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the self same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of one &amp; the self same
kinde of meat and drink for
the whole yeare throughout;
and yet notwithstanding
they lived exceeding long.
But now adayes in Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
there is good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
made this way for
health, there being change
of victualls appointed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the season; out
of which they who follow
Temperance, may make
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13691:60"/>
choice of what they finde
most convenient for them.</p>
               <p>22. The second
Doubt is,<note place="margin">Whether the dayly measure or stint ought to be taken at one, or at more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>efections.</note> Whether
this measure and
stint which we
have prescribed, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which men shall finde
meet for them, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at one meal, or more.
To which I answer, That
however all the Ancients,
who did so notably practise
Temperance, contented
themselves with one meal a
day, and that either after
Sun-set, or at the ninth
houre of the day, that is,
three houres after noon; as
<hi>Cassianus</hi> reports in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Collation of Abbat
<hi>Moyses, chap. 25. and 26.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13691:60"/>
many there be
that think it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
for old men to make
two meals a day, dividing
the foresaid measure into
two parts. And the reason is,
because old men being not
able to take much sustenance
at once, it is better that they
should eat oftener, and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
quantities. For by this
means they will not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with meat, and make
their digestion easier. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may take 7. or 8.
ounces at dinner, and at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
3. or 4. or otherwise, as
they shall finde it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for them.</p>
               <p>But verily in these matters
long custome bears great
sway, and much regard is to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13691:61"/>
be had likewise to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the bodie. For if the
stomack abound with cold
and tough phlegme, it seems
to be mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e expedient, that a
man should make but one
meal a day, in regard that
there is a good space of time
requisite for the concocting
and dispersing of them:
And this I have by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
abundantly made proof
of. Yet notwithstanding if
the meal be deferred till
night, it will be good to take
some small modicum at
noon, &amp; such in particular, as
may help to drie up the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
moisture of the stomack.
Or if so be the chief meal
be a dinner, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at night to take some
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13691:61"/>
dried Raisins, with bread or
the like. For they who are
thus affected, ought to have
especiall care that this moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the stomack be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
as much as may be:
in regard that from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
the stomack is
troubled with winde, and the
head filled with cloudinesse
and tough phlegme. One said

               </p>
               <p>23. Some will perhaps
object against this which we
have delivered, That this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13691:62"/>
stinting a mans self at a set
measure for meat and drink,
is a thing that hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by many excellent
Physicians: in regard that
by this means the stomack is
contracted or made narrow,
and at last becomes so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to this set quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as if at any time it chance
to exceed, it feels great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and hurt, inasmuch
as it is thereby extended or
enlarged beyond that which
it useth. For the remedie of
which inconvenience they
advise, that a man should not
keep alwayes one stint, but
sometimes take more food,
and sometimes lesse. Which
opinion seems to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Hippocrates, Aphor. 5.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13691:62"/>
sect.</hi> 1. where he writes thus;
<hi>A very slender, set, and exact
diet is perilous even in them
that are in health; inasmuch as
they become thereby lesse able
to endure errours when they
happen. And therefore in this
respect a slender and exact diet
is more perilous, then that
which is a little fuller.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24. I answer, That this
Rule of the Physicians takes
place in them, who cannot
stedfastly hold the same
course of Temperance, in
regard of the often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of feasts and banquets,
which they either cannot
or will not avoid; and have
not so gotten the masterie of
Gluttonie, as they are able to
restrain their Appetites, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13691:63"/>
keep themselves in their
wonted bounds, when they
see abundance of dainties
before their eyes, and are on
every side enticed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by perswasions and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of them that are in
companie, to take their part
of them. For verily these
men upon such filling of
themselves will run upon
some inconvenience, for the
reason above specified. But
the case is otherwise with
them, who may well avoyd
these occasions &amp; excesses, &amp;
are able to hold themselves
in their own course. For to
them a set measure is most
fitting, especially if they be
weakly or old, as both Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and Reason evidently
convince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:13691:63"/>Nor doth it matter much,
if now and then through
some occasion they be
drawen to exceed this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
in regard that one or
two excesses do not much
harm, if so be a man instantly
return to his wonted sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and either altogether in
such cases omit his next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
or else make it as much
sparer, as the former was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,
As suppose using to
eat moderately both at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and supper, thou be
drawen on to eat more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at dinner, then forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
supper altogether: And
if at supper thou exceedest,
forbear thy dinner the next
day after.</p>
               <p>This inconvenience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13691:64"/>
is not of that moment,
that for shunning the hazard
thereof a man should refuse
to binde himself ordinarily
to a set measure in his food;
inasmuch as such accidentall
excesses, so they happen but
seldome, are of little preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
even to old and weakly
disposed persons.</p>
               <p>25. But if these excesses
come often, or be continued
many dayes together, they
who are used to a set stint,
will finde much hurt by
them, and especially they
who are sickly or stricken in
age. Our Authour relates;
that having lived from the
36. yeare of his age to the
75. with onely 12. ounces of
food, and 14. of drink for the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13691:64"/>
day, he did all that while
enjoy his health very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously:
Afterwards by the
Physicians counsell, and
through his friends impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie,
he was over-ruled to
adde onely two ounces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
both to his food and to
his drink. But this small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
after ten dayes brought
upon him many great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
to wit, very sore pain
in his side, much grief in his
chest, and a fever, which held
him 35. dayes, so that the
Physicians gave him over for
a dead man: nor could he
have been cured, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.
I my self also knew
one, who for many yeares
together having used himself
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13691:65"/>
to suppers, taking onely a
bit at noon, and that of some
drie kinde of food, was by
the perswasions of friends
drawn on to eat a little more
largely at noon, and that of
liquid substance: which thing
after ten or twelve dayes
space brought upon him such
cruell pains in his stomack &amp;
bowells for divers weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that it seemed verily
he would have died. From
which although he was
twice recovered by the help
of many remedies, and the
care of excellent Physicians,
yet he did still fall again into
the same passions. At last,
upon his third relapse, after
many dayes torment, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of his wonted custome
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13691:65"/>
came to remembrance, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
when he had well bethought
him of, he did conclude it
was the true ground of all
this mischief: whereupon he
determined to return to his
former course. Which be no
sooner began to do, but the
very first day his pains asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and in foure dayes space
were so quite gone, as there
remained nothing behinde,
save a great debilitie and
weaknesse of bodie: which
yet notwithstanding by little
and little wore away like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by means of that fober
and drie diet. For it is not
the abundance of meats, nor
the daintinesse, that strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
Nature; but the moderate
quantitie proportionable to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13691:66"/>
the strength, and the good
condition of the food an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the constitution
of the bodie.</p>
               <p>26. Nor is <hi>Hippocrates</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisine
above alledged,
contrarie to this opinion of
ours: inasmuch as he there
intends by a spare diet, That
which is of so small nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so little in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as is not sufficient for the
maintenance of strength, and
upholding of a mans consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
But we allow all sorts
of meats that are agreeable
to Nature, and that measure
and quantitie, which is most

bodies power,
(or at least not with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie)
to observe this exact
course of diet: what then?
is there no other way for a
man to preserve his health,
and to prolong his life? I
answer, There is onely one,
which many excellent Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
have prescribed. And
that is, That every yeare
twice, namely in the Spring
and Autumne, the bodie
should be well purged, and
cleared of all ill humours. I
speak of those, who do not
ordinarily use much exercise
of the bodie, but are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intent upon the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the minde; such as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13691:67"/>
are Church-men, Lawyers,
Scholars, and the like.</p>
               <p>Now this purging ought
to be after a good prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the evil humours, and
that by the advice of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Physician: Nor ought it
to be done by strong medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
one upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the neck of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
but gently, taking the
medicines two or three dayes
together. For so they will
both be easilyer borne, and
with much more benefit. For
the first day the first region
(as the Physicians terme it) is
to be purged, that is, the
Bowells: The second day, the
Liver: and the third day, the
Veins, in which lies the
great drayn of ill humours.
For they who do not live
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13691:67"/>
temperately, do every day
adde some crude humour,
which being sucked in by
the veins as by a spunge, is
afterwards dispersed through
the whole bodie.</p>
               <p>28. So that after two or
three yeares space there is
oft times such a masse of ill
humours gathered in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
as a vessell big enough
to hold two hundred ounces
would scarce serve to receive
them in.</p>
               <p>Now these humours in
tract of time do corrupt and
putrifie, and cast a man upon
mortall infirmities; and are
the very true ground why
most men die so much before
their time. For almost all
that die before old age, die
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13691:68"/>
by this means: those onely
excepted, who are slain by
outward violences; as by fire,
sword, wilde beasts, water,
or the like: as also those who
die of the stone, of poyson, of
the plague, or some such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infection. And question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
there be many, who
with store and plentie of all
things in their own houses,
die and perish through this
abundance of malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in their bodies; who
had they been condemned to
the Gallyes, and there kept
at bisket and water, might
have lived long, and with
good health. This danger
therefore may in great part
be remedied by purging sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
at least twice every
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13691:68"/>
yeare. For so it will come to
passe, that neither the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of the ill humours will
be very great, nor be much
putrified, being evacuated
and kept under by this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
at every half yeares
end. I have knowen many,
who by this means have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
their lives to extream
old age, and scarce all their
lives long been oppressed
with any great sicknesse.</p>

of those Commodities, which

               <p>The first Benefit therefore

and preserve him from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

and pains of the head &amp;

Lethargies, falling

of the brain: it cures the
Gout in the feet, and in the
hands, the<note n="*" place="bottom">Dolores ischiadicos.</note> Sciatica, and
those diseases that grow in
the joynts. It likewise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
Crudities, the mother
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13691:69"/>
of all diseases. In a word, it
so tempers the humours, and
maintains them in an equall
proportion, that they offend
not any way either in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
or qualitie. Now where
there is an agreeable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionablenesse
amongst the
humours, there is no matter
for sicknesse to work upon:
inasmuch as the ground of
health lies in this, That the
humours be rightly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
tempered in the
bodie.</p>
               <p>And this both Reason and
Experience doth confirm.
For we see, that those who
keep them to a sober course
of diet, are very seldome or
rather never molested with
diseases: and if at any time
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13691:70"/>
they happen to be oppressed
with sicknesse, they do bear
it much better, and sooner
recover, then those others,
whose bodies are full fraught
with ill humours, bred
through the intemperance
of Gluttonie. I know very
many, who although they be
weak by naturall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and well growen in
yeares, and continually bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
in employments of the
minde, neverthelesse by the
help of this Temperance
they live in health, and have
passed the greatest part of
their lives, which have been
many yeares long, without
any notable sicknesse. The
self same is to be made good
by the examples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13691:70"/>
Fathers and Monks of old,
who lived very long, healthy,
and cheerfull in the height
of spare diet.</p>
               <p>30. The reason hereof is,
For that almost all the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
with which men are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
vexed, have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and birth from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion;
that is to say, from
mens taking more of meat
and drink, then Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and then the stomack
can perfectly concoct. In
proof whereof we see, that
almost all diseases are cured
by Evacuation. For bloud is
taken away either by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a vein, or by cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses,
leaches, or otherwise,
that Nature may be lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The great overflowing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13691:71"/>
of humours in the bowells,
and throughout the whole
bodie, are abated and drayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Purgings and other
Medicines: Abstinence and
a very spare diet is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
All which wayes of
cure do plainly shew, that
the disease was bred by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion:
For contraries are
cured by contraries. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Hippocrates, Sect. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</hi>
22. saith, <hi>What ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
are bred by Repletion, are
cured by Evacuation: and those
that are bred through Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by Repletion.</hi> But diseases
by Evacuation happen sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and scarcely other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then upon dearths, sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
sea-voyages, and the like
chances. In which cases, the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13691:71"/>
adust humour, which the
heat through want of food
hath bred and kindled, is first
to be removed; and after
that, the bodie by little and
little is to be nourished and
strengthened, the measure of
food being increased by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The self same course
is likewise to be held for the
repair of Nature, when upon
great sicknesses the Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been many,
whereby the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trength hath
been much empaired.</p>
               <p>Since therefore almost all
diseases proceed from this
ground, to wit, That more
food is taken into the bodie,
then Nature requires; it will
follow, That he who follows
the just measure, shall be free
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13691:72"/>
from almost all diseases.
Which thing is also intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that famous saying of
<hi>Hippocrates, l. 6. Epidemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

exercise of the bodie.</p>
               <p>31. The self same
is confirmed by that
which Physicians
affirm,<note place="margin">Cruditie the mother of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

not thy self out upon every

will be sicknesse.</hi> Now a sober
course of Diet doth prevent
these Crudities, and thereby
cuts away the ground of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
That which we call
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13691:73"/>
                  <hi>Crudities,</hi> is the imperfect
concoction of food. For when
the stomack, either through
the over great quantitie of
meats, or for their refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
qualitie, or for the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of them taken at the same
time, or because there was
not a due space of time left
for the perfect concoction of
food, doth imperfectly digest:
then that Chylus or juice,
which it makes of the meats
so taken, is said to be Crude,
that is, raw, or to have Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
in it; which brings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inconveniences. First, it
fills the brain and bowells
with many phlegmatick and
bilious excrements. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it breeds many obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the narrow passages of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13691:73"/>
the bowells. Thirdly, it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
the temper of the
whole bodie. Lastly, it stuffes
the veins with putrid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
whereof proceed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grievous diseases.</p>
               <p>32. These things might be
largely demonstrated; but the
thing is manifest enough of it
self, especially the first and
the second point: I will onely
therefore explain the third
and fourth.</p>
               <p>When the Chylus is crude,
or malignantly concocted by
the stomack, and rather cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
then digested (for so
<hi>Aristotle</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a corruption, not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction)
there cannot be bred
good bloud in the storehouse
of the Liver, out of this kinde
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13691:74"/>
of Chylus, but onely that
which is bad and vicious.
For, as physicians affirm,
The second concoction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
amend the first. Now
then from corrupt bloud
there cannot be made good
nourishment in the bodie,
but of necessitie the whole
temper of the bodie is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and so becomes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to diseases. For the third
concoction, which is made
in the small pores of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
(where the bloud is assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated
to every part which
it is to nourish, and lastly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the receiving of
the form thereof) cannot
mend the second. By this
means the temper of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
through these Crudities
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13691:74"/>
is by little and little altered,
and marred, and made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to many inconveniences.</p>
               <p>Again, the cruditie of the
Chylus is a cause, that the
veins through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
are replenished with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
and foule bloud, and
such as is mingled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evill humours, which in
tract of time do by little and
little putrifie, and at last upon
occasion of Labour, Heat,
Cold, Windes, and the like,
are set on fire, breaking out
into great and perilous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
whereby an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
companie of men do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
even in the flower of
their age.</p>
               <p>These inconveniences a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
course of Diet prevents,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13691:75"/>
by taking away the Crudities
which are the cause of all.
For when there is no more
taken in, then the stomack
can well concoct, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
sufficient space of
time is allowed thereunto,
Crudities cannot arise; but
the Chylus is made good and
agreeable to Nature: And
from good Chylus, good
bloud is bred; And from good
bloud there followeth good
nourishment and good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in and throughout the
whole bodie.</p>
               <p>By this means also the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
of the humours in
the veins is avoyded; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
obstructions in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
excrements which do
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13691:75"/>
so often vex and molest the
head and inward parts and
joynts of the bodie: So that
a good constitution of the
bodie, and health is hereby
preserved: For they consist in
these two things, to wit, in
the due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of the humours,<note place="margin">Health consisteth in two things.</note> both
in respect of their quantitie
and qualitie; and in a certain
spongie kinde of disposition
throughout the whole bodie,
having no let nor impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by obstructions, so that
the spirits and bloud have
their free passage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
through all parts.</p>
               <p>Nor doth Sobrietie onely
prevent the Cruditie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and the evill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences

but it doth also consume the

doth; as the famous Doctour
<hi>Viringus</hi> doth learnedly shew
<hi>in his 5. Book concerning Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
chap.</hi> 3, 4, 5. For Labour
doth confusedly stirre the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and alwayes exerciseth
some parts more then other,
and most commonly onely
some few parts alone; and
that oft times with a great
perturbation in the humours,
with much heat and hazard
of sicknesse, especially of
Feavers, Pleurisies, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kindes of Distillations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sundry parts, which breed
much grief and pain. But
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13691:76"/>
Abstinence peirceth farre
more inwardly, even unto
the very entralls, and to all
the joynts and knittings in
the bodie, and doth with ease
and equalitie make a generall
evacuation: For it extenuates
that which is overthickened,
it opens that which is closed,
it consumes those things that
are superfluous, it unlocks the
passages of the spirtis, and
makes the spirits themselves
the more cleare; and that
without disturbance of the
humours, without fluxes and
pains, without heating the
bodie, and without hazard of
diseases, without expense of
time, or losse and neglect of
better employments. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it must needs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13691:77"/>
be granted, That Exercise, if

of bones; in regard that
there is either no flux at all
of ill humours, or at least ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little to that part that is
affected. Now the flux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
doth very much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

so that they do very

long life to the followers

thereof, and leads them on
to extreme old Age; so that
when they are to passe out

               <p>Both these things are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest

in a Religious Order. It would
be too long to recount all the
Examples, that might be
brought out of Histories and
the lives of the Saints to the
confirmation of this matter.
I omit very many in our
times, who by means of a
sober course of Life &amp; Diet
have extended their lives
with health untill 80. 90. &amp;
95. yeares space, or upwards.
There are also Monasteries
of women, in which upon a
most spare diet they live to
80. or 90. yeares; so that
those of 60. and 70. yeares
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13691:83"/>
old are scarce accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Aged.</p>
               <p>36. Nor can it be well
sayd, That these whom we
have recounted, lived to so
great ages by the superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
gift of God, and not
by the power of Nature: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as this long life was

that many of them lived till
they were a hundred yeares old,
through the simplicitie of the

               <p>38. But some will say,

               <p>To which I make answer,
That these are but rare, and

and in better health, and
effect farre greater matters
by their wit and learning.
For it cannot be but that
they who live not frugally
should be full of ill humours,
and oft times vexed with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
Nor can they without

be violently withdrawen by

Concoction must needs prove
vicious, and many crudities
necessarily follow: As also in
regard that the head hereby
becomes full fraught with
vapours which do overcloud
the minde, and if a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his thoughts much,
cause pain and grief.</p>
               <p>Lastly, these men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to use much exercise of
bodie, or often to take me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
for the purging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
so that in truth however
they may seem to live long
in the bodie, yet as much as
belongs to the minde and the
understanding, they live but
a while; in regard that it is
but a little and short time,
that they are fit for the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13691:87"/>
being forced to spend the
greatest part of their time
upon the care of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
which is in very truth
to make the Soul become the
servant of the Flesh, that is, a
Slave to its own Vassal. Such
a life suits not with Mans
nature, much lesse with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie;
whose good and
happinesse is altogether spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
and is not to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
purchased then by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the Senses, and
employment and exercise
both of Minde and Bodie.</p>
               <p>39. Adde further to that
which hath been said, That
they who are of weakly
Constitutions, if so be they
live temperately, are much
more secure touching their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13691:87"/>
health and the prolonging of
their lives, then those who
are of the strongest Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that may be, in case they
live intemperately. For these
of the former sort know that
they have no ill juices or
moistures in their bodies, or
at least not in any such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
as to breed diseases: But
those other after some few
yeares must of necessitie have
their bodies cloyed with evil

break out into grievous and

nothing but skin and bones

bodie, is unloosed, not by any
violence used to Nature, but
by a simple Resolution and
Consumption of their Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Humour.</p>
               <p>And it fares with them as
with a Lamp, that when the
Oyl is spent, goes out of it self
without any ado or businesse.
For as a burning
Lamp may be three
wayes extinguished;<note place="margin">Mans life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Lamp.</note>
First, by outward violence, as
when it is blowen out: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by pouring in much
water, whereby the good
Liquour of the Oyl is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13691:90"/>
and corrupted: and Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the waste and spending
of the Oyl it self: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a mans Life (which in
truth resembles much the
nature of a Lamp) is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by three wayes and
means; First, by externall
force, to wit, of the sword,
fire, strangling, and the like:
Secondly, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ill Humours, or the
malignant qua <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itie of them,
whereby the Radicall Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is opprest and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen:
Thirdly, when the
Radicall Humour is in long
space of time quite consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Naturall Heat,
and blowen out into the
aire; which is done after
the same manner that boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13691:90"/>
water or oyl is wasted
by the heat of the fire.</p>
               <p>Now in the first and second
kindes of death there is a
great disturbance of Nature,
and so consequently much
grief must needs ensue, as
long as that continues; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the Temper is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowen
by the violence
of that which is contrarie to
it, and the bond of Nature is
forcibly broken: But in the
third there is either none at
all or very little grief, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the Temper is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
dissolved by little and
little, and the Originall Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie,
in which Life chiefly
consists, is wasted together
with the inbred heat: For
whilest the Humiditie or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13691:91"/>
moisture wasteth, the heat
founded therein doth equally
abate; and the moisture being
spent, the heat is joyntly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
as we see it
comes to passe in Lamps.
After this manner do most
of them die, who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
an exact Rule of diet,
unlesse perchance they die
by means of outward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
For having prevented
evill Humours by their good
diet, there is no inward cause
in them whereby their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
should be violently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
nor their Naturall
Heat oppressed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will needs follow, that
they must live till the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Moisture together with
the Heat that is founded
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13691:91"/>
thereupon be so consumed,
as it is not sufficient to retain
the soul any longer in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
And in the like manner
would a mans death be, if
God should withdraw his
conservation of the Naturall
Heat, although the Radicall
Humour should remain; or on
the other side, if the Radicall
Humour should by divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
be in an instant
consumed.</p>

Benefits which it affords to
the Minde; &amp; they may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be well reduced to five.</p>
               <p>The first is, That it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth
soundnesse and vigour
to the outward
Senses.<note place="margin">It affords vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to the Senses.</note> For the
Sense of Seeing is chiefly
deaded in old men, by reason
that the Optick Nerves are
cloyed with super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13691:93"/>
and vapours: whereby
it comes to passe, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall
spirits which serve
to the sight, are either dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
or not afforded in such
abundance as is needfull for
quick and cleare discerning
of things.</p>
               <p>This impediment is taken
away or much diminished by
the Sobrietie of meat and
drink, and by abstinence from
those things which replenish
the head with fumes; such as
are all fat things, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Butter, if it be taken in
a good quantitie, strong
wines, and thick beer, or
such as are compounded
with those herbs that flie up
into the Head.</p>
               <p>43. The Sense of Hearing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13691:93"/>
is likewise hindered by the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lux of crude and superfluous
humours out of the Brain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Organ of hearing, or
into the Nerve that serves
unto it: for by this means it
comes to passe that a man
grows deaf or thick of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in that part where this
flux of humours is. Now this
flux is very easily prevented
and driven away by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie
of diet. And as it may
be taken away by help of
Physick after it hath befallen
a man (in case it be not let go
on too long, so as it take root)
so likewise it may be taken
away by means of Diet, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if together therewith
some<note n="*" place="bottom">Topica quaedam.</note> Topicall Medicines
be used.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:13691:94"/>44. The Sense of Tasting
is chiefly marred by ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that infect the Organ
thereof: As, if cholerick, tart,
or salt humours possesse the
tongue and throat (whether
it be that they come out of
the Head or out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
whose inward tunicle
is continued with these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans)
all things will relish
bitter, tart, and salt. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
is taken away by
good Diet; by means whereof
it is further brought about,
that the most ordinarie meats,
yea and drie bread it self, do
better taste and relish a sober
man, and yeeld him greater
pleasure, then the greatest
dainties that can be do to
those who are given to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13691:94"/>
Gluttonie. For the evil jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Taste, and which bred<note n="*" place="bottom">

loathing and offence, being
removed and cleared, the
Appetite returneth of it self,
and the pure relish and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
delight in meats is felt.
In like manner, good Diet
conserveth the Senses of
Smelling and Touching.</p>
               <p>45. Neverthelesse, I grant
that by long age the vigour
of the Senses, and especially
of the Eyes and Eares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is
much abated and almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
in regard that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Organs, as also of
the other parts, is by little &amp;
little dissolved; the Radicall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13691:95"/>
Humour and the Native Heat
being by degrees consumed
and dried up: whereupon the
Temper becomes more drie
then is proportionable to the
operations of the Senses, and
all the passages and pores
are stopped up with cold
Phlegme, which is most of
all other things contrarie to
the functions of the minde.
For as old men by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
temper of their bodies
grow drie and cold in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
so likewise they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
full of moisture by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of excrementitiall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
so that old Age is
nothing else but a cold drie
temper, proceeding from the
consumption of the Radicall
Humour &amp; the Native Heat,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13691:95"/>
to which there must needs
be conjoyned great store of
cold Phlegme, dispersed
through the whole bodie.</p>

               <head type="sub">That it mitigates the Passions
and Affections.</head>
               <p>46. THe second Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
which a sober
Diet brings to the Soul of a
man is, That it doth very
much abate and diminish the
Affections and Passions, and
especially those of Anger
and Melancholie, taking
away from them their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
&amp; inordinate violence.
The self same it works upon
those Affections which are
conversant about the taste
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13691:96"/>
&amp; touch of delectable things:
so that in this regard it
ought to be highly prized.
For it is in truth a shamefull
thing not to be able to master
Choler, to be subject to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie
and to sowre cares
of the Fancie, to be enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to Gluttonie, and Slave
to the Belly, to be hurried on
with violence to eating and
drinking, and poured out as
it were to the exercise of
lust and concupis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence. Nor
is it onely shamefull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to Vertue to be thus
disposed, but also very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
in regard of Health,
and full of opprobrie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of good men. But So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie
with much ease re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
all these mischiefs,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13691:96"/>
partly subtracting and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
correcting the Humours
of the bodie, which are the
causes of them. For, that the
Humours are the causes of
such Passions, is both a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ground amongst all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
and Philosophers, and
manifest by experience:</p>
               <p>47. Inasmuch as we see
those who are full of Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Humours to be very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
&amp; Rash; and those who
abound with Melancholie, to
be alwayes troubled with
griefs and fears: and if these
Humours be set on fire in the
Brain, they cause Frenzies
and Madnesse: If a tart Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
replenish the tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Stomack, it breeds
a continuall Hunger and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13691:97"/>
If there be store of
boyling bloud in the bodie, it
incites continually to Lust,
especially if together with it
there be any flatulent or
windie matter. The reason
is, Because the Affections of
the minde follow (as is well
known in Philosophie) the
apprehensions of the Fancie:
Now the apprehension of the
Fancie is conformable to the
disposition of the Bodie, and
to the Humours that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hence
it comes to passe, that Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
persons dream of fires,
burning, warres &amp; slaughter:
Melancholie men of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
funeralls, sepulchres,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>goblins, runnings away,
pits, and such sad and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13691:97"/>
matters: The Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
dream of rains, lakes,
rivers, inundations, drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
shipwracks: The San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
of flyings, courses, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
songs, and love-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Now Dreams are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Fancie, when the
Senses are asleep. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it follows, that as in sleep,
so also in waking, the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
doth for the most part
apprehend things answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Humour and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
then prevalent, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
upon the first present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the object, till it be
corrected and otherwise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by reason.</p>
               <p>So then the excesse of these
Humours doth pervert the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13691:98"/>
naturall condition and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the Fancie. For
Choler, inasmuch as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
bitter and contrarie to
Nature, causeth a man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
other mens words
or deeds, or any thing that
displeaseth him, as if it were
intended against him with
despight and injurie: And
because this humour is fierie
and impetuous, it makes the
apprehension to be swift and
violent, and drives a man on
to a speedie repulse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of the evil which he
conceiveth done towards
him. The Melancholick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is heavy, cold, and drie,
lumpish, sowre, swart in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and very hurtfull to the
heart. And so it causeth that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13691:98"/>
the Fancie apprehends all
things as having enmitie,
bringing sorrow, and full of
darknesse. Now by reason of
the cold &amp; heavinesse therein
it comes to passe, that this
Humour doth not incite a
man to the repulse of evil, as
Choler doth, which is light
and active: but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
it casts a man into
fears, flight, and delayes.
Phlegme is cold and moist,
whereby it comes to passe,
that the apprehension is slow
and dull to every thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any vigour, acrimonie, or
alacritie. So that Choler
makes a man angrie, rash,
hastie, bold, earnest, quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
peevish, angrie at every
thing, a swearer, a curser, a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13691:99"/>
clamourer, and a brawler.
And hence arise so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uries,
fightings, wounds and
slaughters, as are rife amongst
men. For even those things
which are committed upon
drunkennesse, do for the most
part come from the furie of
Choler set on fire, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the wine. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie
makes men sad, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
timorous, solitarie,
thoughtfull, and enclining
to despair. And as Choler,
whilest it boyls, doth for a
short space pervert the right
judgement of the minde: so
Melancholie perverts it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
alwayes, especially if
it be that kinde which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
the brain, or sends
up foul vapours from the

Phlegme makes men slow,

unfit for mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worth. For albeit this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
be not so hurtfull to
the Bodie as Choler and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie,
it is neverthelesse
exceeding contrarie to the
functions of the Minde, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as by the coldnesse
thereof it dulls the vigour of
the spirits, and by the moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof it cloyes the
brain, and stops up the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the spirits.</p>
               <p>48. Now a Sober Diet
doth in great part remedie
all these evils. For by the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13691:100"/>
continuance thereof, the
evil Humours are by little
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> little abated, Nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consuming or driving
them out, and especially if
there be adjoyned some little
help by means of purging
Medicines. Furthermore, the
temper of the bodie is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
inasmuch as there is
a supply of pure and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
bloud, which is
neither mixed with Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor corrupted by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Humours, nor exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any hurtfull qualitie.
And hereupon we see those
men that are accustomed to
Sobrietie, to be calme, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
courteous, cheerfull, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable,
and moderate in all
things. For the benigne juice
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13691:100"/>
or nourishment which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
works upon, causeth
benigne affections and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
and the malignant juice
(such as Choler and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie
breed, if they exceed
either in Quantitie or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie)
causeth fiercenesse and
wildnesse in the affections &amp;
manners. Wherein it is also
very considerable, That evil
Humours do not onely excite
and stirre up passions, and set
them on work; but again by
a certain sympathie that is
between them, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also set on fire, and
strengthened by the passions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and being thus kindled and
strengthened, they adde new
force and strength to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
augmenting &amp; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:13691:101"/>This is evident in the
Cholerick Humour, which,
when it is abundant, stirres
up wrath by means of the
apprehension of the Fancie,
which it hath corrupted:
And on the other side, the
commotion of Anger, by a
certain kinde of Sympathie,
sets on fire the spirits and
the cholerick humour; and
then again the cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
being enflamed, causeth
the Fancie to apprehend the
matter more strongly and
vehemently, so that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie
seems much greater
then it did before: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the commotion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it self is increased and
fortified. And so it oft times
happens that men runne out
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13691:101"/>
from Anger into Madnesse,
if so be the Fancie dwell
long upon imagination of
the injurie. It is therefore
the best counsel that can be
given, to perswade a man to
turn away his thoughts from
the injuries that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
to have received, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the thinking upon
them is prejudiciall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Minde, but also to
the Bodie. In like manner, the
Melancholick Humour, by
means of the Fancie, stirres up
grief, although there be no
true ground for it; and grief
thus set on work, by a certain
kinde of Sympathic strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens

               <p>49. The third Commoditie
arising to the Soul from a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Diet, is, The preservation
of the Memorie. For Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is above all things most
hurt by a cold humour posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Brain, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13691:102"/>
useth most to molest
intemperate persons, &amp; those
who are stricken in age. For
this humour both stops up the
narrow passages of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and benummes the spirits
themselves, making them
sluggish: whereby the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
slow, languid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant;
and oft times they
do so fail a man in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of his discourse, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
knows not what it was
he said, nor about what he
was speaking, but is fain to
ask the standers by concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter that they
were treating of. And this is
caused three wayes; First, by
reason that the Animall spirit
which the Fancie makes use
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13691:103"/>
of, as well in remembrance
as in all her other actions, is
as it were hastily intercepted
in her course by the phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
humour; upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception
whereof the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
ceaseth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
all remembrance.
Secondly, this comes to passe,
in regard that the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was feeble and without
reflexion, and that by reason
of the povertie &amp; unaptnesse
of the spirits. Now the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of any thing, made
without re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lexion, cannot
leave any such print of it self
as is sufficient for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
Forasmuch as all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
is immediately
conversant about our own
actions, and onely mediately
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13691:103"/>
about the objects of those
actions. For I do not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remember that <hi>Peter</hi> was
dead; but that I saw, or heard,
or read that he was dead: so
that where there is no refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
upon our own actions,
there cannot be a sufficient
print left for memorie. The
third cause is, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptnesse
of the spirits: For
albeit the print and footstep
be in some manner sufficient
for its own part; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it comes often to passe,
that by reason of the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or impuritie, or sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or too much heat of
the spirits, we cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
make use of that
print and footstep. And by
this means it sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13691:104"/>
that a man almost quite
loseth his memorie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
all his learning; As
when abundance of cold
Phlegme stops up the narrow
passages of the Brain, and
makes the spirits become
sluggish, and doth overmuch
moisten and cool the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Brain.</p>
               <p>50. Now all this evil is
wonderfully prevented or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a sober and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
course of Diet; to wit, by
abstaining from hot drinks
and such as fume, except it
be in small quantities. For
albeit wine is hot, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
being drunk often and
in abundance, it breeds cold
diseases, to wit, Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Coughs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13691:104"/>
at the nose, Apoplexies, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
&amp;c. And the reason is,
because it fills the head with
vapours, which being there
refrigerated, are congealed
into that cold Phlegme,
which is the cause of all
these evils. Nor must a man
in this case abstain from hot
and fuming drinks onely, but
also from all abundance of
moist things, and, asmuch as
may be, hold himself to a drie
kinde of diet: For so it will
come to passe, that the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
humiditie will either
not be bred, or being bred
will be consumed; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the obstructions
caused by means there of will
be removed, and the passages
of the spirits made free, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13691:105"/>
the spirits themselves rarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and brought to their right
qualitie, and the brain it self
reduced to its naturall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
&amp; become together with
the spirits fit and apt to the
service of the Fancie and the
Memorie.</p>

               <head type="sub">That it helps the Wit and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</head>
               <p>51. The fourth Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
is the vigour of the Wit
in excogitating, reasoning,
finding out, and judging of
things, and the aptitude and
fitnesse that it hath for the
receiving of divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And hence it comes to
passe, that men given to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13691:105"/>
are watchfull, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect,
provident, of good
forecast, able to give counsel,
and of sound judgement: and
for matters of learning, they
do easily grow to excellencie
in those things whereunto
they apply themselves. As for
Prayer, Meditation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
they do perform
them with great facilitie,
pleasure, &amp; spirituall delight.</p>
               <p>The Ancient Fathers and
those that lived in the deserts
prove this by their example,
who being most abstinent,
were alwayes fresh in their
mindes, and spent whole
nights in prayer, &amp; in search
and studie of divine matters,
with so great solace of minde
that they deemed themselves
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13691:106"/>
to be in Paradise as it were,
and perceived not the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the time: And by this
means they came to that
great measure of holinesse,
and familiaritie with God,
and were adorned with the
gifts of prophesie and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and became admirable
to all the world. For having
their mindes alwayes lifted
up and set on God, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
vouchsafed to descend
down to them, illuminating
them wonderfully, according
as it is in the 34 Psalme,
<hi>They had an eye unto him and
were lightened;</hi> making them
partakers of his secrets, and
instruments of his miraculous
works; that so the world
might know how acceptable
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13691:106"/>
their kinde of life was with
God, and be provoked to the
honour &amp; imitation of them.</p>
               <p>52. There are very many
also now adayes, who tend
unto the highest pitches of
wisdome and vertue by the
self same way of Abstinence:
whereof some are very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
in all mens eyes,
through the abundance of
their writings, and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
learning. But no man
without the assistance of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie
can perform any such
matter: and if he obstinately
attempt it, he shall kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
long before his time. No
man is able without the help
of this vertue to refrain his
passions, to keep his minde in
quiet, to perform the services
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13691:107"/>
of the minde about divine
mysteries with ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or to come to any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree of holinesse. For
Sobrietie is as it were the
ground and Basis of all these
things, as <hi>Cassian</hi> teacheth in
his 5 <hi>Book</hi> which is <hi>de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strimargia,
chap.</hi> 14. &amp; 17.
So that all the Saints who
have gone about the building
up of the high Tower of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall
Perfection, have
made their beginning from
this vertue, as from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their spirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</p>
               <p>52. Nor is it any thing
contrarie to this which we
have said, that Faith ought
to be held the foundation of
all vertues, and consequently
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13691:107"/>
the ground-work of all this
spirituall building: Inasmuch
as Faith is the internall and
primarie foundation, into
which all other vertues are
set, and whereupon they are
reared: but Abstinence is an
outward, secondarie, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
foundation, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it removes those
things which breed impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the exercises of
Faith, and to the functions of
the Intellectuall facultie, or
make them full of difficultie,
unpleasant, and tedious: And
together herewith it affords
many helps, whereby the
functions of the Intellectuall
power become more cleare,
easie to be performed, and
delightfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:13691:108"/>For all spirituall progresse
doth depend upon the use of
the Understanding, and of
Faith which resides in the
Understanding. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love any good thing, or
profit in the love thereof, nor
hate any evil thing, or grow
in the hatred thereof, except
it be proposed by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
so as it may move
the Affections: Whereupon
he that is so disposed by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
-Grace, as that heavenly
matters are alwayes in his
minde (as it was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and in other Apostolicall
men) will easily contemne
all earthly things, and so by
degrees, from a great measure
of holinesse attained here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
mount up to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13691:108"/>
of a glorious Crown
of everlasting blisse in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
For the Will doth easily
conform it self to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Understanding,
when matters are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Understanding, not
by starts as it were, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and seriously. From
these grounds it is evident,
That those things which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the functions of the
Minde, or obscure them, or
make them to become diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and irksome, are the
things which in very truth
debarre us from attaining to
any great measure of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
either in Learning, or in
exercises of Religion; or in
sanctitie of Life: And on the
contrarie, those things which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13691:109"/>
make the functions of the
Minde to become more easie,
expedite, cleare, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
are those things which
fit a man to intend spirituall
affairs with ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and do leade on to the
readie attainment of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
wisdome and holinesse.</p>
               <p>54. Since Sobrietre the hath

they are by little and little

unlesse the evil be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate

there is bred a continued

               <p>Nor doth a Sober Diet
onely take away the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Speculation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
minister the proper helps
thereof, to wit, good bloud,
and consequently pure and
well-tempered spirits, and
such a temper in the brain as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13691:110"/>
ought to be. For the very
temper of the brain it self,
which by Intemperance is
made either too moist, or too
cold, or too drie, or too hot, is
by little and little mended
through the help of diet, and
reduced to mediocritie.</p>
               <p>55. This fruit of
Temperance ought
to be highly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:<note place="margin">This is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est moment.</note> For what can a Christian
man more desire, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he that intends Pietie,
then after long old age to
enjoy his Minde healthfull,

to all employments and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

that this is very pleasant in
its own nature, it brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it, if so be we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13691:111"/>
it, a very great spirituall
commoditie: For then by
long experience of forepast
age, the vanitie of the world
is better discerned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more contemptible;
heavenly matters begin to
relish us better, and earthly
to be despised: Those ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
future things which
hang over our heads, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
before our eyes, and
call upon us to make fitting
preparation for them: All the
knowledge and experience
which we have gotten from
our youth up untill that time,
turns then greatly to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and we reap the
sweet fruit thereof. And then
the affections and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our mindes being
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13691:111"/>
calmed, we can with great
ease and pleasure give our
selves to Prayer, Meditation
of divine matters, Reading
of scripture and the works of
the holy Fathers. Then we
may with delight alwayes
busie our mindes with pious
cogitations, and, as the holy
Fathers were wont, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ruminating upon some
one or other divine sentence
out of Gods Word, and with
great reverence and devotion
be constantly partakers of the
Prayers, and other publick
duties which the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
us unto. It is not to be
beleeyed, what an aptnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

facilitie there is in a sober

and consolation they
shall here finde by means
thereof, and consequently
increase their reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>56. This was that which
principally drew me on to
the penning of this Treatise,
to wit, that I might thereby

and lay up in store
for themselves a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of good works. A long
life is little worth, and of
small advantage, if it be spent
in the service of the world,
and not of God, being given
to Covetousnesse, Ambition,
and Pleasure: but if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
devoted to God, and
wholly employed in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of vertue, then undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
it is a thing that ought
to be highly prized, as being
of singular benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
both to a mans own
self, and to the world.</p>
               <p>Wherefore albeit Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

matters. This Imagination
first stirres up the Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
and that straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
moves the spirits to
the expulsion, and they being
thus stirred up do accomplish
the thing, except the Will do
restrain them. Now in the
overcoming of this violence
doth the Christian combate
chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly lie, especially in them
that are in the flower of their
Age, and in the strength of
Nature.</p>
               <p>58. Now Sobrietie doth
take from the Matter and the
Impulsive cause: for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an abatement by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
both in the quantitie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13691:114"/>
and heat of the Seed. It doth
likewise diminish the store
and firinesse of the spirits, by
abstaining from hot and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
meats, and from the use
of wine and strong beer, at
least so long as is needfull for
coming to the right Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie.
And when the Seed is
diminished and tempered,
and withall the spirits, lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
imaginations do cease of
their own accord: or if so be
they rise, they are easily quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
except it be so, that by
Gods permission they are
continued through the devils
suggestion. For lustfull ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
do spring up in the
Minde through a certain
kinde of sympathie which
they have with the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13691:115"/>
of the Bodie, to wit, by
reason of the abundance of
Seed and spirits; as also other
imaginations do, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the condition of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Humour, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
declared. In signe and
proof whereof, we see the
followers of Sobrietie for
the most part free from such
kinde of imaginations and
temptations, or rarely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
with them. Now if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
be there be not store of these
causes laid up before hand in
the bodie, Sobrietie doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
prevent their growth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as it causeth that a
man neither eats nor drinks
more then the sustentation of
the bodie requires: For he
doth not measure the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13691:115"/>
of those things which
he takes, by his Appetite,
which is altogether deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
but by Reason, which
looks what and how much is
proportionable for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Bodie, and
the performance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and services belonging to
the Minde.</p>
               <p>59. Now there is
a double Reason,<note place="margin">Why the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ull.</note>
why the Appetite
becomes a deceitfull Measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in this kinde. The first is,
Because the Appetite doth
not onely desire that which
is nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sarie to the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bodie, but also
that which may serve for the
use of Procreation. For the
appetite of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13691:116"/>
is both in men and beasts
ordained to both these ends,
to wit, to the conservation
of the Individuall, and to the
propagation of the whole
Kinde. And therefore Reason
chargeth them who desire to
live chastly, and not to be
molested by the sting of Lust,
that they should not obey
their Appetite to the full, but
give it satisfaction onely to
the half, that is, onely asmuch
as is needfull for the suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Bodie: which
thing if they carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
there will be little store
of Seed bred in their Bodies,
and very few incitements to
Lust. For Seed is bred of that
superfluitie of the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was more then
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13691:116"/>
requisite for the sustentation
of the bodie: So that where
there is no more sustenance
taken in, then is sufficient for
the nourishment of the bodie,
there remains either nothing
at all, or very little to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
for the increase of
Seed.</p>
               <p>60. The other cause why
the Appetite is deceitfull, is,
Because it oftentimes longs
after more then is any way
proportionable to either of
these fore-mentioned ends,
that is to say, more then is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
either for the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Bodie, or for the
matter of Propagation. And
that is caused either through
the ill disposition of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
as it comes to passe in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13691:117"/>
that ravening kinde of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
which is called <hi>Dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunger,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Buli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>a.</note> 
                  <hi>Ox-hunger,</hi> and
when the Melancholick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is soaked into the tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the stomack: or else by
reason of the condiments, and
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mangonia.</note> Lickorish cooking of the
meats themselves, which by
their varietie and new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
do go on continually
provoking the Appetite, and
stirring up Gluttonie. In
which regard, this varietie
and curious dressing of meats
is, as Physicians teach, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to be eschewed by all
them that are followers of
Sobrietie and Chastitie, and
in very truth by all those
who have care of their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13691:117"/>
health, concerning which
thing we have discoursed
more largely before.</p>
               <p>By all this it appeares,
That there is farre greater
vertue and power for the
quenching of Lust, in Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and Abstinence, then in
other corporall mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
such as are hair-cloths,
whippings,<note n="*" place="bottom">Chameuni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</note> lying upon the
ground, and bodily labours:
for these do onely afflict the
bodie outwardly, and but rase
the skin as it were, but come
not at all to the ground of the
evil which lies hidden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
But Abstinence plucks up
the cause of all by the roots
in the inward veins, reducing
the naturall temper to a just
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13691:118"/>
mediocritie. This remedie
then is to be used by all those
who are vexed with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
               <p>61. And thus much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the benefits and singular
fruits of Sobrietie: all which
might well be confirmed by
the testimonies of the ancient
holy Fathers: but for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake I omit them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
my self with one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
onely out of S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi>
who in his first Homily
concerning Fasting writes
thus: <hi>Fasting is, asmuch as lies
in us, an imitation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
a contemning of things
present, a school of prayer, a
nourishing of the soul, a bridle
of the mouth, an abatement of
concupiscence, as they that use
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13691:118"/>
to fast do well know and prove
in themselves: It mollifies rage,
it appeaseth anger, it calms the
tempests of Nature, it excites
reason, it cleares the minde, it
disburdens the flesh, it chaseth
away night-pollutions, it frees
from head-ach, and it breeds
cleare and well-coloured visa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
By fasting a man gets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

at the price of so much pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, At
first indeed this sparenesse of
Diet is somewhat trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
in regard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
usage formerly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in regard of the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the stomack: but by
little and little that trouble is
removed. For we must not
suddenly passe from a great
quantitie to a small, but every
day by degrees subtracting a
little, till we come to the just
measure, as <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ippocrates</hi> doth
oftentimes warn: for by this
means the stomack is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by little and little
without any great trouble,
and the greedinesse which
was formerly felt, is taken
way. Now when the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13691:120"/>
comes to be contracted
to the right measure that it
ought, there is no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
remaining by means of a
Sober Diet, inasmuch as that
small quantitie doth justly
agree and answer the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
and strength of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.
In proof whereof we
see, that it is very grievous
to most men to forbear their
usuall Break-fast at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Lent; but by little
and little that offence is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished:
and divers do in
the end finde such benefit by
Abstinence, as that they
choose willingly ever after
to forbear Break-fast. The
self same do many prove in
forbearing of Suppers. And
in like manner, after that men
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13691:120"/>
have a while forced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they finde no pain in
abstaining from divers kindes
of meats, to which their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
did formerly leade
them with great violence.
It is therefore altogether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
which is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
That a sober Diet
doth torment a man with
continuall hunger.</p>
               <p>63. Secondly, I answer,
Suppose there were some
trouble in such kinde of diet,
and that it should d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re long,
(which yet in truth is not so)
yet ought we to consider the
many profits and benefits
which it brings in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of this small trouble;
to wit, That a sober Diet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells
diseases, preserves the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13691:121"/>
bodie agil, healthfull, pure
and clean from noysomnesse

to the Wit, and
clearenesse and aptnesse for
the receiving of divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
And further, quiets
the Passions, drives away
Wrath and Melancholie, and
breaks the furie of Lust; In a

               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:13691:121"/>64. And on the contrarie,
a disordered life repayes that

affords to the throat, with
an innumerable companie of
mischiefs: For it oppresseth

all other exccllent and loftie
matters; whereby is brought
about, that there can be little
progresse made either in
knowledge of good things,
or in holinesse of life, or in
the exercise and performance
of good works.</p>
               <p>And what a goodly Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is it, for the enjoyment
whereof we undergo all this
losse and damage! Nothing
but a short delight of the
throat for a minutes space,
which is onely felt whilest
the meat is in chewing and
going down into the belly;
which in it own nature is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
base and contemptible,
being no other then that
which is common with us
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13691:122"/>
together with the beasts, and
such as doth affect onely a
very small portion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
to wit, the tongue, the
palate, and the throat: For
this it is, that we pull upon
our selves all these mischiefs;
and through the desire of this
it is, that the following of
Temperance seems such1 a
difficult businesse: For were
there no pleasure in taking
meat and drink, there would
be no grief in forbearing
them. Intemperance then
hath no other p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ece of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in it, then onely a base
momentanie delight &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the throat. What a
height of miserie and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie
then must it needs be
for a man to enthrall himself
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13691:123"/>
to the slaverie thereof, and
for this cause to endanger so
many inconveniences &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices?
what a deal of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
and gall doth Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
poure in, after the small
sweet and pleasure which it
hath afforded!</p>
               <p>65. These things ought to
be diligently considered and
weighed by wise men, and
especially by Church-men,
and such as set themselves
apart to the service of God,
whose profession is to attend
continually upon divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
and the functions of
the minde. For if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ponder these things, it
will not be possible but that
we should make choice of
Sobrietie, and finde it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13691:123"/>
and easie; and on the
contrarie, Intemperance will
appeare and prove full of
horrour and detestation unto
us: we shall be ashamed of
our delicacie, and blush at the
feeble and base tempers of
our mindes, that are so capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
to the service of Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie,
that we slavishly obey
the Tyrannicall Rule of it,
not being able to resist the
most base and transitorie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
thereof. What can
be more vile and undecent
for a man, then to be a slave
to his belly? And what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
madnesse, then to renounce
and quit our interest in all
those excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t benefits which
Sobrietie brings both to Soul
and Bodie, for a little tickling
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13691:124"/>
delight in the throat? and to
expose our selves to the lash
of all those evils both of Soul
and Bodie, wherewith In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
scourgeth her
followers? Oh the wretched
condition of mankinde, that
is subject to so great vanitie,
blinded with so much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and beset with so many
errours; whose minde is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
in his judgement and
choice, by a vain appearance
of delectable good, as it useth
to be in dreams!</p>
               <p>66. And thus much shall
suffice to have spoken touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sobrietie, as it is the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
means and instrument
for preservation of bodily
health and vigour of minde
in and unto long old age, and

as it is a procurer of the most
excellent good that can be,
to both parts of a man,
bringing abundance both of
Temporall and Spirituall
Benefits to the exercisers
thereof.</p>
               <p>I heartily beseech God,
that the things thus written
may prove to the good of
many; and will conclude in

the Flesh, to which the

by Intemperance; who,
if they had lived, would have
been an ornament to the
world, and a comfort to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13691:126"/>
friends: I thought fit to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in a short Treatise, that
Intemperance was not such
an evil, but it might easily be
remedied: which I undertake
the more willingly, because
divers worthy young men
have obliged me unto it. For
when they saw their parents
and kindred snatcht away in
the midst of their dayes, and
me contrariwise, at the age of
eightie and one, strong and
lustie; they had a great desire
to know the way of my life,
and how I came to be so.
Wherefore, that I may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their honest desire, and
withall help many others,
who will take this into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
I will declare the
causes which moved me to

forsake Intemperance, and
live a sober life, expressing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the means which I have
used therein. I say therefore,
that the infirmities, which
did not onely begin, but had
already gone farre in me,
first caused me to leave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
to which I was
much addicted: For by it, and
my ill constitution, (having
a most cold &amp; moist stomack)
I fell into divers diseases, to
wit, into the pain of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
and often of the side,
and the beginning of the
Gout, with almost a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
fever and thirst.</p>
            <p>From this ill temper there
remained little else to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of me, then that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many troubles and griefs I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13691:127"/>
should quickly come to an
end; whereas my life seemed
as farre from it by Nature, as
it was neare it by Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.
When therefore
I was thus affected from
the thirtie fifth yeare of my
age to the fortieth, having
tried all remedies fruitles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Physicians told me
that yet there was one help
for me, if I could constantly
pursue it, to wit, <hi>A sober and
orderly life:</hi> for this had every
way great force for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
and preserving of
Health, as a disorderly life to
the overthrowing of it; as I
too wel by experience found.
For Temperance preserves
even old men and sickly men
sound: But Intemperance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13691:127"/>
most healthy and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
constitutions: For
contrarie causes have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
effects, and the faults
of Nature are often amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Art, as barren grounds
are made fruitfull by good
husbandry. They added
withall, that unlesse I spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
used that remedy,
within a few moneths I
should be driven to that
exigent, that there would be
no help for me, but Death,
shortly to be expected.</p>
            <p>Upon this, weighing their
reasons with my self, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
from so sudden an
end, and finding my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
oppressed with pain
and sicknesse, I grew fully
perswaded, that all my griefs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13691:128"/>
arose out of Intemperance:
and therefore out of an hope
of avoiding death and pain,
I resolved to live a temperate
life.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, being direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them in the way I
ought to hold, I understood,
that the food I was to use,
was such as belonged to sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
constitutions, and that in a
finall quantitie. This they had
told me before: But I, then
not liking that kinde of Diet,
followed my Appetite, and
did eat meats pleasing to
my taste; and, when I felt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heats, drank delightfull
wines, and that in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
telling my Physicians
nothing thereof, as is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of sick people. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13691:128"/>
I had resolved to follow
Temperance and Reason, and
saw that it was no hard thing
to do so, but the proper duty
of man; I so addicted my self
to this course of life, that I
never went a foot out of the
way. Upon this, I found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few dayes, that I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
helped, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
thereof, within lesse
then one yeare (although it
may seem to some incredible)
I was perfectly cured of all
my infirmities.</p>
            <p>Being now sound and well,
I began to consider the force
of Temperance, and to think
thus with my self: If <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
had so much power as
to bring me health; how
much more to preserve it?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13691:129"/>
Wherefore I began to search
out most diligently what
meats were agreeable unto
me, and what disagreeable:
And I purposed to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those that pleased my
taste brought me commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or discommoditie; and
whether that Proverb,
wherewith Gluttons use to
defend themselves, to wit,
<hi>That which savours, is good
and nourisheth,</hi> be consonant
to truth. This upon triall I
found most false: for strong
and very cool wines pleased
my taste best, as also melons,
and other fruit; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
raw lettice, fish, pork,
sausages, pulse, and cake,
and py-crust, and the like: and
yet all these I found hurtfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:13691:129"/>Therefore trusting on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
I forsook all these
kinde of meats and drinks,
and chose that wine that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my stomack, and in such
measure, as easily might be
digested: Above all, taking
care never to rise with a full
stomack, but so as I might
well both eat and drink
more. By this means, within
lesse then a yeare I was not
onely freed from all those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
which had so long beset
me, and were almost become
incurable; but also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I fell not into that
yearely disease, whereinto I
was wont, when I pleased
my Sense &amp; Appetite. Which
benefits also still continue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
from the time that I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13691:130"/>
was made whole, I never
since departed from my set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
course of <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> whose
admirable power causeth
that the meat and drink that
is taken in fit measure, gives
true strength to the bodie,
all superfluities passing away
without difficultie, and no ill
humours being ingendred in
the body.</p>
            <p>Yet with this diet I avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
other hurtfull things also,
as too much heat and cold,
wearinesse, watching, ill
aire, overmuch use of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of marriage. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the power of health
consists most in the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of meat and drink, yet
these forenamed things have
also their force. I preserved
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13691:130"/>
me also, asmuch as I could,
from hatred and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and other perturbations
of the minde, which have a
great power over our consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.
Yet could I not so
avoid all these, but that now
and then I fell into them,
which gained me this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that I perceived, that
they had no great power to
hurt those bodies, which
were kept in good order by
a moderate Diet: So that I
can truly say, That they who
in these two things that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in at the mouth, keep a
fit proportion, shall receive
little hurt from other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Galen</hi> confirms, when
he sayes, that immoderate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13691:131"/>
heats and colds, and windes
and labours did little hurt
him, because in his meats and
drinks he kept a due modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore never
was sick by any of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
except it were
for one onely day. But mine
own experience confirmeth
this more; as all that know
me, can testifie: For having
endured many heats &amp; colds,
and other like discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the bodie, and troubles
of the minde, all these did
hurt me little, whereas they
hurt them very much who
live intemperately. For when
my brother and others of my
kindred saw some great
powerfull men pick quarrels
against me, fearing lest I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13691:131"/>
should be overthrown, they
were possessed with a deep
Melancholie (a thing usuall
to disorderly lives) which
increased so much in them,
that it brought them to a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
end. But I, whom that
matter ought to have affected
most, received no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
thereby, because that
humour abounded not in me.</p>
            <p>Nay, I began to perswade
my self, that this suit and
contention was raised by the
Divine Providence, that I
might know what great
power a sober and temperate
life hath over our bodies and
mindes, and that at length I
should be a conquerour, as
also a little after it came to
passe: For in the end I got the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13691:132"/>
victorie, to my great honour,
and no lesse profit: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also I joyed exceedingly;
which excesse of joy neither
could do me any hurt. By
which it is manifest, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
melancholie, nor any
other passion can hurt a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
life.</p>
            <p>Moreover I say, that even
bruises and squats, and falls,
which often kill others, can
bring little grief or hurt to
those that are temperate.
This, I found by experience,
when I was seventie yeares
old: for riding in a coach in
great haste, it happened that
the coach was overturned,
and then was dragged for a
good space by the furie of
the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby my head
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13691:132"/>
and whole bodie was sore
hurt, and also one of my arms
and legges put out of joynt.
Being carriedhome, when the
Physicians saw in what case
I was, they concluded that
I would die within three
dayes. Neverthelesse at a
venture two remedies might
be used, letting of bloud, and
purging, that the store of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and inflammation, and
fever (which was certainly
expected) might be hindred.</p>
            <p>But I, considering what an
orderly life I had led for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares together, which
must needs so temper the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the bodie, that they
could not be much troubled,
or make a great concurse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
both remedies and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13691:133"/>
commanded that my arm
and legge should be set, and
my whole bodie anointed
with oyl: and so without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedie or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
I recovered; which
seemed as a miracle to the
Physicians. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That they that live a
temperate life, can receive
little hurt from other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>
            <p>But my experience taught
me another thing also, to wit,
That an orderly and regular
life can hardly be altered
without exceeding great
danger.</p>
            <p>About foure yeares since,
I was led by the advise of
Physicians, and the dayly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
of my friends, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13691:133"/>
adde something to my usuall
stint and measure. Divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they brought, as, that old
age could not be sustained
with so little meat and drink;
which yet needs not onely
to be sustained, but also to
gather strength, which could
not be but by meat &amp; drink.
On the other side I argued,
that Nature was contented
with a little, and that I had
for many yeares continued
in good health, with that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
measure; that Custome
was turned into Nature, and
therefore it was agreeable to
reason, that my yeares increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and strength decreasing,
my stint of meat and drink
should be diminished, rather
then increased; that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13691:134"/>
might be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the agent, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since the power of my
stomack every day decreased.
To this agreed two Italian
Proverbs, the one whereof
was,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mangierà più, chi manco mangia. Ed è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trario, Chi più mangia, manco mangia. If senso e, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>He that will eat much,
let him eat little;</hi> because by
eating little, he prolongs his
life. The other Proverb was,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Fa più pro quel che si lascia sul' condo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> ventr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>The meat which remaineth,
profits more then that which is
eaten.</hi> By which is intimated,
that the hurt of too much
meat is greater, then the
commoditie of meat taken
in a moderate proportion.</p>
            <p>But all these things could
not defend me against their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13691:134"/>
importunities. Therefore, to
avoid obstinacie, and gratifie
my friends, at length I yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and permitted the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of meat to be increased,
yet but two ounces onely. For
whereas before the measure
of my whole dayes meat, viz.
of my bread, and egges, and
flesh, and broth, was twelve
ounces exactly weighed; I
increased it to the quantitie
of two ounces more; and the
measure of my drink, which
before was foureteen ounces,
I made now sixteen.</p>
            <p>This addition after ten
dayes wrought so much upon
me, that of a cheerfull and
merrie man I became melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie
and cholerick; so that
all things were troublesome
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13691:135"/>
to me: neither did I know
well, what I did or said. On
the twelfth day, a pain of the
side took me, which held me
two and twentie houres. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the neck of it came ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fever, which continued
thirtie five dayes and nights;
although after the fifteenth
day it grew lesse and lesse.
Besides all this, I could not
sleep, no not a quarter of an
houre: whereupon all gave
me for dead.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, I by the
grace of God cured my self,
onely with returning to my
former course of Diet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I was now seventie
eight yeares old, and my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
spent with extream lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the season of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13691:135"/>
yeare was winter and most
cold aire. And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that under God nothing
holp me, but that exact rule
which I had so long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In all which time I felt
no grief, save now and then
a little indisposition for a day
or two.</p>
            <p>For the Temperance of so
many yeares spent all ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red not any
new of that kinde to arise,
neither the good humours to
be corrupted, or contract any
ill qualitie, as usually happens
in old mens bodies, which
live without rule. For there
is no malignitie of old age in
the humours of my bodie,
which commonly kills men.
And that new one, which I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13691:136"/>
contracted by breaking my
diet, although it was a fore
evil, yet had no power to kill
me.</p>
            <p>By this it may clearely be
perceived, how great is the
power of order and disorder;
whereof the one kept me
well for many yeares; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though it was but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
excesse, in a few dayes had
so soon overthrown me. If
the world consist of order, if
our corporall life depend on
the harmonie of humours &amp;
elements, it is no wonder that
order should preserve, and
disorder destroy. Order makes
arts easie, and armies victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and retains and confirms
kingdomes, cities, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
in peace. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13691:136"/>
That an orderly life is
the most sure way &amp; ground
of health and long dayes, and
the true and onely medicine
of many diseases.</p>
            <p>Neither can any man denie
this, who will narrowly
consider it. Hence it comes,
that a Physician, when he
cometh to visit his patient,
prescribes this Physick first,
That he use a moderate diet:
and when he hath cured him,
commends this also to him, if
he will live in health. Neither
is it to be doubted, but that he
shall ever after live free from
diseases, if he will keep such
a course of life: because this
will cut off all causes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ases,
so that he shall need
neither Physick nor Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13691:137"/>
yea, if he will give his
minde to those things which
he should, he will prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Physician, and that a
very compleat one: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no man can be a perfect
Physician to another, but to
himself onely. The reason
whereof is this, Every one
by long experience may
know the qualities of his
own nature, and what hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
properties it hath, what
meat and drink agrees best
with it: which things in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
cannot be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such observation, as is
not easily to be made upon
others; especially since there
is a greater diversitie of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
then of faces. Who
would beleeve that old wine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13691:137"/>
should hurt my stomack, and
new should help it; or that
cinnamon should heat me
more then pepper? What
Physician could have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
these hidden qualities
to me, if I had not found
them out by long experience?
Wherefore one to another
cannot be a perfect Physician.
Whereupon I conclude, since
none can have a better Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
then himself, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Physick then a Temperate
Life, Temperance by all
means is to be embraced.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, I denie not
but that Physicians are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
and greatly to be
esteemed for the knowing &amp;
curing of diseases, into which
they often fall, who live dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13691:138"/>
For if a friend who
visits thee in thy sicknesse,
and onely comforts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles;
doth perform an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
thing to thee; how
much more dearely should a
Physician be esteemed, who
not onely as a friend doth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
thee, but help thee!</p>
            <p>But that a man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
himself in health, I
advise, that in stead of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
a regular life is to be
embraced, which, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by experience, is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Physick most agreeable
to us, and also doth preserve
even ill tempers in good
health, and procure that they
prolong their life even to a
hundred yeares and more, and
that at length they shut up
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13691:138"/>
their dayes like a Lamp, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a pure consumption of
the radicall moisture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grief or perturbation of
humours. Many have thought
that this could be done by
<hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> or the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
stone,</hi> sought of many,
and found of few. But surely
there is no such matter, if
Temperance be wanting.</p>
            <p>But sensuall men (as most
are) desiring to satisfie their
Appetite, and pamper their
belly, although thy see
themselves ill handled by
their intemperance, yet
shunne a sober life: because
they say, It is better to please
the Appetite (though they
live ten yeares lesse then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they should do)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13691:139"/>
then alwayes to live under
bit and bridle. But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not, of how great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ten yeares are in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
age, wherein wisdome
and all kinde of vertues is
most vigorous; which, but in
that age, can hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
And that I may say
nothing of other things, are
not almost all the learned
books that we have, written
by their Authors in that age,
and those ten yeares, which
they set at naught in regard
of their belly?</p>
            <p>Besides, these Belly-gods
say, that an orderly life is so
hard a thing that it cannot be
kept. To this I answer, that
<hi>Galene</hi> kept it, and held it for
the best <hi>Physick:</hi> so did <hi>Plato</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:13691:139"/>
also, and <hi>Isocrates,</hi> and <hi>Tullie,</hi>
and many others of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
and in our age, <hi>Paul the
third,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Bembo,</hi>
who therefore lived so long;
and among our Dukes, <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
and <hi>Donatus,</hi> and many
others of inferiour condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not onely in the citie,
but also in villages and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
            <p>Wherefore since many
have observed a regular life,
both of old times and later
yeares, it is no such thing
which may not be performed;
especially since in observing
it, there needs not many and
curious things, but onely that
a man should begin and by
little and little accustome
himself unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:13691:140"/>Neither doth it hinder, that
<hi>Plato</hi> sayes, that they who
are employed in the common
wealth, cannot live regularly,
because they must often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
heats, and colds, and
windes, and showers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
labours, which suit not
with an orderly life: For I
answer, That those inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
are of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as I shewed before) if
a man be temperate in meat
and drink; which is both easie
for common-weals-men, and
very convenient, both that
they may preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from diseases, which
hinder publick employment;
as also that their minde, in all
things wherein they deal,
may be more lively and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:13691:140"/>But some may say, He
which lives a regular life, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes light meats, and
in a little quantitie, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
shall he use in diseases,
which being in health he
hath anticipated? I answer
first; Nature, which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to preserve a man as
much as she can, teacheth us
how to govern our selves in
sicknesse: For suddenly it
takes away our appetite, so
that we can eat but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
wherewith she is very
well contented: So that a sick
man, whether he hath lived
heretofore orderly or disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
when he is sick, ought
not to eat, but such meats as
are agreeable to his disease,
and that in much smaller
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13691:141"/>
quantitie then when he was
well. For if he should keep
his former proportion, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is alreadie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with a disease, would
be wholly oppressed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I answer better, That he
which lives a temperate life,
cannot fall into diseases, and
but very seldome into indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
because Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance
takes away the causes
of diseases: and the cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away, there is no
place for the effect.</p>
            <p>Wherefore since an orderly
life is so profitable, so vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
so decent, and so holy, it
is worthy by all means to be
embraced; especially since it
is easie and most agreeable to
the nature of Man. No man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13691:141"/>
that followes it, is bound to
eat and drink so little as I: No
man is forbidden to eat fruit
or fish, which I eat not: For
I eat little, because a little
sufficeth my weak stomack:
and I abstain from fruit, and
fish, and the like, because
they hurt me. But they who
finde benefit in these meats,
may, yea ought to use them:
yet all must take heed, lest
they take a greater quantitie
of any meat or drink (though
most agreeable to them) then
their stomack can easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest:
So that he which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with no kinde of meat
and drink, hath the <hi>quantitie,</hi>
and not the <hi>qualitie</hi> for his
rule, which is very easie to be
observed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:13691:142"/>Let no man here object un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, That there are many,
who, though they live disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
yet continue in health
to their lives end: Because
since this is at the best but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
dangerous, and very
rare, the presuming upon it
ought not to leade us to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
life.</p>
            <p>It is not the part of a wise
man, to expose himself to so
many dangers of diseases and
death, onely upon a hope of
an happie issue, which yet
befalls verie few. An old
man of an ill constitution,
but living orderly, is more
sure of life, then the most
strong young man who lives
disorderly.</p>
            <p>But some, too much given
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13691:142"/>
to Appetite, object, That a
long life is no such desirable
thing, because that after one
is once sixtie five yeares old,
all the time we live after, is
rather death then life. But
these erre greatly, as I
will shew by my self, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
the delights and
pleasures in this age of eighty
three, which now I take, and
which are such, as that men
generally account me happie.</p>
            <p>I am continually in health,
and I am so nimble, that I can
easily get on horseback with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the advantage of the
ground, and sometimes I go
up high stairs and hills on
foot. Then, I am ever cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
merrie, and well-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
free from all troubles and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13691:143"/>
troublesome thoughts; in
whose place, joy and peace
have taken up their standing
in my heart. I am not wearie
of life, which I passe with
great delight. I conferre often
with worthie men, excelling
in wit, learning, behaviour,
and other vertues. When I
cannot have their companie,
I give my self to the reading
of some learned book, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to writing; making
it my aim in all things, how
I may help others to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
of my power.</p>
            <p>All these things I do at my
case, and at fit seasons, and in
mine own houses; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they are in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
place of this learned Citie
of <hi>Padua,</hi> are verie beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13691:143"/>
and convenient above
most in this age, being so built
by me according to the rules
of Architecture, that they are
cool in summer, and warm in
winter.</p>
            <p>I enjoy also my gardens,
and those divers, parted with
rills of running water, which
truely is very delightfull.
Some times of the yeare I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the pleasure of the <hi>Euga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
hills, where also I have
fountains and gardens, and a
very convenient house. At
other times, I repair to a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of mine, seated in the
valley; which is therefore
very pleasant, because many
wayes thither are so ordered,
that they all meet and end in
a fair plot of ground; in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13691:144"/>
midst whereof is a Church
suitable to the condition of
the place. This place is wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the river <hi>Brenta;</hi> on
both sides whereof are great
and fruitfull fields, well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured
and adorned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
habitations. In former
time it was not so, because
the place was moorish and
unhealthy, fitter for beasts
then men. But I drained the
ground, and made the aire
good: Whereupon men flockt
thither, and built houses with
happy successe. By this means
the place is come to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
we now see it is: So
that I can truly say, That I
have both given God a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and men to worship him

me.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I ride to some
of the neighbour-cities, that I
may enjoy the right &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of my friends, as
also of excellent Artificers in
<hi>Architecture, painting, stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

whereof in this age there
is great plentie. I view their

those of Antiquitie: And ever
I learn somewhat which is
worthy of my knowledge: I
survey <hi>palaces, gardens,</hi> and
<hi>antiquities,</hi> publick <hi>fabricks,
temples,</hi> and <hi>fortifications:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omit I any thing that
may either teach, or delight
me. I am much pleased also
in my travells, with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13691:145"/>
of situation. Neither is this
my pleasure made lesse by the
decaying dulnesse of my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
which are all in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
vigour, but especially my
Taste; so that any simple fare
is more savourie to me now,
then heretofore, when I was
given to disorder and all the
delights that could be.</p>
            <p>To change my bed, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
me not; I sleep well and
quietly any where, and my
dreams are fair and pleasant.
But this chieflly delights me,
that my advice hath taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the reducing of many
rude and untoiled places in
my countrey, to constivation
and good husbandrie. I was
one of those that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
for the managing of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13691:145"/>
that work, and abode in those
fenny places two whole
moneths in the heat of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
(which in <hi>Italie</hi> is very
great) receiving not any hurt
or inconvenience thereby: So
great is the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of that <hi>Temperance</hi> which
ever accompanied me.</p>
            <p>These are the delights and
solaces of my old age, which
is altogether to be preferred
before others youth: Because
that by <hi>Temperance</hi> and the
<hi>Grace of God</hi> I feel not those
perturbations of bodie and
minde, wherewith infinite
both young and old are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by this also, in
what estate I am, may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
because at these
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13691:146"/>
yeares (<hi>viz</hi> 83) I have made a
most pleasant comedie, full
of honest wit and merriment:
which kinde of Poems useth
to be the childe of Youth,
which it most suits withall
for variety and pleasantnesse;
as a Tragedie with old Age,
by reason of the sad events
which it contains. And if a
<hi>Greek Poet</hi> of old was praised,
that at the age of 73 yeares he
writ a Tragedie; why should
I be accounted lesse happie,
or lesse my self, who being
ten yeares older have made a
Comedie?</p>
            <p>Now lest there should be
any delight wanting to my
old age, I daily behold a
kinde of immortalitie in the
succession of my posteritie.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13691:146"/>
For when I come home, I
finde eleven g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and-children
of mine, all the sonnes of one
father and mother, all in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
health; all, as farre as I
can conjecture, very apt and
well given both for learning
and behaviour. I am delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their musick and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
and I my self also sing
often; because I have now a
clearer voice, then ever I had
in my life.</p>
            <p>By which it is evident,
That the life which I live at
this age, is not a dead, dump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
and sowre life; but cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
lively, and pleasant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if I had my wish, would
I change age and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them who follow
their youthfull appetites, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13691:147"/>
they be of a most
strong temper: Because such
are daily exposed to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
dangers and deaths, as
daily experience sheweth,
and I also, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I was a
young man, too well found.
I know how inconsiderate
that age is, and, though
subject to death, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
afraid of it: For
death to all young men is a
terrible thing, as also to those
that live in sinne, and follow
their appetites: whereas I
by the experience of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares have learned to
give way to Reason: whence
it seems to me, not onely a
shamefull thing to fear that
which cannot be avoided;
but also I hope, when I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13691:147"/>
shall come to that point, I
shall finde no little comfort
in the favour of Jesus Christ.
Yet I am sure, that my end
is farre from me: for I know
that (setting casualties aside)
I shall not die but by a pure
resolution: because that by
the regularitie of my life I
have shut out death all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wayes. And that is a
fair and desirable death,
which Nature brings by way
of resolution.</p>
            <p>Since therefore a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
life is so happie and
pleasant a thing; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
but that I should
wish all who have the care

it with open arms?</p>
            <p>Many things more might

            <p>The Ancient Sages were

            <p>Undoubtedly, our extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie

            <p>But I would fain once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
from these Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods,
that seem born onely to
waste good meat, what the
reason may be, That now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
the store of victuals is
so much abated, and the price
enhaunsed of that it was in
time of old; when yet the
world appeares to have been
then much fuller of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13691:151"/>
then it now is. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
That scarcitie and
deernesse, under which we
labour, can proceed from
nothing but our excessive
Gluttonie, which devoures
things faster then Nature
can bring them forth. And
that plentie and cheapnesse,
which crowned their happie
dayes, was maintained and
kept on foot chiefly through
the good husbandrie of that
<hi>frugall and simple Diet</hi> which
they used.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> writing of the
course of life held by those
good Fathers that retired
themselves into the deserts
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the better to serve
God, tells us, That they were
so enamoured of Spare and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13691:152"/>
Simple Diet, that they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
it in themselves for a
kinde of Riot, to feed on any
thing that was drest with
Fire. The same in every point
doth <hi>Cassian</hi> report, in his
Relations of the Holy <hi>Monks</hi>
and <hi>Hermites</hi> of his time.</p>
            <p>I finde in Ancient Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
that the inhabitants of
the old world were such
strict followers of <hi>Sobrietie,</hi>
that they kept themselves
precisely to Bread in the
morning; and at night they
made their Supper of Flesh
onely, without addition of
Sauces, or any first or second
courses. And by this means
it came to passe, that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so long and in continuall
health, without so much as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13691:152"/>
once hearing the names of
those many grievous infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
that now adayes vex

            <p>What think you might be

passed so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of yeares, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any acquaintance at all
with Physick or Physicians?
Surely nothing else but their
sober spare Diet; which,
when all is done, we are oft
times constrained to undergo,
and ever indeed directed and
advised unto, by those who
really practise this Divine
Science of Physick, for the
recoverie and conservation
of their patients health, and
not covetously for their own
gain.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:13691:153"/>I reade in approved Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,

was so pressed with hunger,
that he was fain to call in at

brought him a piece of Rie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread;
which when he had
eaten, he took a solemne
oath, That he never in all his
life had tasted better, nor
more pleasing meat: And
from that day forward, he
set light by all the costly sorts
of bread, which he had been
formerly accustomed unto.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the brother
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being overthrown
in battell, was constrained in
his flight to sit down with
drie Figges and Barley bread;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13691:154"/>
which upon proof he found
so good, as he seriously la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
his misfortune, in
having (through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
cloying of artificiall
dainties, wherewith he had
been bred up) been so long
time a stranger to that great
pleasure and delight, which
naturall and simple food
yeelds, when it meets with
true hunger.</p>
            <p>True it is, Our belly is a
troublesome Creditour, and
oft times shamelesly exacts
more then its due: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
if we were not
partiall, and corrupted by the
allurements of that base con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
which dainties promise,
we might easily quiet the
grudgings and murmurings
thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:13691:154"/>It's not the Belly (I wis)
which would rest well
enough apayd with that
which is at hand; but the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of our capricious
Fancies, that makes us wear
out our selves, and wearie all
the world besides with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
travell in the search
of Rarities, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of new Delicacies.
If we were but half as wise
as we ought to be, there need
none of all this ado that we
make, about this and that
kinde of Manchet, Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,
and French-bread: and
I know not what new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are brought on foot, to
make more businesse in the
world; whereas with much
lesse cost and trouble we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13691:155"/>
might be much better served
with that which growes at
home, and is to be found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in every thatcht cottage.
That which is most our own,
and that which we therefore
perhaps (fools as we be) most
contemne in this kinde, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
bread</hi> I mean, is by all the
old Physicians warranted for
a most sound and healthfull
food: He that eats daily of it,
say they, shall undoubtedly
never be troubled with the
Gout in the feet.</p>
            <p>Shew me such a vertue in
any of these new inventions,
and I'le yeeld there were
some reason perhaps in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of them, if they
might with ease and quiet
be procured. But to buy them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13691:155"/>
at the price of so much pains,
time, and hazard as they cost
us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, were undoubtedly too
much, although they brought
asmuch benefit as they do
prejudice.</p>
            <p>Consider well (I pray)
whether it be not a thing to
make a wise man runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
himself, to see such a
ransacking of all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by <hi>Fishers,</hi> and <hi>Fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and <hi>Hunters;</hi> such a
turmoyling of the world by
<hi>Cooks,</hi> and <hi>Comfit-makers,</hi> and
<hi>Tavern-keepers,</hi> and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlesse
many of such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
occupations; such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
of mens lives on Sea
and Land, by heat and cold,
and a thousand other dangers
and difficulties: and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13691:156"/>
in procuring daintie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the greedie
Maw, and senslesse Belly, that
within a very short while
after must of necessitie make
a banquet of it self to
worms.</p>
            <p>What an endlesse maze of
errour, what an intolerable
hell of torments and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hath this wicked <hi>Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
brought the world unto!
And yet, wretched men that
we are, we have no minde to
get out of it, but like silly
Animals led by the chaps,
go on all day long, digging
our Graves with our Teeth,
till at last we bring the Earth
over our heads much before
we otherwise need to have
done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:13691:156"/>And yet there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
odde fellow once in the
world (I would there were
not too many of the same
minde now adayes!) <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus</hi>
by name, that seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wisht he might have a
swallow as long and as large
as the Cranes, the better to
enjoy the full relish of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corish
morsells. Long after
him, I reade of another of
the same fraternitie, <hi>Apitius,</hi>
I trow, that set all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
in good cheare: but
little credit (I am sure) he
hath got by the means; no
more then <hi>Maximinus,</hi> for
all he was an Emperour, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
his using every meal to stuffe
into his paunch thirty pounds
of flesh, beside bread and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13691:157"/>
wine to boot. But <hi>Geta</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
in my opinion the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
of <hi>Gluttons,</hi> as he had
of the <hi>Romanes:</hi> His feasts
went alwayes according to
the letters of the Alphabet:
as when <hi>P</hi>'s turn came, he
would have <hi>Plovers,</hi> and
<hi>Partridges,</hi> and <hi>Peacocks,</hi> and
the like; and so in all the
rest, his table was alwayes
furnished with meats whose
names began with one and
the same letter.</p>
            <p>But what do I raking up
this carrion? Let them rot in
their corruption, and lie more
covered over with Infamie
then with Earth. Onely, to
give the world notice who
have been the great Masters
of this worthie Science of

filling the belly and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good cheare, I have been
enforced to make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of some of their
goodly opinions and pranks.
Which let who so will be
their partner in: for my part,
I solemnely avow, that I
finde no greater miserie then
to <hi>victuall the Camp</hi> (as the
Proverb is) cramming in lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
over night, and to be
bound next morning to rise
early, and to go about serious
businesse.</p>
            <p>Oh what a piece of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie
is it, to feel within a

and those <hi>Flushing

eating! And what a shame
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13691:158"/>
(if our foreheads were not
of brasse, and our friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom we act them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

would it be, to stand <hi>ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ning,

            <p>On the contrarie, what a
happinesse do I prove, when
after <hi>a sober pittance</hi> I finde
sound and quiet sleep all
night long, and at peep of
day get up as fresh as the
morning it self, full of vigour
and activitie both in Minde
and Bodie, for all manner of
affairs! Let who will take his
pleasure in the fulnesse of
delicates: I desire my part
may be in this happie enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>When I was last at <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina,</hi>
my Lord <hi>Antonie Doria</hi>
told me, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

<hi>My Lord, had I been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed

in my youth, I had never come
to this age which you see, nor

            </p>
            <p>See now! here's a proof
even in our Age, That the

mens lives in the old world
was chiefly caused by the
means of Blessed <hi>Temperance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need more

I'le make an end with that

Tiberius,</hi> and the like: And
on the contrarie, the friends
and followers of Sobrietie
and Frugalitie to have been
men of divine spirits, and
most heroicall performances
for the benefit of mankinde;
Such as were <hi>Augustus, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander

and all the rest who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred

            <p>A spare diet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is better
