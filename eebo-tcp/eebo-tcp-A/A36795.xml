            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If then the meer Inclosure and Tillage of that which naturally yielded little profit, doth justly deserve so great a commendation; how much more is the skill and pains of those to be had in esteem, who have recovered many vast proportions of Land, totally overwhelm'd with a deluge of waters? And of these I need not look out for examples from abroad, our own Countrey af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foarding a multitude of notable Instances, as the ensuing Discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this was it, which gave encouragement to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:49029:4"/>
the sole Adventurers for the Drayning of those vast Fenns of <hi>Cambridgshire,</hi> and the five other adjacent Counties; (a worthy Work, and never totally attempted till their times;) well discerning, that by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat performance thereof, the costly and troublesome meeting of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for Sewers; the frequent great Taxes, for the maintenance of divers Banks and Drains, with many unhappy controversies and emulations relating thereto, might be, in a great measure prevented. And if our industry were but comparable to that of our Neighbours in the <hi>Belgique</hi> Provinces, how much more might those drayned grounds afford us, for profit and pleasure, than they yet do? forasmuch as theirs, lying below the Levell of the Sea at high Tydes, is drayned by Engines, which cast out the water; and ours have not only a descent to the Sea, but divers large Rivers and streams for leading the waters to their natural out-falls.</p>
            <p>To give instance in the benefits: First let us consider the large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this one Levell, which is no less than five hundred thousand Acres, it being, from the edge of <hi>Suffolk, to Waynflete in Lincolnshire,</hi> full <hi>Lxviii.</hi> miles in a strait line: And if we reckon by the bow of the Fenn, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth up on both sides of the River <hi>Witham,</hi> within a mile of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> it may be well accounted <hi>Lxxx</hi> miles; the bredth being in many places <hi>xxx.</hi> more <hi>xx.</hi> and seldom so little as ten miles: so that, 'tis thought by some, to be as good ground, and as much, as the States of the low Countries enjoy in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next for the richness of the soyl, being gained from the waters, doth it not for the most part exceed the high grounds thereon bordering, as much as other meadows do, which are ordinarily let for <hi>xx <hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> the Acre? And do we not see, that in the Marshes beyond <hi>Waynflete in Lincolnshire,</hi> where the grounds are severed and trenched, it is hard to find a poor man, though they sit at great Rents? for their Cattel, being alwaies sound and thriving, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore merchandable; or if they come to a mischance, yet fit for food.</p>
            <p>Moreover, besides the great plenty of flesh and white meats, with the breed of servicable Horses, let us consider the abundance of Wooll, Hydes, Tallow, and other Commodities, which this fruitfull ground now produces; and that the new Chanels, made for the Drayning, do yield no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to all those parts, for the carriage of their Corn and Merchandize; whereas before, they were constrayned to go many miles about, according to the natural bending of the Rivers.</p>
            <p>And if we weigh the great inconveniences, which these over-flowings have produced; certainly the advantage by the general Drayning ought the more to be prized: for in the Winter time, when the Ice is strong enough to hinder the passage of Boats (as hath been by some well observed) and yet not able to bear a man; the Inhabitants upon the Hards and the Banks within the Fenns, can have no help of food, nor comfort for body or soul; no woman aid in her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ravail, no means to baptize a Child, or partake of the Communion, nor supply of any necessity, saving what those poor desolate places do afford. And what expectation of health can there be to the bodies
<pb facs="tcp:49029:4"/>
of men, where there is no element good? the Air being for the most part clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, gross, and full of rotten harrs; the Water putrid and muddy, yea full of loathsome vermin; the Earth spungy and boggy; and the Fire noysome by the stink of smoaky Hassocks.</p>
            <p>As for the decay of Fish and Fowl, which hath been no small ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestion against this publick work, there is not much likelyhood thereof: for notwithstanding this general Drayning, there are so many great Meeres and Lakes, still continuing, which be indeed the principal harbours for them, that there will be no want of either; for in the vast spreading waters they seldom abide, the Rivers, Chanels, and Meeres being their principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles; which being now increased, will rather augment than diminish their store. And that both Fish and Fowl are with much more ease taken by this restraint of the waters within such bounds, we daily see; forasmuch as all Netts for Fishing, are better made use of in the Rivers and Meeres, than when the waters are out of those narrower limits: And that <hi>Decoys</hi> are now planted upon many drayned Levels, whereby greater numbers of Fowl are caught, than by any other Engins formerly used; which could not at all be made there, did the waters, as formerly, overspread the whole Countrey.</p>

Floris</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> demanding the Isle of <hi>Walchren,</hi> in <hi>Zeeland,</hi> from <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi>; after a warr betwixt them, upon this quarrel, they came to an accord; <hi>viz.</hi> That Count <hi>Philip</hi> should enjoy to him and his heirs for ever, the Land of <hi>Waes,</hi> (which is one of the best quarters of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly held) and <hi>Floris</hi> to be restored to the said Isle of <hi>Walchren</hi>; in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, he should send to Count <hi>Philip</hi> a thousand men, expert in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Ditches, to stop the breach, which had been made neer unto <hi>Dam,</hi> or the <hi>Sluse</hi>; whereby the Countrey was drowned round about, at every high Sea; the which the <hi>Flemings</hi> could by no means fill up, neither with wood, nor any other matter, for that all sunk as in a gulf without any bottom, whereby in processe of time, <hi>Bruges</hi> and all that jurisdiction had been in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost by inundation, and to become all Sea, if it were not speedily repaired. Wheerupon Count <hi>Floris</hi> sent the best workmen that he could find in all his Countryes: who being come to the place, they found a great hole, neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Dam</hi>; and at the entrance thereof, a Sea Dog, that, for six dayes together, did nothing but cry and howl very terribly. They not knowing what it might signifie, resolved to cast this Dog into that hole; whereupon a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Hollander,</hi> getting into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Dike, took the Dog by the tail, and cast him into the midst of the Gulf, with earth and turf after him; so as, finding a bottom, they filled it up, by little and little.</p>
               <p>And because many workmen, that came in to the repairing of this work, lodg'd in Cabins (which made the place seem a pretty Town) Count <hi>Philip</hi> gave to them, and such others as would inhabit there, as much land, as they could recover, from <hi>Dam</hi> to <hi>Arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> for them and their successors for ever, with divers immunities and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; by reason whereof, many plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves there, and in tract of time made it a good Town; the which, by reason of this Dog, so cast into the hole, they named <hi>Hontsdam</hi>; that is to say, a <hi>Dogs-Sluce; Dam</hi> in <hi>Flemish</hi> signifying a <hi>Sluce,</hi> and <hi>Hondt</hi> a <hi>Dog:</hi> And therefore, at this day, the said Town (now called <hi>Dam</hi>) carryeth a Dog in their Arms.</p>

                  <hi>Diickgraven,</hi> that by them, both the inner and outer Banks, may upon all occasions be repaired and made good, in case of any breach or weakning in them. Which Banks are of that strength and height, that they do preserve the Country from certain drowning at the high tides: For it is evident to all that sayl in the Ports of these flat Countries, that at full Sea, the Fields within the Banks, wherein Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are depasturing, and Corn growing, do lye below the levell of the Ocean, which is to many no small astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Having thus shewed, how and by whom this Country of <hi>Holland</hi> was first gained and made habitable, I will now make some observation, of those advantages as have been farther acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of late years, by this active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious people in their great and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial improvements; the number of the Inhabitants so much increasing, as that urgent necessity enforc'd them to make use of their utmost skill, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing somewhat, as might be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in such a case. This was by drayning of sundry Lakes, whereof six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen were most considerable; all which was performed within the space of these last fifty years, by certain Wind-mills, devised and erected for that purpose. The chiefest of which Lakes, called the <hi>Beemster</hi> (containing above eighteen hundred Acres) made dry by the help of <hi>Lxx.</hi> of those Mills, and walled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a Bank of great strength and substance, is now become a place of such profit and pleasure, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cattel, that are fed in it, and the plantation therein, otherwise made, that it may not without desert, be very justly called, the most famous Garden of all that Province.</p>
               <p>The other Lakes, so drayned, as I have said, do lye about the Cities of <hi>Alcmare, Horne,</hi> and <hi>Purmerende</hi>; and are vulgarly called <hi>de Schermere, de W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That the performance of these emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent works, required extraordinary knowledge and skill, which antient times had not attained to, and forein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now admire, is not to be doubted; the Engines of several kinds made use of, in this businesse, for raising up the water and casting it off, being framed by men of singular judgements in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical learning, and suitable to the depth of the water, or opportune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it away.</p>
               <p>Neither have the attempts of these people, by the like commendable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, in <hi>South-Holland,</hi> about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Leden, Dort,</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> had lesse successe; there having been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thousands of Acres, formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with water, made good and firm land, within these few years, by the help of these Engins, as I have been credibly informed by that learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

               <p>And in the next place to take a view of the other, heretofore, surrounded Marshes in that County, aswel adjacent to the <hi>Thames,</hi> as bordering on the Sea: And, having so done, to ascend up the stream of that fair River, on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side: And then descending on the North side, to observe what I have met with, which is memorable, in reference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Marshes that lye on either.

Cambridge, Huntindon, Northampton, Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> wherewith I shall conclude this work.</p>

               <p>To attribute it unto the <hi>Britans</hi> (the primary Inhabitants of this Nation) or to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who succeeded them, I dare not adventure; the first of these, being a people so rude and barbarous, as they were not verst in any Arts; and the latter so illiterate, for the most part, as that little of invention can justly be ascribed to them. That it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a work of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whilst they were Masters here, as it is the opinion of some learned men, so do I make thereof no doubt, considering to what a height, not only in learning, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Arts and Sciences that people were arrived, as by sundry testimonies we plainly find. Besides, it is not only evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the credit of our best Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that their several Colonies, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst throughout this Nation, were so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently disciplined; that, for avoiding the mischiefs, which idlenesse produces, they were alwayes exercised in some fit and necessary imployments, as those great and publick <hi>Ways</hi>

               <p>Whereupon they say, that, by teason of the said <hi>Godfrey's</hi> default, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse taken for repair of those Banks and Watergangs was justly made: Of which, there were assigned by the said Jurats, three perch and a half at the least, for his proportion in the Bank of <hi>Apuldre,</hi> to be repaired at his costs; and according to the overflowing of the waters, more, if need should be, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places: And whether they might not have taken a greater distresse upon him, they appeal to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p>Whereunto the said <hi>Hamon</hi> and the rest replyed, that in former time there was a difference betwixt the Tenants in the said Marsh, touching the repair of the before-specified Banks and Water-gangs: Upon which there grew a sute in the Country before the Shireeve; wherein the said <hi>xxiiii</hi> Jurats; deeming themselves wronged, came to the King's Court and complained to the Shireeve; alleging this Plea did not pertain to the Shireeve, to hold: It was therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the King's Counsel, that the Kings Justices should be sent thither, to ordain and dispose of those differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to Justice; and, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Henry de Bathe</hi> being sent, all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the said Marsh had summons of <hi>xl</hi> dayes, as in the <hi>Iter</hi> of the Justices. And the said <hi>Henry,</hi> upon his view of those Banks and VVater-gangs, by the consent &amp; good liking of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monality of the said Marsh, then ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and all the tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the said Marsh, should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribute to the repair of those Banks &amp; Water-gangs, according to the quantity of their tenements. VVhereupon, as the said <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> desired to be defended by the said Banks &amp; water-gangs, the said <hi>Hamon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that he the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> should contribute to those repairs, as it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the presence of the said Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: And that there was such an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as aforesaid, he referred himself to the Record, in the Rolls of the said <hi>Henry de Bathe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And also the said <hi>Hamon</hi> further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, that of necessity the said <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> ought to contribute to the said Banks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because, that if his land should not be defended by them, it would be wholly drowned &amp; made salt. But to this the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> answered, that though that Ordinance was so made by the said <hi>Henry,</hi> yet he the said <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> never gave his consent thereto; and that he was neither summoned, nor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come before him at the making thereof. And moreover said, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the same Ordinance, so made; nor after, either he or his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors ever so contributed; but alwayes held their land quietly without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action at all, according to the Tenor of the before-specified King <hi>Henry's</hi> Charter (Grandfather to the then King <hi>Henry</hi>) untill two years before, that the before-specified <hi>Hamon</hi> and others, took his Cattel: Whereupon he required judgement, whether the same Ordinance ought to prejudice him in that behalf.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, the said <hi>Hamon,</hi> and others replyed, that he had the common sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>xl</hi> dayes, in such sort as the whole Commonality of the said Marsh had, whereof he ought not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; And thereupon said, that though the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> would not come, as he ought to have done, with his neighbours, he ought not therefore to be free from payment of the before-specified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution for repair of those Banks; because it conduced to the common profit of all the Tenants in the same Marsh; that aswell his lands, as the lands of the other Tenants, be defended by the said Banks and Water-gangs; whereupon he required judgement. And he also said, that after the said Ordinance, the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> and his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants gave one Mark towards the repair of the said Banks and Water-gangs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he the said <hi>Hamon</hi> was Bayliff: And that this he was ready to justifie.</p>
               <p>To which the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> answered, that he held himself to the before-spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Charter of King <hi>Henry</hi>; And to the liberty, which he and his Ancestors had used, against which no Ordinance, made by the said <hi>Henry de Bathe,</hi> could or ought to do him harm: And stood upon it, that neither himself, nor any by him, had given ought, either before the said Ordinance so made, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and that this he was ready to justifie.</p>
               <p>After which, on the morrow after the feast of <hi>S. Martin,</hi> in the <hi>xlii</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 3, came the said <hi>Godfrey, Hamon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And the Shireeve had command, that he should bring <hi>xii,</hi> aswell Knights, as others, having no lands in the said Marsh, on the morrow three weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Easter,</hi> by whom the truth might be the better discovered; to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> and his Ancestors, after they had their land of <hi>Hurst,</hi> of the gift and grant of the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King <hi>Henry,</hi> had wont to repair the said Banks and Water-gangs, together with others that had lands in the said Marsh, and to contribute with them for their repair, when need should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

               <p>But the Shireeve, not making his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as above-said, was amerc'd, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother VVrit directed to him, to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the said <hi>xij</hi> men, to appear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the morrow after the Feast of the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi>: At which time the said <hi>Godfrey, Hamon</hi> and others, came, and required that judgement should be done, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Record and processe upon the before-specified Plea.

               <p>By virtue of which Precept, the Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeve of <hi>Kent</hi> was commanded to bring before the said Justices, at a certain day and place, <hi>xxiiij</hi> aswell Knights as other honest and lawful men, of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinage of <hi>Monketone</hi> and <hi>Menstre,</hi> (in the Isle of <hi>Thanet</hi>) and to enquire of the premisses.

King; in which Ordinances it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contained, that all persons, having Lands or Tenements, or common of Pasture or Fishing; or that had defence and preservation in any sort, or might have, by the Banks, Ditches, Gutters; Sewers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in those Marish grounds; ought to contribute, according to the quantity of their said Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either by number of Acres, or by Carucates, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their said tenure, not only, to the new making of the said Banks, Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to their repair and support, as often and whensover need should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: Whereupon it seemed meet to the said Justices; that, not only they, who had grounds lying neer to those Banks; but also they, who held lands situate within the before-specified Marshes of <hi>Monketone</hi> and <hi>Menstre</hi>; whether neer, or at a large distance; forasmuch as they are within the peril of the Sea, and had, or in some sort might have had safety and defence by the same Banks, Ditches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to contribute thereto, according to the quantity of their tenure, without any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, either to rich or poor, of what condition, state, or dignity soever: And to be compelled thereto, not only by distresses and amerciaments, but also by double the chardge; and whatsoever other wayes or means, is in the said Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances contained.</p>

Lords of the Fees to assist the said Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors in the assessing and gathering the said moneys, and likewise, if need be, to distrain for the same.</p>
               <p>Also that the said Common Bayliffs should cause the said <hi>xij</hi> men to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as often and whensoever there might be need; or that there was any danger, to supervise all the Banks, Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Water-gangs, Sewers, and Gutters; and to take certain consideration, before they departed, of all the defects; and likewise to assesse a certain portion of money upon every acre, to each Tenant, according to the quantity of what he held; and also to repair and amend the said defects within a certain time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they belong'd to particular persons, or the whole Commonalty; and for the fulfilling of all those deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, that they be not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by distresses, but by amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and double, if need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>And the said Bayliffs moreover, should punish all such, as being refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their summons, did not appear. And if any mans Land, lying within the Banks of the said Marshes, were digg'd for the repair of the said Banks, Ditches, Sewers or Water-gangs; or for any new Bank or Ditch; or for the making of an in-ditch or out-ditch, that then the Commonalty of every Marsh should give satisfaction to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty damnified, by the discretion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the said Jurats, according to the usage of Marish Lands; having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes respect to the quantity of the ground so digged or lost: Saving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the Lords of the Fees their right which they had and ought to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Tenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Who appearing, and the said Jury taking the premisses into farther consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, said upon their Oaths; that, as to the Fishing, the said Prior and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent had antiently a certain mill in a place called <hi>Lydene</hi>; which Mill being burnt in the time of warr, there was no other there built till that the Prior then living about...... years past erected a new one: And they said, that after the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, the said Prior raised a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gutter, four foot high, which had there been made in former time, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the water from the upper parts of the Country: And they said likewise, that without the said Gutter, there then was a certain Fishing, which the Kings Officers belonging to <hi>Dover</hi> Castle (it being within the liberties thereof) sold sometimes for 30<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> sometimes for 20<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. and sometimes

for lesse: And that the course of the said water, which passed through the before-specified Gutter, passed to that place, wherein those condemned persons had wont to be drowned, and their bodies carryed to the Sea. And they moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver said, that after the same Gutter was so raised, the water, so descending from the upper parts before-mentioned, could not passe through it, whereby not only the said fishing became totally lost, but the drowned bodies could not be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sea by that Stream as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and all this, by reason that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had not it's passage there, as usually; and that the ground without the Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so increased, and grew higher, that the stream could not have it's course there.</p>
               <p>And the said Jury being asked, how long that Gutter had been so raised; they answered, for four years only<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By reason whereof, by virtue of the said Letters Patents, the Shireeve was commanded, that he should not neglect for any Liberty, but cause <hi>xxiiij</hi> aswell Knights as other honest and lawful men of this County, by whom the truth might be the better known, to come before the said Justices at <hi>Apuldore,</hi> in the said County, on the <hi>Thursday</hi> before the Feast of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> then next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, to enquire and make certificate to the said Justices concerning the Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and touching other Articles and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances specified in the said Letters Patents; and lastly to do and receive what should be enjoyned them on the said King's behalf.</p>

               <p>And afterwards on the before-specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friday, at <hi>Lyde</hi> aforesaid, came the said <hi>Will. Brent</hi> (who then prosecuted for the King in this businesse) before the said Sir <hi>Iohn Fogge,</hi> and the rest of his said fellow Justices before named: And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the said Jurors of the first panell, as those of the second, being impanelled in form aforesaid, as also sworn and chardg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enquire of the premisses, came, and severally said upon their Oaths; that in the said Lands and Marshes within those limits before mentioned, except before excepted, the wall of the Marsh of the <hi>Becard,</hi> called <hi>Becard Wall,</hi> leading from the Marsh called the <hi>Kete</hi> unto the Marsh of <hi>Estmarsh</hi>: And also the Bank of the said Marsh, called <hi>Estmarsh Wall,</hi> leading to the <hi>Ree Wall,</hi> were defective and stood in need of repair, for resisting the Sea and salt water: And if that the salt water of the Sea, should enter on any part of the said Banks, or in any place from thence to <hi>Holmystone</hi> aforesaid (which is at the East part of the Bank, called <hi>Newe Wall,</hi> lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sea and the Land of <hi>Promhill</hi> aforesaid) and that a resistance thereof could not be easily made, all the Lands and Marshes before mentioned, situate within the precincts before-specified, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept before excepted, touching the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereof information was given, in form aforesaid, unto the said Justices, would be in a very short time overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the salt water, to an inestimable damage.</p>
               <p>And the said Jurors did likewise seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expresse, that it would be proper for the safeguard and defence of all those Lands and Marshes (except before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) called <hi>Becard Wall,</hi> and <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh Wall,</hi> to be sufficiently repaired as soon as conveniently could be, and continually sustained against the violence of the Sea, Storms, and Tides, lest the salt water should get in at any of them, and thereby all these Lands and Marshes (except before excepted) be drowned. And they farther said, that it would be very expedient, that the said Bank called <hi>Newe Wall,</hi> which is without the said Banks called <hi>Kent Wall</hi> and <hi>Simonds Wall,</hi> and within the bounds aforesaid (except before excepted) should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently repaired as soon as might be, to withstand the rage of the Sea, storms, and Tides, for the defence of the said Banks called <hi>Kent Wall</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondes Wall</hi>; and afterwards conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually maintained for prevention of the peril of the Seas inundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto those Lands and Marshes were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>And likewise the said Jurors, in form aforesaid sworn, and severally chardged, did say upon their Oaths; that it seemed to them expedient, that the Lands and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49029:33"/>
Marshes, called <hi>Cheyncourt, Seynt Thomas Innyng</hi> and <hi>White kempe,</hi> which were within those precincts and lyable to the said danger, should be dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one Sewer in the Land of <hi>Thomas</hi> then Archb. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at <hi>Rounde mershe,</hi> running into the Sea where the Gutter then was; and that there should be made in that place Sluces and Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, fit and proper for that purpose: And that there should also be Bayliffs, Jurats, and other Officers, within the said limits (except before excepted) for the view and conservation of the Marish grounds and Banks within those bounds, except before excepted. And that there should be had for every Sea-bank there, a common Forland, as before that time had been used, upon which such carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as should be necessary for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, maintenance, or making of those Walls, might, without impediment be made.</p>
               <p>And likewise the said Jurors, being in form aforesaid sworn, did severally say; that the Land-holders in the said Marsh, called the <hi>Becard,</hi> who ought to pay and contribute to the repair and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Banks within those limits, except before excepted, had not any way, by which they might go, ride, or drive to that Marsh nor from it, except over other mens Lands, or upon the Banks or Forland leading thence to and from the said Marsh. And they said, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Custome of the Marsh-law there, in all such cases before that time used, the Tenants of that Land, at their pleasure, might go, ride, and drive to and fro to the said Marsh, and from the said Marsh, over and upon the Forland of the Banks leading to the said Marsh and from the same. And as to the number of Acres, or partition of the Lands and Marshes <hi>&amp;c.,</hi> within those limits (except before excepted) or of the certainty of the Land-holders, and how much land every such Tenant had or held of the said Lands and Marshes, within the said li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits (except before excepted) the said Jurors did severally present the certainty thereupon, according to the form, and as it was contained in the Books of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers within those limits (except before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) then exhibited before the said Justices.</p>

               <p>And it was farther enquired, whether any of the said Tenants did ever contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the aid of any other Tenant for the repair and maintenance of those Banks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon any such breach hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in former times: And it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered no: For they said, that every Tenant had wont to repair and sustain all the Banks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon his own proper land, at his own chardge, upon perill which might befall. And because that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-specified Free-holders, who were not guilty of the said breach, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault thereof, as by the said inquisition was found; whereas they should have had benefit by the repair of those banks, as in reason they ought, and contrarywise sustained great losse; that they might have their action therefore, if they saw good: And that the said Bishop and his Bondmen, through whose neglect, those breaches, drowning, and damages came, should be distrained from day to day for the repair and maintenance afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>By reason of which Inquisition, for that the King was informed that the said Bishop and his Bondmen did refuse to perform those repairs, at their proper costs and chardges, upon their lands bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the before-specified River, the Shireeve had command, that he should summon the said Bishop, to appear in the Court of Kings Bench, in the <hi>xvm•</hi> of <hi>S.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully executed: and therefore saith, that the Lands and Tenements aforesaid, were not overflowed and drowned through the default of the Bishop and his Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in not repairing and maintaining the Banks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aforesaid, upon those their Lands. But he said, that on the Even of the <hi>Circumcision</hi> of our Lord, in the <hi>xviith</hi> year of the said Kings reign, there hapned a mighty floud, proceeding from the tempestuousnesse of the Sea, which overflowed all the Banks, aswell those that were against other mens lands, as those against the lands of the same Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and his Bondmen; and drowned all the said grounds: Which floud af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in it's retreat to the Sea, made a certain ground-breach upon the Land of the said Bishop, which could not be repaired by the labour of one Tenant; so that every man having any land so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed, ought to be chardged equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for his proportion, towards the repair thereof,<note place="margin">☜</note> according to the Custome of the Marsh. And farther said, that if all the Land-holders there, would joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the repairing and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said ground-breach in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he the said Bishop and his Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be ready, for their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to assist and contribute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Adam de Fyncham</hi> the King's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, then said, that the said Walls <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were so broken and torn, through the default of repair by the said Bishop and his Tenants, upon their own grounds; that all the before-specified Lands and Tenements were thereby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed, and in divers places drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as aforesaid, to the great damage and peril of all those Land-holders: And that this he was ready to make proof of. And the Bishop said as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and that if there were any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing at all, it was occasioned by the said impetuous floud, which went over all the said Banks and Ditches; and which made that ground-breach before-speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in it's retreat; and not by the default of him and his Bondmen aforesaid; and desired that this might be enquired of by the County. And so likewise did the said <hi>Adam,</hi> then the Kings Attorney. Whereupon the Jurors in the said Court of Kings Bench, in the <hi>xvme</hi> of S. <hi>Michael</hi>:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49029:43"/>
and said upon their Oathes; that the Banks, Ditches <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the coast of <hi>Thames,</hi> situate betwixt the said Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and the Town of <hi>Shadwell,</hi> were not broken through the default of the Bishop and his bondmen; and that the said Lands were not so overflowed and drowned through any defect in repair of them: For they said, that all the Land was so overflowed by the means of that huge floud before-mentioned, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the vehement tempests from the Sea, about the Feast of the Circumcision of our Lord before-speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; which ran over all the said Banks and Ditches; and which in it's fall to the Sea, made the said ground-breach, whereby those Lands became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards often overflowed, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And the said Jurors being asked who ought to repair that ground-breach; answered; that according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of those parts,<note place="margin">☞</note> every man having any part in the said Land, lying betwixt the said Hospital and <hi>Shadwell,</hi> ought and had wont to contribute, according to his proportion, to the repair and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of such a ground-breach, when it should happen: And therefore the Shireeve was commanded to distrain not only the said Bishop and his bondmen, but all other persous having Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the said Hospital and the Town of <hi>Shadwell,</hi> lying within the before-specified peril, for the repair and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ditch, where the said ground-breach was made by that great floud; and likewise to repair the Banks, Ditches, Sewers and Gutters, which, by means of that ground-breach, were so broken and torn.</p>
               <p>In pursuance of which verdict, the said King in the same 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his reign (wherein the pleading above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was) assigned <note n="b" place="margin">Pat. 18 <hi>E.</hi> 2. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But she said, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49029:46"/>
one <hi>Iohn de Covele,</hi> long ago, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, held in the said Marsh, as of the fee of <hi>Munt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fichet</hi> (which then belonged to Sir <hi>Iohn de Handlo</hi>) fifty acres of land, together with the said Bank, then called <hi>Coveles Wall,</hi> and a certain piece of Pasture, called the <hi>Hope,</hi> lying neer the said Bank, without the precinct of the said Marsh, <hi>viz.</hi> between the same Bank and the course of the River of <hi>Thames</hi>: which land, together with the said Bank of <hi>Hope,</hi> were before that time, ever assessed together, for the repair of that Bank, whensoever it stood in need. And the said <hi>Iohn de Couele,</hi> being so seized, aliened the said Bank and <hi>Hope,</hi> to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert le Ku,</hi> to hold to him and his heirs, for the repairing and maintaining of the said Bank, for ever; the said <hi>Hope</hi> then being sufficient for the Pasturage of six Kine, as it was reported.</p>
               <p>And afterwards the said <hi>Iohn de Couele,</hi> long before the Statute, entituled <hi>Quia emptores terrarum,</hi> sold the said Land by parcells to divers Tenants, to hold to them and their heirs, of him the said <hi>Iohn</hi> and his heirs, for a certain yearly Rent and sute of Court to be thereupon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: And afterwards the said <hi>Iohn</hi> did wholly sell from himself and his heirs, all the demesn of the before-spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Tenements, together with the whole Rent and service, which he had wont to receive of his said Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, unto one <hi>Simon de Passelewe</hi>: and the said <hi>Simon</hi> sold them to one <hi>Cecelie de Lancaster</hi>: And she the said <hi>Cecelie</hi> granted the said whole Lordship, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Rents and services before mentioned to the Church of S. <hi>Leonard</hi> of <hi>Stratford,</hi> and to the Nunns there serving God; to hold in pure Alms: And so the said Prioresse then had and possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the said Lordship, together with the Rent and service aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And she farther alleged, that the said <hi>Robert le Ku,</hi> whilst he lived and held those Lands and <hi>Hope,</hi> alway repaired that Bank. And after his decease, the said Bank and <hi>Hope,</hi> descended to <hi>Ioane</hi> his daughter and heir, who was wedded to one <hi>Will. de Rokesle</hi>; in whose time all the said <hi>Hope,</hi> by a great inundation of the <hi>Thames,</hi> was wholly destroyed and drowned. And the said <hi>William</hi> then considering, that the chardge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of that Bank, would much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the profit of the said Tenement, wholly relinquisht all that Tenement, and would not meddle any more with the said Bank; and so the said Bank lyes unrepaired. And she alleged more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the said Prioresse only recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of her Tenants of those lands in that Marsh, of the said Fee of <hi>Covele,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rent of <hi>xiiij</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">s</hi>. over and above the service due and accustomed to the said <hi>Iohn de Handlo,</hi> then chief Lord of that Fee: and that she was ready, according to the quantity of that Rent, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the repair of that bank: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required justice to be done to her in the premisses.</p>
               <p>And hereupon came the Abbot of <hi>Stratford,</hi> by his Bayliff, as also <hi>Iohn de Brumpton</hi> and <hi>Thomas le Bret</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per persons; and as Tenants of the lands in the said Marsh, lying within the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the same bank, alleged, that the said Prioresse did unjustly prosecute that Writ, forasmuch as she thereby endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to excuse her self from the repair of the same Bank; and to lay the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof upon the said Abbot and others. They also alleg'd, that the said Prioresse, and all her Predecessors, from the time that the said Lordship of the Fee of <hi>Covele</hi> came to their hands, did use, till that very time, to make and repair the said Bank; and that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they refused so to do, they were ever thereto compelled; and this, they said, they were ready to prove, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they required judgement.</p>
               <p>And the said Prioresse, saying as she did before, added, that forasmuch as she had been thus disquieted and molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by grievous and intolerable distresses, she then did complain and brought her action; and as before she did, so she still required remedy, acccording to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the said King.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the said Justices, having heard her complaint in this businesse, and having respect to the said Kings Precept, were willing to enquire and be informed touching the premisses; and therfore yielded that an Inquision should be taken; which was accordingly done by the said <hi>Iohn de Dakenham</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jurors: who said, upon their Oaths, that there had been time out of mind, and then were certain Lordships in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49029:46"/>
Town of <hi>Westhamme; viz.</hi> the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Handlo,</hi> the Lordship of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,</hi> the Lordship of <hi>Placetz,</hi> and the Lordship of the Prioresse of <hi>Stratford</hi>; and that antiently all the Lords of those Lordships met together, and agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, that each Lord should have a certain part of the Bank of <hi>Thames</hi> belonging to his Lordship. And they said, that to the Lordship of the said Prioresse, there was assigned a certain parcell of that Bank, now called <hi>Priores-Wall</hi>; and that the said Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse was obliged to make and repair the same Bank, at her own proper chardges, in such sort as the other Lords before-specified are theirs. And they said farther, that the defects then in that Bank might be made good for <hi>Cs</hi>.</p>
               <p>And the said Prioresse, having heard the verdict of the said Jurors, alleged, that they had not in any thing made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to what they had in chardge: Whereupon she required, that they might make a further answer. And therefore because the said Justices were not satisfied, that the above-mentioned verdict was sufficient for them to ground any judgement upon, by the tenor of their Commission, they appointed that the said Jurors should appear before them again, and have a new chardge for a better enquiry.</p>
               <p>Whereupon they the said Jurors, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Nicholas le Forestere, Richard le Saltere &amp;c.</hi> also sworn and associated with them, came, and said upon their Oaths, that the said <hi>Iohn de Covele,</hi> long ago, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, held <hi>xliij</hi> Acres and a half, of Land, in the marsh of <hi>West Hamme,</hi> together with the said Bank, now called <hi>Prioreswall,</hi> which was then called <hi>Coueles-wall</hi>; as also with a <hi>Hope</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning: which Land and <hi>Hope</hi> were then wholly chardged with the making and repair of the said Bank. And that afterwards the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> long before the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores terraram</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so seized, demised all the said Land, particularly, to divers Tenants, to be held of him the said <hi>Iohn</hi> and his heirs, by certain services, to be performed to him and his heirs for ever; and that then he reserved to himself, the said Bank and <hi>Hope,</hi> together with the chardges of the same Bank; and that he afterwards dimised the said Bank and <hi>Hope,</hi> to one <hi>Robert de Ku,</hi> to hold for ever, because that the said <hi>Hope</hi> did then afford Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturage for ten Kine yearly in Summer time. And that afterwards the said <hi>Iohn</hi> did totally alienate all those his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, together with all his Fee and Lordship of all his Tenants and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, unto one <hi>Simon de Passelewe</hi>: And that afterwards, by divers alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so made from hand to hand, the same services, with the whole Fee and Lordship aforesaid, came to the hands of the said Prioresse, who did then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the said services, and so likewise the said Fee, and service of all that Land.</p>
               <p>And they farther said, that the before-specified <hi>Robert le Ku,</hi> whilst he held the said Banks and <hi>Hope,</hi> did undergo the chardge of the said Bank, all his time, as aforesaid: And that after his decease, the said Bank and <hi>Hope,</hi> came to the hands of one <hi>William de Rokeslee,</hi> and <hi>Ioane</hi> his wife, daughter and heir of the said <hi>Robert</hi>: in whose time, by reason of an extraordinary floud of the <hi>Thames,</hi> it was much spoiled and almost drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: so that the said <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ioane,</hi> considering the chardge of the Bank to be great, and that they should not for the future receive any more benefit of the said <hi>Hope,</hi> forasmuch as there was little of it left, they wholly relinquished the said Bank, and rendred it into the hands of the same Prioresse, then Lady of that Fee, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And hereupon the said Jurors being asked, whether any part of the <hi>Hope</hi> did then remain, or not, they answered that there did not. And being farther asked who were then the Tenants of the said Lands, which had so belonged former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the said <hi>Iohn de Covele</hi>; and they said, that <hi>Iohn de Brumpton</hi> held <hi>xiij</hi> Acres thereof, <hi>Walter le Rooke</hi> two Acres <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And being asked if the said Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse held any part of the said Marsh in demesne, or not; they answered that she did not; excepting a certain Rent of <hi>xiiij</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">s</hi>. which she received of her said Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in the same Marsh, over and above the service due and accustomed unto Sir <hi>Iohn de Handlo</hi> chief Lord of the Fee.</p>

And moreover, that two Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, called <hi>Wyggebergh mers,</hi> and <hi>Holewyke mersh,</hi> in which six hundred Muttons might be yearly kept, were then through the continual tides dayly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown, that scarce four hundred could be maintained. And that the Water-Mill situate in the Town of <hi>S. Osiths,</hi> and belonging to that Abby, which had been worth <hi>xxl</hi>. was by the Sea-tides so spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it could not be repaired under an hundred pound chardge. And lastly, that the Marsh walls in that Town, in length three miles, which included a Pasture for <hi>Lxx</hi> Kine, and a thousand Muttons and Ewes, were so torn and broken at that time, that for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the same, there must be other banks made anew, and those old ones quitted; so that a great proportion of the said Pasturage being for that respect to be left out, scarce fifty Kine and six hundred sheep could be there maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: In consideration therefore of these losses, he petitioned that the Church

               <p>In 31 <hi>E.</hi> 1. the King being informed, <note n="e" place="margin">Claus. 31 <hi>E.</hi> 1. m. 2.</note> that the Banks and Ditches, which had been made in the Marsh of <hi>Wynchelse,</hi> for the defence of his lands there, and preservation of the adjacent parts, were then so broken, by the overflowing of the Sea, that the said Lands were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be drowned and lost: and that his Tenants of those lands, by reason of a certain antient composition made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and the Tenants of other lands in that Marsh; which was, that the said Kings lands, should be defended in such reparations, by the other Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders there, refused to contribute to the repair of those Banks and Ditches: And being also informed, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the other lands, were not able to undergo those repairs, by reason of the great expence, which would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site thereto: Taking care therefore, of his own indempnity, and the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Marshes, he directed his Precept <note n="f" place="margin">Claus. 31 <hi>E.</hi> 1. m. 2.</note> to <hi>Thomas Alard,</hi> Guardian of his lands of that Marsh, commanding him, that he should, for the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, cause an equal contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made, out of those his lands, according to a just and proportionable Tax, with the said other Land holders; lest for want thereof a greater losse might afterwards happen; for which he the said <hi>Thomas</hi> was to receive allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>But after this, the very next ensuing year, upon an Inquisition <note n="g" place="margin">Claus. 32 E. 1. m. 17.</note> taken by <hi>Rob. de Septem Vannis, Will. de Hastyngs,</hi> and <hi>Robert Paulyn,</hi> whom the King had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to take view of the Banks and Ditches in this County, and to cause them to be repaired (which was returned into the Chancery;) it was found, that the said Marsh of <hi>Winchelse,</hi> could not be defended and preserved by the old wall, situate towards the East: and that if it ought to be defended, it would be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to have a certain new Bank there, of the length of <hi>CCCL.</hi> Perches: and that the said new Bank, could not be made by those, who according to the antient composition before-mentioned, had wont to repair that old bank; forasmuch as they, who were in that sort lyable to the repair of the said old bank, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in regard of the diminution of their lands, to bear the whole chardge thereof themselves: He therefore directed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept <note n="h" place="margin">Claus. 32 E. 1. m. 17.</note> unto the said <hi>Thomas Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> requiring him to take care, that such contribution should be made thereto, out of his own lands, and the lands of others, as is above exprest.

               <p>And they also said, that there were in the River of <hi>Peret</hi> two VVeres, called <hi>Tappyng Weres,</hi> whereby the course of the water was straitned, which ought to be amended and removed by the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi>

And likewise, that the Kings High wayes, betwixt <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bathepole-brigge,</hi> were so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed and spoyled, by the flowing back of the said water, that people could not travel that way: and that the said Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot ought to amend the same.</p>
               <p>And they also said, that by the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those Mills and VValls, the Boats which had wont to have passage that way with Merchandize, from <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> to <hi>Taunton,</hi> were stopped; and that the Fish were also thereby hindred of their course to and from those places.</p>
               <p>And they said moreover, that a certain piece of ground, on one part, in <hi>Monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> was appropriated to the said Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, by the planting of VVillows and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trees by the said Abbot and his Predecessors, their servants and Tenants there.

               <p>To answer all which chardge, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and his Tenants appeared, by their Attorney, upon the <hi>Wednesday</hi> in <hi>Easter</hi> week, in the seventh year of the said King: and as to the bank, called <hi>Southe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake wall,</hi> first presented, said, that it was in <hi>Othery,</hi> and not in <hi>Weston,</hi> which is parcel of his the said Abbot's Mannour of <hi>Sowy.</hi> And farther said, that he held a certain piece of ground, called <hi>Southlakemore,</hi> in <hi>Othery</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, containing about <hi>xl</hi> Acres of land, Meadow and Pasture, &amp; that it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the said Mannour, and lay betwixt the same Bank, and a certain Bank, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Burwall,</hi> which Mannour the said Abbot held as parcel of the foundation of his Church of <hi>Glastonbury</hi>; and that he and all his Predecessors were seized thereof time beyond memory, as in the right of their said Church.</p>
               <p>And he alleged moreover, that there was a certain River, called <hi>Paret,</hi> which is adjacent to the said ground called <hi>Southlake mere,</hi> into which River the Sea water did flow and ebb; and that the said Bank, called <hi>Southlake wall,</hi> was and had been there time out of mind, for safeguard of the same ground, called <hi>Southlake mere,</hi> aswell to defend it from the inundation of the Tides, flowing in by the said River, as of the fresh waters descending by that and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chanels, to the damage thereof: And that there was in that ground a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain high way, called the <hi>Drene,</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it self through the midst thereof: And that the said Abbot and all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors and Tenants of <hi>Othery,</hi> had time out of mind maintained the said Bank, called <hi>Southlake wall,</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that ground and way, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; without that, that there had been any Runes, Sewers, Gutters, Trenches, or Ditches in the said Bank, called <hi>Southlake wall,</hi> or of right ought to be: and without that, that any Runes were obstructed by that bank, or any bank els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>Weston,</hi> called <hi>Southlake wall,</hi> as it was supposed by the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment: and this he was ready to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie by the Country.</p>
               <p>And as to the Presentment of the two <hi>Weres,</hi> called <hi>Tappyng Weres,</hi> in the River of <hi>Paret,</hi> by which the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of that water was hindred; he said, that he held the Mannour of <hi>Sowy,</hi> as parcel of the foundation of his Church of <hi>Glastonbury</hi>; as also a certain Floud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, called <hi>Tappyng Were,</hi> in the said River, which is parcel of that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and so supposed to be to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Country: And said, that the same Floud-gate had been there time out of mind; and that he the said Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and all his Predecessors were seised thereof, as parcel of the said Mannour; and that it then was in bredth, heighth and depth, as much as it had been time out of mind; and that the current of the said water was not any otherwise stopped, than it had been time out of mind; and that he was ready to make proof thereof by the Country.</p>
               <p>And as to the presentment of the said pleck of Osiars so appropriated by him the said Abbot and his Tenants in <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>; he said that it was amended, and totally removed, and that this he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ready to prove.</p>
               <p>And as to the planting of the said Trees, and appropriating of the soyl, he said, that he was not guilty; and that he was ready to prove it. And because the said Tenants could not justifie, that the said nusance was removed, at the time of the said presentment, they were amerced at half a Mark.</p>

               <p>And as to the Presentment that he had suffered Trees in <hi>Monketan</hi> to hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River of <hi>Tone,</hi> and overthwart the same, so that Boats could not passe to and fro; he said, that those Trees grew above <hi>Bathepole mills,</hi> where Boats never used to passe, neither could or ought to do; and that the said Trees were not any nusance; all which he was ready to justifie.</p>
               <p>And as to the Presentment, that <hi>Bathepole mill</hi> was built in the midst of the River of <hi>Tone,</hi> with stone VValls higher by six foot, than they formerly had been: And that there was also a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49029:62"/>
Fulling Mill, built there <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that the Kings High way betwixt <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bathepole brigge</hi> was spoiled by the reflowing of the said wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And that the Boats, which had wont to have their passage with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize from <hi>Briggewater</hi> to <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> were hindred <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the said Abbot answered, that the said <hi>Richard de Atton</hi> was seised of the said Mills and those other Lands, and held them of the Abbot of <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> his Predecessor, as of his Mannour of <hi>Monketon,</hi> and in right of his Church of <hi>Glastonbury</hi>: and that he the said <hi>Richard</hi> and all they whose estate he then had in those Mills, Lands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had held them of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors of him the said Abbot, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain services, time out of mind: And forasmuch as the said Mills were grown old and ruinous, he the said <hi>Richard</hi> did new build them, and made them of the same height, bredth and depth, as they were before he so pulled them down; and that this he was ready to prove. VVhich said Mills, with the Lands and Tenements aforesaid, the said <hi>Richard,</hi> by the Kings license, then and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, gave to one <hi>Walter</hi> Abbot of <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> the preceding Abbot; to hold to him and his Successors for ever: And so said, that the then Abbot held those Mills, in form aforesaid; without that, that they were built higher in any sort, other than is before alleged; and that this he was ready to prove.</p>
               <p>And he said, that before those Mills were so new built by the said <hi>Richard,</hi> the fresh waters, descending into the said Chanel in great flouds, did overflow the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Pastures adjoyning, and also the before-specified Road-way betwixt <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridgwater</hi>: so that the overflowing of those grounds, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the same way, was not at all worse, after the said new building of those Mills, than it had been before; and that this he was likewise ready to prove.</p>
               <p>And the said Abbot farther answered, that he was not obliged to repair the said Kings high wayes, so spoiled, as by the before-mentioned Presentment was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; in regard, that neither he nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his predecessors, nor any one whose estate he had in any of the Lands and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements aforesaid, he used to perform such repairs in those wayes time out of mind: and that this he was ready to prove. And he said moreover, that there was a certain place, below the said Mills, called <hi>Bathepole Crosse,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all the Boats, coming from <hi>Brigge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> towards <hi>Taunton,</hi> by the same water, and not above, nor farther in the said River of <hi>Tone,</hi> ought of antient time to go up or passe, or could so do; but had used to be unloaded there; and this he was ready to prove.</p>
               <p>And he likewise said, that one <hi>Walter</hi> late Abbot of <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, then Tenant of those Mills, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eighteen years before, did of his own good vvill, and not of right, make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chest of boards, for the ease of the then Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (Lord of <hi>Taunton</hi>) and put it into the poole of those Mills, by which Chest, the boats in time of flouds, might be drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the said poole: by which means the boats being drawn by that Chest, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times got up to the said Bishop's Mill, called <hi>Tobrigge Mill</hi>; without that, that the said Boats did use to passe up towards <hi>Taunton,</hi> in the same River of <hi>Tone,</hi> any farther than the place called <hi>Bathepole Crosse,</hi> time out of mind. And without that, that the Fish in the said River were more hindred in their passage towards <hi>Taunton,</hi> than they had wont to be before the new building of the said Mills.</p>
               <p>And as to the Presentment of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground in <hi>Monketon,</hi> appropriated to the before-specified Abbot, by the planting of VVillows and other Trees thereon, by his servants and Tenants; the said Servants and Tenants affirmed, that the said nusance was amended and totally removed, and that this they were ready to prove.</p>
               <p>And the said Abbot likewise answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as to the planting of the Trees, and appropriating the soil in <hi>Monketon</hi> aforesaid, he was not at all guilty; and that he was ready to prove it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his servants and Tenants did not deny, that the said nusance was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, at the time of the said present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they were therefore amerc'd in half a Mark.</p>
               <p>All which things, they the said Abbot, with his servants &amp; Tenants, being ready to prove, they required judgement there

in. Whereupon a Jury being summoned, to appear before the said Justices on <hi>Thursday</hi> in <hi>Easter</hi> week, and there sworn; did say, that the said Bank, called <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake wall,</hi> was in <hi>Othery</hi> (which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the said Abbot's Mannour of <hi>Sowy</hi>) and not in <hi>Weston</hi>; and so was and had been time out of mind, as the same Abbot had before pleaded: And they said, that there never were or ought to be any Sewers, Gutters, Trenches, or Ditches in the said Bank: and that no Runes were stopped by the said Bank, as he the said Abbot and his Tenants had also pleaded. And as to the two <hi>Weres,</hi> called <hi>Tappyng Weres,</hi> in the River of <hi>Peret</hi>; they said, that the said Abbot held the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Sowy,</hi> as parcel of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Monastery; and that he had a Floudgate, called <hi>Tappyng were</hi> in the same River, which vvas parcel of the said Mannour, and had been time out of mind: And that the Watercourse there was not otherwise stopped, than it had been from the said time, as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly pleaded and alleged.</p>
               <p>And as to the Presentment of those Mills, called <hi>Bathepole mills</hi>; they said, that they were old and ruinous, and new built by the before-specified <hi>Richard,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great plague; and of the same height and depth as they had been time out of mind, and not otherwise; so that neither the Lands, Meadows, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures before-mentioned; nor the High way betwixt <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridgewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in <hi>Bathepole,</hi> were drowned or prejudiced by the said new building of them, in any other manner than as they had used to be in great Flouds, and time out of mind, as the said Abbot had also pleaded and alleged.</p>
               <p>And as to the Presentment concerning the passage of Boats and fish, from <hi>Bridgwater</hi> to <hi>Taunton</hi>; they said, that there was a place, called <hi>Bathepole Crosse,</hi> on the lower side of those Mills; and that there all the Boats, coming from <hi>Briggewater</hi> towards <hi>Taunton,</hi> had used to be unloaded time out of mind; and that they neither could, nor ought of right to go farther: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that the said Chest for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Boats, neer to the said Mill, was made by the said <hi>Walter</hi> late Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Glastonb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as to the course of the water, called <hi>Wythrune,</hi> which was stopped; they said, that the before-specified nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance was amended at the time of the presentment made, and long before, as the said Abbot and his Tenants of <hi>UUythies</hi> had also pleaded. And as to the Trees growing athwart the River at <hi>Monketon</hi>; they said, that they did grow above those Mills, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as to the ground in <hi>Monketon</hi> appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the said Abbot, his Servants and Tenants, by planting of VVillows and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trees thereon, they likewise said, that the said nusance was also amended and totally taken away, as the said Abbot had alleged.</p>

                  <p>There is also in this County, a large Fenny plain; which, being covered with water for the most part of the VVinter, and in Summer affordeth nothing but Rushes, Reeds, and Sedge, hath thence the name of <hi>Sedgmoore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Over this level there is a fair Causey of stones and gravel (from <hi>Somerton</hi> to <hi>Bridgwater</hi>) about eight miles in length, antiently made by one of the Abbots of <hi>Glastonbury</hi> (as tradition saith) which still bearing his name, is called <hi>Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock's fosse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not find, from the authority of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Records, or other credible testimony, that there was ever any endeavour used for the improvement of this Moor by drayning, till of late dayes, that King <hi>Iames</hi> (of blessed memory) making ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the soyl, resolved to do it: But, as in most other places, there be a perverse generation of people, who, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are not content to sit still, but will hinder others that would promote such laudable works for the publick good; so was it here; for divers there were that made opposition thereto: But after a Bill exhibited in the Exchequer, those opponents and the rest of the owners of the adjacent Lordships commoning with their Cattel upon this Moor, discerning, that they could make no justifiable claim to the soyl, offer'd to assign unto the King four thousand Acres in lieu of his right thereto, and to lay out the residue (being nine thousand five hundred twenty and two Acres) unto those their Lordships: which being accepted of by the King, there were Allotments then made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of each Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse, after this fair entrance to so good and beneficial a work, nothing was done therein: To give some encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement therfore to posterity, in case this present age shall still decline it, I have here exhibited a perfect Map thereof, with the particular Allotments assigned to each of those bordering Lordships.</p>

               <p>And the said King being informed, that <hi>Margerie,</hi> the VVidow of <hi>Robert de Botheby</hi> of <hi>Rihill,</hi> conspiring cunningly to supplant him in his right, caused the same trench, in the said Kings absence from <hi>England,</hi> to be stopt up; and his Tenants of that Mannour, who were at the making thereof, to be impleaded, by divers VVrits, as trespassers to the said <hi>Margerie</hi>; alleging that they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Banks of a certain Sewer at <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> aforesaid; so that the water thereof, by that breach, did drown her lands, that she could have no profit by them: And that certain VVrits of <hi>Nisi prius</hi> for to take Inquisition upon the premisses, were granted to the said <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>VVilliam</hi>: by which, in case they should be taken, or that there should be such proceedings therein, he the said King might easily receive prejudice and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herison; especially, if thereby his said Tenants should be convicted of those trespasses; for then it would appear that he had no right to make that trench: Therefore the said King, being desirous, by all wayes he could, to prevent such damage and disherison; commanded the before-specified <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> that they should wholly supersede the taking

               <p>By virtue of which Commission, they the said <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> sate at <hi>Rikhale</hi> upon Friday, being the Feast of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation</hi> of <hi>S.

of the lands belonging to the Abby of <hi>S.

               <p>And they also said, that the Road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which leadeth from <hi>Hoveden</hi> to <hi>Yorke,</hi> as also that High way from <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> to <hi>Yorke,</hi> were, by reason of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing of the water, entring by the said Sewer, so often drowned, that no man could passe them.</p>
               <p>And that one <hi>Will. le Mareschall,</hi> by reason of the said overflowing, was drowned in that Road betwivt <hi>Seleby</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> the year before; and so likewise was one <hi>Walter Redhed,</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, in a place called <hi>Welebrig,</hi> overflowed in such sort by the said water.</p>
               <p>And being asked through whose neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it was, that those banks were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and who ought to repair them; they answered, that the Prebendary of the Prebend of <hi>Rikhale,</hi> had, in times past, a certain Mill, which stood in the said Sewer, in a place called <hi>Rikhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drun,</hi> for his own private commodity, and a pool raised to a certain height; upon which pool was a Causey for the passage of Carts and Waines, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pool a Sluse, six foot in bredth, for evacuation of the water descending from the before-specified fields; by which Causey and Sluse, the tides of <hi>Ouse,</hi> coming up the same Sewer, and flowing over the banks thereof, entring the said pool, were hindred, so that they could go no farther, except casually in the time of an exceeding great floud of the said River.</p>
               <p>And they said moreover, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Prebendary (owners of that Mill, time out of mind) had a Mill there for their proper benefit, and kept the Mill-pool to the height above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, untill that one <hi>Bartholmew Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyne,</hi> Prebendary of that Prebend, in the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, deeming, that it would be more for his profit to pull down the said Mill, than maintain it, demolished both the Mill and the pool; so that the tides of <hi>Ouse,</hi> entring the before-specified Sewer, and going over the Banks, passing through the said pool so demolished, did in every great floud of that water, thenceforth till that time, drown the before-specified lands, and the lands of many others.</p>
               <p>And they also said, that there were never any other Banks nor Sluses for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that water, nor was any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to repair any banks there, except they whose lands were so overflowed as aforesaid: but they said, that it would be more profitable and beneficial for the Inhabitants of those places, to have banks raised to a fitting height, and Slu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of a certain bredth, for to keep back the tides of the said River, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereof; that is to say upon the banks of <hi>Ouse,</hi> at the mouth of the said Sewer, where the said Bishop of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resme</hi> is Lord of part of the soil, and the said Prebendary Lord of the other part. And they said moreover, that they believed, that the said water of <hi>Ouse,</hi> did enter by that Sewer, and passe over those banks, by reason they were too low, to the damage of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of those parts, through the default and neglect of the men of those Towns, which had their grounds so overflowed &amp; not of any other: And that all they who had lands overflowed by the flouds of that water, ought to repair those banks, as also to raise them higher.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing now come into <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,</hi> I shall first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Isle of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,</hi> which, for many ages, hath been a Fenny tract, and for the most part covered with waters: but more antiently not so: for originally it was a woody Country, and not at all annoyed with those inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Rivers that passed through it, as is most evident by the great numbers of Oak, Firr, and other Trees, which have been of late frequently found in the Moor, upon making of sundry Ditches and Chanels for the drayning thereof; the Oak Trees lying somewhat above three foot in depth, and neer their roots, which do still stand as they growed, <hi>viz.</hi> in firm earth below the Moor; and the bodies, for the most part North VVest from the roots, not cut down with Axes, but burnt asunder somewhat neer the ground, as the ends of them, being coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, do manifest. Of which sort there are multitudes, and of an extraordinary bignesse; <hi>viz.</hi> five yards in compasse, and sixteen yards long; and some smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of a greater length, with good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Akorns neer them: and of small Nuts so many, that there have been found no lesse than two pecks together in some places.</p>
               <p>But the Firr Trees do lye a foot, or eighteen inches deeper; of which kind there are more than of any other; many of them being above <hi>xxx</hi> yards in length: Nay, in the year 1653. there was a Firr pole taken up, by one <hi>Robert Browne</hi> of <hi>Haxey,</hi> of <hi>xxxvi</hi> yards long (besides the top) lying neer the root, which stood likewise as it grew, having been burnt, and not hewed down: which tree bore at the bottome ten inches square, and at the top eight.</p>
               <p>About <hi>xx</hi> years since also, in the Moors at <hi>Thurne</hi> (neer five foot in depth) was sound a Ladder of Firr, of a large substance, with about <hi>xl</hi> staves, which were thirty three inches asunder; but so rotten, that it could not be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up whole. And in <hi>Haxey</hi> Carr, at the like depth, a Hedge, with stakes and bindings.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that there are so great a number of Trees, thus overgrown with the Moor, through a long time of stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the fresh waters, in these parts; that, the Inhabitants have for the space of divers years last past, taken up, at least two thousand Cart Loads in a y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to the time when this woody Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel (which extends it self into <hi>Dikes mersh,</hi> and <hi>Hatfield</hi> Chase in <hi>Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>) became first thus overflowed, I can say nothing, there being not any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial thereof transmitted to us, from the light of History or Records: but that it hath been so, for divers hundreds of years, the depth of the Moor doth sufficiently manifest; which could not, in a few Ages, grow to that thicknesse it is of. Howbeit, as to the occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I may rationally conclude it to have been, through the muddinesse of the constant tides, which flowing up <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> into <hi>Trent,</hi> did in time leave so much silt to obstruct the currents of <hi>Idle, Done,</hi> and other Rivers; that, having not their free passages as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they flowed back and overwhelmed that flat Country with water; insomuch as the high ground became an Island, as it is still (we see) called; and a place so defencible, in respect of the spacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>That he the said <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thereof; should have to him and his heirs, for ever, one full third part of the said surrounded grounds, to hold of the said King, his heirs and successors, as of his Mannour of <hi>East Geenwiche,</hi> in free and common so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That the work being finished, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> should be, for the better preservation thereof, a Corporation made, to make Acts and Ordinances to that end, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion should require; consisting of such persons as he the said <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his heirs did nominate.</p>
               <p>That within three years after they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> should be finished, six Commissioners to be appointed; <hi>viz.</hi> three by the Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> for the time being; and three by the same <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> his heirs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to view them, and estimate what the future yearly chardge might amount unto, for the perpetual maintaining of them: whereupon the said <hi>Cornelius</hi> to convey and assure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of lands to such a value, as might be thought sufficient to support that chardge.</p>
               <p>And that whereas divers did claim common of Pasture in sundry of the said grounds, it was agreed that the King should issue out his Commission under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to certain persons, to treat and conclude with those Commoners, by way of composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in land or mony, concerning the same.</p>
               <p>VVhereupon Commissions were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly directed <note n="b" place="margin">The state of the case prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> an. 1656.</note> to several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of those Counties, to treat and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with all such as pretended right of Common within any of the Mannours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49029:84"/>
which took effect with each of them, except those of the Mannour of <hi>Epworth,</hi> in this Isle: But Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> being the then Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General, exhibiting an information in the Exchequer Chamber against them, three hundred and seventy (who were all that at that time could be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have right of common there) came and submitted to such an Award, as Sir <hi>Iohn Bankes</hi> (the then Attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) should make therein: Who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on several hearings of all parties and their Councell, made this Award; <hi>viz.</hi> that of thirteen thousand and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres, belonging to that Mannour (which was then to be drayned, with the rest of the levell) six thousand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres should be allotted to the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as their part or portion, lying next to the Towns; and so preserved for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, at the chardge of the said <hi>Cornelius Vermuyden</hi>; and the remaining seven thousand and four hundred Acres to be set out in the remotest parts of those wastes to Sir <hi>C.

               <p>The agreement being therefore thus made, this great work was accordingly begun, and had so successful a progresse; that, with the chardge of fifty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand eight hundred twenty five pounds, or thereabouts, it became fully finished, within the space of five years; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which usually overflowed the whole levell being conveyed into the River of <hi>Trent,</hi> through <hi>Snow</hi> Sewer, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi> River, by a Sluse; which issued out the drayned water at every ebb, and kept back the tides upon all comings in thereof.</p>
               <p>And now that the world may see what an advantage accrued to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick by this noble, though chardgable work, I shall here, from the before-spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Depositions, observe; First, that since the drayning of <hi>Haxey Carr,</hi> a great part thereof hath been sowed with Rape and other Corn, for three years together, and born plentiful crops.</p>

               <p>Howbeit after this, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>February</hi> 1650. upon a full hearing in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, a Decree was made for esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the possession with the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants; which being published on the place, in presence of divers of the said Inhabitants; they having gotten the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the said <hi>Lilburne, Wildeman,</hi> and <hi>Noddel</hi>; declared, that they would not give any obedience thereto, nor to any order of the Exchequer or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and said, that they could make as good a Parliament themselves: Some expressing that it was a Parliament of Clouts; and that if they sent any forces, they would raise men to resist them; and thereupon proceeded to the defacing of the Church at <hi>Santoft</hi>; and within ten days time, did totally demolish the Town it self, with other Houses therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, to the number of fourscore and two habitations, besides Barns, stables and Out-houses; as also a Windmill; and destroyed all the Corn and Rape then growing on the said 3400 Acres: the damage of all which amounted to fourscore thousand pounds, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the Testimonies of sundry wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>All which waste and spoil being done; the said <hi>Lilburne, Wildman, Monckton,</hi> and <hi>Noddel,</hi> confederating together, made an agreement with several of the Inhabitants of <hi>Epworth,</hi> that in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of 2000 Acres of the said land, so

VVhich being done, the said <hi>Lilburne</hi> and <hi>Noddel,</hi> with some others came to <hi>Santoft</hi> Church, on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and forced the <hi>French</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thence, telling them that they should not come thither, except they were stronger than they.</p>
               <p>And after this, the said <hi>Lilburne</hi> and <hi>Noddel</hi> went to another Lordship, called <hi>Crowle,</hi> where they agreed with some of the Inhabitants thereof, to get their Commons again, as <hi>Epworth</hi> had done; advising them to impound the Tenants Cattell; and that if any Replevin were brought, they should impound them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and break down their Fences, and eat up their crops; and so tire them till they had attorned Tenants to them; all which they did accordingly. The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants therefore being thus terrified, and seeing their condition no better than their Neighbours, took Leases from <hi>Ias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Margrave</hi> and <hi>George Stovin</hi> (two of <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Confederates) who gave bonds of save them harmlesse: by which practice and the former force, the Petitioners became outed of their possessions in both these Mannours.

               <p>And <hi>Noddel</hi> said at another time, that now they had drawn their case, they would print it, and nail it at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dore; and if they would not do them justice, they would come up; and, making an out-cry, pull them out by the ears. And having thus possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the proportions above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they dimised several parts thereof to sundry persons; <hi>Lilburne</hi> himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the House, which had been built for the Minister, and almost pulled down by the Rioters, put his servants to reside and keep possession in it, and imployed the Church for a stable and Barn.</p>
               <p>A Narrative of all which barbarous outrages and high insolencies of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-specified <hi>Lilburne, Wildman,</hi> and <hi>Noddel,</hi> with their confederates, were drawn up in writing by a Committee of the said Parliament to be represented to the House: but that Parliament being dissolved by the power of the Army, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1653. which was before this Report could be made by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitee; the Council of State (which was set up about ten days following) did send for it; and made reference thereof to a select Committee of the same Council; who also farther examining the business, and finding what had been so deposed and reported, to be true, signified as much to the said Council of State; whereupon they did order, that the forces of the Army, quartering in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell of <hi>Hatfield Chase,</hi> or within the Counties of <hi>Yorke, Lincolne,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> or any of them; or any other that then were, or might be in those parts, should be aiding and assisting to the Officers of Justice, and the said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipants, for setling and establishing the possession of the 7400 Acres of those late improved lands, within the Mannour of <hi>Epworth,</hi> in the said Report mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with the said participants; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for executing the Decrees and Orders of the said Court of Exchequer, or any Courts of Justice touching their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therein; and likewise for preventing such Riots and outrages for the future. And in respect of the great damage suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the said participants and their Tenants; they farther ordered, that the Commissioners of the great Seal, for the time being, should award a special Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> to the Judges of Assize for the said respective Counties, to try the Ryotors and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them according to Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and to enquire of the damages suffered, as aforesaid, by the said parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipants

and their Tenants; to the end, that they might have just reparations for the same. VVhich order beareth date at <hi>White Hall</hi> the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1653.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding this, &amp; the former Orders and Letters of the Parliament &amp; Council, the said Inhabitants still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their riotous &amp; rebellious posture, not giving any obedience thereto, nor to the Decrees and Orders of the Court of Exchequer, nor Precepts of the Court of Sewers; standing in defiance and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to all Authority.</p>
               <p>Upon another Petition, therefore, presented by the said participants and their Tenants, together with a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the Commissioners of Sewers unto the Lord Protector and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; an Order of reference was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>xvth</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1656. to the Lord <hi>Fienes</hi> then one of the Commissioners of the great Seal, the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Desborough,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> and the Lord <hi>Strickland</hi> (for so they were then called) or any three of them, to consider of the said Petition, and report their opinion therein to the Council.</p>
               <p>The said Lords therefore requested Major General <hi>Whalley</hi> to call both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before him, and to examine the whole matter set forth in the before-specified Petition, and make report thereof unto the said Committee; which he did accordingly; manifesting, from sufficient Testimony, the guilt of those Ryotors, in all the outrages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed.</p>
               <p>VVhereupon the Council of State, by their Letters dated at <hi>Whitehall</hi> 21<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Augusti</hi> 1656. and directed to the said Major General <hi>Whalley,</hi> recommended the redresse thereof to his care; and to that end desired him to improve his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour upon all occasions, to prevent any farther Ryots and misdemeanors in those places; and in order thereto, to punish such their scandalous disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, according to his instructions; and not to suffer the said Inhabitants to keep by them any Arms or other Instruments for their future acting of the like; and moreover to appoint some of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be effectually aiding and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting to the Shireeves of the respective Counties within his association, or the Deputies and Collectors of the Court of Sewers, for the putting in execution from time to time, the Decrees, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and Orders, of any the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or of the Commissioners of Sewers; to the end that the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers just Rights might be restored accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, and the said Strangers have the peaceable exercise of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the place designed for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings to that purpose.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, that every person who had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> lands adjoyning to those drayned grounds, which should happen to be bettered by this drayning, should pay unto the said Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> his heirs or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, for every Acre so improved, so much as by six of the Commissioners of Sewers, for the time being, should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged fit.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, that in case the said River <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of <hi>Ankolme,</hi> should, in order to this drayning, be diverted by any new cut, such Lords of Mannours, and others, as have had liberty of fishing in the old Chanel, should in lieu thereof, have the like benefit and liberty in the new.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, that where any mans ground <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> should happen to be cast from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to the other side of the River; the same person, his heirs and assigns to have free ingresse and egresse to and from the same, through the Lordship of him to which it should be so cast.</p>

                  <p>THat this vast levell was, at first, a firm dry land, and not annoyed with any extraordinary inundation from the Sea, or stagnation of the fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I shall now endeavour to manifest; which may, perhaps, seem strange to many: but when it is well considered, that Timber-trees will not grow and thrive where water, for the most part, stands; or in Moor, which by tract of time is bred and increased in such moist places, both the one and the other may with much probability be granted. The casebeing then thus stated, it nowremains for me to prove, that such have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been bred, and prospered in sundry parts of this now Fenny Country: which is no hard matter to do, divers persons, yet living being able to testifie, that in the late digging of those Chanels an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Drayns, as have been made for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siccation thereof, great numbers of such Trees, of several kinds, have been found; most of Oak and Firr, and few of them severed from their Roots: but of such as be so severed, the Roots are observed to stand in the firm earth below the Moor; of which sort I my self have seen some, that were taken up in the Fens neer <hi>Thorney</hi>; and have had credible information of multitudes found in other places; whereof some were digg'd up, at the cutting of that large Chanel, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Downham Ea,</hi> which extendeth it self from <hi>Salters lode,</hi> about four miles Northwards, towards <hi>Linne.</hi>

Add hereunto what I have already observed in the Isle of <hi>Axholme,</hi> touching the Trees of Oak and Firr found in such great numbers, at the making of those Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Sewers for drayning of that Fenn: which, though it lye not contiguous to this, out of all doubt is on the like levell, and was apparently a woody Country at the first. To give farther instance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to demonstrate so evident a truth, there will be no need; so that I shall hence proceed, and in the next place ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest upon what occasion this great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration grew.</p>

               <p>But when and by what means that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent breach and inundation of the Sea was first made into this Country, I am not able positively to affirm: therefore I must take leave to deliver my conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture therein, from the most rational probabilities: VVhich is, that it was by some great Earthquake, for, that such dreadful accidents have occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the like, we have unquestionable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</p>

               <p>BUT though the Sea, by some such strange accident, made that irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into those parts; yet did not the tides, for any long continuance of time, flow wholly over it (as I presume:) for most evident it is; that as all flouds, do from the muddiness of their streams, leave on the Verges of their quickest currents, a sandy settlement; so by these dayly fluxes, did a vast proportion of silt fix and settle somewhat within the mouth of this Bay; which silt, in tract of time, increased to such a height, as that it exceeded the ordinary flowings of that watry Element; and thereby checking the usuall tides, got ground so fast upon the Ocean (as it is the nature of most places to do, where the Sea hath any stop) that those active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious people, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who made all use of art and skill to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their profit, finding the soyl, thus raised above the usuall tides, to be much more rich and fertile than any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ground, bestowed the pains and cost to raise strong banks of earth, on that side towards the Ocean, to defend it from the overflowing of the Spring-tides, which commonly happen about <hi>xx</hi> or <hi>xxx</hi> times in the revolution of one year; and some much higher than other, through the power of the North east winds; by which means the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Marshland</hi> were thus won and gained.

               <head>CAP. XXXVII. How those their out-falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obstructed.</head>
               <p>HAving thus described the rise, course, and out-falls of these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral streams, I now come to the cause and occasion of their inundation and drowning of this great level; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, instead of the benefit which it might receive from their overflowings, in case they had enjoyed their free and naturall passages and out-falls, it hath been made, for the most part, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ages, a most unhealthy stagnation of waters, yielding no considerable profit to the Inhabitants, or those that border upon it. That the obstruction, which the before specified Rivers hath had in passing out freely, to the Sea, hath been the only cause of those inundations and drownings already spoken of, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enough: I shall therefore, in the next place make manifest what it is that hath thus stopped and choakt up these their out-falls.</p>
               <p>Whosoever hath observed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant tides, which flow up the River of <hi>Ouse,</hi> at <hi>Lynne,</hi> will find the water alwayes very thick and muddy there; because the Sea bearing a large bredth Northwards from thence, worketh with so much distemper: It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, that a great proportion of silt doth dayly settle in the mouth of that ostiarie, and likewise in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Wisbeche, Spalding</hi> and <hi>Boston,</hi> so that in time it could not but grow to that thicknesse; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some artificial helpes to quicken the current, upon its evacuation at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ebbe, whereby it might be carried out again; that it must needs force back the fresh waters, and cause them not only to overflow, but at length to drown the whole levell, through which their streames did passe. And this we see apparently was the case here: for to such an height is the silt grown, that in the year 1635. upon the deeping of <note n="s" place="margin">Relation touching the Fens, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Burrel</hi> an. 1642. p. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Wisbeche</hi> River, the VVorkmen at eight foot below the then bottome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, came to another bottome, which was stony; and in it at several distances, found seven Boats, that had lyen there overwhelmed with the silt for many ages.</p>
               <p>So likewise at <hi>Salters lode,</hi> at the digging of a foundation for the Sasse, which was there set up (of late years) by the Adventurers in that great work of the present drayning, the silt was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be ten foot deep; and next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that, three foot thicknesse of firm Moor; then blewish gault, which the workmen judged to have been silt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; because being dry, it not only crumbled like it, but had the Roots of Reeds in it: then below it, moor of three foot thicknesse, much firmer and clearer than the other; and lastly whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Clay, which is supposed to have been the very natural and bottome soyl at the first, before those changes hapned, either from the alteration of the course of the Sea, or choaking up these out-falls, as I have already shewed.</p>
               <p>Add hereunto what likewise hath, of late years been observed at <hi>Witlesey,</hi> in the casting of those Moats by Mr. <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> for the fencing in of his new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of fruit Trees; <hi>viz.</hi> that digging through the Moor at eight foot deep, they came to a perfect soil, and swaths of grasse lying thereon as they were first mowed: which clearly manifests, that some great Land-floud, many ages since, meeting with an obstruction at the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ostiaries towards the Sea, by reason of much silt, which after a long drouth had choakt them up, did then spread it self over the face of the whole Levell; and that the waters, till this general drayning, ever since covering the same, have produced a moor now grown to this thicknesse.</p>
               <p>And moreover, that at the setting down of <hi>Skyrbeck</hi> Sluse, neer <hi>Boston,</hi> there was found at <hi>xvi</hi> foot deep, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with silt, a Smiths forge, and all the tooles thereunto belonging, with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoos and other things made of Iron, as some that saw it have affirmed to me.</p>

Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Rusticus,</hi> telling us, <hi>Praecipui inventores &amp; cultores Monacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, fuerunt filii Prophetarum in veteri te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>As to the erection of this, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a brief touch, with the occasion; in regard it was in so great veneration whilst it stood, by reason of the sanctity of <hi>S.

VVhereupon she pouring out her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God with much fervency, there immediately gushed out a clear Spring, which not only satisfied their thirst at that time, but ever since hath been of such virtue, that infirm people drinking of it, have thereby received health.

               <p>After this, Saint <hi>Audrey</hi> (for so mine Author now calls her) taking with her the two maids before-mentioned, went thence; and passing the River <hi>Humbre,</hi> landed at <hi>Wintringham</hi> in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>: about ten furlongs from which Town, they came to a little village, call'd <hi>Alfham,</hi> almost compas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But at length <hi>S.

And moreover, if by some infirmity she was not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, from the, time of <hi>Mattens</hi> untill break of the day, she alwayes continued at her Prayers in the Church.

               </p>
               <p>To this holy woman, in the place of Abbesse succeeded that devout Virgin <hi>Sexburge,</hi> her sister; who sixteen years after, took up her body; which, with the linnen, wherein it was wrapt, being found incorrupt, and cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Howbeit to these Priests there succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded those, who lived not only irregular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but irreligiously: Nay the superior himself, out of a wicked curiosity, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be satisfied, whether the body of that Holy Virgin <hi>S.

               <p>Neither did they yet cease, but sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the stick at the one end, thrust it into the said Vestments, and drew them to the hole: and being imboldned because they had no hurt, one of them took a knife, and cut off a piece; others laying hold on the remainder, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured withall their streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And of his associates therein, two of them hapned to be slain; the third, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was made Priest, lost his senses at every Wane of the Moon; and the fourth, being stricken with a Palsie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinned so, untill his parents, with great sorrow, brought him to the Tomb of <hi>S.

               <p>Whereof the King hearing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much inraged thereat, he resolved to get the Isle by assault; and to that end caused a rendezvous of his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Alrehede</hi> (neer which place there is a military rampire yet to be seen) where the Fen was four furlongs in bredth: and having brought store of wood, stone, and fagots of all kinds, with a multitude of Trees and great pieces of timber, fastned them together under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath with Cow-hides; and to the end that they might the better passe over them, they stript off the skins of beasts, and filled them with wind like bladders: which being done, there were so many that pressed on to get over, being greedy of the gold &amp; silver whereof they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed store to be in the Isle, that they that went formost were drowned, with their Bridge; and those in the midst became swallowed up in the depth of the Fenn: but of those that were hindmost, a few, throwing away their weapons, made a shift by the mud to escape: Nevertheless multitudes perished in this adventure, whose bodies were long after found, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified in their Harnesse, and dragg'd out from the bottome of the water; but one onely man (whose name was <hi>Beda</hi>) get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Isle.</p>
               <p>The King therefore beholding this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable disaster, and much grieving thereat, departed thence with those few which he had left, without any hope to conquer it; placing guards of soldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, to prevent those within from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the Country. In the mean time the said <hi>Beda</hi> being taken, and brought before the chief persons that were in the Isle; and asked why he so boldly adventured himself; told them, that the King did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that whosoever should first enter, and do some notable exploit there, to the danger of those that defended it, let him ask what he would of any mans therein, and he should obtain it: which, when they heard, they commended his valour, and kept him there with them for certain days, using him with great respect. Having therefore had this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their civilities, and observed how secure the place was, by reason of the fortifications there made; as also the number and valour of the souldiers therein; he professed, that as he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard them reputed to be persons more expert in warr than others, he now found it to be true; and faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them, upon liberty to go back to the King's camp, that he would there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late as much: which he accordingly did, all being joyful to see him safe returned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which speech of his being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there stept out one of those Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that the King had imployed to keep the Fort made at <hi>Reche,</hi> in order to the siege of this Isle: who being but newly returned from thence, having heard this relation of the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Beda,</hi> said; <hi>Do you think this to be a vain report, and not to be believed? I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, that yesterday I my self saw a party of the Enemy make a sally out of the Isle, whereof but seven of them were armed; and all Monks except two, who behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in every point like Souldiers, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Town of Burwell, doing much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief otherwise: which when our men saw, ten of them issued out of the Fort, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to take them in their return, because they were fewer in number; but in the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish they slew all our men, except one, a stout Souldier, whose name was</hi> Richard, <hi>and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to</hi> Osbert <hi>the Shireeve, with whom one</hi> Wenothus <hi>had a single encounter; wherein neither prevailing, though they fought a good while, some of our men went to part them; whereof the famous</hi> Hereward <hi>taking notice (for he was within view) he would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any one to meddle; saying, that it was not just, that two or three should set upon one man, and that he would not suffer ser any of his to do so base a thing: But our men followed them to their ships, and killed one of their Mariners with a dart; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another prisoner, he told us who they all were, and their names</hi>; viz. Hereward <hi>the General,</hi> Wenothus, Thurstane <hi>(a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, afterwards sirnamed Provost) Boter of S. Edmunds Bury,</hi> Siward, Leuric; <hi>and</hi> Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r <hi>for his stoutness sirnamed</hi> Hardy. <hi>These notwithstanding they were Monks, being skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men in Arms, often gave testimony of their valour in presence of the said</hi> Hereward.</p>
               <p>All which the King hearing; as he would not speak an evil word of them, deeming it a most unworthy thing to give bad language of such valiant men, so did he forbear to commend their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage above his own souldiers; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered to make peace with them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Isle was so strongly fortified, and that he knew not how to prevent their coming out thereof, or return. VVhereupon, calling together his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Counsellors, he told them his thoughts; alleging, that now he was to march against the Army of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and soon after of necessity to go into <hi>Normandy,</hi> it would not be safe to leave such an enemy behind him in the midst of the Land, at his back. But some of his Nobles, then present, and which were most of his privy Council, diswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from so doing; urging, that if he dealt thus favourably with those that had imbroiled his Kingdome for so long a time, others would not be afraid to do the like.</p>
               <p>To whom the King, in anger, replyed, that he was not able to conquer them, considering the place naturally so defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. VVhereupon one <hi>Ivotael le Bois,</hi> moved with some indignation, told him,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49029:110"/>
that he had long known a certain old Witch, who if she were there, would by her Art soon destroy their whole strength, and places of defence; and drive them out as Cowards out of the Island: which was no sooner said, but that all who stood by, became earnest suters to the King, that he would make no delay to encourage, and well reward whomsoever, that could by any Art or skill vanquish his Enemies. The King therefore yielding to these their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, caused this old woman to be privately sent for, that it might not be talkt of; and brought his Army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, placing it on all parts of the Isle, making Fortifications on every side thereof, and appointing strict guards to prevent the issuing forth of any that were within, lest they should know what was in hand, and use any means to hinder the same.</p>
               <p>All which being done, and understood by those that were within, it put them to no little disturbance of mind, and likewise fear; they not knowing what to do, because the King had learnt some new way of warring against them: they therefore consulting what was best to be done, concluded to send out some fit person to make a discovery, what it was that their Enemies were in hand with: but finding no man fit for such a task, the Valiant <hi>Hereward</hi> resolved to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it himself; either as a Scout, or Travailer; or to alter his habit, though all were against it: and at length did set forwards, taking with him only his Mare called <hi>Swallow,</hi> which was always very lean and ill shapen; but of pace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding swift, and nimble for action.</p>
               <p>And when he went out, he changed his clothes, cut his hair and beard; and being so clad, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And about the dead time of the night, discerning the Woman of the House, and that old Sorceress to go out of doores, he secretly followed them, and saw, that they went to a certain Spring, which was by the side of a Garden, and ran towards the East; and hearing them discourse, he understood that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to murther him: but to prevent their purpose, he got away very early in the morning, with his Pots; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring about the King's Court on every side, he cryed (as Potters use to do) <hi>Pots, Pots, good Pots and Pitchers; all good earthen ware.</hi> Whereupon, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the King's Kitchen, that they might buy some of his Pots, there came in one of the Constables of the Town, and looking upon him said, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw any man in favour of face and stature so like <hi>Hereward,</hi> as a poor man might be like to a rich, and a Country man to Souldier: insomuch as divers came about him, desiring to see a man like so much famed a person; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon brought him into the King's Hall, amongst the Knights and Souldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, that they might behold him: But some when they saw him, said that a man of no greater limbs could not be of that valour and courage as <hi>Hereward</hi> was said to be. Others asked him if he knew, or had ever seen that wicked fellow, scil. <hi>Hereward.</hi> To whom he answered; <hi>I wish that he were now here amongst us, he being the greatest Enemy that I have: for he took a Cow and four sheep from me, which were all the goods in the world that I had, except my Pots, and this Mare; and the only livelyhood for my self and my two Sonns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time the King's Dinner being making ready, <hi>Hereward</hi> retired into the Kitchin; and after Dinner the Servants, Cooks, and Grooms of the Kitchin gave him Wine and Beer, that they might make him drunk and laugh at him, scoffing at him diversly; having a purpose to shave his Crown, and pull off the hair of his beard; and then to hoodwink him, to the intent that he might break his own Pots, which they had set about him. But refusing to be thus abused, one of them struck him, whom he requited presently with a blow that knockt him down; insomuch as the rest took up Tongs, and other things to beat him; which he discerning,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49029:111"/>
forthwith snatcht up a fire shovel, and laying about him stoutly, kill'd one, and wounded divers of them. Whereupon it being made known in the House, they apprehended him and put him in ward: and soon after, the King being gone out to hunt, one of his Keepers came and brought a naked Sword in one hand, and a pair of Fetters in the other, which he threatned to put upon him: but <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reward,</hi> being too nimble for him, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the Sword out of his hold, and slew him; and so, over hedges and ditches hasted to the King's outer Court, where he found his Mare; and though some pursued him, got safe away to <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> wood; where he hid himself till the Moon shone after midnight, and then came into the Isle.</p>
               <p>But whilst he was thus in the wood, he chanced to meet with a person, whose Horse was tired, and himself too: and demanding of him who he was; he told him that he was one of the King's Servants, that had pursued a man, who had killed one of the Kitchin Boys, and another that had the custody of him, after he was apprehended for that fact: and desired him, that for the love of God, and generosities sake, he would discover to him, whether he saw such a fellow or not, whom he then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. To whom he replyed; <hi>Because thou requirest me to tell thee, for the love of God, and of generosity, I will. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I am the man: And now, that thou maist be infallibly assured, that I am so, and that thou hast spoken with me; take this thy Sword with thee for a testimony, and leave thy lance with me.</hi> All which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the King; who with those that were the present, admired <hi>Hereward</hi> for an excellent Souldier.</p>
               <p>The King therefore according to his former purpose, having prepared di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers warlike Instruments, brought his whole Army to <hi>AElreheth</hi> (now <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey</hi>) causing great store of wood and stone, with divers sorts of fagots, and such like materials, to be carryed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And summoned all the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in those parts, with their Boats, to meet at <hi>Cotingelade,</hi> that they might transport thither whatsoever was brought; and raise large hills and heaps on this side <hi>Alreheth,</hi> whereupon to fight. Amongst which Fishermen came <hi>Hereward</hi> himself also with a Boat, using all shew of diligence: and the same day before Sun setting, having set fire on what was so brought, and killed and drowned divers, he made his escape away: And to the end he might not be known, he coloured his head and beard red; neglecting no way to disguise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which might further the doing of mischief to his adversaries: whereof the King hearing, commanded, that if ever he could be taken, he should be brought alive to him without any hurt.</p>
               <p>But having warning by these losses, the King caused more strict guards and watches day and night in every place; and within seaven days raised four or five mounts of earth and other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, in which they placed certain war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Engines; intending, on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, with all their force to assault the Isle; and that they might the better succeed therein, set that old Witch before mentioned, upon the highest place, in the very midst of them; that, being so well guarded, she might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise her wicked Art. Who being so got up, made long speeches against the Isle, and all those that were in it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king signes and shews of their being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht; and allways at the end of each spell, she turned up her bare buttocks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Isle. Howbeit, as she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with her third spell, there were those of the Isle that set fire on the Reedes growing in the Fen all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; which, by the help of the wind, spread it self no less than two furlongs; and making a horrible noise of crackling amongst the willows, and such like Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, did so affright the assaylants, that they hasted away as fast as they could; but being troubled with the smoak, could not tell which way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves, insomuch as many were drowned, the defendants having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the wind and smoak, getting out of the Isle, and shouring multitudes of arrows upon them.</p>
               <p>And in this prodigious rout and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the assaylants, down tumbled the old witch, from the place where she was set, and broke her neck: nay the King himself hardly escaped death, there being an Arrow shot into his Target, which he carried away with him to his Tent: which so soon as his Souldiers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49029:111"/>
saw, they feared he had been wounded; but he told them, he was not at all hurt, otherwise than by evill Counsel, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived and abused through the cunning of that wicked Sorceress; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, that all the mischief which had hapned, did befall him deservedly, in putting any trust in her devillish Art.</p>
               <p>At that time it was, that <hi>Raphe,</hi> sirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Waer</hi> (Earl of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>) having privily got together a great strength, inviting divers of the English to his wedding, obliged them to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deceitfully, by an Oath; and wasted the whole Country, from <hi>Norwich</hi> to <hi>Thetford</hi>: whereof the two Earles, and all the rest of the chief persons, who then were in this Isle, having notice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to them; leaving only <hi>Hereward,</hi> with the Monks and his own Souldiers, to defend this place.</p>
               <p>Things standing therefore thus; the King discerning that all his endeavours were fruitless, as to the conquering this Isle by war or power, having lost so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men in his attempt to that purpose; he at length; by the Councel <note n="q" place="margin">Ex hist. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Which Scouts, finding them in a little Island, called <hi>Stuntney,</hi> thought them to be their Enemies; and therefore two of them (<hi>viz.

Whereupon, setting in hand therewith, he began to measure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from <hi>Soham</hi> to <hi>Ely,</hi> and to cut down the Reedes which stood in his way; as also to make Bridges over the Rivers; and so went on in raising of the said Causey, which he perfected in a very short time, to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all men that then saw it; that Causey being still called <hi>Soham Causey.</hi>

               <p>In answer to which proposals, I find his Majesties pleasure signified to the said Commissioners by the Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Theobalds,</hi> in the same moneth of <hi>Iuly</hi>; which was to let them know, that they might proceed to make a Decree, for the farther and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect drayning of the said <hi>Deping</hi> fen; and thereby to adjudge and order, aswel from his Majesty being Lord of the soil, as from the Adventurers and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed therein, such proportion of land, as might sufficiently bear the chardge of the work: And, that because his Majesty intended to see that great work of the <hi>whole Levell</hi> prosecuted according to his first Princely design (it being for the Countries good, and his own ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) in such manner, as might have just regard to the perfecting of the same, with most publick and general advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the whole Fens, he was farther pleased to declare himself the sole Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer, aswell of this particular Fen, called <hi>Deping</hi> fen, as of the whole <hi>great Levell</hi>; and, that he would afterwards, in ordering the same, have a just respect unto such persons of Honour and others, as had any former interest or engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein.</p>

               <p>Whereupon <hi>Gerard de Bamvill, Fulke d'Oiri, Thomas de Multon</hi> the elder, and <hi>Conan</hi> son of <hi>Helyas,</hi> who were much displeased with the said Monks of <hi>Crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for other respects, associating to themselves <hi>Richard de Flet,</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> with many others, came to <hi>Nicholas</hi> then Prior of <hi>Spalding,</hi> and moved him to be their Leader: and to augment the number, all the chief men of <hi>Ellow</hi> Wapentake, some few excepted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring with them, sometimes had their meetings in the Prior of <hi>Spalding</hi>'s Barn, at <hi>UUestone,</hi> and sometimes in the Church at <hi>Holbeche.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Abbot of <hi>Crouland,</hi> according to Custome, kept up his Marshes, as every year he had used to do about <hi>Rogation</hi> week; and to the end that his Hay might have the better growth, caused Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made upon the Bridge at <hi>Spalding,</hi> that the men of <hi>Holand</hi> and others should keep their Cattel from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereinto; they not only refused so to do, but drove in many more than they had formerly done. Whereupon the Abbots servants impounding them, the men of <hi>Holand</hi> grew very angry; and having set a day, <hi>viz.</hi> the Feast of <hi>Nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Achilleius,</hi> they then came into the said Marsh of <hi>Crouland,</hi> all armed, as it had been to battail, to the number of above three thousand. Whereof the Abbot having notice, he forthwith (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a few of his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) met them at the Bank called <hi>Asendic</hi> (which is the boundary of <hi>Crouland</hi> Fen) and earnestly intreated peace with
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49029:124"/>
them; for he feared that they had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to destroy the Abby, and to that end were so come together. But they answered him scornfully, and passing through the midst of the Fen, shared it among themselves, according to the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their Towns. And having so done, pitched Tents and made huts on every side the Abby; wherein they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced guards of armed men to keep each part thereof. And likewise digg'd turf, cut down a great part of the wood and Aldergroves of <hi>Crouland,</hi> and burnt them; depastured their Meadows, and carryed away the Hay, with divers other violences, by the space of <hi>xv</hi> days: the Abbot and Monks with their servants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this while shut up, so that they durst scarce go out of their Church dores.</p>
               <p>In this lamentable condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they resolved to make complaint to the Kings Justices; and to that end dispatch'd a messenger to <hi>Geffrey Fitz Piers,</hi> then dwelling at <hi>Clive</hi> in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonshire</hi>: who hearing of these great outrages, sent six Knights from <hi>Northampton,</hi> to be better informed thereof. Which Knights coming first on the East side of the Abby, there found the Tent of <hi>Sutton</hi> men, who were Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to <hi>Geffrey de Canvill,</hi> and had all sorts of weapons with them; and said, that they were there by their Masters command. So likewise did all the rest answer, the Tent of <hi>Spalding</hi> men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the last.</p>
               <p>But the Abbot himself, being most sensible of these high oppressions, got out privately, and made all the haste he could to <hi>London</hi>; where he represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Hubert Walter</hi> (substitute to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulph de Glanvill,</hi> the Kings Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then beyond Sea with the King) and to his fellow Judges, these great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and abuses; shewing them the Kings Charter, which setteth forth the bounds of those their Fens. VVho thereupon much compassionating the said Abbot and his Monks, sent forthwith in the Kings name, to the said <hi>Geffrey fitz Piers</hi>; and required him, that he should call before him, the Prior of <hi>Spalding,</hi> and all those men of <hi>Holand</hi>; and to do the said Abbot right upon them: whereof these Riotors hearing, they presently burnt their Cabbins, and went to their own homes.</p>
               <p>At the summons therefore of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned <hi>Geffrey fitz Piers,</hi> the said Prior of <hi>Spalding,</hi> and the other Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, met him at <hi>Deping</hi>; to which place the said <hi>Geffrey</hi> brought many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons with him, upon the <hi>Friday</hi> in <hi>Whitson Week</hi>; where the Abbot of <hi>Crouland</hi> chardged them with the breach of the Kings Peace, and all the violence and wrong before-specified. There were likewise seven particular men, who stood up, and on the said Abbots behalf, laid to the chardge of seven of the principal offenders, that each of them had damnified the Abbot to the value of <hi>xx</hi> Marks: Whereupon some of them were sent to Prison to <hi>Northampton,</hi> some to <hi>Rokingham,</hi> and some to other places.</p>
               <p>The particulars touching this sute; for it lasted five years, would be too much trouble to rehearse: but at length the Abbot prevailed, and recovered the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of those Marshes; the businesse being determined in the year <hi>MCXCxiij.</hi> (5 <hi>R.</hi> 1.)</p>
               <p>But though this sute had then an end, the Prior of <hi>Spalding</hi> renewed his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer claim: yet in the end they came to an amicable agreement <note n="n" place="margin">Ex Chro. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49029:124"/>
Wapentake of <hi>Ellowe</hi>; setting forth, that there was two courses of water, in the common River of <hi>Croyland</hi>; the one nearer, and the other more remote. And that the nearer current was the right Chanell, and of sufficient depth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they that did go with Barges and Boats might well passe too and fro: but that the Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> had by planting willows thereon, so obstructed &amp; straitgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the said course of that stream, that Boats and Barges could not passe as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had. But it was afterwards adjudged, both by the said Jurors, and likewise by the Justices Itinerants for this County (who passed that way to view the same) that the current of the said water was much more proper and commodious in the place where then it went, than there where the Jurors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the default to be; provided that it might continue as wide and deep as it then was; and that it might be straight and not bending, as the old one was: and therefore they concluded and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it should continue where it then ran.</p>
               <p>In 11 <hi>E.</hi> 1. there was a Commission <note n="q" place="margin">Pat. 11 E. 1. m. 22. in dorso.</note> issued unto <hi>N. de Stapelton, W. de Brump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>E. de Bekingham</hi> to enquire by the Oath of honest and lawfull men of this County, whether the Abbot of <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or Prior of <hi>Spalding</hi> ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair certain Bridges, Gutters, Banks, and Ditches in those parts, concerning which there was some difference betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Pat. 10 E. 3. p. 2. m. 8. in dorso.</note>In 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3. there was a Petition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the King and his Council in Parliament, setting forth the many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils and losses, which had befallen seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men, by reason of the ill way betwixt <hi>Crouland</hi> and <hi>Spalding</hi>; as also that greater mischief was like to happen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, unlesse by the repairing of those ways, a remedy were speedily used: And that all those dangers and losses might well be avoided, in case there were a new Causey made betwixt the said town of <hi>Crouland,</hi> and a place called the <hi>Brother house,</hi> by the said Abbot, upon his own proper ground; for the making and repair whereof, he the said Abbot and his successors were to take a certain Custome of all persons travelling that way: the said King therefore, much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the safeguard and ease of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and for that respect, desiring to be certified, whether the said Abbot would be willing to undertake the making and repair of such a Causey or not: and if so, then how and in what sort; dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Precept to him, requiring his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereto.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Abbot by his Letters signified to the King; that the distance betwixt the great Bridge within the Town of <hi>Crouland,</hi> and the said place called <hi>Brother-house</hi> (within which space these dangers in passage were) was no lesse than three miles, and in a fenny soil, upon the one side of the River <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; where, by reason of the lownesse of the ground in a Moorish earth, it would be a difficult matter to make a Causey, fit and durable for passengers; because it could not be made otherwise than upon the Brink of that River, where there was so much water in winter time, that it covered the ground an ell and an half in depth, and in a tempestuous wind two ells: at which times the ground on the side of that River, upon the brink whereof the said Causey ought to be made, was often broke by Bargemen and Mariners; and by the force of the wind so torn away, as that the earth was diminished and wasted: so that in case a Causey should be there made, it would in a short time be consumed and wasted away, by the power of those winds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were raised very high and broad, and defended by some means against such dangers: and that for the safeguard and ease of passengers, aswell on that side the said River of <hi>Weland,</hi> within the Precincts of the Town of <hi>Crouland,</hi> as overthwart the same Causey, there ought to be made many high and strong Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which would require no little chardge, to the end that loaded Barges and Boats might passe under them; and that might serve for necessary Sewers; over which Bridges loaded Carts, Horses, and others might also travell. And for the supporting of this great chardge, ever Barge passing that way in a tempestuous time, should pay <hi>xii</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. every loaded Cart <hi>xij</hi>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49029:125"/>
with the boat-men. And in great storms and flouds, double to what is before exprest to be paid for all carriages by water, that way.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as the making and maintenance of the said Causey was like to be so chardgable, in respect of it's length, height, and thicknesse, with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary bridges, as aforesaid; the said Abbot proposed then to the King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would please to grant unto him and his Monastery, for to undergo the same, such a Custome, for the space of seven years, of every passenger, aswell by land as water, travailing within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the Lordship of <hi>Crouland,</hi> as might be suitable to such a work, though such Custome did not exceed the one half of what passengers did at that time pay; and after those seven years should be expired, a certain lesser Custome, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the chardge of such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary maintainance and repair thereof. And that in case the King would so do, that then he would do his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make and maintain the said Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys and bridges.</p>
               <p>VVhich answer of the said Abbot had no reply made thereto for the space of two years after: but then, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again sitting, the Inhabitants of <hi>Kesteven</hi> and <hi>Holand,</hi> exhibited a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition <note n="s" place="margin">Ibid.</note> to the King, whereby they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly besought him, that for the safety and advantage of themselves and other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, he would take the answer of the before-specified Abbot into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do what should be meet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. VVhereupon the said King much regarding the safety and welfare of his people; and therefore desiring, for the better performance of the work, to be more fully certified touching the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, assigned <hi>Robert de Colevill, Adam de Limbergh, Iohn de Ros, Humphrey de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlebury, Will. de Bayeux,</hi> and <hi>Ranulph de Parys,</hi> to enquire by the Oaths of honest and lawful men of this Country, what manner of Customes, and how much the barge-men and boat-men did then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, aswell for men as Cattel; and had to that time usually received; and who ought to make that way and take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof: As also upon whose soil, on both sides, the barges and boats had used to land, and whose the whole pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage was. And moreover what and how much Custome would be requisite for the said Abbot to take for the space of seven years, in consideration of his chardge in making the same Causey and Bridges upon his own proper soyl: and how much after those seven years were expired, to maintain them in repair. As also how many Causeys, and Bridges, and of what length, bredth, height, and thicknesse each of them ought to be, for the more safe and substantial benefit of passengers: And lastly, whether it would be of any damage to the said King or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if he did grant to the said Abbot such Customes as aforesaid, for the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations above specified.</p>
               <p>But what was done therein, I find not.</p>

Gates and Bridges of <hi>Brother house,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Pool of the said Abbots there where <hi>Henry,</hi> at that time Abbot of <hi>Crouland,</hi> had erected a certain house for Oxen, upon the said VVatercourse and Sewer of <hi>Old hee,</hi> where it had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to run, by right, and so fall into the River of <hi>Weland,</hi> for the benefit and Commodity of <hi>Cambridge, Lincolne, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Huntendon shires</hi>; and of all the grounds from <hi>Tydd</hi> S. <hi>Maries,</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> unto <hi>Baston</hi> on the borders of <hi>Kesteven</hi>; as also unto <hi>Surflet</hi> in <hi>Holand</hi>: and that it ought to be <hi>xx</hi> foot in bredth.</p>
               <p>And they said, that the same Sewer called <hi>Shep Ee,</hi> was first obstructed by <hi>Roger</hi> sometime Abbot of <hi>Crouland</hi>; and that the same obstruction was at that time upheld by the before-specified <hi>Henry,</hi> the then Abbot, to the great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of those Towns as lye betwixt the Town of <hi>Tydd</hi> S. <hi>Maries</hi> and <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flet.</hi>

               <p>And they likewise presented, that the said Road-way from <hi>Brotherhouse,</hi> was obstructed by a certain Dunghill, laid there by the said Abbots servants, to the hinderance of all people passing that way.</p>
               <p>And they farther presented, that the before-mentioned <hi>Henry,</hi> then Abbot of <hi>Crouland,</hi> with his Covent, had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to themselves the particular soil of that high way, at the end of <hi>Crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> town; and planted willows and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trees thereon to the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of those that passed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And they likewise presented, that there was a certain Causey made by the town of <hi>Spalding,</hi> for the benefit of that place, directly from <hi>Wode lode</hi> unto <hi>Midfen</hi> of <hi>Deping,</hi> for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the Pasture of <hi>Deping</hi>; and that the said <hi>Henry</hi> Abbot of <hi>Crouland,</hi> had in the night time broken down the same Causey, to the damage of the towns of <hi>Spalding</hi> and <hi>Pyncebek</hi>; as also that the water of <hi>Spalding</hi> could not be preserved, unlesse the same Causey were repaired and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>By reason of which presentment, the Shireeve had command to summon a Jury: who appearing, accordingly, said upon their Oaths, that the Sewer called <hi>Shepee,</hi> was a certain Ditch, and one of the bounds of the precinct of <hi>Crouland</hi> Abby; and so had been time beyond memory: which boundary did extend it self to certain other limits of the said Abby, called <hi>Asewygtoft,</hi> and from thence to other limits of the same Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.

               <p>And they also said, that there was not then any common Sewer at the <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhouse</hi>: but that the Sewer there was only a drayn peculiar to the Precinct of the before-specified Abby, and within the several grounds of the said Abbot and boundaries aforesaid; as also at the pleasure of the Abbot and Commodity of the Abby; <hi>viz.</hi> to make it and stop it again in what place soever the Abbot and Covent should think fittest.

               <p>And they also said, that there was not any common Road-way at the end of <hi>Crouland</hi> town, excepting in the River of <hi>Weland,</hi> with Barges and Boats, for all passengers upon hire.

               <p>And as to the Presentment, that there was a certain Causey made by the men of <hi>Spalding,</hi> for the benefit of that Town, directly from <hi>Wode lade</hi> to <hi>Midfen</hi> of <hi>Deping</hi>; they said, that the same Causey was wholly upon the land of the Abbot of <hi>Crouland,</hi> and not to <hi>Midfen</hi> of <hi>Deping</hi>: And that the said Abbot was Lord of the Mannour and Town of <hi>Crouland,</hi> within the precinct whereof was a certain Fen, called <hi>Goukeslound</hi>; which Fen was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per soil of the said Abbot, and so had been of his Predecessors time out of mind, as parcell of their Mannour and Town of <hi>Crouland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they said moreover, that the floud of fresh waters, descending from the West, into the said Marsh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways used to passe from thence, into the River of <hi>Weland,</hi> and so to the Sea. And that certain men of <hi>Spalding,</hi> and other Towns, had raised the said Causey upon the soil of the said Abbot of <hi>Crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where never any Causey was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; by which means the current of the fresh waters flowing in the said Marsh was stopped, and by that obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Marsh of <hi>Goukeslound,</hi> and other Marshes adjacent thereto, were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed; and the Abby and Town of <hi>Crouland</hi> in danger of drowning. And the said Abbot perceiving the said Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey to be so unjustly made, and to the danger of drowning the before-specified Abby and Town, came and caused it to be thrown down in divers places, as it was very lawfull for him to do: and that he did not cast down any Causey else: therefore both himself and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent were dischardged of the before-mentioned presentment.</p>

               <p>And moreover, that the same Abbot and his successors, should from the Feast of <hi>All Saints</hi> then next ensuing, well and sufficiently repair and maintain the said two banks; whereof one did extend it self from <hi>Dovedale Clote</hi> before-speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unto the before-specified bridge at <hi>Crouland</hi>; and the other from thence to <hi>Brotherhouse,</hi> untill the said Bank from <hi>Brotherhouse</hi> to <hi>Quapelodesyd dyke,</hi> should be sufficiently perfected; so that the usual flouds and overflowings of the waters of <hi>South Ee, Nene,</hi> and <hi>Weland</hi> aforesaid, might not, in the mean time, do any hurt to the said bank called <hi>Lodyke,</hi> or drown the lands in <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Multon</hi> before-specified: provided that such flouds were not much greater than usuall, through excessive tempests and rain.</p>
               <p>And the said Prior of <hi>Spalding,</hi> with his Covent, did then grant and agree, that the before-mentioned Abbot of <hi>Crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his successors, should have power and authority, to dig and take, within the soil of him the said Prior and his successors, in <hi>Spalding</hi> sen, nearest to the said place called <hi>Brotherhouse,</hi> so much earth, sand, and clay, for the making and repair of the said bank, thus begun and to be new raised, as an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Boats could carry upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Weland,</hi> each boat containing six Cart loads.</p>

               <p>Whereupon the Shireeve of this County had command to summon the said Abbot to appear at <hi>Alford,</hi> upon the Friday next after the Feast of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angel, to answer unto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars contained in the said present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who came accordingly, and said; that he himself and some of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, with their Tenants and Fermours in the Towns and places adjacent to those banks, had for their own Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and benefit, often repaired divers parts of them; but not at all for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Country; and thereupon did put himself upon the tryall of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Which, being summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, came, and said upon their Oaths; that the said Abbot and his Predecessors, as also their Servants, Tenants, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their Lands and Tenements, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the places adjoyning to those Banks, had very often for the avoiding of damage to themselves, repaired those Bank, for their own private advantage, (as he the said Abbot had pleaded) and not otherwise.

that all the Frontiers, from <hi>Fulnegote,</hi> unto the Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi>'s Mill, in <hi>Spalding,</hi> were then broken, through the default of the Inhabitants there; and therefore it was ordained, that they should be repaired, as antiently they had wont to be, so that Horses with their Furniture might passe that way, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Peccebrigge</hi> to <hi>Coldealegote,</hi> on the East side of the River; and from the great Bridge unto <hi>Ratun Row,</hi> on the West thereof: And, that every man should defend his Frontier with Piles aad stones, where need required.</p>

               <p>Whereunto the Counsel for the Abbot of <hi>Peterborough</hi> answered; that the Custome of this province of <hi>Holand,</hi> so stated by the Plantiffs, ought thus to be understood and qualified, <hi>viz.</hi> that when by such addition of any silt or sand, there should happen an increase of land, and by the Seas leaving thereof, become firm ground, it ought to belong unto him, to whose firm and solid ground it first joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self, without any respect, whether it grew directly to it, or at one side. And they farther said, that the before-speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Marsh did originally joyn it self to the antient Marsh of the said Abbot of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> whereof that Monastery had been seized time beyond memory, as it appeareth by <hi>Domesday book,</hi> where it is recorded, that the Abbot of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> had <hi>xvi</hi> Salt pans in <hi>Donington.</hi> Moreover, in the Charter of King <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the first, there were confirmed to the said Abbot three Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ucates of land with the Salt pans and Pastures, and all their appurtenances, in <hi>Holand.</hi> So that the said soil increasing by little and little, ought not to belong unto the Abbot of <hi>Swinesheved,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Custome of the Countrey; because that a certain part of <hi>Salten Ee,</hi> which was not then dry land, did lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the old Marsh belonging to the said Abbot of <hi>Swinesheved</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and the Marsh whereof they pretended so to be disseised. Which part of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Ee</hi> could not at all be drayned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the fresh waters had used to run through that place from the parts of <hi>Kesteven</hi> to the Sea, untill <hi>Geffrey</hi> Abbot of <hi>Peterborough</hi> (Predecessor to the then Abbot) did, for the better drayning of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49029:138"/>
the Province of <hi>Holand,</hi> by his deed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented, grant unto the said Country, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sewer, directly running to the Sea, through his own land: by which means, though the antient Sewer, in another place, became lesse than it had wont to be, by reason of the non-usage thereof, from the time that the said new Sewer was granted; neverthelesse it remained at that time sufficiently open, and the Sea did flow and eb by it: and therefore it served sufficiently for a division; because that antiently by the current of the fresh water as aforesaid, and the checking thereof by the Sea, which continued till that day, it could neither be drayned or stopt: And that, beyond that boundary, the said Abbot of <hi>Swynesheved</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> could not by the Custome of the Country, for the reason aforesaid, claim or chalenge any thing.</p>
               <p>But at length, after divers arguments, to and fro, therein used; it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>xij</hi> trusty men, aswell Knights as others, should be made choice of; six on one side, and six on the other, to view the place in question, at <hi>Michaelmasse</hi> then next following, and make a final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination therein. Whereupon the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al at that Assizes was stopped: and at the day appointed, the said Abbot of <hi>Peterborough</hi> came himself, in person, to <hi>Gosbercherche,</hi> together with Sir <hi>Iohn de Wylughby,</hi> and other of his friends and Counsel: And so likewise did the Abbot of <hi>Swynesheved,</hi> but Sir <hi>Nicholas de Ry</hi> sent his Attorney. Where the <hi>xij</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so chosen, did take a view of the ground; but not agreeing, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without making any conclusion therein.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to a legal tryal of the businesse in dispute, the Justices of Assize appointed to sit again at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> upon <hi>Saturday</hi> being the Feast of S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Apostle. At which time the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-specified <hi>Gilbert de Stanford</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Achirche,</hi> together with Sir <hi>Iohn de Wylughby</hi> and others, on the behalf of the said Abbot of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But the adverse party, having in the mean time obtained a new Assize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called upon the first Writs, did not prosecute; so that they were amerc'd; the reason why they durst not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute, being, because they could not have a full Jury, out of the Wapentake of <hi>Kirketon,</hi> of those whom they had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured: For Sir <hi>William Franc,</hi> the then Shireeve of this County, had, at the special instance of Sir <hi>Iohn Wylughby,</hi> and for <hi>xx</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. which he had given him, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>xviij</hi> of the most trusty men, and of the best account, within the three Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentakes of this Province; <hi>viz. Ellow, Skyrbek,</hi> and <hi>Kirketon</hi>; who were es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyned upon the second Writs. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third Writ, the principal persons of the said three VVapentakes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, by <hi>Iohn de Hundon,</hi> then Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeve, for ten Marks, which he had given him: Neverthelesse some of the said Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Counsel, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against those second VVrits, because they were obtained, whilst the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and the land in question put in view; and therefore they desired, that those their exceptions might be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; protesting, that they would more fully urge that exception, upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the said Assizes, they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to do it on that day; because their adversaries had a day by Essoin: and they desired that the panell upon the first VVrit might be reserved, whereby it might appear, whether the lands which were then enjoyed by those VVrits, were put in view by the former VVrit: others moving the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the said panell might be made void, and no prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereupon.</p>
               <p>Besides, the form of those VVrits was excepted against by reason of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege which the said Abbot of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> had by the Charters belonging to that Monastery; because, that the said Tenements put in view, were parcell of their Mannour of <hi>Gosbercherche</hi>; and that chiefly by the words of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter, <hi>Quicquid Vicecomes</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But it then hapned, that through the mediation of Sir <hi>Adam de Welles,</hi> there was another day of reference appointed, to be at <hi>Lincolne</hi> aforesaid, upon <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next after the Feast of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> then next following. At which time the said Abbot of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Officers, together with Sir <hi>Iohn de Wylughby,</hi> and the rest before-mentioned, came: howbeit, after many disputes, they went away without making any accord: so that then there was a third day appointed for the Assize; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Thursday</hi> next after the Feast of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> at <hi>Lincolne</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said:

But in the interim it so falling out, that the Abbot of <hi>Swynesheved,</hi> having for the repairing of all his Mill-pool at <hi>Casterton,</hi> digg'd farther upon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s ground, at <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe,</hi> than he had power to do by that liberty, which had been antiently granted to him by composition; the said Abbot of <hi>Peterborough</hi> brought an Assize of <hi>Novell disseisin</hi> against him, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Roteland.</hi> At the day of which Asizes came the said Abbot of <hi>Swineshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> with five of his Monks, and others of his Counsel; where, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Mr. <hi>Alexander de Ounesby,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Church at <hi>Castreton,</hi> all differences betwixt the parties before-mentioned, were concluded; the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Swinesheved</hi> being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease all their interest in the said Marsh; and the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> to give license to the said Abbot and Covent of <hi>Swynesheved</hi> to repair their pool at <hi>Castreton,</hi> as often as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion should require; and also <hi>xl</hi> Marks in mony, by way of agreement, for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any farther trouble and chardge for the future. And the said Abbot and Covent of <hi>Swynesheved</hi> did thereupon remit all their claim, whereunto they had any pretrence, in the said Marsh, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. All which was perfected by deeds indented betwixt them.</p>
               <p>And on the morrow before the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes (so appointed as abovesaid) came the said <hi>Gilbert</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> on the behalf of the Abbot of <hi>Peterborough</hi>: where, upon treaty betwixt them, and the said Sir <hi>Nich. de Rye,</hi> six persons were chosen to arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the business, <hi>viz.</hi> on the part of the same Sir <hi>Nich.</hi> Sir <hi>Rob. de Colevill,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bytham</hi>; and Sir <hi>Philip le Despenser,</hi> K<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>. and <hi>Iohn Cleymunt</hi>: And on the behalf of the Abbot, Sir <hi>Iohn de Wilughby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn de Kyrketon</hi> Knights, and <hi>Henry Grene</hi>; who awarded, that the said Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot should give to Sir <hi>Nicholas xl</hi>

               <p>And as to the future increase of ground, which might happen to either party; that it should be enjoyed by him to whose land it did lye most contiguous</p>
               <p>Whereupon a day was assigned for writings to be made betwixt them, for ratifying of this award, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Monday</hi> after <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi>: At which time, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Gosbercherche</hi>; where discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the said VVritings did expresse the said Marsh to be the right of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Abby; the said Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> fearing that in case he did seal them, he might be indicted of conspiracy for pleading both falsly and unjustly, the businesse was respited till the next Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, which was in the <hi>xv</hi> of <hi>Easter</hi> in the <hi>xvijth</hi> year of the said King <hi>Edward</hi> the third's reign: to which Parliament the parties abovesaid came; and after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers arguments in the presence of Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas de Cantilupe,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn de Wilughby,</hi> and others, the said Sir <hi>Nicholas de Ry,</hi> did release all his right, as abovesaid: VVhich release beareth date at <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> upon the <hi>xvijth</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the year abovesaid.</p>

Whereupon a Jury was summoned to attend them at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> upon <hi>Fryday,</hi> being the Feast day of the <hi>Decollation</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn Baptist.</hi> Who appearing accordingly, did upon their Oaths present, that the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Town of <hi>Wigenhale,</hi> on one side the great River of the same Town i <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Southwest part, was one and the same; and that all the Land-holders, on that side thereof, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually preserved: and that the safeguard thereof likewise on the other side, to the North-east, was also all one.</p>
               <p>And that the Causey called <hi>Old fen diche,</hi> was made and repaired by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners and Tenants of <hi>S. Mary, S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and <hi>S. Germans</hi> of <hi>Wigenhale</hi>; and not by the Parishioners of <hi>S. Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was likewise found, that aswell

the said Causey of <hi>Old fen diche,</hi> as all other Causeys and Banks of the whole Town of <hi>Wigenhale,</hi> of what kind so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; as the Lands and Tenements of all and singular the Tenants of the said Town, were preserved by the said banks from inundation and drowning by the Salt waters: and that the repair of those Banks tended to the Commodity of the said Tenants of all that Town; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as whilst the said Banks and Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were repaired, the making and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of those Causeys was no chardge at all. And moreover it appeared, that by the view of the said <hi>Thomas</hi> and his associates, and by that Inquisition, that those Banks which were good, at the time of the Agistment made by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-specified <hi>Will. de Carleton,</hi> were then bad; and that many places, which were at that time better than ordinary, were then, by reason of the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, much worse. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the said <hi>Thomas</hi> and his associates thought fit to make a new Agistment for the common safeguard of the said Town of <hi>Wigenhale</hi>; and therefore ordered, that the Land-holders there, should make good their Banks and Ditches on that side of the said River.</p>
               <p>After this, in another Session <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> of the said <hi>Thomas de Ingaldesthorpe,</hi> and <hi>William Bataile,</hi> held at <hi>Tirington,</hi> upon <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next after the Feast of <hi>S.

               <p>But as the expence, in such a constant support of these Banks, Ditches, Bridges, Sluses, and Sewers, within this Province, was great; considering the frequent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults which the Sea, in tempestuous seasons, did make upon the one side thereof; and the fresh waters of so spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Fen, agitated by boysterous winds and storms (especially in the time of extraordinary flouds) on the other: so, for those respects, was the regard not small.

                  </gap>rs belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, from the inundation of the Sea, and flowing of the fresh waters. And they said; that in the dayes of K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first, there was an equal assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, to the Inhaitants and Tenants of these Towns, according to each mans proportion, of the banks, ditches, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys belonging thereto, by <hi>Will. de Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and his associats, then Justices of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: at which time the charges were easy; but then, through the raging of the Sea, and flouds of fresh waters, very heavy and grievous to bear: As also that the said charge was, then, so unequally asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that some persons were burthened more by an hundred fold, considering their proportions of Land, than others; whereby they were so impoverish'd, that they were not then able to contribute any farther to these repairs and that by their decay, much damage had already accrued there; and more was likely to happen, if speedy remedy were not had. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they said, that, of necessity, there ought to be a new Agistment made, of the said banks and ditches, and an assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a fit proportion to each man, for the maintaining whereof they might be continually compell'd.</p>
               <p>And they said moreover; that the ground whereupon the Ditches and Banks stood, betwixt <hi>Edyensgole,</hi> and the East corner of the Tenement of <hi>Iohn de Engal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desthorpe,</hi> in the <hi>Freth,</hi> within the said Towns of <hi>Tilney</hi> and <hi>Ilsington,</hi> was daily torn up by the boysterous Sea tides, and flouds of fresh waters; insomuch as the said banks could not be preserved, in any sort, by that Agistment, to defend the said Town from drowning: therefore they said, that for safeguard of that Town, there must, of necessity be made certain <hi>Kays,</hi> and four or six <hi>Schrops,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Edyensgole,</hi> and the said corner, at the charge of all the Landholders throughout the whole Town.</p>
               <p>And they ordained; that, whereas by reason of the like danger in another place, between <hi>Knight's gole,</hi> and the gutter called <hi>Cattesback dole,</hi> the Sea banks would not be sufficient to defend the Town from drowning; there should be made, forthwith, certain <hi>Kays</hi> and <hi>Schrops,</hi> at the charge of the whole Town: and and that no bank should be thrown down towards the River, betwixt those Goles, in any place but where they then were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by assessment they could be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at less charges. And that the whole bank and chanel of the river, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the said gutters be made; and, if need required, raised two foot higher; so that it should contain <hi>xiii.</hi> foot in bredth at the top, and at the bottom a thickness proportionable thereto.</p>
               <p>And they also said, that the banks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the river side, betwixt <hi>Skalys gole</hi> and <hi>Cattesbak,</hi> were grown so narrow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bottom, by reason of the often sinking down of the Earth, that the Cart way, which is of <hi>xxiiii.</hi> foot in bredth towards the said banks and ditches, for the whole length thereof, was by those banks and ditches totally interrupted and stopt: whereupon they ordained, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time it had been, that <hi>xxiiii.</hi> foot of ground should be added thereto, from the Land next adjoyning.</p>
               <p>And they farther said, it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that all the Sewers and Gutters, great and small, as also the common Bridges in <hi>Tilney</hi> and <hi>Islington,</hi> with the gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Sibley,</hi> and at the Mill, sometime belonging to <hi>William de Fen,</hi> upon the Fen ditch in <hi>Tilney,</hi> should be continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, at the charges of the whole Town,

               <p>And they said, that such a restraint thereof might well and conveniently be done for the safeguard before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in a certain place, called <hi>Larkes hirne,</hi> in <hi>South Lynne,</hi> in this manner; <hi>viz.</hi> that whereas the same River did in that place then contain in it self <hi>xl</hi> perch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in bredth (every perch being reckoned at <hi>xvi</hi> foot) it ought of necessity, to be restrained in that place, on both sides, for the safety of those Towns, <hi>xxxiiij</hi> perch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, every perch being of the length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid; so that the bredth of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the same River should be reduced to six perches.

fresh waters, to the extraordinary da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of all such persons as were Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, or that did enjoy Common of Pasture or Fishing there. And they said, that the before-specified Bank, could not be made firm and sufficient by any repair thereof, the weaknesse of the ground, whereon it stood, considered: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ordained and decreed; that for the better preservation of all the Towns in <hi>Marshland</hi> aforesaid; and of all the Lands within the compasse thereof;<note place="margin">The making of the new <hi>Poke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And that the said Bank so to be made new, should be made and raised upon the North side of the great River, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from <hi>UUelle</hi> to <hi>Salterys lode,</hi> and <hi>UUigenhale; viz.</hi> from the shore of that River by the space of <hi>xxiiij</hi> foot: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to begin in that place called <hi>Salterys lode,</hi> and to extend it self from thence, to the Priory of <hi>Mullycourt,</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; And that the height thereof from <hi>Salterys lode</hi> to <hi>North delfe,</hi> shall be five foot from the levell earth, and the thicknesse at the bottom <hi>xviij</hi> foot; and from <hi>Northdelf</hi> to the said Priory, six foot in height from the ground, with <hi>xviij</hi> foot in bredth at the bottom, and <hi>xij</hi> at the top, of good measure, so that it might sufficiently keep out the water of the Fen.

               <p>And the said Jurors did also decree and ordain, that it might be lawfull for every man, in making his proportion of the said Bank, to dig earth on the North side of the same, in Winter time, when by reason of the flouds of fresh water coming down, it could not be taken on the South side; so that such digging on the said North side were <hi>xl</hi> foot distant from the same, upon penalty of being amerc'd.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 That the Creek, which now run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth under <hi>Terington</hi> bank, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, hath within four or five years last past, run half a mile off; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>xx</hi> years since it did run about a mile off.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We think, that the approach of the said Creek, is the greatest cause of the decay and overthrow of the said Banks: and that at this present, the said Creek runneth where Banks have lately stood, being <hi>xxiiij</hi> foot deep or more, at a low water. And that by the said outrage, there are four other great Creeks, worn in the whole ground, to the Town-ward, where there was Corn reaped the last Harvest; whereof two of the said Creeks are fourscore foot broad a piece, and neer <hi>xxx</hi> foot deep; and are worn to the Town-ward, within ten rod of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyke, by the reflowing and ebbing of the waters, from out of the Town to the Sea-ward; and that these Creeks were so worn within the space of <hi>xlviij</hi> hours.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 We say, that the Township of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> standeth chardged with <hi>xiC.</hi> Rod of Bank, at <hi>xvi</hi> foot to the Rod; which, within 50 years last past, cost making <hi>MMxx</hi> l.

                  <p>The repair of <hi>viiC Liiij</hi> Rode, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the said <hi>xiC</hi> rods, cost seven years since <hi>CCCLxxiij</hi>

                  <p>There were also exposed to the Sea, this last year, without the said Indike, <hi>Cxxxvi.</hi> Acres; for which by the Law of Sewers an allowance of fifty shillings the Acre is and must be paid; amounting to the sum of <hi>CCCxx</hi> l.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 We say, that the Salt Marshes of <hi>Terington</hi> are exceedingly worn away: For the Kings Majesty had one Marsh, in the occupation of <hi>Awdley Lad,</hi> alias <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> or his assigns, called the <hi>Gonge Marsh</hi>; which, by report, hath contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>CCC.</hi> Acres; and within <hi>xxx</hi> years last past, contained <hi>Lx.</hi> Acres, which is now all worn to the Sea. And his Majesty hath lost more within these <hi>xxx</hi> years, <hi>C</hi> Acres of Marsh, being part of other Marshes, which the said Mr. <hi>Lad</hi> holdeth by Lease of his Majesty. Which Marshes are (as we suppose) chiefly wasted or decayed, for want of keeping and maintaining of divers Damms, which are named and set down hereafter in the answer to the <hi>xiith</hi> Article.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 We say, that the waters of <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beche</hi> and <hi>Elme,</hi> have antiently fallen to the four Gotes as they now do, and from thence they have fallen to the Sea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the memory of man, more than a mile off from <hi>Terington</hi> Banks: And it is very probable, that in antient time they have fallen to the Sea much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
                  <p>But, in our opinions, upon our view taken, they might be carryed, at this time, a neerer way to the Sea; <hi>viz.</hi> from the four Gotes aforesaid, over <hi>Tyd</hi> marsh, and <hi>Sutton</hi> marshes, unto a Creek there, called <hi>Kings Creeke</hi>; and there to fall into the deep, called <hi>Lutton Leame,</hi> and so to the Sea; which is a shorter course for the River by <hi>vi</hi> miles, and hath a much better out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 We say, that all the Towns within the Isle, which have been heretofore chardged with the maintenance of <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bech</hi> River: and such other Towns in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> bordering on the said Isle, between <hi>Peterborough</hi> and <hi>Somersham,</hi> who have heretofore contributed to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of <hi>Clows crosse drayne,</hi> or <hi>Wysebech</hi> River, shall, in our opinions be benefitted thereby: And the Towns of <hi>Walpole</hi> and <hi>Terington</hi> proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably: but for the portions of money to be particularly rated upon every several Town, we leave it to farther considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>At which time came <hi>Adam de Fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi> the King's Attorney: but the said <hi>Edmund,</hi> though solemnly called, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not; whereupon a verdict was taken against him by default.</p>
               <p>Nor did the Shireeves of any of the before-mentioned Counties make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their said Precepts: therefore new writs were issued out unto them, to the same purpose as above-said, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable upon the <hi>xvth</hi> of S. <hi>Hillarie</hi> then next following. At which time came the said <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Shireeves of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi>; who alleged, that the Writs were so long in coming to their hands, that they could be nothing therein: howbeit the Shireeve of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Hunten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donshire</hi> returned the names of Jurors; but the Shireeve of <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> sent no answer.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King issued out a Precept to <hi>Geffrey le Scrope</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Justices of the Pleas before himself to be holden, whereby he signified to them, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Marsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> had complained; and the men of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgshire,</hi> who had Lands neer unto those parts, had exhibited a Petition to him the said King and his Council; shewing, that whereas some parts of <hi>Marshland,</hi> together with a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of those Counties, was lost and destroyed by the inundation of the Salt waters; as also of the fresh, by reason that the said waters and Sewers had not their right course: And that King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, passing that way, and taking notice thereof; did, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Council, assign <hi>William How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and some other to make enquiry touching the premisses; who by Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken before them,<note place="margin">☜</note> found that those parts could not be any other way preserved, than by stopping of a certain water called <hi>Welle dam</hi>: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for that respect, they did ordain the before-specified obstruction thereof to be made: and that afterwards it was presented before him the said <hi>Geffrey</hi> &amp; his fellow Justices itinerant, in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of some persons, for their own particular advantage; that the same obstruction was made to their damage; Whereupon they caused <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Peverell</hi> to be impleaded for it; and proceeded so far therein, as that the said <hi>Edmund</hi> submitted to an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thereof: which Inquisition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be taken before the said King; the parties before-specified besought him; that, whereas that obstruction had been made by the appointment of those Justices, he would please to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede the taking thereof, untill the complainants could shew forth their right as they ought to do. The said King therefore being willing to do right in the premisses, required the Treasurer and Chamberlains of his Exchequer, that they should under the Exchequer Seal, send unto him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions so taken before the said <hi>Will. Howard</hi> and his associates, as aforesaid; together with the whole process there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, upon the <hi>xvth</hi> of the holy <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> then next ensuing; all which were

               <p>By virtue of which Precept, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors for the Counties of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Huntendon</hi> were respited untill from the <hi>xvth</hi> of the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; because none of them appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and therefore the Shireeve was to attach them. And because the Shireeves of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that their Writs came so late unto them, that they could do nothing therein; and the Shireeve of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> made no return at all, therefore other Writs were sent unto them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring each of them to bring <hi>xxiiij.</hi> honest and lawfull men <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at that time prefixed: and in the interim the said King dispatcht his Writ of <hi>Certio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare</hi> to the Treasurer and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains of his Exchequer; commanding them, that they should forthwith send unto him under the Exchequer Seal, the said Inquisitions, so taken before the before-specified <hi>Will.

               <p>But the said Treasurer and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains of the Exchequer, made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; that, having sought amongst their Rolls, they could not find any such Inquisition, Ordinance, or Decree touching the obstruction of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King signified as much to the said <hi>Geffrey le Scrope</hi> and his associats; and not long after issued out a writ to the Shireeve of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; whereby, having advertised him of all proceedings in that business, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to make publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, within his Liberties, where he should think fit, that all such persons who were concern'd therein should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the said King, at a day and place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, to make their proposals touching that business, if they thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By virtue whereof the said Shireeve of <hi>Norfolk</hi> (<hi>viz.

And that he did give notice to all the Noble-men of those parts, that they should appear at the same day, specified in the writ, before the said King, to render their reasons, if they thought good. And the said Shireeve did also give advertisement thereof to <hi>Will. de Whetacre</hi> Steward of the Liberties for the Town of <hi>Lenne,</hi> who had return and Execution of writs.

               <p>The like Writs did the said King send to the Shireeves of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgshire.</hi> Which Shireeve of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgshire</hi> (<hi>scil.

he required him to summon the said <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to appear upon the said <hi>xvth</hi> of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> when Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be taken thereof, to propose what she could touching her right then in question.

               <p>And upon the same <hi>xv.</hi> of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> the said Shireeve making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Writ, there came <hi>Adam de Fincham,</hi> the King's Attorney, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Jurors for the said Counties of <hi>Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntendon, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Northampton:</hi> But neither did the said <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Marshland</hi> Land men, nor of the Counties of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> having Lands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, make any appearance at all.</p>

                  </gap> Causey ought to be <hi>xvi</hi> foot in bredth, and four foot in height; and all these things to be done at the charge of the Land-holders of <hi>Elme, Welle,</hi> and <hi>Wisebeche,</hi> on the South side as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, from <hi>Mermaunde</hi> unto the house of <hi>Iohn de Vernon</hi>: and they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that for the performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, every acre of Land in <hi>Elme, Welle,</hi> and <hi>Wisebeche,</hi> within the Precincts before-specified, should be agisted at <hi>ii</hi>

               <p>But afterwards, at a Session of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers held at <hi>Wisebeche</hi> by the same Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, came the free-holders of <hi>Tyd, Neuton, Leverington,</hi> and <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beche,</hi> on the North part of the River of <hi>Wise</hi>; and alleged, that the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that <hi>Crike</hi> ought not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; because if it should be made, the water running through that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, called the <hi>Crike,</hi> would so rise, increase and stand upon the Fen-bank of <hi>Wisebeche,</hi> and <hi>Leverington,</hi> as that the Tenants of those Towns, <hi>viz. Wisebeche</hi> and <hi>Leverington,</hi> could not be able to maintain them; but their said Banks would be broken, and their Lands totally drowned and lost; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more damage by half would happen to those Towns, than benefit to the Towns of <hi>Elme, Welle,</hi> and <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beche,</hi> on the South side.</p>
               <p>VVhereunto the said Tenants of <hi>Elme</hi> and <hi>Welle</hi> answered, that the water of <hi>Crike,</hi> had then so swift a course by <hi>Welle,</hi> unto the River of <hi>Wigenhale,</hi> that though the said <hi>Crike</hi> were stop't, as was contained in the before-specified Ordinance, the water running by the same <hi>Crike</hi> would never turn towards <hi>Wisebeche,</hi> nor do any hurt. And they farther said, that the <hi>Crike,</hi> where the water then
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49029:178"/>
ran, was the proper and several soil of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> which Bishop might lawfully, at his pleasure stop the same. Whereupon came the Abbot of S. <hi>Edmundsberry</hi> by his Attorney, and claimed a certain fishing in the said water of <hi>Crike,</hi> of the gift of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> sometime King of <hi>England</hi>; and brought a Precept from the King, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the said Commissioners, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a confirmation made to the said Abby by the before-specified King <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> and other his Progenitors (<hi>inter alia</hi>) of certain Lands and fishing, which <hi>Ulfkytell</hi> had in <hi>Welle:</hi> And that though the said fishing was then (<hi>viz.</hi> when this Inquis. was taken) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Livermere,</hi> and in the Town of <hi>Welle,</hi> which was before called <hi>Wylla,</hi> and in the County of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>: and that a certain water called <hi>Nene,</hi> had time out of mind ran to the said Lake, and did then so do; and that the said Abbot and his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, had ever had the said Lake or fishing, with the course of that River of <hi>Nene</hi> running thereinto, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enjoyed the same; the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, by Virtue of the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Parents, for the view and repair of the Banks, Ditches, and Sewers in that County; and by colour of an Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken before them, without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to the before-specified Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, intended the obstruction of the said water-course, wherein, in case they should proceed, the said Abbot would totally lose the benefit of his said fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the damage of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; because that the profit thereof, with the benefit of the other Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Abby, being of the said Kings Patronage, ought to belong unto the Crown in the time of every Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy: he therefore required them, that they should not make any attempt therein to his prejudice, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Wednesday</hi> next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Feast of the blessed Virgin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assigned, the said Commissioners sate again; at which time the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Elme, Welle,</hi> and <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beche,</hi> brought the Kings Writ, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof, the Bayliffs of <hi>Tyd, Neuton, Leverington, Wisebeche, Elme,</hi> and <hi>Welle</hi> were required to summon <hi>xij.</hi> of the most substantial men in every of the said Towns, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the Castle of <hi>Wisebeche</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said Justices upon <hi>Wednesday</hi> next after the Feast of S. <hi>Luke</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, there to perform what should be enjoined them, on the said King's behalf touching the obstruction of that <hi>Crike.</hi> And the said King did likewise issue out another Precept <note n="x" place="margin">Ib. f. 420.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the before-specified Justices, that after their said Session, they should upon the <hi>Octaves</hi> of S. <hi>Hillary,</hi> under their Seals, transmit the Record of their proceeding therein unto him; to the end, that upon perusal thereof, he might consider what farther to do therein, according to the Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of this Realm.</p>

               <p>The decay of which said several Sewers, with the Rivers, Lodes and Drayns from them, extending unto the said Town of <hi>Wisebeche,</hi> they say be the chief and special occasions of the drowning, aswell of the said Marish and Pasture in <hi>Upwell</hi> and <hi>Outwell,</hi> as of the whole Countrey of <hi>Marsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Wigenall</hi> adjoyning; and in continuance of time, as they think in their consciences, will utterly drown the said Parishes, and the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Marshland,</hi> unlesse the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Sewers be scoured, according to the antient Ordinances; so as a great part of the said fresh waters of the same <hi>great Ee,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> aforesaid, may be conveyed unto the said North Seas, by the Town of <hi>Wisebeche,</hi> in manner and form aforetime used.</p>
               <p>And they said, that there is another great occasion of the drowning of the said Marish grounds, by reason of the decay of the said old Sewer in <hi>Upwell</hi> aforesaid, called <hi>Maide lode</hi>; and a part thereof called <hi>Ship lode</hi>; the which Lode beginneth at <hi>Welney</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, otherwise called the South branch, coming from <hi>Shrewysnest poynt</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and extendeth from thence unto a certain fen of the said <hi>Edmund Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre,</hi> called <hi>Weeke fen</hi>; and from thence into a certain place in <hi>Helgay,</hi> called <hi>Shiplode Helgay</hi> house, and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the said great River of <hi>Ouse</hi>: The which Sewer they say hath been most

specially decayed, by reason that there hath not been kept a good Sluce of stonework or timber, with sufficient fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and hanging dores to the same, to stop out the Floudsilty waters: And also by reason that the same Sewer falleth not lower towards the said North Seas; <hi>viz.</hi> at and against a certain place in <hi>Denver,</hi> called <hi>Denver hithe</hi>; at the which place they think it most meet for to set and build the said Sluce.</p>
               <p>And they said, that for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the said Sluce, there ought to be a substantial Clouse of stone work and Timber, with two sufficient draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores to the same, to be set within half a furlong of the said Sluce, to stop the fresh waters aswell in the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the same Sluce, as to keep and preserve a sufficient portion of waters within the said Drayn, in the time of extreme drought.</p>
               <p>Furthermore they said, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there hath not been a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Bridge over the said Sewer, called <hi>Maid lode,</hi> of the length of <hi>xx</hi> foot, next unto <hi>Welney</hi> water, so as the same water, at the entry thereof, might have full passage; hath been in like manner a great decay of the said Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>

The plain there is as Level as the Sea, which with the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the grass allureth the Eye, and so smooth that there is nothing to hinder him that runs through it. Neither is there any wast place in it: for in some parts thereof there are Appletrees, in other
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:49029:206"/>
Vines, which either spread upon the ground, or are raised up with poles. A mutual strife there is betwixt Nature and Art, so that what the one produceth not, the other supplies. What shall I say of the Beautifull Buildings, which tis so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to see the ground amidst those Fens to bear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which testimony, no lesse can be inferred; but that, then, this skirt of the Level was not at all drowned: and therefore, that the out-falls to the Sea, were at that time cleer and open; which argueth a greater care in the people inhabiting this flat Country, in those days, than hath been for several ages since. Not were the parts towards <hi>Peterborough</hi> then lesse free from that annoyance, as may seem from what I have received from credible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon the cutting of certain Moats by <hi>Francis Underwood</hi> Esquire, at <hi>Wittlesey,</hi> where he hath made a pleasant and commodious plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, within lesse than <hi>xx</hi> years last past, there was found, at seven foot deep (through absolute Moor) firm ground, and swathes of mowed grasse, lying perfect and not consumed: which cleerly manifesteth; that, through some excesse of rain, falling in the Summer time, there hapned such a floud of the fresh waters, as then meeting with an obstruction at the out-fall, in regard of the silt there contracted by a long sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of dry weather, it did so hinder their usual current to the Sea, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced back, they not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the whole Levell, but have ever since, till the late undertaking (whereof I shall speak anon) kept it, for the most part under water.</p>
               <p>But I dare not adventure to say, that this was the only cause thereof; there being something else, which (no doubt) might be concomitant; <hi>viz.</hi> the usual flowing of the tides, much higher upon the coasts towards <hi>Lenne,</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: for, that they long since did so, is easily demonstrable; there having been, of late years found, at the setting down of a new Sluse, a little beneath <hi>Magdalen fall</hi> (which is about half a mile from <hi>Magdalen</hi> bridge) on <hi>Marsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> side, about <hi>xvi</hi> foot deep in the earth, a large flat stone, of about eight foot in length, and a Cart wheel neer unto it, which were taken up by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain workmen, imployed be one Mr. <hi>Emerson,</hi> in that businesse. And at <hi>Wigenhall</hi> S. <hi>Maries</hi> (which is not far thence) at a place called <hi>Wathden,</hi> there are still to be seen some remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a Church, as also bones that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at a low ebbe upon the River side, about 8 foot below the present super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the earth. The like is also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable at <hi>UUigenhall</hi> S. <hi>Germans,</hi> the floor of the Church there, being at least seven foot lower than the high water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of the <hi>Ouse,</hi> which River run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Church-yard side, is kept off by a strong and large Bank from drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Country. Nor is it any thing else, but the same rising of the usual tides, to a greater height than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which hath so widened the Chanel of this great stream at <hi>Lenne,</hi> that the Inhabitants have been constrained to remove one of their Churches to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distance from it, as is yet to be seen in that part thereof, now called <hi>old Lenne</hi>; where the bones of the dead, which were buried in that Church-yard, are now dayly washt at every high tide, by reason that part of the same Church-yard is consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med away with the violence of that current.</p>
               <p>As for the Trees, which he so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth for their length without knots, I believe they were Firr, no other tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber affording such straightnesse and height; of which kind there have been many digg'd up, of late years, in those parts. But when it was, that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction (whereof I have thus taken notice) hapned, I could never yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; nor the exact time, that the course of the Sea did thus alter: I shall therfore, for want of better light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, descend to the beginning of <hi>K.

And there is likewise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther narrow water there, of one mile long, which is called <hi>Falet,</hi> having in it one Fishing.</p>
               <p>In that part thereof betwixt <hi>Wytles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> and <hi>Kynkesdelf,</hi> where the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern boundary thereof is, the bredth of the Meer containeth three miles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in it a narrow stream, called <hi>Derescuf</hi>; and a Wood named <hi>Rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holt.</hi> On the South part thereof also, there is another slender stream, of three furlongs in length, called <hi>Selfremere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beche,</hi> having in it two Fishings; at the end whereof is a Lake, named <hi>Selfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi>; having on the South side thereof a narrow water, of half a mile long, called <hi>Ubbemere lade</hi>; at the head whereof is likewise another Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, And about the middle thereof, there is a place in the Fen, called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynesbarwe</hi>; and there is the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern boundary thereof.

On the West side (for on all other there is no access to it, by reason of the Fens) it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the firm land, with certain deep and boggy Quagmires, in bredth about two Bow shot: insomuch, as in times past, the access unto it was by navigable Vessells, brought thither through a slow stream, with gentle windes: but now, by much labour and no small cost, there is, with Wood, Stones, and Gravel, a firm Causey made, so that people may come to it on foot. In length this Island doth extend, almost, unto two miles; but in bredth not so much, being environed with Alders, Reedes, green Canes, and Bulrushes, which do beautify it exceedingly; and before it became inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, was full of all sorts of trees (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wild Ashes) the length and bigness whereof, may be seen by the beams and raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the roof of the Church. But now, through tract of time, the Woods, for the most part gone, the fertility of the turf is such, as that the land, converted to tillage, beareth Corn plentifully: nor is it less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable otherwise, being full of fair Gardens, fat Pastures, shady Groves, and rich Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; which, in the Spring time, make a most beautifull shew. Moreover, on the borders of it, there are several Meeres full of Eeles, as also spacious Fens and Pooles, abounding with divers sorts of Fish and Waterfoul; whereof one, called Ramsey meere, from the name of the Isle, much excelleth the other adjacent waters in bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, before I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin therewith, it will be proper (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) by way of preparation thereto, to make some short observation upon the antient Commissions and most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Statutes of Sewers.</p>
               <p>And first touching the <hi>Commissions</hi> (the antiquity and extent whereof do sufficiently appear in the precedent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) I shall briefly note; First, that the King, <hi>ratione dignitatis suae Regiae, ad providendum salvationi Regni sui cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumqua<expan>

                     </expan> fuit astrictus</hi> &amp;c. (for those are the words therein) was by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of his Crown obliged to see and foresee to the safety of his Realm.<note place="margin">See Serg. <hi>Callice</hi> his Reading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stat. of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> Secondly, that by virtue of them, the Commissioners might enforce the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecters of their duty, by distress of their goods, and likewise fine and imprison the dissobeyers of their Orders, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by those words viz. <hi>ad distrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum, &amp; per amerciamenta &amp; alio modo, prout,</hi> &amp;c. All which was by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Common law, id est</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient usage of this Kingdome; as the learned Sergeant <hi>Callice</hi> well infers from the words <hi>dignitatis suae Regiae,</hi> all Prerogatives being without limitation of time.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Statutes.</hi> The first of these was in 6 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and this adds to the power of the said Commissioners; for it gives them Authority to make Officers; to take Accounts of their Expenditors; to set Labourers on work; and to rate the wages of such Labourers.</p>
               <p>Then that of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. which supplying the defect of the former, grants power to the said Commissioners to ordain and execute the Statutes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and other things to be made according to the effect and purport of the said Commissions.</p>
               <p>Next that of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. which continueth the power of that Statute of 6 <hi>H.</hi> 6. for ten years longer, the time first limitted therein being then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49029:212"/>
Preamble whereof there are these words; <hi>viz. the King nothing erthely so highly weighing as advancing of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profit, wealth and Commodity of this Realm.</hi> Whence (saith the before-specified learned Sergeant) it appeareth; that the making of this Law was of all other thought to be most necessary, and of greatest consequence, the King prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same before any earthly thing: and the King's care therein became his Royal person very worthily; because by this Statute safety was brought to the Realm, and wealth and profit to the people thereof.</p>
               <p>In that Preamble 'tis likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable. First, that Marshes and low grounds had formerly been, by politick wisdome, won and made profitable for the good of the Common-wealth. Secondly, that if more speedy and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy were not had and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though divers provisions had been formerly made; yet none of them were sufficient remedy for reformation thereof. And thirdly, that power is given thereby to six Commissioners of Sewers, whereof three to be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> to take any man's timber <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be used therein, and to set the price thereof; as also to sell any mans Lands, nay the King's also, or part thereof, in fee, or for what other term they pleased.</p>
               <p>All which being confirmed by the King's Royal assent had thereunto, are not to be repealed but by Act or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and makes them therefore an absolute Court, to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all things concerning Sewers.</p>
               <p>After this, about two years (<hi>viz.</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10) there was another Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, which extendeth this last Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Town and Marches of <hi>Caleis,</hi> and imposeth a penalty of five Marks upon every Commissioner who shall refuse to be sworn according to the Act of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Then that of 3 &amp; 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. which, taking notice how beneficial the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. had been to this Realm, ordained; that it should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, with these additions thereto, for ever; <hi>viz.</hi> that all Skots, Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Next that of 13 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 9. which authoriseth the Commissions of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thenceforth, to stand in force for the term of ten years next after their dates, unless they were repealed by reason of any Commission, or by <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly that of 3 <hi>Iac. Cap.</hi> 14. which comprehendeth the Walls, Ditches, Banks, Gutters, Sewers, Gates, Causeys, Bridges, Streams, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courses having their passage into the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and within two miles of the City of <hi>London,</hi> as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Commissions and Statutes of Sewers, and to the penalties of the same.</p>
               <p>To these, for removing of some scruples, touching the power of the Commissioners of Sewers, for erecting of new Sluses, and for making new Cuts and Drayns where none were before, I shall add the opinion of those two Chief Justices, <hi>viz. Popham</hi> and <hi>Anderson</hi> (men famous in their times for their learning) in both these Cases; and which is observed by the before-specified Serg. <hi>Callice</hi> in his said Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Stat. of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

               <p>In 43 &amp; 44 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy did arise in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> about the erecting of two new Gotes, at <hi>Skirbeck</hi> and <hi>Langare,</hi> for drayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the waters of South <hi>Holland</hi> and the Fenns, into <hi>Boston</hi> Haven; which work Sir <hi>Edward Dimock</hi> Knight, did by himself and his friends further what he could; but it was opposed by the Country of <hi>Kef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

two Justices, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>The like controversie arose in 12 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 THat the grounds now sought, by these new Sewers to be won and drained, are such as naturally and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently were dry grounds, and not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually overflown; so as they were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land and not water, and are still to this day dry half the year, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in good years longer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nextly, that there have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, notorious and common Drayns, maintained at publick charge for the conveying away of the waters in times of downfall or other overflows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, that the said antient Drayns cannot now possibly (were they

never so well maintained) drayn the Country, because their conveyance (whilst they were in use) was into the Sea running out at <hi>Wisbeche,</hi> from whence the Sea is now departed: so that there is no way now to carry these waters to the Sea, but by <hi>Lynne</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to which therefore these works are made to carry them.</p>
                  <p>¶ The case (I say) standing thus in all these parts, I am of opinion; that the Law of Sewers, lately made for these new works, is warranted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sewers; and that a Tax may be set, aswell for the making and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it according to the meaning of the Statutes and Commission, as it might have been for the old, if they had remained still in use.

                  <p>On the contrary, when they fail, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son teacheth and necessity enforceth, some other remedy be found in supply of it: And the words of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion have it plainly, that gives power in one Clause <hi>to make necessary and behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Laws, for the safeguard and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lands lying to the premisses</hi>; which premisses, being restrained as much as may be to the Sewers, yet the lands lying to them, must be understood the land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Their Lordships finding in their wisdomes, that it can neither stand with Law nor Common sense, that in a case of so great consequence the Law can be void of providence, to restrain the Commissioners in making new works, aswell to stop the fury of the waters, as to repair the old, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity requireth it for the safety of the Countrey; or to raise a charge upon the Towns or Hundreds in general, which are interessed in the benefit or loss, with attending a particular adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surement of Acres, where the service is to be speedy <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Shewing what pains they had taken for two years past in order to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Drayning; and made several Laws: But that Letters were come down from their Lordships, bearing date 20 <hi>Ian.</hi> for respiting the execution of those Laws, so far as related to the County of <hi>Cambr.</hi> or Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> except such as concerned the outfalls of <hi>Nene</hi> and <hi>Weland,</hi> untill farther directions from their Lordships: So that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this stop, those parts, especially in the County of <hi>Cambr.

And that this great discouragement to the said Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, occasioned their Petition, that they might be left to their former liberty.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the said Lords, sitting in Council at <hi>White Hall,</hi> on the <hi>ix</hi> of <hi>March</hi> ensuing, ordered <note n="a" place="margin">Ib. 252. a.</note>, that their said Letter of 20 <hi>Ian.</hi> should be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back to that Board;<note place="margin">9 <hi>Martij.</hi> 15 <hi>Iac.</hi>

                     </note> sent from the said Lords to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-specified Commissioners, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; that by the result of that Board, an Order was made for a Sluse to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at the outfall of <hi>Wisbech</hi> river; and after that so done, the River to be ditched: And that since that time, without the consent of any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners within the Hundred of <hi>Wisbeche,</hi> a Law was made for the ditching of the said River, &amp; that at the particular charge of the same Hundred, from <hi>Wisbeche</hi> bridge unto the Sea; but no Law for the Sluse. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that the said River, when it was last ditched was enlarged from <hi>xl</hi> foot to <hi>Lx</hi> foot wide, at the charge of the high lands and low Countries; and that this Law hath now imposed upon the said Hundred of <hi>Wisbeche</hi> the ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof to its antient bredth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no mention of the said added <hi>xx</hi> foot.</p>
                  <p>All which considered, the said Lords did think fit to vary from some points of those Laws; and farther ordered, that there should be a Sluse made at the <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shooe</hi> beneath <hi>Wisbeche,</hi> at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-charge of all that drayn that way.

                     </note> of the Commissioners to these Propositions.</head>
                  <p>That they had no power to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any mans land without his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary assent: And that the authority which they had by their Commission (to which they were strictly bound) was only to rate the charge of every particular man towards any such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral work, according to the profit which every such person should receive by the same: And forasmuch as 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be discerned, before the work were finished, who should have profit thereby, or how much, they could not legally procure any such assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before hand. But if the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers would be constant to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions which themselves had before that time at divers Sesions of Sewers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; <hi>viz.</hi> that they required no other recompence for their intended work, than a moity only of the cleer profit, which by their sole industry and charge they should bring unto each particular owner of these surrounded grounds, more than formerly was received; they should be ready (as at the first) to give the said Vndertakers all lawfull furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and assistance: Provided, that before they begun their work, they gave security, that they would not impair the Navigation, in the Rivers of <hi>Ouse</hi> and <hi>Grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon which terms if the Vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers did refuse to proceed, the said Commissioners offered to do the work themselves, according to the antient course and legal power of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
                  <p>VVhereupon ensued this <note n="r" place="margin">Ib. f. 266. a.</note> Order of the Lords of the Council, by reference from the King made upon this Answer of the Commissioners, bearing date at <hi>White Hall</hi> 12 <hi>Iulii</hi> An. 1620. (18 <hi>Iac.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:49029:232"/>1. That, according to an offer then made on the part of the Country, good security should be given to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers for a moity of the cleer profits, which by the drayning should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved upon every man's ground, above the rate that then the same was valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; and that the security should be partly from the Owners, and partly in case of Common, by aid of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners; with this Condition, that the lands and parts of each County should be rated by the Commissioners of the said County.</p>
                  <p>2. Concerning Prejudice of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Rivers of <hi>Ouse</hi> and <hi>Grant,</hi> it was ordered that the Undertakers being agreed with for their security in form aforesaid; they should shew unto the Country the means they intended in the drayning of these Levells: And therefore if the Countrey should find it either prejudicial to <hi>Mershland</hi> or otherwise, and present their Reasons to the Board, their Lordships concurring therewith, all farther proceedings to be stayed.</p>
                  <p>3. That consideration should be had, that particulars receive no damage by this drayning; but that the Owners have satisfaction out of those that were to receive Commodity.</p>
                  <p>4. That no land should contribute to this charge, which was then at 8<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. an Acre or upwards, except it lay in small quantities, and intermixt with other lands, so that the work could not go forward without it, and then to have a moity of profit, <hi>ut supra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That their Lordships should not intermeddle with any part of the work, which was already setled &amp; agreed on.</p>
                  <p>6. That the Undertakers, according to their promise, should begin the work within one Month after this Agreement should be concluded.</p>
                  <p>All which being thus setled and agreed upon the last day of <hi>May</hi> then past, with the consent of both parties (for ought appeared to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.) Forasmuch nevertheless as the Undertakers, had not then entred upon the work, nor made any proceeding therein (the time of the year requiring expedition) it was, according to his Majesties pleasure and command, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by that Board; that the said Undertakers should either go on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles so agreed on at that Board, or otherwise desist from that undertaking, and hold the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try no longer in suspence; but to leave them to such further courses as should be expedient: To which purpose it was likewise ordered, that Copies of those Articles and Orders should be delivered both to the Undertakers, and such Gentlemen as attended that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there for the Country.</p>
                  <p>And afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the same Month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the King by his Letters <note n="k" place="margin">Ib. f. 267. a. 25 <hi>Iulii.</hi> 18 <hi>Iac.</hi>
                     </note> directed to the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners (published at <hi>Cambridge</hi> 18 <hi>Aug.</hi>) commending the Undertakers readiness, and acceptance of such mean conditions in so hazardous an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise; required that they might have square dealing in the valuation of the Lands, as they had been truly let, and security for the partage of what should be alotted to them, so that there might not be any just exception thereto; and likewise that the said Commissioners should give them their best assistance, that they might go on with cheerfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the work; the Lords of the Council also, by their Letters <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. 20 <hi>Iulii.</hi> 18 <hi>Iac.</hi>
                     </note> to the said Commissioners, inciting their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the said Undertakers; and for their setling of the business with them according to that Agreement.</p>
                  <p>In pursuance whereof, in a Session <note n="m" place="margin">Ib. f. 267. b. 17 <hi>Aug.</hi> 1620. (18 <hi>Iac.</hi>)</note> of Sewers held at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>August</hi> following, it was ordered; that Sir <hi>Miles Sandys</hi> Knight and Baronet, Sir <hi>Edw. Peyton</hi> Knight and Baronet, and several of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Sewers within the County of <hi>Cambridg</hi> and Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> should view and value, according to the annual worth of the same (being subject to the Taxes, surrounding, and other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which the same had born for <hi>x.</hi> years then past) all the Fen grounds within the County of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> beginning at <hi>Fen-Drayton</hi> on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of that instant <hi>August.</hi> And that four able and sufficient men of every Parish should attend the said Commissioners there, for the better informing them in the true value of those grounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:49029:233"/>And the next year following in a Session of Sewers, held also at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> aforesaid, it was decreed; that the Adventurers, in recompence of their charge of Drayning this whole Level,<note place="margin">19 <hi>Iac.</hi>
                     </note> should have out of the surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded grounds so to be drayned one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thousand Acres, to be set out by metes and bounds: and the King himself (who hath been heard to say; <hi>that for the honour of his Kingdome, he would not any longer suffer these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to be abandoned to the will of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor to let them lye waste and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>) was then pleased to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the principal Undertaker.<note place="margin">☞</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether it was the great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance he had about that time, and after till the end of his reign, for regaining the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> then violently invaded by a powerfull Army, and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with her Husband and Children exposed to the wide World for a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, which was the impediment; or what else I shall not take upon me to say: Certain it is, that no farther progress was made therein; nor any thing else conducing thereto, till the fifth year of our late Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, of blessed memory, when in a Session of Sewers held at <hi>Huntendon,</hi> upon the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6 <hi>Ian.</hi> 5 <hi>Car.</hi> Anno 1629.</note> it was decreed; that a Tax of six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings an Acre should be laid upon all the said Marish, fenny, waste and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded grounds, in order to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Drayning: Notwithstanding which Decree, there was no part of the said Tax paid, nor any prosecution of that work.</p>

                  <p>And it was then decreed, that the said Tax should be paid in, to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers appointed to receive the same, before the <hi>xviijth</hi>. of <hi>Iuly</hi> then next ensuing that present Session; to the end that it might be speedily imployed in the work; that so the said Fens might by sufficient Drayning, be made aswell Winter-grounds as Summer-grounds, in all the parts thereof, saving conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Forelands and Receptacles for Winter flouds.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, his late Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the first of blessed memory, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this great business into his Princely consideration; and foreseeing that these lands, being <note n="p" place="margin">Discourse by Sir <hi>C. Vermuden,</hi> ut supra, p. 2 &amp; 3.</note> a continent of about four hundred thousand Acres, in case they were made Winter-grounds would be an extraordinary benefit to the Common-wealth (<hi>viz.</hi> of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue) as also a great and certain revenue to all parties interessed: And likewise, because the Owners (who were very many) could not agree to do so great a work (one being willing, and another not; one able to contribute, another not) was therefore pleased to undertake the making of those lands, Winter-ground, at his own charge, whereby the said four hundred thousand Acres might be profitable, firm, and good. And for the better performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did command divers Gentlemen, expert in such adventures, to give their advice how these lands might be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in such manner, as that they might be made Winter-grounds; to the end the said work might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                  <p>Amongst which the before-specified Sir <hi>Cornelius Vermuden</hi> was one: who, after view taken thereof, returned their opinions; all concluding it fesible, but differing much in the way to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the same.</p>
                  <p>To give instance of the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of such whom his said Majesty imployed to inform him therein, it will be needless: howbeit of those, that <note n="†" place="margin">Discourse concerning the Drayning of the great Fens, Impr. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1642.</note> exhibited by the said Sir <hi>Cornelius Vermuden</hi> (a person of greater experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Drayning than most others were) was not the least considerable: and therefore it being published in Print, I shall refer my Reader thereto.</p>
                  <p>But such speed there was made in the farther prosecution of this great and noble adventure, that at a general Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sewers, held at <hi>Huntendon</hi> on the <hi>xviijth</hi>.<note place="margin">18 <hi>Iulii</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> Anno 1638.</note> day of <hi>Iuly</hi> then next ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the said King himself was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Undertaker; and to have not only those ninety five thousand Acres, which had been formerly set out for the said Earl; but also fifty seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Acres more, from the Country; his design being (as by the Decree then made at <hi>Huntendon,</hi> appeareth) to make the said Fens as well Winter-grounds as Summer-grounds, as hath before been expressed, <hi>viz.</hi> out of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Pinchbeck, Spalding</hi> South fen, and <hi>Croyland</hi> fen (alias <hi>Gogsland</hi> fen) twelve thousand Acres: And out of the rest of the lands out of which the ninety five thousand Acres had been formerly assigned to and for the said Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> and his partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants; First the number of twelve thousand Acres, parcell of the said

                           <p>Touching the <hi>Great Levell,</hi> we have received many and several complaints, from divers Townships therein; that their lands are taken from them, and they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no benefit by the Drayning: upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof, and of the proofes by them made, and declaration of divers Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners in Court, we find many of them true; and according to his Majesties Instructions to some of us, his Commissioners, we have made an Order to permit them to take the
