         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>So to the conuerted Thiefe, that same night Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise is promised, which before <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proue (as hee alledgeth) to haue been extraordinary: he must prooue the going of soules to Purgatory first to bee ordinary. As also vpon one extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Example, no common Article of Faith
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19589:16"/>
could bee grounded, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth on this, saying, <hi>De fide est mox a morte impios descendere ad aeterna supplicia, vt patet,</hi> Luc. 16. <hi>de diuite, &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos ad aeterna gaudia, vt patet</hi> Lucae 23. <hi>de Latrone, Hodie eris mecum in Paradiso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Simeon</hi> desired <hi>to depart in peace,</hi> and <hi>Paul to bee dissolued,</hi> which neither the one had desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if his departure had been to enter him in so fierce a fire, nor the other, if his dissolution had not been straightway to ioyne him to Christ. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth hee say, that at the finishing of his course, or ending of his fight, a crowne onely is laid vp for him, which should bee giuen him in that day (to wit, of his departure, as <hi>verse</hi> 6.) but likewise, that in the very like manner it abode all them that loue the Lord Iesus.</p>
               <p>Now to close vp our Arguments out of their owne distinction of <hi>Culpa &amp; Poena,</hi> thus wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> reason:</p>
               <p>If Purgatory purge away ought, either it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the fault or the punishment.</p>
               <p>But it purges not away the fault or guilt of mortall sinnes, (by the Papists owne confession) nor the eternall punishment of them, both being before remitted. Neither purgeth it away the temporall punishment; because out of the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of purging, which is taking away, (as <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. is euident) the same is not taken away, but on the contrary is inflicted, <hi>non aufertur enim, sed infertur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore of mortall sinnes it purgeth nothing; and so in that respect it cannot bee called Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>
               <p>And as for veniall sinnes, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19589:17"/>
saith, <hi>Quoad culpam &amp; poenam intrant Purgatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> we prooue thus, that it purges them not away.</p>
               <p>No transient actions can enter into Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to bee burnt vp, or purged away, which are <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Purg. c.</hi> 5.</note> saying, <hi>Ignis Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry que verus &amp; realis est non potest opera combur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But to subsume, Veniall sinnes are transient actions, which none can deny.</p>
               <p>Therefore they enter no wise into Purgatorie, to bee burnt vp, or purged away; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing neither mortall nor veniall sinnes, guilt nor punishment is purged away from the Soule in Purgatory, there is no such thing at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Nam Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorium</hi> (as is said) <hi>est semper alicuius rei purgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Purgatorium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As also, that is not remitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which wholly is punished (saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                        <item>2 That to exact that punishment of man, which Christ hath already satisfied to his Fathers iustice, is to make God vniust, by taking two payments for one debt, as also in not accepting Christ satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for as much as it is worth to the Godly, being of value to free them, as well from Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory (<hi>which is the lesse</hi>) as from Hell (<hi>which is the greater</hi>).</item>

being vnresponsall, to pay it ouer againe to the Creditor: and much more absurd is it to say, that this second payment is a grace, as after a free and full pardon of all punishment whatsoeuer, it should bee a fauour done to a malefactor to bee cast so long in prison, and cruelly whipped.</item>

But first, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne explication of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, in the beginning of the fift Chapter, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies that in all the tenure of that whole meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall speach, it is but one fire that is meant, &amp; no more sortes.

               <p>Next, it is absurd, the whole discourse being Metaphoricall (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants) to take the word (fire) to be only proper.

            <p>So that euery sinne is as a Viper: and there is no Viper,<note place="margin">Actes 28.</note> if wee respect the meere nature of the best of them, but shee killeth whom shee biteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if one shall light on the hand of <hi>Paul,</hi> shee is shaken off into the fire without any har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not the lesse is shee to bee feared, and accounted deadly of her owne nature, although the Apostle be safe.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>sed personis.</hi> From whence it followes, That all sinnes are damnable in all men, but not to all men; all deserving, but not all receiuing damnation: for to the reprobate no sinne is finally veniall, and to the elect no sinne is finally mortall. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that there is one sinne, which is simply, and vniuersally mortall, because it is not only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable, but euer punished with eternall death,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19589:32"/>
and is that sinne against the Holy Ghost; but is no wayes incident to the elect.</p>
            <p>Therefore I call sinne mortall two wayes. First, by explication and generally; and to say a mortall sinne, is to shew the nature of all sinne. Secondly, by way of distinction and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; and so to say a mortall sinne, is to designe that sinne against the Holy Ghost in particular: and which sinne Impenitencie doth follow <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate ineuitabili,</hi> as an inseparable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, where in all other sinnes it is rather contingent: for as no sinne can bee forgiuen without repentance; so this sinne excludes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of repentance:<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.4.</note> and therefore is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missible, and is called Mortall in an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and neuer becomes veniall; not because God in his absolute power cannot forgiue it, but because in his iust will hee hath decreed neuer to forgiue it, the partie so sinning being euer obdured by his owne vniust action, and Gods iust desertion.</p>
            <p>And this is that which is spoken, <hi>Mathew</hi> 12.31. and which Christs beloued Disciple vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 5.16.</note> saying, <hi>There is a sinne to death, and a sinne not vnto death:</hi> distinguishing so, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene some sinnes mortall in nature, and some sinnes veniall by nature: But betweene one sinne simply mortall in nature, and in necessary effect vnto all; and all other sinnes simply mortall in nature also, but not in necessary effect vnto all: and therefore possibly and by repentance veniall through grace vnto the elect. Whereas the same sinnes are iustly through want of repentance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19589:33"/>
retained, and be comes finally mortall to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured reprobate.</p>

               </hi> therefore that concupiscence it selfe should not bring foorth death, or be a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne, but veniall.

            <p>Next he saith, That by the fire that burneth this combustible and light stuffe, Purgatory (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Veniall sinnes enter) cannot bee meant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it purgeth not the worke, but altogether consumes the worke.

               </gap> himselfe is to bee punished by God, according to the merit of his vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned offence, the Lord not hauing meanes to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Iustice on an infinite person, to make proportion betweene his Iustice, and mans sinne some way, hee chuseth an infinite time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the person punished, is no wayes match with the partie offended: therefore this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is truly called <hi>Passion,</hi> but not <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas the infinitenesse of Christs Nature

in person, made his <hi>Passion</hi> to bee a sufficient <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it followes that nothing can bee done by man, either actiuely or passiuely in this life, nor after the same; that can be reputed a condigne satisfaction to God for any one sinne whatsoeuer committed by vs; the guilt and whole punishment whereof is perfectly abrogated by Christ: the first being imputed to him, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inflicted vpon him: that so all who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft in him, may be freed from both; the merit of his blood, and fire of his spirit, and not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Purgatorie effectuating that to vs.</p>
            <p>Not, that by this ouerthrow of that distinction of sinne into mortall and veniall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The inequality of sinne, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thereof.</hi>
               </note> (which at last among the Papists becomes also <hi>venall</hi>) that we denie an inequalitie to be in sinnes, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in their due punishments.</p>
            <p>For first, wee hold sinnes to bee vnequall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the obiect against, which we sinne; and so a sin against God is a greater sin, then a sin against man; and a sinne against the first Table, is greater then a sinne against the second Table; being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in equall and paralell acts. Otherwise if we compare a sinne in the least part of a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the first Table, with a sinne in the greatest part of a Commandement in the Second Table, the latter is more hainous then the first.</p>
            <p>Likewise, as a sinne against God is greater then a sinne against man, for the essentiall diuersitie of the obiect; so the sinne against one man may bee greater then a sinne against another, for the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall diuersitie of the obiect; as in eminencie of place against a King, or propinquitie of blood, &amp;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19589:35"/>
bond of nature against a Parent: for although all men naturally considered are alike and the same, yet ciuilly and politickly they are not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in respect of the matter wherein wee sinne, there is an inequalitie: so Murder is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne then Theft, because life is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then goods. Likewise if we compare sins in the same matter, one may be greater then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the extent or quantitatiue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: as to kill three, is a greater offence then to kill one; and to steale 100. pounds, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theft then 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in respect of the manner how we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, there is an inequalitie of sinning, and so a sinne of malice is greater then a sinne of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so is that of knowledge, greater then that of ignorance. As likewise sinnes that consist only in immanent action or thought of the minde, are lesse then these that come to transient action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accomplished by the body; euery further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition making the sinne more intense in degree.</p>

               </note>And as sins are vnequall; so are their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; God in his distributiue iustice, allotting seuerall portions of paine to the seuerall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sinne.</p>
            <p>The priuatiue punishment, or <hi>poena damni,</hi> in time &amp; degree is alike to all; <hi>Depart from me &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:19589:35"/>And as the outward paine of fire primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the body, doth worke effectually to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the soule; so doth the inward paine of the worme which is in the soule, worke effectually to afflict the body: that as they were brethren in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and participated in sinne, so they may bee coupled likewise, and pertake in torment.</p>
            <p>And as the soule hath one estate in her selfe at death independant vpon the body by her sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it, and another in the body vpon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vniting with it at the resurrection: so in the first she suffereth outward paine immediately, and in the second by the body mediately.</p>
            <p>In all which, the punishment of all is equall in time, because in respect of duration, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor lesse in that which is eternall, but the punishment is vnequall in degree, Gods iustice hauing a relatiue respect to mans sinne.</p>
            <p>And so although we denie that any sinnes are veniall by nature, yet we affirme some to be lesse then others, and in a lesse measure punished: and so the vniust slander of our Aduersaries, affirming that we make all sinnes, and consequently all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments equall, may easily hence appeare.</p>
