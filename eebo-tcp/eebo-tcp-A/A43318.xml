            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The desire &amp; endevor of the Preacher was, according to the scope and nature of the Text, to shew, that after so often renued and long continued humiliation; and after solemne entring into Covenant with the most high God, The true reformation of Religion, is the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est meane to turne away the still pressing wrath of God from the Kingdome, And to bring the desired blessings of all sorts upon Church and State; which yet will prove but uneffectuall, unlesse the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation intended by the Honourable Houses of Parliament and the reverend Assembly of Divines be attended &amp; faithfully followed with Renovation and Repentance in the people: Repentance for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very knowne Sin (and how can Sin be unknowne in the midst of so many burning and shining

I should soon have subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. The haters of God, should have submitted themselves unto him; but their time should have endured for ever.</hi> Hearken therefore unto the voyce of God in the spirituall, plaine and powerfull preaching of his servants (one of the greatest evidences that the Lord hath a purpose of mercy toward you) and walke in his wayes. <hi>Marke them which cause devisions and offences amongst you; be wise unto that which is good, &amp; simple concerning evill; &amp; the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.

to trouble him <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 4.4, 5.</note>. While <hi>Belshazzar</hi> the King mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great feast to a thousand of his Lords, he can make a hand to write over against the Candlesticke upon the plaister of the Wall, which maketh the Kings countenance to be changed, and his thoughts to trouble him; so that the joynts of his loynes were loosed, his knees smote one against another, and his wise men and Lords were astonied with him <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 5.5.</note>: he can make <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he is called to curse the people of God, contrary to his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention &amp; the desire of <hi>Balaak,</hi> to blesse them three times <note n="c" place="margin">Num. 24.10.</note>: He can make <hi>Cajephas</hi> to prophesie what he understandeth not, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole Nation perish not <note n="d" place="margin">John 11.49, 50.</note>: And the Lord can reveale his will to <hi>Joseph, Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and his Prophets, concerning things to come for the comfort of his Church <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 37.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54059:4"/>
when the Lord is pleased neither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to farre as to renue, nor doe so little as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine, but thinketh meet to change the affections of the heart of man; whether from particular ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and opposition, as he dealt with <hi>Esau</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against <hi>Jacob</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54059:5"/>
and the house of God ordered with all speed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in every thing, as God himselfe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Text di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</note>If we will looke more distinctly upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not of the words, but of the matter, we shall meet with three particulars fitting the present condition of affaires, and very worthy our gravest consideration: The first is the great evill to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded, even the greatest of all evils, <hi>The wrath of God against the Realme of the King and his Sonnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, the meane which is the chiefest of all meanes, and without which no other meane can be effectuall for averting or preventing of wrath, <hi>Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done, for the house of the God of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, the connexion of the one and the other, or the inference of the effect from the cause: <hi>For why should there be wrath? &amp;c.</hi> When that is not diligently done for the house of the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which the God of Heaven commandeth, then is there wrath against the Realme of the King and his Sonnes.</p>
            <p>Would the Lord, who is so rich in wisdome and can use so many powerfull wayes of dealing with the heart of man, be pleased to put it in the Kings heart, to write such a letter and send forth such an Edict as this is, it would be the opening of a doore of hope; or as good <hi>Schechaniah</hi> saith <note n="l" place="margin">Ezra 10.2.</note>, <hi>there would be now hope in Israel concerning this thing</hi>: That the horrible deluge of wrath which now overrunneth this Land, should be aswaged, the Fountains also of the depth, and the windowes of Heaven would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54059:5"/>
be stopped, the <hi>Arke</hi> would rest, the Dove would come with an Olive-leafe in her mouth, we would all joyn in offering a Sacrifice of thanksgiving, the Lord would smell a savour of rest, and we should see a new world wherin should dwel righteousnesse and peace. Amongst all the great things which the honourable Houses of Parliament have done, there is none more acceptable to God, or more promiseth peace and happinesse to this Land, then that a Church-assembly is called, for searching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of the God of Heaven, <hi>that whatsoever is commanded by him may be diligently done.</hi> The wrath of the Lord hath raged for many yeeres in <hi>Germany</hi> and is not yet abated, because nothing is done there for Reformation of Religion, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the house of God. But there be three things in <hi>England</hi> which give us hope and promise deliverance. First, Your frequent and continued fasting and humiliation. Secondly, Your entring into a solemne Covenant with God for obtaining mercy. Thirdly, Your begun Reformation, and the course You have taken for perfecting the same, <hi>That whatsoever is commanded by the God of Heaven may be diligently done for the house of the God of Heaven.</hi> If these three be performed in truth, You may expect a blessing: True humiliation, Covenanting with God, and Reformation, are the Harbingers of peace and happinesse: But when they are not in truth, the hypocrisie threatneth more then the performance promiseth.</p>

               </gap> the power which God hath given them, for setling his feare and worship according to his owne will: The height and depth thereof is in the word <hi>Wrath,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.22.</note> which is a boyling and burning anger, and this is the wrath of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from heaven,<note place="margin">In the hight and depth thereof.</note> and burning to the lowest hell; The bredth is, where it is not said against the King, but the kingdom of the King; and the length of it is, the Sons &amp; Posterity of the King to al generations.</p>
            <p>To speake a word of these three severally: First, we know that the words used in Scripture to denote the wrath of God against his Enemies, doe expresse humane affections and bodily passions, which are not in him who is not like unto man; But the thing intended is the Lord his most holy dislike and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54059:6"/>
detestation of sinne, with his most just and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant will and decree to punish the same: His Comminations and threats declaring his dislike and decree, and his judgements and vengeance which are the executing of his threatnings. This execution of wrath is principally meant in this place, and yet it is not called the wrath of God, but simply (<hi>Wrath</hi>) thereby shewing the greatnesse and immensity of the wrath of God; that there is no wrath comparable with his wrath, and therefore no wrath so formidable as his wrath. For first, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrath of Man or Angell is but the limited wrath of the creature, but his wrath is infinite like himself; as the man is, so is his wrath, and as God is, so is his wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The wrath of a King is like the roaring of a young Lyon, but the roaring of the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> is more terrible; look how much the Wisdome, the Power, the Justice, the Mercy of God are greater then the Wisdome, the Power, the Justice, the mercy of man, so much is the wrath of God greater then the wrath of man. Secondly, the wrath of God reacheth to the soule as well as to the body; to Kingdomes as well as to particular persons or Families; to the posterity as well as to the present generation; it being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with omnipotency to which all things are alike, easie and faisible. Thirdly, the greatnesse of his anger appeareth in this; that he is the Lord of Hosts, when the Heavens and the earth were fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and all the host of them <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1. then and not before did God the maker of all things take upon him the name of the Lord <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 2.4.</note>, <hi>verse</hi> 4.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54059:7"/>
After he had made all things by his word, and set them in order, he commandeth and ruleth all by his authority, he hath them all ready to execute his will; they are all his Host and Souldiers, from the Angels, Sunne, Moone and Starres, unto the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Flies and Wormes; and when he giveth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme to the least of them, the greatest on earth are not able to resist.</p>
            <p>The Use of this may be two-fold:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> One is against the wicked; since in these three respects there is no wrath comparable to the wrath of God, no wrath is so much to be feared as his wrath. Vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompence saith the Lord; and againe, the Lord shall judge his people; It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 10.30.31.</note>; although it be much better for the Godly to fill into the hands of God, whose mercies are great and who in judgement remembreth mercy, then into the hands of men whose mercies are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell; and it were more tolerable for them to have the pestilence then the sword raging in the Land <note n="q" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14.</note> yet the wicked shall find that it had beene more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for them to fall into the hands of men then into the hands of God, who both killeth the body and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth their temporall being, &amp; casteth both soul and body into the fire of hel; <hi>For the Lord whose name is jealous is a jalous God</hi>

               <note n="t" place="margin">Ezek. 5.13.</note>. The wicked amongst the people of God, who blesse themselves in their owne hearts, saying; We shall have peace, though we walk in the imaginations of our owne hearts; are the naturall element for the curses and judgements of God, which are moving to and fro, to lye and rest in, and when the curses and judgements of the Lord come upon them, the Lord is at rest and is comforted, and his people that feare his name and tremble at his judgements, are also at rest and are comforted.</p>
            <p>Another use is for the Godly,<note place="margin">

When <hi>Moses</hi> did behold the Idolatry of the people in the golden Calfe, his Zeale was so strong and he so impatient, that he brake the Tables written with Gods owne hand <note n="u" place="margin">Exod. 32.</note>. <hi>I have beene very jealous for the Lord God of Hosts,</hi> saith <hi>Elias</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12.11.</note>. When we are lukewarme in the matters of God, then doth the wrath of God wax hot, and when we are fervent and zealous, then doth his anger cease and the fire of his wrath is extinguished.</p>
            <p>The second is, the object of his wrath, or the bredth unto which it is extended:<note place="margin">In the bredth thereof.</note> 
               <hi>The Realme of the King</hi>: he saith not upon the King, or upon the King of the Kingdome, but upon the Kingdome of the King; and thus he expresseth himselfe upon two grounds, or for two reasons: The one is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew that for his fault the people might suffer: The other is; that he looked more to the suffering of the people, then to any thing that could befall himselfe. No question he had learned from <hi>Ezra</hi> and others of his spirit (so good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a thing is it, that <hi>Ezraes</hi> and <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> be about Kings, such prove indeed as their names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, helpers and comforters both to King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that Kingdomes suffers sometimes for the sins of their Kings and Rulers <note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 24, 1 Kin. 21.</note>; a truth not unknowne unto naturall men. It is also true that Kings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times suffer for the sinnes of the people: <hi>For the transgression of a Land many are the Princes therof</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 28.2.</note>. <hi>If you shall still doe wickedly,</hi> saith <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people <note n="e" place="margin">1 Sam. 12.25</note>; <hi>yee shall be consumed, both you and your King.</hi> But all the debate is in the application; for Kings many times justifie themselves, that the people suffer not for their sinnes, but for their owne; and the people are as ready to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54059:8"/>
that Kings suffer not for their sinnes but for their owne; and when wrath is upon both, both are ready to stand to their owne defence, and to plead their innocency: But the true determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that no man or multitude suffereth but for that sinne, which some way is their owne sinne, and whereof they themselves are guilty. When <hi>David</hi> numbred the people, &amp; the people were punished, the people were punished for their owne sinnes; both their former sinnes which the Lord at this time did take occasion to call to remembrance; and their present sinne in consenting to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of the people; for had they beene all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing as <hi>Joab</hi> was, and had not consented, they had not sinned. Kings should not be permitted to commit such publike sinnes, but Councell, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, People, and every one according to his place and power should hinder them. It may displease them for the present, but afterward it shall be no griefe nor offence of heart unto them, either that they have shed blood causlesse, or have avenged themselves, as <hi>Abigail</hi> said to <hi>David</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 35.31.</note>; yet <hi>David</hi> said truely, it was his sinne, both because it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at him, and he was the principall Agent in it; and because he gave the provocation at this time, and his sinne was the match that set on fire the wrath of God, which was ready before to be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled against the people for their sinnes. It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable debate betwixt a King and a people, when in the time of a publike judgement, both of them stand to their owne innocency, and the one accuseth the other of guiltinesse: But it is a sweet contest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54059:9"/>
and promiseth much mercy and comfort: when the Prince saith; I have sinned and done wickedly, but what hath the people done? and when the people say, we have sinned and done wickedly, and thereby have drawne wrath upon out selves. Although at this time the Kings Majesty, when he sees so many of the poore people fall to the ground, so much blood spilt, should be moved in his heart to say as <hi>David</hi> said, I have sinned: Yet yee that are his Subjects, each one in his owne place, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your owne sinnes, and justifie the Lords doing, for yee are guilty; first, of many sinnes before this time, especially that you have not called and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured so earnestly as yee ought for Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, that every thing might have beene done in the house of God according to his own wil; but have pleased your selves with, and have rested in the beginnings of a Reformation; yee have been for the greater part more pleased with things which were not reformed, then the things which were reformed in the worship of God; and this sinne hath beene the cause of many other sinnes, for where God is not served aright, all other duties are but neglected or performed without sincerity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the present, this is the sinne of the Land, that the people have not according to their power stayed the King from shedding of blood, but many have joyned their Counsels and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to begin and encrease the common misery, and others have not resisted the evill, but suffered the sword to rage, which may make the people just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say, <hi>We have sinned and done wickedly.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54059:9"/>The third is, the length of this wrath;<note place="margin">In the length thereof.</note> for it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Kings Sonnes and so to the Posterity. The wrath of God endeth not at the persons that have sinned, but is extended to others that descend of them, without respect of persons, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for sinnes about the house and worship of God. For the horrid and blasphemous murmuring of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they repented themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and said one to another, let us make a Captaine and let us returne into <hi>Egypt;</hi> not onely their own carkasses fel in the Wildernes, but their Children which had not murmered, yea which were not yet born must wander in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse forty yeers, and beare their whoredomes <note n="g" place="margin">Numb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in slaying the Gibeonites, there was not onely a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> three yeers yeere after yeere, but seven of his sonnes also were hanged up in <hi>Gibea. David</hi> himselfe was not sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This course the Lord doth after a speciall manner follow in sinnes about his house and worship; and therefore in the second command and no other doth the Lord threaten to visit the sinnes of the Fathers upon the Children. The reasons why the Lord doth so; are first, that all the world may know, how much the Lord abhorreth sinne, especially in matters of his worship. To this purpose it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable what he saith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.34. <hi>In the day when I visit I will visit their sinne upon them:</hi> So often as he punished the people and their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for other sinnes he remembred, their sinne of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, which gave occasion to the saying, That in every plague of <hi>Israel</hi> there was one ounce of the golden Calfe. Secondly, that men may abstaine from sinnes of this sort, not onely for respect to themselves, but to their posterity, whom they love so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enderly, and of whom they are often more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then of themselves. And this he doth to the <hi>third and fourth generation,</hi> that both the Parents themselves and others who are witnesses to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54059:10"/>
sinnes of the Parents, may be sensible of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and know that the Lord is just, and the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of sinne. I leave the theologicall discourse in vindicating the justice of God, onely I say; first, that the Lord punisheth no man with eternall wrath for his fathers sinnes, but the soule that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth suffereth in that kind. Secondly, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wicked posterity cannot open their mouth against the justice of God, since they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the iniquity of their fathers. Thirdly, that the Godly when they are visited in their bodies, goods, or estates which they have from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will find these visitations to be indeed <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia peccati non judicia propter peccatum,</hi> and rather medicines and preservatives for their eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse then wrath for their destruction.</p>

               </note> the great wisdome which God hath given you in your publike places, be stirred up and exercised, in taking heed that all the former sinnes of this Land committed by so many Progenitors, be not brought upon this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, according to that sore and sad sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Sonne of God against <hi>Jerusalem, Matth.</hi> 23.35.<note place="margin">Matth. 23.35.</note>

               </gap>tirpation of some Families: But it is in your hands to prevent the desolation of the Church and Kingdome. The Jewes filled up the measure of their Fathers, by crucifying the Sonne, of God when he came amongst them and would have wrought a Reformation, and therefore their habitation was left desolate, and they are no more a Nation nor a Kingdome unto this day: It is true the people were executioners, but the Rulers were the prime Agents. Doe therefore the worke unto which the Lord hath called You, and Yee shall save the Kingdome from this wrath: It is in Your hands as Instruments to make the posterity blessed, and to blesse You for your faithfulnesse. Woe to them that leave their Station in such an exigence; they doe what they can to bring all the blood and all the sinnes of former times upon this Generation, and to make the Posterity miserable. Let others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse or pretend what they will, I am assured, that such as are faithfull in their places, are upon the right way to save the Kingdome, the King, and the Kings Sonnes from wrath.</p>
            <p>Now there is nothing more necessary, nothing we should desire more earnestly to know, then by what means this great wrath of the great God may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented where it is iminent &amp; feared,<note place="margin">The me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54059:11"/>
threaten his wrath, to what purpose doth he make it smoke, and in part to break forth in a flame, but that the means may be used to turn it away, that the fulnesse thereof come not upon us. We will find three sorts of means practised in the books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and of the Prophets their contemporaries. The first was publick fasting and solemne humiliation joyned with Confession of sin,<note place="margin">The first mean.</note> justifying of God in all the evils he had brought upon them, earnest deprecation of wrath, and supplications for a blessing that God would accept of their endeavours, and prosper his work against so many professed and secret Enemies. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was,<note place="margin">The second mean.</note> a solemne Covenant: For the Princes and Rulers first, and then the people entred into a curse and an oath, to walk in Gods Law, and to observe and do all his commandments, judgements, and statutes. Here there was swearing, subscribing, sealing; and all means used which could bind their inconstant and fugitive hearts unto God. The third was,<note place="margin">The third mean.</note> the doing of the work of God; the building of the Temple, the reformation of Religion, the ordring of the worship &amp; service of God, and the reedising of the wals which were ruined &amp; lying in heaps. Their fasting and praying was not sufficient, they behoved to enter into Covenant. Their praying and Covenanting was not enough, nor were they to rest there, They behoved to build and reforme. It hath pleased God to putt in your hearts, to give your selves to frequent fasting and humiliation, onely consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the acknowledgment of your particular Sins and personall transgressions, yee have beene humbled for publike and Nationall Sinnes, and especially such as have beene committed about the worship of God, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54059:12"/>
the Government of the house of God. The Lord hath been much dishonoured this way, for this hath he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in a controversie with the Land; this therefore would be confessed that God may be resto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d to his honour by your confession. It feareth me that a great part of the people of the Land are not yet brought to this Confession, but are still fond of a formall Service, and a proud Prelacie; and therefore as ye are your selves in humilitie to acknowledge this sin as a high provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so would all good meanes be used for bringing the people to the sight and sense of it. It is true, there is a secret and reall acknowledgement in the Covenant; but the Lord requireth a more direct, open, and plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; nor can he be pleased, or his wrath turned away, till that which hath been called and esteemed, for so many yeers, the glory and the beautie of the Church of England, be thus brought low and cast into the dust. It hath pleased the Lord also, to bring you a degree farder: That both the honourable Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many others, whose hearts the Lord hath toucht, have entred into a solemne League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for performing such duties, as are judged neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie at this time, for the honour of God, and for the deliverance and preservation of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which no doubt will prove a pretious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mean of good, if the Name of the most high God, be not by it taken in vain: But take heed, that it be not forgotten by them that have taken it, before it be taken by others; And therefore two things would be looked unto. 1. That although it should never be taken by others, yet it obleigeth such as have entred in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and although the whole Nation, be bound to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54059:12"/>
same duties, which ye are bound unto, ye have entred into a new Obligation, which, if you shall forget or violate; will certainly be laid to your charge. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reproveth Israel not for the transgression of the Law,<note place="margin">Jer. 34.</note> which yet commanded the same duties, but for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant. 2. That others be instructed and moved to enter into the same Covenant: for if they who have entred in Covenant shall not consider that it is a perpetuall Covenant never to be forgotten, or (which God forbid) shall forget their supervenient obligation, and others shall refuse to enter in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it will not onely make a division in the Church and Kingdom, but shall be a ready way to bring on a greater wrath, then yet hath been seen or felt: Upon one sort for their perfidy; and upon the other, for their neglect or obstinacy.</p>
            <p>There is yet a third mean, without which the former two are not sufficient: And this is, <hi>Whatsoever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the God of heaven, be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven:</hi> A dutie which in it self is necessary, and which to us who live under the Gospel, is no other thing, but the reformation and setling of Religion. Wherein we are to consider.<note place="margin">Considerations about the third mean.</note> 1. the Rule of reformation, which is the <hi>Commandment, Decree, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God.</hi> 2. The extent of this reformation, <hi>whatsoever.</hi> 3. How or after what manner we should go about the work, <hi>diligently.</hi> 4. The reasons, which should induce us to this duty: one is, from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and soveraignty of God: <hi>He is the God of heaven.</hi> The other from common equity: <hi>It is the house of the God of heaven</hi>; and it is equitable that every man bear rule in his own house.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54059:13"/>The rule of building the house of God, and of the reformation of Religion,<note place="margin">1. The Rule of Reformation.</note> is the same and perpetuall: the commandment of God, and not the commandment of man one or moe, whether they be Civill or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall persons. It is their part to provide according to their places and callings, to command and direct that the Commandment of God be obeyed. This King commandeth not that his will be done, but what God hath commanded. Neither King nor Parliament can command otherwise. Civill powers have great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, not onely in things civill, but in matters of Religion; and they sin against God, if they use not the authority which God hath put in their hands, for the good of Religion.

                  </gap>,</hi> it is about matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a civill manner, and in a way sutable to the nature and qualitie of their place and power. The faithfull custody and preservation of Religion, is a part of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54059:13"/>
office: for they are not onely keepers of the second, but of the first Table of the Law. To them appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vindication and defence of Religion, against contempt, corruption, and abuses. Religion also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth from them the Civill sanction, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and the wholsome constitutions of the Church about Religion, be confirmed and setled by their Laws. Coaction also is theirs, for they by their power are to constrain their Subjects to the duties of Religion, and to coerce and stop them that they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary. They also may and ought to call Assemblies of the Church, when the case of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth require, praeside as Civill Presidents, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Church-Constitutions, not onely as they are Christians for satisfying their own souls, but as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates for the good of the people. And when there is a necessity of reformation of Religion, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and Church-men, like the sands of the Sea-shore are covered with a deluge of defection and corruptions, they are by their Authority to endeavour a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet in all this exercise of their power, they are to do nothing but according to the Commandment of God: so <hi>David, Jehoshaphet, Hezekiah, Josiah,</hi> and other good and religious Princes have done. But when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> putteth his own commandment in place of the commandment of God, when <hi>Ahaz</hi> setteth up the Altar of Damascus beside or in place of Gods Altar, when the Kings of Judah and Israel, did worship God, or did command the people to worship God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then God had commanded, wrath was upon the Kingdom of the King and his Sons.</p>
            <p>When we consider of this,<note place="margin">

               </note> we have cause both to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and rejoyce: to lament, that through the working of corrupt Church-men so many things concerning the worship and house of God, should have been pressed upon the people of God, without or against his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, if Arminianisme for the soul and life, and Popish Service and Ceremonies for the body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had been received and admitted, as they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and obtruded, our condition had been more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, then it is at this time, notwithstanding all our calamities and miseries. We have also cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that in the one Kingdom a course hath been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for doing every thing in the house of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Commandment, and that in this Kingdom it is ordered, that a wise and holy Assembly of Divines shall search diligently into the Word of God, <hi>That whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The extent of this Reformation is,<note place="margin">2. The extent of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>Whatsoever God hath commanded:</hi> for what God hath commanded must be done; what he hath forbidden must not be done, but abolished; and what is in the nature thereof indifferent must be regulated according to the Commandment of God, which is, no lesse plain and peremptory in our practise of things indifferent, then in other matters. Reformation therefore of Religion must be a through and perfect reformation. The particular reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were wrought by the Kings of Judah, are noted, and according to this rule, do they receive a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony from God. Some onely destroyed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Baal, some the golden Calves of Dan and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and some also the groves and high places, and we know what approbation is given to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi> There is a promise made to such a through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

               <hi>I will restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called the City of righteousnesse, the faithfull City, &amp;c.</hi> The reason is, 1. Because God is not honoured by a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, imperfect, and half-reformation. He is readie to spew out the luke-warme person, family, or people. If we love the Lord with all our heart and strength, we will do every thing that he commandeth: for what is it that hindreth, but that our heart is parted or divided betwixt two; and that we resolve, to be almost, but not altogether godly. 2. Because <hi>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> saith the Apostle to the Galathians,<note place="margin">Galat. 5.7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them that having run well they did halt and not throughly obey the truth, and telling them, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion did not come of him that called them.</hi> When any known corruption is kept, it becomes a snare, and like a nest-egge, that bringeth us back again. I know this is censured for precisenesse by the world: but we see the best servants of God have been such Precisians. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the hoof of <hi>Moses, Mordecai</hi> his bowing of his knee, <hi>Daniel</hi> his abstaining from idolatrous meat, and the opening of his window; <hi>Paul</hi> his houre and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evill, with many more examples of this kind. They are Precisians indeed, who are liberall in the matters of God, and can find in their hearts to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with his commands, his truth and worship: but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54059:15"/>
will not be content to want the least complement of their own worldly honour and dignitie, nor the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest penny of their gaine and worldly commodity. Although it be true, that some things in Religion be fundamentall, and absolutely necessary unto salvation, and other things not so, yet to be obstinate against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth, or to mis-regard or despise smallest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, which are necessarie to be received, if not for themselves, yet for the authoritie of Scripture, (as some make the distinction) bringeth as certain a curse and condemnation, as ignorance and errour doth in matters more substantiall.</p>

It is better known to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Audience, then to me; and yet who is so great a stranger that knoweth it not: that Reformation was begun in the time of two Princes? But because it was not a through Reformation according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, Superstition and Idolatry returned again like an inundation. It was again begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the time of other two Princes; but because, they set up their rest in the Rudiments and beginnings of Reformation, Idolatry, Superstition, and Heresie have assayed to enter again with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew strength and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Now the third time the work is begun, and there is a greater stir and shaking for it then before, either now endeavour to carry it through to every point of known perfection, doing whatsoever the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath commanded, or look for nothing, but that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition

and Idolatry, and with it ruine and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shall come upon you as a flood.</p>
            <p>And therefore, which is the third, go about the work after the manner here prescribed,<note place="margin">3. The manner of going about Reformation.</note> that is <hi>diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which implyeth very much. 1 Sincerely, ayming at the right end without simulation. This is to do the work of God, for the honour of God, and good of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And not for our glory or benefit, or for civill ends were they never so publick; And therefore it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not onely for publick, but for pious Spirits. Where this sinceritie is wanting, there may be a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and counterfeiting of diligence, but no true dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or faithfulnesse. 2 Zealously: for true zeal is active, like fire, or like mettall in a horse, or like winde to the sails of a ship, it carrieth us on, and maketh us diligent. 3. Prudently, Prudence considereth both the opportunities and impediments of working, where Prudence is wanting, there may be precipitation, but no true diligence. 4. Speedily, without delay or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastination. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54059:16"/>
others, prevail with you, to leave your station, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the work unto the which the Lord hath called you, but that you resolve still to do, and, if the Lord will, to die. Let no man think by deserting the work and forsaking his station, that the work shall cease and he shall prosper. No, thou shalt find thy soul filled with grief and vexation upon two contrary grounds: One is, Thou shalt with a grieved and envious heart behold with thy eyes, the work to prosper, and thou not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to have a hand in it. The other is; Thou thy self shall perish in the end: <hi>For as a bird that wandreth from her nest,</hi>

               <hi>so is a man that wandreth from his place.</hi> Mark and consider what comfort they have found who have deserted this work of Reformation, whether in the one Kingdom or in the other. Thou thinkest, that thou will not hazard thy self for the honour of God: but God saith, he will not honour thee, to have heart or hand in his work, and thou shall run a greater hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note>There be two reasons secretly couched in the words to perswade and provoke unto this duty:<note place="margin">The first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> The one is from the knowledge of the greatnesse and majestie of God, the other from the conscience of common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie amongst men. Concerning the first: <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was a great King: for in the beginning of his letter, he is honored with the title of <hi>King of Kings,</hi> as having many mightie Princes under his power; And in the end of the letter, he hath power of confiscation of goods, imprisonment, banishment, and death: Yet he acknowledgeth one greater then the greatest whom he calleth <hi>the God of heaven,</hi> thereby to expresse his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, majestie, and glory, which made him to give forth this Decree, and by which he would move all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54059:16"/>
men to do diligently what he commandeth: For the knowledge and apprehension of the greatnesse and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of God, especially compared with our basenesse, is a powerfull mean, to move us to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and to go diligently about the affairs of his House. The Lord is great eminently and infinitely above the creature: he is the originall of all created greatnesse, and nothing can be conceived in him, which may be the least diminution of his greatnesse and Majestie. It is not so with men. When he is to give his Law to his people, he first manifesteth his greatnesse by his wonders in Aegypt, by bringing them miraculously through the Red sea, and by the Terrors of Mount Sinai, and then he beginneth,<note place="margin">Isa. 6.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Lord thy God that brought thee, &amp;c.</hi> When he speaketh to his Prophets, to make them diligent and faithfull, he useth this Preface: <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 46.1.</note> When he sendeth <hi>Isaiah</hi> with his message, he beginneth with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his glory: <hi>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his traine filled the Temple. &amp;c.</hi> When he will have men to tremble at his word, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, the heavens is my Throne, and the earth is my footstool.</hi> When he revealed himself to <hi>John</hi> his servant, he sheweth his greatnesse, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. and 7. If the greatest of the children of men did consider that he is higher then the highest, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.8. that in his hand is there breath, and all their wayes, as <hi>Daniel</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a great King that went before <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> Dan. 5.23. <hi>That in his fight when once he is angrie, no creature can stand.</hi> Psal. 76.7. They would not by any sin, and least of all by dealing deceitfully in the matters of his House, provoke him to anger. <hi>Wo unto him that stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54059:17"/>
with his Maker: Let the potsheard strive with the potsheards of the earth.</hi> Isa. 45.9. If either King or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or Assembly, could really in their hearts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this uncreated and infinite greatnesse, and could look upon God, as he is described, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Antient of dayes did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head as pure wooll, his Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery streame is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministred unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.</hi> They would choose rather to offend all the world, then to offend him in the smallest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his House: but the truth is, we put the Lord farre from us, and we see not him that is invisible. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse by the goodnesse of God a timeous and powerfull remedie be provided, the multitude of Sects and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will become ere it be long, the reproach of this Nation, yet it fears me that Atheisme and Atheists be more common, and abound more, then any Sect, or sort of Sectaries: For did men know or beleeve, that there is a God in heaven, who is God of heaven and earth, were it possible for them to live as they live, and to do what they do. Men become first Atheists in their life and conversation, living as a worme in a mans bellie, thinking no other wayes of man, but as ordained to be a place for it to live in, and of no other world but that wherein it lives: So do the Atheists of the world, wallow in their sins and sensualitie, never thinking of the Author or end of their life, that there is any other world, or that this world serveth for any other end but for their life. After they have lived as Atheists,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54059:17"/>
when they are constrained sometimes to think that there is a God, they become Atheists in their desire and affection, wishing that there were not a God to be avenged upon them for their wickednesse; and in end the Lord giveth them up to Atheisme in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion. <hi>As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.</hi> Rom. 1.28. Being stricken with his judgement, they have no serious thought of the House of God or his glory, but all their care is, about their own houses and honour; And ordinarily the Lord befools them in their deepest Policies, sweeping down their cob-webs, which they have been for a long time twisting, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their own wits a snare unto them, and turning the means which they did use for their standing and rising, to be the meanes of their fall and ruine.</p>
            <p>The other Reason is from common equity amongst men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2.</note> which was the ground of that Decree, <hi>Esth.</hi> 1.22.<note place="margin">Esth. 1.22.</note> 
               <hi>That everie man should beare rule in his own house.</hi> The Temple of Jerusalem was the House of God: and now under the Gospel the Church of Christ, is the House of the living God, where he hath promised his presence, his face is seen, and he is found of them that seek him: which therefore may be called, <hi>Surely God is in thee.</hi> Isa. 45.14.<note place="margin">Isa. 45.14.</note> And Jehovah Shammah, <hi>The Lord is there.</hi> Ezek. 48.35.<note place="margin">Ezek. 48.35.</note> And therefore the Lord should beare rule in his Church, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment ought to be obeyed. According to this ground hath the Lord given the precepts of his holy, just, and good Law: For if he be our God, what more equitable then that we have him and no other for our God, that he direct his own service and worship, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54059:18"/>
his Name be reverently used by us, that we observe the times wherein he will have us to appeare before him, and that we do duty to every one with whom we live under him.</p>
            <p>This consideration may be very usefull: For it may first serve to be a Cure of two great ills in this Land: One is of such as conceive that the Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to Christians; They may as well say, that Common and Naturall Equitie belongeth not to Christians. Is it not written in the heart of man by nature? Is it not confirmed by Jesus Christ? Is it not recommended to Christians by the Apostles? Is it not established by faith? Is not the observing of it, a testimonie of our communion with God? Is not the end of it, love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfained? Is it thankfulnesse to God, because we are delivered from the condemnation, coaction, and rigour of the Law, not to acknowledge the obligation of the Law? Shall not the domesticks of the house of God observe the Commandments of God, or shall they not be grieved when they transgresse and observe them not? It is too common an errour to turn the grace of God into wantonnesse. The other evill is on the other hand when men give themselves to will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: the one sort neglects the Commandments of God, the other addeth the commandments of men to the Commandments of God, which is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaketh of, a superfluous will-worship: of which there is too palpable an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and practise in this Kingdom at this time, in the observation of dayes. No Church or Kingdome on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54059:18"/>
earth, hath greater reason to take heed to it, then the Church and Kingdome of England. 1. Because the house and service of God, hath been pestered, beside a multitude of superstitious observations and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, with a greater number of dayes, then the Church of the Jews had in the time of their Ceremoniall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. 2. Because the Christian Sabbath or Lords day hath been profaned, and what hath been added to other dayes, hath been added with derogation to the Lords day: They have forsaken the fountain of living waters, and have digged unto themselves cisterns which hold no water. 3. Because God hath called this Land to mourning and fasting, as we professe this day, and I pray God that the unseasonable keeping of this festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, which God hath not commanded, be not more prevalent for evil, then the humiliation of this day for good; and yet the keeping of this day of humiliation in such a time of festivitie, is a presage that by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God upon the proceedings of the Honourable Houses of Parliament and Assembly, this superstition shall shortly expire, and that it is now at the last gaspe.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> It may teach us what reason the Lord of heaven hath to be angry when his Commandment is not obeyed in his own house. Kings will be obeyed in their kingdoms: Majors &amp; Magistrates in their Cities, every man in his own house: The Church of God is the Kingdom, the City, the House of God, which we must either deny, or resolve to have his will done.</p>
            <p>There is yet a third point to be considered:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The third part of the Text.</hi>
               </note> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of these two, or the inference, of the effect from the cause: <hi>For why should there be wrath, &amp;c.</hi> It is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in an interrogatory way to shew the necessitie of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54059:19"/>
the consequence; and that the wrath is certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, unlesse what is commanded be done: and to shew the foolishnesse and wickednesse of man in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon himself this wrath which by his obedience he might prevent, like unto that in the Prophet: <hi>Why will ye die O house of Israel. The prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself</hi>:<note place="margin">Pro. 22.3.</note>

I confesse it is a higher point of wisdom to have a care of Religion, that thereby our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves and others may be brought to spirituall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happinesse, and thereby to prevent everlasting wrath: yet even in relation to the blessings and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this present life, this kind of piety is the best policy. <hi>I will honour them that honour me,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>and those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</hi> Men may expect honour by dishonouring of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising of Religion, but the Word of the Lord abideth sure, and their honour shall be turned into shame. More particularly to this purpose and text, the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> speaketh.<note place="margin">Hag. 1.9, 10.</note> A heavie judgement was upon the people for the neglect of the worship and service of God: <hi>Why saith the Lord of hosts? because of mine House that is waste, and ye run every man into his own house; Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit,</hi> like unto that in Deut.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.23.</note> 
               <hi>The heaven that is over thy head shall be brasse, and the earth that is under thy feet shall be iron.</hi> But afterward he speaks comfortably:<note place="margin">Hag. 2.9.</note>
