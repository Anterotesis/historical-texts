            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE title of this Pſalme ſhewes the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Author of it: a Song of degrees, a Pſalme of <hi>David.</hi> The Pſalme it ſelfe is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory: <hi>Davids</hi> gratulation to and for the good eſtate of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Metropolitan City of his Kingdome. In which he firſt profeſſeth his joy for the preſent good eſtate thereof, and demonſtrates his care for the future. That which he rejoyceth at in the preſent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64627:3"/>
condition of it, is; firſt, the forwardneſſe of the people to Gods ſervice: ſecondly, the good eſtate of the City, which was built as a City united, made <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> of <hi>Iebus</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the Fort of the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> being ſubdued by <hi>David,</hi> and by building united into one City, now at peace; in which alſo Religion was ſet up, yea the ſtaple of Religion; for thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tribes went to worſhip; and Juſtice alſo, yea the royall ſeats of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The demonſtration of care for the good of that City here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, hath in it two branches. The Kings incitation to all his Subjects to pray for the peace of it; and he ſets them downe a forme of praye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: the holy Ghoſt knowes well enough how to pray in a ſet forme. The ſecond thing is his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as it were his <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Kings great Charter, for the good of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the words now read. A great Charter, but in few words, which yet are maſſie and weighty, containing the Kings grant in the word of a Prince to gratifie <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in two things. Firſt, to uſe her kindely: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to procure her wealth. To both which he addeth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we ſhall ſee in their places.</p>
            <p>The promiſe of kinde and gracious uſage is not ſo plaine in the words of our tranſlation, as in the originall; for where the tranſlation ſaith, <hi>I will wiſh thee proſperity,</hi> the originall ſaith, <hi>I will ſpeake peace.</hi> A ſpeech that every where as well as here, ſignifies all kinde uſage, under one ſpeciall kinde of it, that is good words. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.3. where <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of ſome that ſpeake peace to their neighbours, but malice is in their hearts, they ſpeake friendly. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. God will ſpeake peace unto his people; that is, will uſe them graciouſly. And in <hi>Hester</hi> 10.3. it is ſaid of <hi>Mordecay,</hi> he ſpake peaceably, ſaith the tranſlation (peace, ſaith the originall) to all his ſeed.</p>
            <p>Whereby it may appeare that the firſt parcell of the Kings grant, is to uſe his people graciouſly, to ſpeake peace unto them. In which parcell (if we marke it) be foure points. Firſt, what he will doe; <hi>I will ſpeake peace.</hi> Secondly, to whom, <hi>to thee,</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Thirdly, for what reſpect, <hi>for my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64627:3"/>
and companions ſake.</hi> Fourthly, when? <hi>now:</hi> but that when is indeed <hi>why,</hi> as we ſhall after heare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching the thing what we learne in <hi>Davids</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Firſt, that it is the office and care of good Princes to ſpeak peace unto their people. They are Fathers, a title as of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo of love, to teach them to uſe their Subjects as children. They are Maſters, but ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to Maſters, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Know, that even your Master alſo is in heaven.</hi> The greateſt Kings are ſervants to the great King of Kings; let them uſe their ſervants as they would be uſed of their Maſter graciouſly. To this end, becauſe the diſeaſe of Princes oftentimes is the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of heart, and to dye upon ſuch ſwellings, it pleaſed God in the 17. of <hi>Deutrinomy</hi> both to reſtraine them from windy and ſwelling meats, forbidding ſuch multitude of Chariots and horſes as might lift up their hearts above their brethren, ſo as to make them forget that they are men and rule over men: and alſo to give them a dyet, the Booke of God to meditate upon, which is able to moderate and temper the heart of any Prince; without which no Kings heart, no mans heart can be good as it ought. Secondly, now as it is a duty of Princes to ſpeake peace, ſo it is an ornament unto them. Curteſie is a Chriſtian vertue, commended to all men in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> That which is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie in a Subject, is graciouſneſſe in a Prince: a vertue of the ſame kinde, onely advanced to an higher place by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the perſon. And it is an ornament that becomes none ſo well as Princes, the images of the gracious God, whoſe Deputies they are, whoſe titles they beare. It was truly ſaid of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that in two things ſpecially we imitate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, truth and goodneſſe. A Prince faithfull of his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gracious to his people, is a goodly image of God. We ſee that in greater Maps things are expreſſed more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then can be in the ſmaller (though they be drawne by one skill) ſo in the greateſt perſonages this ornament is faireſt, when they that of all others have the beſt: warrant to ſpeake roughly, ſhall ſpeake peace. Thirdly, and as it is a duty and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64627:4"/>
an ornament, ſo is it a bond, and one of the beſt that Princes have to obliedge the hearts of their ſubjects unto them. It is therefore noted of <hi>Mordecay</hi> as the ground of his acceptance among the multitude of his brethren, that he did theſe two things (which the King here promiſeth in his Charter) <hi>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the wealth of his people, and ſpake peace unto all his ſeed.</hi> The ſtrength of this courſe, to melt the heart of the Subjects, appeares in <hi>David</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. who underſtanding the minde of the ten Tribes to fetch him home againe, takes the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, and ſends to the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> this meſſage, <hi>Why are you behinde to bring the King againe to his houſe? ye are my brethren, my bones and my fleſh are ye, wherefore then are ye the laſt that bring the King againe?</hi> And to <hi>Amaſa</hi> this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, <hi>God doe ſo to me and more alſo, if thou be not Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the hoste to me for ever:</hi> to lead the Army for him, that had led it againſt him; what was the effect? He bowed the hearts of the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as one man, ſaith the text. Such ſtrength hath the gracious uſage of a Soveraigne in the hearts of good Subjects. Againe, <hi>Ioab</hi> knew well what ſtrength was in the Kings good ſpeeches, who (finding the King ſo wounded for <hi>Abſolon,</hi> that he retired himſelfe, as if he had loſt a Kingdome that very day, in which the Kingdome was recovered, ſo as the people alſo ſtole away, as men that had loſt the battell) comes to the King (and after other expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rougher then became a ſubject to his Soveraigne, yet wholeſome for that time) <hi>come out,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſpeake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably unto thy ſervants, for I ſweare by the Lord, except thou come out, there will not tarry one man with thee this night, &amp;c.</hi> Nor hath the holy Scripture alone this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but even among the heathen (that it might appeare a truth which nature is not ignorant of) we finde it ſtill obſerved and recorded as a meanes that drew the hearts of the people to their Princes. Thus <hi>Suetonius</hi> notes of <hi>Titus,</hi> that he had that of nature or of fortune, good luck, as we ſay, to win eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans good will: and among many things, reports this one gracious ſpeech of his, that no man ſhould goe away ſad from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64627:4"/>
ſpeeeh with a Prince. The like of <hi>Augustus,</hi> as the meanes that ſetled him in the hearts of the people, and by name this one obſervation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when a poore man offered him a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion trembling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he encouraged him, and ſaid, Petitions ſhould not be given to a Prince as meat to an Elephant, that one is afraid of. The like of <hi>Traian. Antoninus,</hi> and others is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which I forbeare to recite. All ſhewing, that it was obſerved as a meanes of gaining the affections of the people, to ſpeake peace unto them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and on the contrary, to doe otherwiſe is not ſafe, neither at the entrance, nor when a Prince is ſetled. For the entrance, <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is a witneſſe, who being a yong King fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed yong mens counſell (indeed yong counſell though old men had given it) and as they bad him, told the people, <hi>his Father had ſcourged them with rods, but he would beat them with ſcorpions</hi> (that is, ſay ſome, with whips which have wires in the laſhes ends, to make them bite where they goe) his little finger ſhould be heavier then his Fathers loynes. The old men had given him better counſell, To ſerve the people that day, and give them good words, and the people would be his ſervants for ever. But this good counſell would not downe with the yong King; What was the end of it? Why, when the people ſaw that they were not regarded, they left him, and bad the houſe of <hi>David</hi> looke to it ſelfe. Thus for want of ſpeaking peace, he put himſelfe out of the greateſt part of his Kingdome. And for an eſtabliſhed State, we have a ſtory of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that after he was growne great and ſtrong in his State, yet his very ſpeeches gave occaſion of diſtaſte, and conſpiracy againſt him; as by name, that he ſaid, the Senate (for that I thinke is meant by Reſpublica) was but a name onely. This was a meane of looſing their hearts, and his owne greatneſſe; however God plagued thoſe that conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: as take this for a generall rule, God never ſpares thoſe that riſe up againſt Princes, how evill ſo ever they be. Finally, for this purpoſe <hi>Comines</hi> hath a grave diſcourſe in his fifth booke out of his owne obſervations; I would I could
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64627:5"/>
ſpeake it in his owne words, he ſpeakes it ſo well, I will goe as neere it as I can: he tels what is the miſfortun of a Prince, It is not (ſaith he) to take a fall off a horſe, or to be ſmitten with a ſharpe ague, that is no misfortune to a Prince; What is it then? When God will not ſuffer him to reigne (that is a misfortune indeed) but what be the prognoſticates of it? Firſt, ſaith he, God ſmites him in his wits which is a great blow, he meanes not ſurely in his ſences, but in his judgement; then he ſets diviſion in his houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (ſaith he) the Prince is ſo farre in Gods diſgrace, that he flyeth the company of the wiſe, and advanceth fooles, oppreſſours, and flatterers, and ſuch as ſooth him in all his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. If he take a penny, they bid him take two; if he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with a man, they bid hang him. Further, they give him counſell in any wiſe to cauſe himſelfe to be feared; and they alſo behave themſelves cruelly and proudly, as though autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were their inheritance &amp;c. This was that wiſe mans ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which I have repeated (as I thinke) very neere in his owne words, to ſhew how Princes looſe the hearts of their Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they grow perſwaded not to uſe them graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. So then, whether duty, or ornament, ſafety or danger be reſpected, it appeares that <hi>David</hi> had good cauſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and all good Princes to performe, gracious behaviour, towards their Subjects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have heard what he promiſed: now let us heare to whom. <hi>To thee,</hi> ſaith he, that is, to all his people; of which (as was ſaid) <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was an abridgement. To ſhew favour to ſome, hath bin in thoſe that were worſt noted. <hi>Nero</hi> had his favorites, not worthy to be named. <hi>Galbo</hi> had his three Paedagogues, beſides <hi>Vimius</hi> the Broker, that prevailed with <hi>Galba</hi> as gold did with himſelfe in any thing: and ſo others. But this is the princely goodneſſe of Chriſtian Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be good to all their good Subjects. All are their ſubjects, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould have the ſun-ſhine of their ſoveraignty: all are their brethren and companions as we ſhall after heare: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in ſcot and lot (as we ſay) I meane in every burthen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64627:5"/>
of their troubles; and therefore ſhould have ſo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e portion in the common comfort of their favours. And indeed this is Kingly graciouſneſſe, to be gracious to all their good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to doe good to all; like the Sunne that ſhines to all like Chriſt that did good whereſoever he became. There is nothing more grievous to the Subjects then incloſure of Commons, or overlaying them when great men over-charge them ſo, that poore men can make no uſe of them for their reliefe: I ſay there is nothing more grievous, unleſſe it be Monopolies, and I cannot tell which of them is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but there is no incloſure of Commons or Monopolies ſo grievous as the incloſure and ingroſſing of a Kings favours, or to make a Monopoly of a King. What then, would we have the favour of Princes ſo common to all, that it ſhould not ſpecially abound unto ſome? God forbid: for as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits in the body goe to the leaſt member, yea to the fingers end, yet are moſt plentifully beſtowed where nature hath the greateſt imployment of them. So it is fit that the favours of Princes lying open as a common to all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in their proportions, ſhould be ſpecially placed on men of chiefeſt uſe and deſert.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſee What, and to Whom, let us now ſee upon what reſpect. <hi>I will ſpeake peace to thee; Sed quare?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Augustin) Non propter honores meos, non propter pecuniam meam, non propter vi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am meam:</hi> Not for mine honours, not for my treaſure, not for my life; but <hi>for my brethren and neighbours ſake<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> For thine owne ſake I will ſpeake peace unto thee. And indeed this is true love; for love (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſeekes not her owne things. And this is trve graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and like the goodneſſe of God himſelfe, who is good to us for his owne goodneſſe ſake, and for our good, not for his: He gaines not ſurely by any match at our hands. <hi>For my brethren and companions ſake.</hi> Theſe very words have weight, and carry a ſecret reaſon of that reſpect for which he will ſpeake peace unto them. They are brethren, not of the ſame wombe, but of the ſame nature in common: Brethren
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64627:6"/>
by the mothers ſide, the common mother. Companions (for ſo the word ſignifies) not in the Court, but in the ſame Countrey; companions in the houſe of God, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and in that reſpect brethren by the fathers ſide; partners of that honour, which all good Princes take to be (and is) their greateſt honour, that they are the children of God. Brethren in nature a thing which as no Prince will deny, ſo none need be aſhamed of, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe, though he were the ſonne of God, and thought it no robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be equall with God, yet in reſpect of the partnerſhip in the fleſh, was not aſhamed to be called a brother, and to call us brethren, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith. This conſideration is a great motive; it was ſo to <hi>Iob,</hi> he durſt not contemne the judgement of his ſervants, no not of his maid, when they contended with him. For (ſaith he) what ſhall I then doe when God ſtandeth up, and when he ſhall viſit me, What ſhall I anſwer? Why ſo? He that made me in the wombe, hath he not made him? that is in effect, is he not my brother? It yeelds a gracious meditation for Chriſtian Princes; as to thinke in time of famine, theſe that dye as ſtarved, they are not dogs, they are my brethren: in the time of Peſtilence, this is not a murren of cattell, they are my brethren that thus periſh: in the oppreſſion of a poore man, this is not an horſe overloaden (which yet a man ſhould pitie, though it were his enemies horſe) this is my poore brother, whom God made, whom Chriſt dyed for. So in their lawfull ſuits and cries, theſe are not the cries of other creatures, nor of ſtrangers, but of my brethren: How will my Father take it at my hands if I the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe not my yonger brethren graciouſly?</p>
            <p>So we ſee in the Kings Grant, what, to whom, and for what reſpect he promiſeth. Of all which, the Vſe is firſt unto Princes, then unto their ſervants about them, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all their Subjects. As touching to uſe to the Lords anointed, having dreſſed theſe things with ſo homely cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it will not become me to be a carver alſo to my ſoveraign
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64627:6"/>
Lord; but humbly, and in the feare of God doe beſeech your Majeſty, to give me leave to apply this unto you in <hi>Pauls</hi> words to <hi>Timothy, Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things</hi>: yea humbly beſeech your Majeſty to know your ſelfe, and your owne moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, of which every man reporteth that ſpeaketh with you in private, and ſtill to uſe it, and to ſpeake graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to your loving Subjects. And for the reſt, it remaines alſo, that your Majeſty hunt away two beaſts, the tame beaſt and the wilde, the flatterer and the falſe informer, which ſhall attempt to ſet off your ſweet affections from any of your loving Subjects.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Vſe is to the ſervants that attend about the Kings perſon, and to them it is a word of Admonition, that ſeeing it is the office and duty of a King, and the deſire and diſpoſition of our gracious King to ſpeake peace unto his people, they would take heed of doing any evill office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and his good Subjects, by applying unwiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſticks to the ſinewes: for if it be a curſed thing to ſet diviſion betweene brethren, what is it betweene the Father and the children? Aſſuredly to alienate, by any meanes, the heart of the Prince from the people, or of the people from the Prince, is a worke for the Divell, and not for any of the Kings good ſervants.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, to us all, it is a word of incitation, that we ſhould know what to be thankfull unto God for, that have a gracious Prince to ſpeake unto us; and alſo to pray, that God would ever ſo diſpoſe of the Kings heart unto his people and all his people unto him againe, that as he came unto us with the greateſt applauſe that ever Prince entred with all, ſo he may continue with the greateſt acceptance that ever Prince had, and may make us but one onely mourning day, that is, the day of ſeparation, like the mourning for good <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> for whom all Iſrael lamented when he dyed. And ſecondly, how to beare our ſelves as loyall and dutifull Subjects, with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Lords anointed, that we may be worthy of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64627:7"/>
gracious uſage. And if perhaps ſomething fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let us remember that of <hi>Salomon, If the ſpirit of him that ruleth riſe up againſt thee, goe not out of thy place, take not the ſturdy.</hi> Conſider thy ſelfe if thou be a Maſter, how thou uſedſts thy ſervants; if a Father, how thou art ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſionate to thine owne children: and then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Princes have greater provocations, greater power. And if there be ſomething in them which may not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, yet the reverence and duty of Subjects is to hide it, going backward.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the firſt part of this Charter. Now come we to the other; wherein he ſaith, <hi>I will procure thy wealth.</hi> The word ſignifies to ſeeke, but with all endeavours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and therefore is well tranſlated, <hi>procure</hi>; that is, <hi>I will doe thee good.</hi> Indeed it is a gracious thing to ſpeake peace unto them, but more gracious to doe them good. We ſay in an homely proverbe, Better meat without ſauce, then ſauce without meat; yet (no doubt) two good things together are beſt. A childe that is hungry may be ſtilled a while with dandling and ſinging, but it muſt have the breſt, or elſe it will not be contented long, Good and gracious words pleaſe well, but good deeds, doing juſtice, ſeeking the common good, is that which gives the chiefe content unto the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But why, ſaith he, <hi>I will procure</hi>? had he not done it? yes undoubtedly, but he will doe it ſtill, he will doe it more: as he had alſo ſpoken peace unto them before, but will ſpeake it ſtill unto them. God hath given Princes ſuch power and meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhould, and might be continuall fountaines of goodneſſe unto the people. But let us conſider now more particularly this part of the Kings promiſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firſt, What he would doe: and ſecondly, Why.</p>
            <p>The thing, What, hath in it two branches. Firſt, the very object of his care; that is, their good. Secondly, the manner of procuring it, noted in the word of ſeeking: which is a word of ſtrong ſignification, and importeth all diligence and induſtry in ſeeking their good. For the former, let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64627:7"/>
that the good of the Subjects is the charge of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For to this end hath God ordained them, witneſſe the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. He is the Miniſter of God for thy wealth, for thy good; if then doe well, for thy comfort, if thou doe ill, for thy terrour, and yet therein for thy good: for it is as good for ſome to be terrified, as for others to be comforted. and indeed this is the proper greatneſſe of Kings and Princes, that God hath made them the great inſtruments of common good. As if no bleſſing could be paſſed to his people but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great ſeale of their office. A wonderfull honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: For even as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in Aegypt was ſet over the corn, ſo as he might have relieved, or ſtarved, not the Egyptians onely, but the Countries of the World neere unto it, in the time of famine; and this <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was there for the ſecond man in the Kingdome. So Princes are the ſecond to God himſelfe, in that God hath put into their hands to doe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall good unto their people. A goodly honour, which as it doth require great reſidence upon ſo great a charge; ſo may it much encourage Chriſtian Princes to doe their office, the benefit whereof is ſo univerſall. And if it might pleaſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſometimes to looke about them, and when they ſhall ſee a poore man labouring and toyling all day as a ſervant in baſe worke, and all for the backe and belly, or (perhaps) for a few poore children at home that cry for bread; and then to think, good Lord, how this man toyles, and all his worke is but for himſelfe, where I labour not as a ſervant, but as a Lord, in workes not baſe, but honourable; and not onely have the good of it to my ſelfe, but am an univerſall good as a bleſſing ſent of God to the whole Land. Such a meditation ſhall greatly encourage them to ſeeke the good of their people. I will ſeeke, ſaith he, that is uſe all diligence and endeavour. If Princes ſeeke not the good of their Subjects, it will not be found. Great things will not be done without great labour; if they ſeeke not, things will be other wayes done then they would, and (which is the miſchiefe) other mens faults will be ſcored upon their accounts. It is ſaid of <hi>Galba,</hi> that many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64627:8"/>
things paſſed under his name, of which he was innocent; yet becauſe he permitted them whom he ought to have brideled, or was ignorant of that which he ought to have knowne, he loſt reputation, and opened the way to his owne overthrow. The fault was other mens, the blame his. If they ſeeke not, they may be abuſed by ſuch as I ſpake of before, Flatterers and Miſinformers, ſuch as will alwayes be about Princes to caſt ſhadowes, and ſtand in the light of their beſt Subjects: as <hi>Ziba</hi> did to <hi>Mephiboſheth:</hi> unleſſe Princes be wiſe, as an Angell of God to finde out the hand of <hi>Ioab</hi> in the diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the woman of <hi>Tekoah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We have heard now what he will doe, He will ſeeke their good: but let us alſo conſider, Why: <hi>For the houſe of the Lord.</hi> What is that? The Tabernacle, the Temple being not built as yet. But how was that Gods houſe? doth the Lord dwell in houſes made of hands? or could he be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Tent, that filleth heaven and earth? Surely no; but becauſe he did there reveale himſelfe by Sacramentall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations; as Princes ſometimes marry by their pictures, he is ſaid to dwell there, and that to be his houſe. The thing is, becauſe of Gods true worſhip and ſervice, he will ſeeke their good. Where (I beſeech you) that it may be marked, that this ſhould be the ſpeciall end of procuring the wealth of the people, for <hi>the houſe of the Lord,</hi> for the religion ſake, and the true worſhip of God. Indeed this is the ſpeciall thing, to know God, and feare God aright. And if Princes provide not this for their Subjects, peace and traffique, and ſuch like, makes no better proviſion for them, then is made for oxen in good paſture, nay not ſo good; for an oxe therein hath all he needs, but a man without this, is left unprovided in the farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, even in his ſoule. And as Princes without this care provide not well for their people, ſo they provide but ill for themſelves; for they can have no certaine aſſurance of their Subjects without it. The great bond of Allegiance is an oath of the Lord. What if a profeſſed Atheiſt take an oath, is hee bound? He is not <hi>ſui iuris.</hi> What if he that is an Atheiſt in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64627:8"/>
effect take an oath, one (I meane) that denies the power of godlineſſe, that hath a diſpenſatory conſcience and will make licences to his conſcience, as Roagues doe to themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hedges? What if a man be a Papiſt, that beleeves (as he is bound by their rules to doe) that the Pope hath power at his pleaſure, to diſpence with an oath, and to diſſolve any bonds; hath the Prince any aſſurance of ſuch a Subject, which hath his dependency upon the pleaſure of a foraigne power? It is true then that nothing can caſt a ſure knot upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Subject, but the true knowledge and feare of God. So as when Princes doe advance the good of Gods houſe they eſtabliſh the good of their owne all in one. I adde further in this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is to be obſerved in all the Kings of Iſrael and Iudah, that their Stories begin with this obſervation (as with a thing firſt worthy to be Chronicled) how they dealt in matters of Religion. Such a King, and ſuch a King, and what did he? He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord. And ſuch a King, he walked in the wayes of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> which made Iſrael to ſinne. I ſpare to cite places, but it is the generall obſervation of thoſe Bookes of Kings and Chronicles, as they that read them know; yea farther it may be marked, that as generally, when Princes have forgotten to ſeeke the good of their Subjects, to which they were ordained of God, God hath ſurely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued them himſelfe; perhaps ſo much the more ſeverely, becauſe none may doe it but he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he will doe it throughly when he takes it in hand. So yet ſpecially hath God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Princes, and even povred contempt upon them, when they have contemned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or forſaken the houſe of the Lord. Of this the Scripture gives us examples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well in ſuch as never advanced the houſe of God, as in thoſe that fell off, in part or in whole. As we may ſee in the ſtories of <hi>Iehoram, Iehoas</hi> and even of <hi>Salomon,</hi> whoſe fal I cannot name without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, to thinke that ſuch a man ſo wiſe, that had ſpoken with God twice (as it were familiarly) I meane by viſion, ſhould in his old dayes be ſeduced, and fall to ſet up groſe idolatry.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64627:9"/>
As for <hi>Iehoram,</hi> he refuſed the houſe of the Lord; God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him up adverſaries, and after ſmote him with a diſeaſe in his bowels, of which he died miſerably, and when he was dead, his people made no mourning for him as for other Kings: ſo he was neither happy living, nor honoured dead, becauſe he ſought not the good of his people for the houſe of the Lord. <hi>Iehoas</hi> alſo did well as long as <hi>Jehoida</hi> his good Councellour lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when <hi>Jehoida</hi> dyed, the Kings good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dyed with him. Then the Princes came to the King and ſpake reverently to him, and compaſſe him with good words as with a net (for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that flattereth a man, ſpreads a net for his ſteps;)</hi> he yeelds, and forſakes the houſe of the Lord. But what became of it? Firſt, the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> came and with a ſmall band they overthrew a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ſlew the Princes that had miſled the King, and left the King himſelfe in great diſeaſes; ſo that he was ſpared to live longer, to be (as it were) but longer in dying; and yet at laſt his owne ſervants ſlew him: and when he was dead, they buried him not in the ſepulcher of the Kings, as not thinking him worthy of a Kings ſepulcher, that had not done a Kings office for the houſe of the Lord. I might ſpeake of others and all to ſhew that God hath ſpecially humbled Princes, when they have forſaken or impugned his true worſhip; doing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions upon them on as high a ſtage, as they played their parts on; that their puniſhment, as their faults, might be of ſpeciall height and note.</p>
            <p>I will adde one obſervation more, that through neglect of this care of Religion, the power of Chriſtian Princes was loſt; and while they put off to the Prelates all the care of the houſe of God, God alſo caſt from them their authority, and made them vaſſals. So they loſt their greatneſſe, and the Clergy found it, and it hurt them both. It is (as I remember) a note of <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of <hi>Adrian</hi> the third, that after they had fully ingroſſed the Emperiall power, there was never ſince Emperour of ſtrength, or Pope of vertue: ſo they loſt both by it. And indeed, as the blood if it fall any way out of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64627:9"/>
veines too much, there is ſome danger, but if it fall into the body <hi>extra vaſa,</hi> there is more danger, for there it will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and putrifie: ſo was it with the ſupreame authority of Princes, when they ſuffered it to fall unto the Clergy (as it were) <hi>extra vaſa.</hi> And here I deſire to informe a miſtery, a miſtery of iniquity, to ſhew how from the authority uſurped in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes claime is made to the whole power of Princes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith in his fift Booke of the Roman Biſhop, a fourth and ſixt Chapters, that the Pope hath nothing to doe with temporalties of Kings, properly (nay his word is directly, but he hath it indirect, indirectly (as true as may be indirectly indeed). As how? He may not (ſaith he) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes ſimply as a Lord, but for the ſafety of ſoules, for the good of the Church: ſo from the care of the Church they challenge power over Princes. Good cauſe have Princes then to maintaine their ſupremacy in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and to be jealous of that title, as alſo to uſe that power for the good of the houſe of the Lord, leſt if they caſt away one moity, God caſt away the other.</p>
            <p>And here may come in that laſt branch of the firſt part, which through haſte I forgot which I deſire might be of uſe, though it come ſomewhat out of the proper place; I meane that time, that <hi>Now,</hi> of which he ſaid, I <hi>will ſpeake peace.</hi> Why now? ment he that he would doe it out of hand, and keepe the word of a Prince, which is to them as great a band as an oath of the ſubjects? Nay, but by this note of time (<hi>Now</hi>) as <hi>Illericus</hi> well obſerves in his <hi>Clavis Scriptura,</hi> not ſo much the time, as the circumſtance of the time is often noted. And ſo it carrieth a reaſon why he would now ſpeake peace unto them; yea, and (as I thinke) why he would now procure their good, for the houſe of God ſake. For I ſee not but that it may be referred to the whole Grant, <hi>I will now ſpeake peace unto thee, I will now procure thy wealth.</hi> But why <hi>Now</hi>? Becauſe the people were ſo forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and came thus to the houſe of God, and ſaid, <hi>Our feet ſhall ſtand in thy gates, O Jeruſalem.</hi> Therefore in this float of good affections in the Subjects, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64627:10"/>
Kings heart is inlarged, and he promiſeth now to ſpeak peace, and now to ſeeke their good.</p>
            <p>Wherein it is good to conſider, that when God diſpoſeth the hearts of the people to goodneſſe, to Religion, Princes ſhould ſpecially cheriſh them and incourage them. It is noted of <hi>David</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. that when the people offered wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, the King rejoyced. Of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> alſo in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. when he drew the people to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, and they came and offered, that the King rejoyced that God had made the people ſo ready; for the thing was done ſodainly. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed then to uſe them graciouſly, and then to ſeeke their good for the houſe of Gods ſake; when God hath beſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their hearts, is a ſpeciall meanes to cheriſh goodneſſe it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is the crowne of the benefit. We read of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> (that Chriſtian King of Kent) that he would compell none to Religion, but he drew religious men about him, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced them, and by that meanes increaſed them innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And ſurely this is a worthy courſe to advance godlineſſe and vertue, as ſtrong as any compulſary meanes. Becauſe, <hi>every man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) ſeekes the face of the Ruler,</hi> which if no man could finde but in the way of godlineſſe and honeſty, none would ſeeke to finde in the way of vice and flattery. To this circumſtance I adde, that as by the courſe of the Moone, there be ſpring-tides at the change, and at the full: ſo at the change, if any man will change a falſe religion for the truth; and at the full, if any man be growne to a full meaſure, ſuch as we attaine in this poore life; I meane, if any man be well thriven in goodneſſe it is ſit that ſpring-tides of favour ſhould ſlow unto ſuch.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to the conſideration of the houſe of God, for which he will ſeeke their good. The very words car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their weight, and ſhew why he ſhould ſpecially ſeeke their good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the houſe of Gods ſake, and the good of the houſe of God: It is the houſe of the Lord of <hi>Jehovah</hi>; Should not that be cared for? there is care of proviſion for the Kings houſe, and good cauſe there ſhould be ſo, and he is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64627:10"/>
to be the ſubject of a good Prince that ſhould grudge it. Now ſhould there not be care for the proviſion of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods houſe? He addes, <hi>our God</hi>; that is, his God, and their God. He muſt needs ſeek their good for the houſe ſake of that God which was their God. One God to both, one houſe of God to both, <hi>chara pignora:</hi> one God, one faith, one baptiſme, one religion, the ſweeteſt bands. And aſſuredly, whoſoever ſhould goe about to ſet up ſeverall Religions, ſhould alſo goe about to ſever the Prince and the people.</p>
            <p>Thus have I bin bold this day, but it is before the Lord and before his anointed. Now for the Vſe which belongeth unto my deare Soveraigne; I humbly beſeech your Majeſty (and ſpeake it with a kneeling heart, as becometh me, and in the feare of God) to ſtirre up your owne moſt noble ſpirit, and to ſet your heart to ſeeke the good of your people, for the houſe of God. God gave you as this day to be borne, for the good (I am perſwaded) of all Chriſtendome. God hath brought you to this goodly Kingdome, and eſtabliſhed you in it, with wonderfull peace and acceptance: God hath given you goodly knowledge, and it appeares in publique how able you are, to teach all the duties of all Kings. Now I beſeech your Majeſty remember what great things God hath done for you, and anſwer him in goodneſſe, and ſet your heart (as I know you doe) to ſeeke the good of his people, and ſpecially of the houſe of God: and be aſſured, that ſo long as you ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and advance the houſe of God, God will eſtabliſh your houſe, and your poſterity, ſo long as they ſhall uphold the Lords true ſervice, or elſe (aſſuredly) this Word of God hath no truth in it.</p>
            <p>Now for the houſe of God, that which is to be done, is, firſt to repaire it well; and then to keepe it ſo. The repaire requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth two things: firſt, that the people be built up in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. I thinke the Kings Majeſty knoweth it not (would God he did know it) that there be very many of his poore ſubjects wonderfull ignorant: the people in many places are naked, and <hi>Aaron</hi> hath made them naked, I meane the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry:

a naked Miniſtry hath made a naked people: the Lord helpe them and incline the Kings gracious heart to pity them. The other thing for the repair of the houſe of God is that the inſide of the Lords houſe the gold of the Temple be looked to; I meane, that with knowledge there be joyned the power and practice of religion in a good converſation. And herein beſeech the Kings Majeſty to give leave unto his poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to informe him that, which perhaps he knoweth not, that (from the occaſion which ſome fooliſh, turbulent and proud ſpirits, ſpirits of ſeparation have given) there is a name of common ſcorne caſt upon every man, that ſetteth his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the practice of true godlineſſe: Wherein, I beſeech your Majeſty to conſider, if the life and ſoule of Religion be let out, what will become of the body of it? will it not fall and grow ugly and rot? and become a ſhame unto it ſelfe? Now as the things are to be looked to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the repaire of the houſe of God; ſo to keepe it in a good repaire, two other things are to be cared for. Firſt that the common enemy may be ſuppreſſed: It was a noble ſpeech (and bleſſed be God that put it into the Kings royall heart) to ſay, He would ſhed the laſt drop of his blood, rather then tolerate another Religion. But the Lord will not ſuffer one drop of that precious blood to be ſhed, that is prepared to be ſhed for him. The other thing, is to eſtabliſh peace in the Church it ſelfe. A worthy worke, and fit for a King. It is true, and all men know it, that while we have ſtriven which way to entertaine Chriſt beſt, as the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and the ten Tribes did, about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, home of <hi>David</hi> their King, <hi>Shebah</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hri</hi> hath wickedly blowne the trumpet of ſeperation, and much hurt hath come in the Church of God, by our unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and unfruitfull contentions, for which godly men have beene much grieved: the diviſion of <hi>Ruben</hi> were great thoughts of heart. But now (thanked be God) the hearts of men are more moderate, and diſpoſed to peace, that a very little thing, a ſmall matter (as I am perſwaded) would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this Church of God in ſo good tearmes of peace, as it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64627:11"/>
never ſaw. In which reſpect, I am bold to ſpeake unto your Majeſty, but I ſpeake unto a moſt gracious King, and to a wiſe King that can tell how to pardon things ſomewhat foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly ſpoken, when they are ſpoken from a well meaning heart. I could ſpeake it upon my knees, if the place would beare it, but my ſoule ſhall kneele before my Soveraine: I beſeech your Majeſty, take unto your ſelfe that Princely worke to ſtrike through a peace in this Church of God; I will not direct, but pray leave to tell a ſtory; It is reported of <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour, that ſupping with one <hi>Pollio,</hi> he was informed that a ſervant of <hi>Pollios</hi> had broken a chriſtall glaſſe of his Maſters; a foule fault if he had done it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if negligently a fault: but for this the poore ſervant was adjudged to be cut in peeces, and caſt to the fiſhes: a marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſore ſentence for ſuch a fault. The Emperour reverſed the ſentence, and thought it puniſhment enough to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have bin in feare of ſuch a puniſhment; and after breakes all the glaſſes, that they might not be occaſion of like rigorous ſentence afterwards. I will not apply it, but do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech your Majeſty to uſe your owne moſt godly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now to make peace in the Church, when ſo ſmall a thing will doe it: that ſo the Biſhops may love the poore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as brethren and Miniſters reverence the Biſhops as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Lord, as <hi>Hierom</hi> adviſeth, and every honeſt man wiſheth they ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Vſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to his Majeſties ſervants and attendants; to whom I may ſpeake more freely, but yet with reverence (and as becometh me) to beſeech them, that (ſeeing it is the office and deſire of the King to ſeeke the good of his people, and ſpecially of the houſe of the Lord) they doe their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervice herein to the King and take heed that they hinder not any of his godly purpoſes towards his people, or the houſe of God: <hi>Curſe ye Mero<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64627:12"/>
ſubject to a curſe that came not out to helpe, what ſhall ſuch be, as come out to reſiſt, to hinder.</p>
            <p>The laſt Vſe is to us all, the Kings loyall ſubjects, to ſtirre us up to be thankfull to God that hath given us a King that ſeekes our good and the good of Gods houſe, and that we ſtrive to walke worthy of ſuch a bleſſing, in all loyalty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. And if any man be otherwiſe minded, let the Lords hand finde him out; yea ſurely, it will finde him out, and make him an example. And ſecondly, this ſhould admoniſh us, to ſerve God and pleaſe him, that ſo we loſe not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a good King; which the people ſometimes doe for their owne wickedneſſe: as we read in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. The high places were not taken away in good <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> time (who was a godly Prince) becauſe the peoples hearts were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the God of their Fathers.

            <p>MOſt humbly giving thanks unto your Honors, for ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious uſage of me at my late convention before you, I now preſent unto you the copy of my Sermon, preached before his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty. To ſay that there is no word added, abated or altered, were a ſpeech not credible of a Sermon penned ſince, and not before the preaching of it. But this J profeſſe, before the God of truth, unto your Honours, J know not where J have varied from my ſelfe in matter or manner of ſpeaking, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of one word. And therefore, as in the preaching (through a ſlip of memory) J loſt one whole branch of the firſt part, out of the proper place; and recovering it afterward, did inſert it in a place not ſo fit; ſo have J willingly miſplaced it now, as then unwillingly: yea, for ſome allegations, wherein J miſſed ſome words of the Author, which J could now by the Authors have ſupplied, J have choſen rather to ſhew the then failing of memory, then now to faile in that (which is a point of honesty) a juſt report of my ſpeech, as J remember it, aecording to my promiſe to your Honours.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, J doe (upon my knees) beſeech your Lordſhips,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64627:13"/>
to lay the whole together, before you cenſure the parts of it; and to conſider the generall doctrines respectively to his Majesty, by mine owne particular applications to his royall perſon. As touching the to ſparing acknowledgement of his Majesties Princely graces, and the unspeakable good we have by him, I humbly pray your Lordſhips to beleeve, and I take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that I failed mine owne purpoſes therein: a fault in a ſpeech unſet, to one not acquainted with ſuch a preſence, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the time, much more eaſie to commit it then excuſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as needfull to acknowledge to the full what we have received, as to incite unto that which is to be continued, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; leſt we ſeeme captious rather, then zealous, of ſmall things ſtudious, of greater unthankefull.</p>
            <p>Farther, my moſt Honourable good Lords, perceiving his Majesty, out of his apprehenſive depth, to be jealous of ſome ſecret purpoſes in me, to aime undutifull intentions to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, under generall coverts, as I cannot deny unto his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moſt juſt cauſe of indignation at me for ever, if I ſhould have intended ſo, to a King, a Christian King, my King, and in his preſence, and before his ſervants; ſo I wiſh the Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo to give me favour with your Honours, yea with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, nay with Chriſt at his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oming, as my heart and purpoſes were upright to God, the King and State, in that ſervice; free from popularity, and from all purpoſe of depreſſing the glory of ſo worthy a Prince, or depraving perſonally any of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſervants.</p>
            <p>I doe alſo further crave leave to proteſt, that I had therein no intelligence, no conference with any man living; but ran that courſe out of opinion, that it was my duty to ſpeake before the King and State, of ſuch things as the beſt Kings and States ſhall have need to conſider of, while the world ſtandeth. As touching mine owne reverent heart, and particular opinion of his Majesties gracious dispoſition, if my ſpeeches to that end cleared it not enough, yet even that doth, which is made to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, my freedome to ſpeak of that duty ſo liberally before his preſence; an undoubted argument of good times, like thoſe of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64627:13"/>
               <hi>Trajan,</hi> wherein (as it is ſaid) one might thinke what he would, and ſpeake what he thought. Howbeit, I am ſo ſenſible of his Majesties distaſte, as I could not out live the diſcouragement thereof, if the integrity of my heart before God in that poore Sermon, and his Majesties gracious readineſſe to receive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction did not relieve me. As for any construction of my ſpeech by his Mnjesties ſubjects, whom I have elſewhere and often taught, and incited to be joyfull, and thankefull to God for this favour, that (not being beſt people) we are bleſſed with the beſt King under heaven; I ſhould mourne not a little, if any ſpiderly minde, ſucke poyſon out of that (not flower, but) pothearbe, that had no poyſon in it. And becauſe it is matter of humbling, to be thought caſually, and unwillingly the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any hurt, I doe freely offer, that if the honeſt wiſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors will ſay upon their conſcience, that my Sermon incited them to leſſe reverence of his Majesty, or joy in him; then to ſilence my ſelfe from preaching, to give up my maintenance, and (if that be to little) to depart my Countrey; in which yet, I had rather live under his Majesty, poore as I am, then to abound in any other Kingdome of the world. But what meane I to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence my ſelfe? I am in your Lordſhips, to whom I ſubmit my ſelfe with all reverence: nothing ſo much fearefull of any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as ſory to have grieved that royall heart, the joy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and contentment wherof I wiſh and pray for, more then my life, as I am bound to doe 'and ſhall doe, whether his pleaſure ſhall be to pardon, or puniſh his poore ſervant.</p>
            <p>And thus profeſſing my ſelfe to have great cauſe already, to thinke the more reverently of your Honors while I live, and to pray to God the more earnestly for you, I humbly crave leave of you, of preſenting to your Honours an account of my ſelfe for my twenty yeeres Ministry; which if I ſhall give untruly in any point, I aske no favour of your Honours, no mercy of God himſelfe: And for the reſt, beſeech God to make you as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in life, &amp; happy in death as ever were any in your places.</p>

            <p>MY no leſſe dear then dread Sovernigne, I recount mine owne ſecret intentions in my Sermon preached before your Majeſty, the dearneſſe and tenderneſſe of my heart to your Majeſties perſon and honour, and the many prayers and teares ſpent upon it, that it might be faithfull, and acceptable to God and your Majeſty; I am amazed at that diſtaſte which your Highneſſe hath taken of it and of me. But when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view ſome ambiguous ſpeeches thereof, in which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had great reaſon to ſuſpect undutifull intentions in me; I wonder more at that divine providence, that carried me unawares upon ſuch things, as gave occaſion of diſtaſte to your Majeſty, to me of humbling under your diſpleaſure: which my ſorrow ſhould have bin the leſſe, if your Majeſties diſlike had broken out in a tempeſt of indignation, and not in a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting griefe of a ſweet and Princely ſpirit. Now God even ſo deliver my ſoule out of all adverſity, as I was farre from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of grieving my Lord the King, and as my heart is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the griefe of your heart. And yet unto this one affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath come another, that all that faithfull Councell, which I meant to have conveyed cloſely unto my deareſt Lord, as a word in ſeaſon, and which I thought my ſelfe bound unto, as I would anſwer it to God, to whom I had vowed it,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64627:14"/>
is now ſpilt, and made not unprofibable onely, but intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, through an evill taſte, which my ſuppoſed intentions gave unto it. And yet (that my miſery might want no weight) there is this added, that whiles the markes which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty tooke notice of, were as much hidden from the common hearers ſight, as they were from mine owne thoughts, I am judged to be now committed for the Doctrines, which were found and generall, and never out of ſeaſon for any State. And ſo (as I ſpake to the Lords with teares) I am caſually an occaſion of that which is no honour to your Majeſty; for whoſe honour I entended that ſervice, and deſire to ſacrifice all things but my ſoule. And theſe are the reſpects for which your poore priſoner is abaſed. As for impriſonment, it is, in a ſort but to be locked up in my Study, and death it ſelfe were but to fall aſleepe: nor can I be diſgraced in the world, in which I never had or ſought gracing. Now for remedy, I have but two receipts; the one of prayer to God, that can recover your favour to me: the other, of humble ſuit unto your Majeſty for reliefe, not ſo much out of priſon, as out of your Majeſties diſpleaſure. Together with which ſuit, I doe humbly preſent unto your Majeſty, upon my knees, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (more ſincere then cautelous) of ſuch things as your Highneſſe deſireth to be anſwered in.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some things I ſpake in mine owne phraſe unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, as that of the ſwelling of Princes hearts, &amp;c. and of their mariage by their pictures: and ſome things I aleadged out of <hi>Comines</hi>; as of a fall from a horſe, a ſharpe ague, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the wits, diviſion in the houſe, &amp;c. in all which, I take God to witneſſe againſt my ſoule, if I had any thought of aiming at, or ſo much as knowledge of thoſe reſpects, which I was conceived to glance upon, but ſpake therein as <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe did, to his Maſters underſtanding, not to his owne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the generall diſcourſe of the graciouſneſſe of Princes to their Subjects, and the arguments and amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations thereof, I confeſſe upon my knees unto your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64627:15"/>
that taking notice (to my hearts griefe) of the generall murmurings and complaints (which every man heares ſooner then your Majeſty, or your neereſt ſervants) as that you grace not your people, you ſpeake not to them, you looke not at them, you bleſſe them not; and therefore (ſay they) you love them not; fearing whereto the divell might carry ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, I thought my ſelfe bound in conſcience as on the one ſide by ſundry Sermons, and in ſundry places, to reprove all unthankfull and undutifull thoughts toward ſo gracious a King; ſo on the other ſide in your owne preſence, to propone ſuch generall diſcourſe, as your Majeſty might make uſe of, for your owne good and all ours that live (as it were) by your breath; and yet without touch to your reputation in your peoples hearts. For which, I not onely did intend, but ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide in my particular applications to your Majeſty, as I dare ſay, that the honeſt hearers did reverence you the more; as many teſtified at the inſtant, by their teares: arguments of good and not of bad affections toward their Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and as for my ſpeech of two beaſts to be hunted away, the tame beaſt and the wilde, the flatterer and the falſe informer, being an alluſion to a ſpeech of <hi>Diogenes</hi>; I proteſt upon my knees unto your Majeſty, I ment not any two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, but kindes of ſuch evill inſtruments: of which (there is no doubt) but your Majeſty hath more then two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, though I know them not.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as to the point of the generality of a Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and that ſimitude of Monopolies uſed in diſcourſe thereof; I likewiſe upon my knees crave leave to proteſt, that I ſpake it not, as thinking your Majeſty to be ſtrict hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or handed; or becauſe I knew that ſome have ingroſed your favours; but becauſe that alſo is muttered of, as if your favours were not immediate, nor tole-free: and becauſe it hath beene the ordinary miſhap of the beſt Princes to be ſo incloſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thought it my duty, <hi>ad majorem cautelam,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe that under a generall diſcourſe unto a wiſe Prince, which I thought none could poſſibly, and certainly apply
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64627:15"/>
unto particularities, unleſſe the fault were both certaine and open.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, For the ſecond part of my Sermon, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of furthering Religion; I doe upon my knees crave leave to proteſt before the God of heaven, that I ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as doubting of your Majeſties owne purpoſes and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of heart, or to detract from the honour of your former proceedings amongſt us, which unhappily and unwillingly I forgot to relate: but becauſe I thought it my duty to ſtirre up your pure minde unto thoſe things which belong unto your royall power, and duty therein; to which (I confeſſe) my heart moved me the more earneſtly, becauſe it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally complained, that Popery and licenciouſneſſe grow upon us; that the new and unwonted urging of the Ceremonies and Subſcription beyond Law (whereby ſix or ſeven hundred of the ableſt Miniſters in the Land are like to be put out) the generall depraving of religious perſons (if they be conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) under the ſcorne of Puritaniſme; as if the body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſtanding upright, men would yet cut the throat of it: the connivency at Papiſts and Jeſuites, and too little regard of religious men; the dignifying of ſuch in the Church, as never were of beſt deſert, gifts, and report; the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes from the Parliament; though in preſent, and in your Majeſties dayes ſafe, yet in the Preſident and ſucceſſion of doubtfull conſequence, computed with the inſolencies and brags of the Papiſts; make many men ſigh and grieve, and ſay in ſecret that theſe things may be the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to Popery: and that though your excellent Majeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the contrary, yet being in your owne purpoſes led out onely againſt <hi>Dothan</hi> of the Puritans, you may at laſt, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and unawares, finde your ſelfe incloſed in <hi>Samaria</hi> of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, As to the point of the good diſpoſition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be cheriſhed by good Princes (which God knoweth I caſt unwillingly into that latter part of my Sermon) I doe humbly confeſſe unto your bleſſed Majeſty, that the time
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64627:16"/>
gave me as good an heart, as the text did occaſion to ſpeake of it; the rather, becauſe I have perceived good mens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to this effect. Surely, the undoubted affections of the moſt religious Subjects, made the Kings happy entrance amongſt us, to be ſo open and ſo eaſie. Others, when they ſaw it unpoſſible to reſiſt, haſted to be before us in favour, as they were behinde us in affection: no otherwiſe then <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> came in firſt to ſalute <hi>David</hi> at his returne, that in his trouble went out to curſe him: we were then ready with our lives in our hands, to have cut out his Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſties way to the crowne, with our owne ſwords, and now are ready to dye for him, at any houres warning. Good Lord, what is it? that we cannot be gratified in a ſuit ſo generally made, ſo eaſily, and not ſafely alone, but profitably granted? and no leſſe (in our conc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s) for the Kings honour and ſafety, then for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon comforts and quiet of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, I doe upon my knees confeſſe unto your moſt excellent Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by <hi>Pollios</hi> glaſſes, I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to notifie the Ceremonies for which this Church of God hath bin in vexation above fifty yeeres. And though they be ſmall things, yet have they cauſed great troubles; as light ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations breed great tempeſts: and the courſe of Religion hath bin much hindred by them, as is the way of a ſhip in the ſea, by the little fiſh Remora as <hi>Plinie</hi> writes. Things (which I confeſſe) I hold not impious but needleſſe and ſcandalous, of ſome ſo extreamely hated of others ſo ſuperſticiouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as a good man cannot tell, whether to pleaſe himſelfe beſt, in pleaſing or diſpleaſing others. Many hundred wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſters thinke them unlawfull, and would ſurely dye, rather then uſe them; ſome others will much more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe their ſubjection to your Majeſty, in bearing the penalty, then ſuffer by their occaſion ſo many to fall off to Browniſme on the one hand, and others to riſe up in ſcorne, and contempt of their lightneſſe, on the other. Thus is the ſtate of the poore Miniſtry, like that of the <hi>Britons,</hi> betwixt the ſword of the Saxons, and the Sea: in which caſe, moſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64627:16"/>
noble Prince, I proteſt to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I durſt not but ſpeak (by way of ſupplication) before your preſence more then ever I ſpake before the people; for what knew I, whether God had brought me thither for that time? and whether the Kings Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſty would hold out his golden Scepter unto me? and thought this motion the more ſeaſonable, becauſe the things yeelded upon ſuit for peace ſake, might goe out with flying colours, one ſide ſatisfied with their juſtification, the other gratified with their remove; both reunited within themſelves, and ſtrengthned againſt the common enemy; the frame of the preſent government being ſtill continued with good appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and confirmed by our inward peace.</p>
            <p>Theſe Motives, moſt dread Soveraigne, led me into that courſe which I tooke, was without counſell or conference with other perſon or perſons. Now durſt I prefer mine own poſſibilities of attaining the Princes ſervice to this duty. In all which, I had no unreverend thought in my heart, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my Soveraigne to any of thoſe evill examples, which I alleadged in my diſcourſes. For the reſt, I could onely plead (as <hi>Luther</hi> before the Emperour) for pardon of rudeneſſe, that I have not beene acquainted with the tender eares of Princes; but doe onely beſeech your Majeſty, for Chriſts ſake, to pardon the errours of my love unto you. Beſeeching God to bleſſe your Majeſty, and all your progeny, and to make your name more honorable, then the name of all the Kings your predeceſſours in this Land.</p>
