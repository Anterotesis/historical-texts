            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE COPY OF A LETTER SENT FROM THE Cardinall du Perron Embaſſadour for the French King at Rome, CONCERNING THE Diviſions of the Papiſts of England, their difference in Government, whether by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Jeſuites, with the Care of his Holineſſe in the agreement, and his Judgement in placing of Biſhops in England, for making Prieſts to increaſe the Catholike Number.

            <p>IT is not long ſince accidentally I did fall upon a Book written in French of the <hi>Negotiations and Embaſſages</hi> of the famous and learned Cardinall <hi>du Perron.</hi> Where amongſt many notable paſſages which happened in his Embaſſage at <hi>Rome,</hi> and wherewith hee acquainted the French King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth his maſter, he has one in one letter to the King his maſter concerning the diviſions of the Papiſts in England, and the meanes to be uſed for their reconciliation. With his judgement of the Biſhops of England. Which after I had read and conſidered, I was induced thereby not without reaſon to believe that it had ſerved for a Counſell to both the Biſhops and Papiſts to ground their greatneſſe upon and to advance both the one and the other to that height they were in before the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> began. Now imagining that it might ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the judgements of many, and help them to rip up the <hi>arcana principia,</hi> and hid Maximes the Prelates and Papiſts have uſed theſe many yeeres to increaſe their owne greatneſſe, oppreſſe all thoſe that ſhould dare to oppoſe them. I have ſet down the true Coppy (not vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the originall) ſo truly as I could, to which I have added my conjecture in few words of the advantages Prelates and Papiſts have taken from it, as alſo of their complying together to uphold one another.</p>

On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>23.</hi> of the laſt Moneth, I had audience of the Pope, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to his Holineſſe, that which it pleaſed your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty to impart to me of your opinion concerning the affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and the diſpute betwixt the Fathers, <hi>Jacobines</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites:</hi> he was much ſatisfied with both the one and the other adviſe, and often thanked your Maieſtie for the good duties your Maieſty had done him, in blotting out of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> imagination the ſiniſtrous impreſſion divers had moved him to conceive of his intentions. Concerning the diſpute, he ſeemed highly to approve of your Maieſties opinion, which was to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all means to end that difference by one agreement; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he gave me charge that at the firſt Congregation of the Cardinals, which ſhould be holden for that effect, I ſhould propoſe ſomethings to try if poſſibly that expedient might be uſed. I did communicate alſo to his Holineſſe, concerning the affairs of <hi>England</hi> two Letters ſent to me from <hi>Venice,</hi> the one from <hi>Mounſieur De Beaumont</hi> to <hi>Mounſieur De Freſnes;</hi> the other from <hi>Mounſieur De Freſnes</hi> to mee, accompanied with a third ſent from a certain Doctor of <hi>England,</hi> (by their means) to his Holineſſe. The end of all thoſe Letters was, that the diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts might be taken away, ſome of them obeying

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93995:3"/>
one Arch-priest governed by the Ieſuites: others appealing from the unlawfully administred authority of the arch-priest. Their common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for removing that difference was, to establiſh a good number of Biſhops, to whom neither the appealers nor the Ieſuits could lawfully refuſe obedience. I read thoſe Letters gladly to his Holineſſe, as being written with great wiſdome and diſcretion, evidencing alſo the care your Maiesties ſervants had for the advancement of Religion in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and eſpecially becauſe the Letters of the Engliſh Priest heretofore well known to his Holineſſe, was filled with the praiſes of your Maieſties prudent carriage in the matter of the Catholike Religion there, and much blaming that of the Spaniards: as alſo becauſe myſelf had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame things to the Pope at his first Inauguration, esteeming it profitable, not onely for the good of the Church, but alſo for your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice: becauſe the faction of the Ieſuites in that Kingdome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on <hi>Perſonius,</hi> and other instruments of the Spaniſh faction. His Holineſſe made me anſwer, that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> had continually made ſcruple to hearken to that expedient, fearing least it ſhould ſtirre up a greater perſecution in England againſt the Catholikes, I anſwered him that on the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrary, it would rather diminiſh then augment it, becauſe that in generall the Heretiques did not carry ſo much hatred againſt the Biſhops, as againſt the Ieſuites, who (as they beleeve) do meddle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much more with the eſtates and lives of Princes, nor any other of the Eccleſiaſticall orders. Morever that the name of Biſhops was yet in great reverence amongſt them, and where as they do reiect and abhor the title of Prieſt, becauſe they beleeve there is no ſacrifice in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: they do honour and reſpect the name of Biſhops, and by this means they ſhould moderate and diminiſh their perſecutions against Biſhops, much more againſt the ſimple Prieſts or Ieſuites. To which I added, that there being no Biſhops in England, there could be no Prieſts conſecrated there, and that it behooved thoſe who deſired to be promoted to the order of Prieſthood, ſhould come take their orders here beyond the Seas: whence did ariſe two notable inconveniences. Firſt, that it did hinder the multiplication of Eccleſiaſtique perſons in England, inregard of the expence, perils, and incommodities it behooved them to undergoe in paſſing and repaſſing the Seas. The other, that this communication and acquaintance they came to make here with ſtrangers, made them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſuſpected to their Countrey men, as having been corrupted and ſuborned of them, by whoſe means they had obtained thoſe orders; ſo that

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93995:3"/>
I did foreſee great utilities in the propoſed advice, and did onely find one incommodity, which was that the Proteſtant Biſhops of England (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many do ſecretly favour the Romiſh Religion, allured poſſibly in hope to be confirmed by the Catholikes in their dignities) ſhould fall from all ſuch hopes, when they ſhould perceive his Holineſſe had conſecrated others in their place. But the remedy that might be uſed, was to conſecrate onely ſome Biſhops in place of thoſe who were married, and already out of hopes they ſhould keep their wives and Biſhopricks together in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion. His Holineſſe took time to think upon it: after which according to the commandment I ſhall receive from your Maieſtie, I ſhall continue, or leave off to preſent the buſineſſe further; and thus much from that Letter.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="conjecture">
            <p>NOw I hope ye ſee clearly from the Cardinalls Letter, what his judgement was of our Biſhops, wherein if he was deceived or not, I will not judge, onely this I may ſay confidently, if he ſpoke falſly of Biſhops of his time, he hath been an oracle of truth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Biſhops of our time, as may eaſily appear to thoſe, who will informe themſelves but ſlenderly of their doctrines and practices ſo well known to moſt ſorts of men, that it is wonder they ſhould find ſo much as one, to ſpeak but one word in their defence, for have they not uſed all violent courſes to ſuppreſſe the truth of the Goſpell by pilloring, ſcourging, impriſoning, fining, baniſhing, and confining numbers of the moſt zealous profeſſours of the truth, for no other known offence, but becauſe they would not ſubmit themſelves to the ſuperſtitions, tyrannies, and oppreſſions of thoſe bloodthirſty perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? Did ever any of that cruell ſociety hitherto, publikely diſapprove either by word or writing the barbarous rage of their Tygerlike fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the miſery of thoſe injuſtly perſecuted men, the deplorable c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of their diſtreſſed Mother the Church, oppreſſed by the too too prevalent factions of Papiſts and Arminians to this day? But for all this, ſome will not ſpare to averre that divers of the Biſhops had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any hand in thoſe buſineſſes, but on the contrary cheriſhed piety, abhorred cruelty, reſiſted ſuperſtition to the utmoſt of their power, and endeavoured (as they were able) to conſerve the peace of the Church, and State. My onely deſire is, that thoſe men would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that neither love, affection towards the one party, nor hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other doth ſo much move me as the love to the truth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93995:4"/>
which ought to be freely ſpoken at all times, but eſpecially when men ſeem as it were to doate on thoſe Biſhops who ſeem innocent to divers, and it may be they neither did contrive nor deſire thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; which charitie would make me beleeve, if I ſhould find reaſon to perſwade me, that they did either diſapprove or reject them being once urged by their fellow companions; nay on the contrary, divers reaſons induce me to believe that they did approve all, without any the leaſt oppoſition; as firſt, ſuffering all things to be impoſed upon them without any repining. Secondly, urging the practice upon all men puniſhing ſeverely the refractory. Thirdly, their unanimous conſent to the late diabolicall Canons (whence I Imagine all things to have been done in the ſame manner) Laſtly, their prodigious ſilence which is one infallible ſigne that even to this day they allow of them, for <hi>qui tacet, conſentire videtur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the end of introducing thoſe ſuperſtitions, and ſetting thoſe perſecutions on foot, is moſt probable, as I can conjecture to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Papiſts, and ſeek by their means and aſſiſtance to raiſe their monſtrous greatneſſe, and boundleſſe ambition to ſuch an height as they might eaſily cruſh and ruine all thoſe who ſhould attempt to oppoſe their ſuperſtitious, cruell, bloudy, and helliſh deſignes. As for the Papiſts, humane policie could never have invented one ſurer foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation (then the Cardinals councels) for them to have builded their greatneſſe in this Kingdome, all things wiſely conſidered; for hath not the pacifying of diſcords amongſt the Papiſts here, and the ſending over of Biſhops, been the chief inſtruments, and in a manner the ſole cauſes of the exceſſive increaſe of the Romaniſts in theſe Kingdomes? Let Papiſts themſelves ſpeak, who tell us plainly, that the dexterity of the Romiſh Biſhops (who are no fewer then the Proteſtant Biſhops in number) hath been ſuch, that in complying the one with the other, they have equally ſhared in the diviſions: for if we may believe ſome of their catalogues, there be above 6000. Prieſts in England, which number being compared with that of the preaching Miniſters, ſhall not come farre ſhort, if not equall them, as I ſuppoſe. And truly this councell of the Cardinall hath been received by his part with as great policie and good ſucceſſe, as it was given with ſolidity and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Now if the number be ſo exceſſive in England, what ſhall we expect of Ireland, where the moſt part of the Natives hath known no other Religion from their infancie; truly the prodigious multitude

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93995:4"/>
of that whores ſonnes (who in blind zeal to that Idolatrous ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and blaſphemous beaſt) can, finding opportunitie, devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to murder Kings and Princes, blow up Parliaments, betray their Countrey, and bring all to confuſion without fear of God, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to man, as wofull experience, the maſter of fools, hath too too often taught by lamentable examples, to the infinite dammage of the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>The ſympathy and affinitie of thoſe men with our Biſhops, is ſuch as I conceive, would not require much labour to make in moſt things a notable parallel, which I leave to ſome other, contenting my ſelf onely to ſhew that their correſpondency hath been ſuch theſe many years, that the Biſhops have taken all things done againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts as done againſt themſelves, and the Papiſts all things done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops, as done againſt their head the Pope and them; but this hath been ſo cunningly performed, as few could heretofore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, whilſt at laſt the Papiſts ſeeing both themſelves and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Biſhops wronged (as they thought) by the factious covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Scotland, could contain themſelves no more, but burſt out in rage againſt thoſe Hereticks, and openly undertook to defend, that our Biſhops were <hi>Iure Divino tales,</hi> more I am ſure then ever they would have ſaid for their infallible head the Pope, whom they defend onely to be <hi>Iure Eccleſiaſtice</hi> Pope: but this they did, perceiving that if ours ſhould not be proved to be <hi>Iure Divino tales,</hi> no Eccleſiaſtick or humane conſtitution could hinder their Miters to be fallable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though themſelves beleeve all that the Church the Pope beleeveth, who will never beleeve any thing to his own diſadvantage. And leaſt our Biſhops ſhould ſeem to be behind with the Papiſts in mutuall courteſies, I aſſure you, they have rendred them tenfold the league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenſive and defenſive; for they will have us beleeve that the Pope is not Antichriſt, but the true ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter;</hi> that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church as it is preſently, is the true Church; that in it they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no materiall or ſubſtantiall errours; that our Religion differeth from the popiſh in matters of ſmall or no conſequence; that invocation on Saints, prayer for the dead, worſhipping of Images, crucifixes, and other reliques, with more then ſeven mountains of other abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that blaſphemous beaſt, and her whoriſh Locuſts, are not onely lawfull, but expedient and profitable to be uſed. I may further averre that Papiſts have been the men of greateſt eſteem with our

Biſhops, and that they went free being convicted by the Laws of the land, when Godly and laborious Miniſters, zealous profeſſours, and ſound Chriſtians were moſt barbarouſly martyred, and that for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the Laws of God, and the King; all this undoubtedly to pleaſe that man of ſinne, who under promiſe of aſſiſtance cauſed them to ſin. But I can tell them that he hath <gap reason="foreign">

And although divers will affirm, that Segnior <hi>Conne</hi> and <hi>Roſſeti</hi> brought bags full of Apoſtolicall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, to all thoſe who would ſpend their lives &amp; eſtates, where the Miter was ſo much concerned, yet their infallibility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now diverſe Merchants aſſure mee that <hi>Gregorie</hi> is to have the bill of exchange to pay them the laſt wages for their ſervice, who (as I am informed) will be ſo ready upon the firſt receipt thereof to ſhew them the ſame courteſie he uſeth to others, that they ſhall have no juſt occaſion to complain of his ſound dealing, more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done before; for my part, I am ſo confident, he will doe them right, even behind their backs, that I could heartily wiſh all ſuch as their Lordſhips to addreſſe themſelves to him who can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly end their deſires.</p>
