            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <q>Woe vnto them that drawe iniquitie with cordes of vanitie, and sinne as it were with a Cart rope.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Text two poynts are to beediscussed especially.</p>
               <p>First, the goodnes of God who soundes a <hi>woe,</hi> before he sendes a <hi>woe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the wickednesse of man, in <hi>drawing iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the first, in holy writ we finde two kinds of woes: a woe of Condoling, and a woe of Condemning. Condoling, as Psalm. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7193:14"/>
or in plainer termes a woe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and a woe executed.</p>
               <p>The woe whereof I am now to treate, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe both after and before these words. <hi>As woe to them that ioyne house to house, and field to field: Till there be no place for others in the Land. Woe to them who rise vp early to follow drunkennesse: Woe to them who speake good of euill, and euill of good:</hi> are but warnings, and so, by consequent, armings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that heauy woe of destruction, which in the end of the Chapter is threatened by <hi>a nation that shall come from farre with arrowes that are sharpe, and all their bowes bent, with horses hauing hoofes like flint, &amp; with Chariots hauing wheeles like whirlwinds, roaring as the Lyon, or as the roaring Seas;</hi> Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the iudgements of God vpon the men of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in such sort that none shall deliuer them.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of security, to sound out the woes of seuerity is not welcome, though it be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: it is harsh vnto flesh and bloud, vnto such as are at <note n="a" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> 30. 10. But the Thundering of woe is wholsome to such as haue hearts and eares to <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 13. 22.</note> suffer the words of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is so farre from either bringing or haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of woe, as that (if it worke true repentance) it doth often deferre, and sometime deliuer vs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7193:14"/>
from a woe hanging ouer our heads: Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the wicked had rather once feele, then euer feare destruction and woe: yet it is an argument of Gods infinite rich mercy (who <note n="e" place="margin">Ezech. 18. 32</note> desires not the death of a sinner) first, to become a Preacher, and then a punisher; First to sound a woe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee send a woe: First to speake to vs in his wrath, before hee vexe vs in his sore displeasure. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>So we read that he did inioyne his Prophets to <note n="f" place="margin">Esay. 58 1.</note> cry aloud, &amp; to lift vp their voyce like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in shewing his people their trangressions, and to the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> their sinnes: And Christ albeit he were the Prince of peace <hi>Esay.</hi> 9. 6. did chuse some for his Apostles who were <hi>the</hi>

In this Chapter at the 6. verse the preachers are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto cloudes, <hi>I will command the cloudes that they raine no more raine vpon my Vineyard,</hi> That is, the pastours &amp; teachers that they preach no more.

               <p>The third point to bee further examined is, <hi>quid dandum?</hi> and that is <hi>Bread:</hi> now there bee three sorts of bread mentioned in holy Bible <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread; Doctrinall, Iohn.</hi> 6. Labour not, saith our Sauiour, for the loaues, and for the meat which perisheth, but for the meate and <hi>bread,</hi> that endure to life euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Corporall, Math.</hi> 4. 4. Man shall not liue by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The bread here prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally spoken of, is neither mentall, nor sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; but corporall, and this kind in a strict acception is the loafe made of wheat, or the like graine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>Melchisedech King of Salem, brought forth bread and wine:</hi> but in a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and large signification it is vsed in holy Scripture, <hi>pro omni Comestibili,</hi> for all kind of food, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>In the sweate of thy face thou shalt eate bread,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 10. King Dauid sayd to Ziba. <hi>Mephibosheth thy Masters Sonne, shall eate bread al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at my Table;</hi> that is, hee shall fare so well as I fare, so well as <hi>one of the Kings Sonnes,</hi> as it is sayd verse the 11. And in the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> giue vs this day our daily bread; Where <hi>Panis</hi> is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7193:36"/>
                  <hi>Pan,</hi> euery thing fit and necessarie for our present life.</p>
               <p>Well then if in asking of bread, from God, thou wilt haue it of the largest extent, take heed how you curtall it in this, and other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, concerning the giuing of bread to thy poore brethren. As you begge bread of God, so breake bread to the hungrie, deale to him as occasion is offered, more then either Crust or crumme of thy loafe. Giue so much as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for his reliefe, <hi>bring him to thine house, couer him, and hide not thy face from thy flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth point is, <hi>de quo dandum,</hi> and that is expressed in the word <hi>Tuum,</hi> not the goods of another, but thy bread, <hi>si tuus,</hi> almes are a <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice pleasing vnto God; now wee may not present an offering to God of that which cost vs nothing, as King <hi>Dauid</hi> speakes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy riches, cast thy bread vpon the waters, giue thy garments vnto the naked, and of thine aboundance to such as haue neede.</hi> It must bee thine first, and that acquired lawfully, not by Bribes, or oppression, or Forgerie: but thine by descent or purchase, thine by the sweat of thy Browes, in some honest occupation: or thine by the sweat of thy braines, in some commendable profession. Almes are not to bee giuen (as <note n="f" place="margin">apud Fox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mart f. 705.</note> one wittily sayd) except they first haue sweat in a mans hand. It is not an act of Charity to rob <hi>Peter</hi> and pay <hi>Paul,</hi> or to build an Hospitall for a few, by the ruins of many, for so you shall haue more to curse you, then to blesse you. If thou
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7193:36"/>
giue, giue that which is fit, ont of thine ovvne Cesterne, and owne Well, and owne substance, <hi>deale thy bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or <hi>thy</hi> bread that is, such as thou thy selfe dost eate, <hi>qui tuus,</hi> thy dole may not bee <hi>panis lapido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> as <hi>Fibius Verucosus</hi> speakes in <note n="g" place="margin">De benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Or <hi>thy</hi> bread, that is, when it is thine, <hi>dum tuus est,</hi> as the blessed Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>While thou hast time,</hi> make thine owne hands executors, and thine own eyes ouerseers, and thine owne sonns and seruants, in thy houshold, witnesses of thy wil in doing good. Halfe a loafe broken vnto the hungrie while thou liuest, &amp; hast it in thine own power and purse, procures thee more friends in the court of Heauen, then a whole loafe giuen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy death, by heires and asignes: If bread bee <hi>thine,</hi> thus as I haue told you, <hi>si tuus, qui tuus, dum tuus,</hi> deale thy bread to the <hi>Hungrie.</hi>

is more apt then clay to receiue a print, So the soule being a spirit, was much more capable of the impression of the Image of God. Yet that which the body could receiue, it did in very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sort expresse, being so wonderfully framed of such an excellent proportion and beauty, that no creature in the world may be compared with it, and moreouer of so sound a temperature, <note n="c" place="margin">Aug. de peccat. meri. tis et remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> that had not <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, it would haue continued without corruption for euer.</p>

               <p>Secondly, for that it is indued with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and memorie, which are the very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Gods wisdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in respect of quicknesse and agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conceiuing at one time so many matters, so different, so farre distant, which is the shadow of Gods vbiquity.</p>
               <p>But <hi>St</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> in saying man was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning created after the Image of God, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 10. And the same in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and holinesse. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. Shewes plainely that this Image consists not so much in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the soule, or in the naturall faculties thereof, as in the supernaturall giftes of grace,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7193:46"/>
knowledge, illumination, holinesse, Iustice of the soule. For Adam had an illuminated vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and a rectified will, louing God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, and his neighbour as himselfe.</p>
               <p>The two wordes of S. Paul, <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> conteine mans whole duty; holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse his duty to God, <hi>righteousnesse</hi> his duty to man. In this Image man was created, and so consequently this Image consists in the soule, more then in the body, and in the supernaturall graces of the soule, more then in the naturall powers of the soule.</p>
               <p>For 1. If this Image consisted onely in the soules spirituall essence; then it would follow that wicked spirits and wicked men should haue Gods Image, because the substance of the spirit and soule remaineth in them; but the scripture teacheth expresly, that the wicked haue not Gods Image, but the deuils stampe. So Christ affirmed of Iudas, <hi>haue not I chosen you twelue? and one of you is a deuill,</hi> and S. Peter when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a foule fact, <hi>come behind me Sathan. Mat.</hi> 16. 23. and of the Pharisees, <hi>yee are of your father the deuill. Iohn.</hi> 8. 44. And the text is plaine, 1. of Iohn 3. 8. he that committeth sin is of the deuill.</p>
               <p>2. God cannot properly be sayd to damne his owne Image, or to send it into hell fire, but the soules of reprobate sinners are damned, <hi>Ergo,</hi> this Image is not altogether in the soules substance, that Image saith <note n="e" place="margin">Operum. fol. 14. 99.</note> 
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> wherein thou wert created; after the likenesse of God, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but crowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:7193:46"/>3. That Image of God, after which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, is by his fall vtterly lost, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, for otherwise this Image needed not to be renewed, or reuiued in vs, as it is by Christ, in whom all true beleeuers are <hi>new creatures,</hi> and <hi>new men</hi> and a <hi>new lumpe,</hi> but the substance of the reasonable soule, with all the naturall powers thereof, are not altogether lost in vnregenerate men, <hi>ergo,</hi> this Image principally consisted in the gifts of grace. To this purpose <hi>S.</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Contr. Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin. l. 24. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> sayd that the whole man both in his inward and outward parts <hi>inueterauit</hi> is waxen old, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by sinne, but the inward man is new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued by grace, and the outward man hereafter shall be restored in the resurrection.</p>
               <p>Another question is moued here, whether the man only was created after this image of God, &amp; not the woman, and the reason of this doubt is grounded vpon the words of S. Paul, <hi>man is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and glory of God, the woman the glory of man.</hi> Answere is made by <hi>Moses</hi> in the very next verse to my text. <hi>God created man in his Image, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male created he them.</hi> As for the place, <hi>man</hi> is the glory of God, <hi>woman,</hi> the glory of man; <note n="g" place="margin">Caluin. in loc.</note> It is to be construed, of the preheminence, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority giuen vnto man, aboue the woman, in which one respect, the Image of God is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the man, more then in the woman. But if we consider the principall part of that Image, consisting in holinesse, and righteousnesse, the woman was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>created, according to it, as well as the man, in Christ, as the blessed Apostle teacheth vs, <hi>there is neither male, nor female, but all</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:7193:47"/>
                  <hi>are one,</hi> women are the daughters of God, so well as men are the sonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Now (beloued) because the day present, is a Sabbath, and the Sabbath in the beginning, was instituted in honour of the creation, and man, of all the creatures, is the most excellent; It is our duty, so long as either man or woman hath any being, all the dayes of our life, but vpon the Sunday more principally to magnifie the Lord, for his infinite rich mercy; who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, not liuelesse as stones are, nor senselesse as the plants are, nor witlesse as the beastes are, but according to his owne likenesse in nature, knowledge, holinesse, righteousnesse, glory, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing vs to be Lords of this ample vniuerse, making all things for man, and man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>2. This ought to teach vs to take heed of corrupting our selues, by sin, or our neighbours through our lewd examples, and to hate our sinnes as a serpent, by meanes whereof, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God is so miserably defaced in vs: for man in his originall integrity, created to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, is by the <hi>foulenesse</hi> of sin, a deuill, and a very vermine; <hi>humana sub cute plurimae la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ferae,</hi> sayd <hi>Carolus Bouillus:</hi> The Scripture<note place="margin">h Dialog. de i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>3. This should make vs to labour earnestly, for true faith in Christ Iesus, by whom this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage shall againe be restored, and as new borne babes, doe desire the sincere milke of the word, that wee may grow from strength to strength, and from vertue to vertue, till wee bee of full growth in Christ, and haue this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Image through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repayred in vs.</p>
               <p>4. This should incite vs to giue the God of our saluation humble and hearty thankes, for redeeming vs with his precious blood, when we were thus vtterly lost, and made, by sin, vnlike to God, and our selues, as the Fathers in their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vse to speake.

               <p>Concerning the first, some men ascribe too much vnto the Magistrate, preferring him aboue God; other on the contrary, too little, not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as the <hi>Minister</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Parasites</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> attribute too much vnto their authority, regarding their ordinances more then the Commandements of God; in this respect, a meere <hi>Courtier</hi> is a strange creature, loosing himselfe in following other: He liueth a great deale by the bread of other, a good deale by the breath of other, oftentimes his clothes are not his owne, his hayre not his owne, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection and very skinne not his owne; nay, that which is worst of all, his soule, (which as <hi>Plato</hi> sayd is most himselfe) is not his owne, while he liueth at the deuotion of other. But if it be true, that Magistrates are <hi>the Ministers of God,</hi> then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, subordinate to God; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when higher powers inioyne things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, which is <hi>higher then the highest,</hi> it is better to obey God than man. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Hic,</hi> saith <note n="b" place="margin">Ser. 6. de verbis.

In that thou fearest Gods power, feare not mans power; obey the Lord temporall, in the Lord eternall: as all power is from God, so for God, and therefore when an earthly Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands against an heauenly trueth, it is a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans duty to be patient, and not agent.</p>
               <p>This humouring of the Chiefe Magistrate is a court sinne, properly called, <hi>adulatio quasi adau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio,</hi> but countrymen offend also sometimes in giuing too much vnto the subordinate magistrat: giue me leaue to reprehend one fault in this kind, which I haue noted in diuerse congregations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, and that is your rising vp in the mids of your religious prayers vnto God, to performe ciuill obeysance to men of worth, and worship; beloued, <hi>there is a time for all things, and a season ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for euery purpose vnder heauen,</hi> a time for your deuotions vnto God, and a time for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto men, a time to fall downe before your maker, and a time to bend vnto the magistrate. Now what manners is it to neglect Gods owne businesse in Gods owne house, to worship his <hi>Minister,</hi> in our parts, especially where gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue so learned Christ, as that they neither expect, nor respect any such vnseasonable duty from you.</p>

                  <hi>Anabaptists</hi> affirme most absurdly, that the Calling of <hi>Magistrates</hi> is vnlawfull, and this they seeme to proue by Scriptures, and by reasons: The Scriptures wrested by them, are chiefly two; The first is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 25. <hi>Christ asked Peter, of whom do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To the second place, <hi>the Kings</hi> of the nations reigne, <hi>but yee not so,</hi> wee say that Christ in saying so, prohibited neither titles of honour, nor ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but only so ruling, that is, such a tyrannous kind of gouernment, as the Gentile Kings vsed, and that ambitious desiring of the same, which reigned in them; and that Christ ought to bee so construed, is playne by three reasons, collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the context it selfe.</p>
               <p>1. Hee saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 25. <hi>and Matth.</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Yee know that the Kings of the Gentiles,</hi> speaking of these Rulers, they knew, &amp; they were <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and oppressours, as <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 4. 16.</note>

               <p>2. Though it should bee granted, that most abuse their authority, yet that abuse proues not their calling, either vnlawfull, or vngodly; glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and drunkards, abuse dayly, meate and drinke; yet both are the good creatures of God: <hi>Heretikes</hi> abuse dayly the Scriptures, vnto their condemnation; and yet the Gospell is <hi>the power of God vnto saluation;</hi> adulterers abuse marriage dayly, yet wedlocke is Gods institution and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee honoured among all men:</hi> and though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>Princes</hi> abuse their <hi>Empire,</hi> Yet <hi>the powers that bee, are ordeyned of God;</hi> And in this case, let vs alwayes remember the saying of <hi>Gregory; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum merita subditorum, disponit Deus corda prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positorum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:7193:100"/>
Almighty God, (in whose hand the hearts of all Kings are,) disposeth of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the merits of their people, so that if higher powers be not good, it is for our sinnes, and for our saks, who gouerne our owne families ill, and our persons worse.</p>
               <p>3. Bad <hi>Princes</hi> often benefit the State, more then hurt; for many good Lawes, haue bene by them enacted, and many good deeds acted, in the dayes of vsurpers, and impious gouernours.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is better to haue a bad King, then none; according to that of <hi>Solomon, Vbi non est gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernator, corruit populus:</hi> Where no gouernour is, the people perish; For whereas in a corrupt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,</hi> there is one <hi>Tyrant;</hi> in an <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> some few <hi>Tyrants:</hi> In a <hi>Democratie,</hi> many <hi>Tyrants;</hi> In an <hi>Anarchie,</hi> all are <hi>Tyrants:</hi> And it is vndoubtedly, more safe, to liue in a place, where nothing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then where all things are lawfull; a bad hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is better then none; the worst <hi>Emperour,</hi> is <hi>the Minister of God,</hi> and if thou be wise, <hi>for thy good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their second reason is, <hi>ab efficiente,</hi> from the founder &amp; author of authority; for they maintain, that <hi>Magistracie</hi> is not ordeyned, &amp; giuen of God, but only vsurped by men; so wee read, that <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> by vexing, and oppressing their countrey, became Kings; as a Pirat told <note n="p" place="margin">Aug. de ciu.

               <p>Thirdly, politique gouernment, is so neessary for mankind; that without it his nature would be destroyed, because man is by nature a <note n="y" place="margin">Arist. pol. lib. cap. 2.</note>
