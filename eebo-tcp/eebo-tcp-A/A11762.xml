         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOrasmuch as the weyght of the Ministeriall

as humane weaknesse can attayne
vnto, and is often discredited by the ignorance,
insufficiencie, and scandalous conversation of
manie who vndertake the same; it is ordayned,
That no person hereafter shallbe admitted to that
holie Function, who hath not bene bred in some
Universitie or Colledge, &amp; hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some degree

Which Certificat shall be given vnder the hands

            <head>CHAP. III. Of Residence and Preaching.</head>
            <p>THE manie inconveniences which result vpon
the <hi>Non</hi>-residence of Ministers, require that
some provision bee made there-anent: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ordayned, That everie Minister reside at the
Church where hee serveth, or nigh therevnto.
And if hee bee found absent, without licence of
his Ordinarie, sixe Sundayes in the whole yeare,
or doe not vse and exercyse his Office, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
(the case of infirmitie being excepted) let
him bee admonished. And if after two admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hee amend not, let him bee depryved of his
Benefice.</p>
            <p>2. No Stranger shall bee admitted to preach
in anie Church, vnlesse hee bee licenced by the
Bishop of the Diocesse.</p>
            <p>3. Everie Presbyter shall eyther by himselfe,
or by another person lawfullie called, reade, or
cause DIVINE SERVICE to be done, according
to the forme of the Book of COMMON PRAYER,
before all Sermons.</p>
            <p>4. Albeit the whole tyme of our lyfe bee
but short, to bee bestowed in the service of God;
yet seeing HEE tempereth that worke to our
weaknesse, It is ordayned, That Preachers in their
Sermons and Prayers, eschew tediousnesse; and
by a succinct doing, leaue in the people an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
for farther instruction, and a newe desire to
devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17504:7"/>
5. No person of the Laicie, whatsoever gifts
hee hath of Learning, Knowledge, or Holinesse,
shall praesume to exercyse the Office of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Deacon, eyther in part, or whole, vnlesse
hee haue receaved Ordination, and bee licenced
by his Ordinarie; vnder the payne of <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. It is the duetie of Presbyters, not onelie
to stirre vp the affections of people by exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but lykewyse to informe their judgement,
by solide instruction, that they may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted
with the groundes of their Profession:
THEREFORE It is ordayned, That there
bee catechizing everie Sunday in the afternoone,
except the Bishop dispence with it, as hee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
cause. And because in the countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can not convenientlie meete but in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
the Presbyter shall everie other yeare
expound the Catechisme to his people, vnder the
payne of suspending him that shall bee found neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
herein.</p>
            <p>7. If anie Preacher shall in the Pulpit parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie,
or of purpose, impugne, or confute the
doctrine delivered by anie other Preacher in the
same Church, or in anie Church nigh adjoyning,
before hee hath acquaynted the Bishop of the
Diocesse therewith, and receaved order from
Him, what to doe in that case, because vpon
publicke dissenting and contradicting, there may
growe much offence, and disquietnesse, to the
people; The same beeing notified to the Bishop
Hee shall not suffer the Preacher anie more to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17504:8"/>
serue in that place which hee hath once abused
except hee faythfullie promise, to forbeare all
such matter of contention in the Church, vntill
order bee taken therein by the Bishop; who with
all convenient speede shall so proceede, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
satisfaction may bee given to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
where the offence was committed: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyded,
that if eyther of the parties offending doe
appeale, hee shall not bee suffered to preach <hi>Lite
pendente:</hi> Neyther shall anie Preacher vse bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
invectiues agaynst his fellow-Presbyter or
Preacher; or goe about indirectlie to worke his
disgrace with the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnder the paine of being
censured, as a prophaner of the Word.</p>
            <p>8. No Presbyter or Preacher shall presume
in Sermons, to speake agaynst His MAIESTIES
Lawes, Statutes, Acts, or Ordinances: But if hee
conceaue anie scruple or doubt, let him goe to his
Ordinarie, and receaue instruction.</p>
            <p>9. No man's name shall bee expressed in
Pulpit, to his reproach, except the fault bee noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
which notoriorie is defined, if the person
bee fugitiue, convict by an Assise, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
or contumacious after citation. Nor yet
shall anie man bee descrybed by anie other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
than publicke vyces, alwayes dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>10. It is manifest, that the superstition of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages, is turned vnto great prophanenesse; and,
that people, for the most part, are growne colde
in doing anie good; esteeming, that good workes
are not necessarie: Therefore shall all Presbyters,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17504:8"/>
as their Text giveth occasion, vrge the necessitie
of good works to their hearers.</p>
            <p>11. When anie person is dangerouslie sicke,
the Presbyter (having knowledge thereof) shall
resort vnto him, or her, (if the disease bee not
knowne, or probablie suspected to bee infectious)
to instruct and comfort them in their disease, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Booke of Common Prayer; and
farther too, as hee shall thinke most needfull, and
convenient. And when anie is passing out of
this lyfe, a Bell shall bee tolled; that the people
hearing, may earnestlie pray for the dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as a fellow-member of CHRIST'S Bodie:
and the Presbyter shall not then neglect to doe
his last duetie.</p>
            <p>12. That everie Presbyter may bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enabled to performe his duetie, and bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
throughlie with knowledge, hee shall bee
carefull to get himselfe good Books; especiallie,
and aboue the rest, the Bookes of holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Wrytinges of the Ancient Fathers,
and Doctors of the Church: and hee shall studie
diligentlie; not taking delight in wandering
through the Countrey, nor medling in matters
not pertinent to his Calling. Or, if anie doe
otherwyse, and after admonition amende not,
hee shall bee suspended from the Ministerie. And
if hee continue in that evill course, hee shall bee
deposed.</p>
            <p>13. All Presbyters and Preachers shall moue
the people to joyne with them in prayer, vsing
some fewe and convenient wordes; and shall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17504:9"/>
alwayes conclude with the LORD'S
PRAYER.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Of the conversation of Presbyters.</head>
            <p>NO Ecclesiasticall person shall at anie tyme,
other than for their honest necessities, resort
to anie Tavernes, or Ale-houses: Neyther shall
they giue themselues to anie servile labour; to
drinking, and ryot; spending their tyme ydlie, by
day, or by night, playing at Dyce, Cardes, or
Tables, or anie vnlawfull Game: but at all tymes
convenient, heare or reade somewhat of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Scriptures; or then exercyse themselues in
some other studie, or employmentes; alwayes
doing the thinges which appertayne to Honestie,
and endevouring to profite the Church of GOD:
having alwayes in mynde, that they ought to
excell all others in puritie of lyfe, and bee ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

vnder payne of the Censures of the Church, to
bee severallie inflicted, according to the qualitie
of their offence.</p>
            <p>2. The ancient Canons of the Church, did
strictlie inhibite anie man to bee admitted to the
Office of a BISHOP, Presbyter, or Deacon,
that had not brought their Families to bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
VVhereby all Ecclesiasticall persons are
taught, to looke vnto their Families; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
them in such sort, that they may bee (as
it were) little Churches, in regard of the daylie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17504:9"/>
Exercyses of Religion, which are kept in them.
Neyther shall they conforme themselues to the
vanitie and superfluitie of the tyme; but in gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and frugalitie, keepe that comlinesse, which
their Calling and Place doeth requyre: taking
good heede that their Wyues bee modest, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
their Children trayned vp in pietie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and their servauntes of a good and honest
conversation.</p>
            <p>3. To restrayne the vaging humour of some
Church-men, so often censured in auncient
Councels; It is ordayned, That no Presbyter
shall leaue his Charge, to goe to Court, or other
places foorth of the Countrey, without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of his Ordinarie, and that the businesse bee
knowne to bee vrgent, and necessarie. Wherein
if they shall transgresse, the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
after tryall, shall inflict such censure, as his
fault shall bee found to merite.</p>
            <p>4. If anie Ecclesiasticall person shall goe out
of his Diocesse, to sute <hi>Plantation</hi> in another, or
accept of anie place, hee shall bee recalled by his
Ordinarie, and returned to his Charge. And if
hee disobey, bee deposed.</p>
            <p>5. It is observed, that sundrie Presbyters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
oftner, and stay longer in <hi>EDINBVRGH,</hi>
than their Charge can well permit; For vvhich
cause it is ordayned, That speciall notice bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of such, and their names sent to their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that due censure may bee inflicted.</p>
            <p>6. Because manie in holie Orders, vndoe
themselues by Suretiship, It is ordayned, That
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17504:10"/>
no Presbyter shall heerefter become Suretie, or
Cautioner, for anie person whatsoever, in civill
Bondes and Contractes, vnder the payne of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension,
ever till he be relieved fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his cautionrie.</p>
            <p>7. All Ecclesiasticall persons shall bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to avoyde the companie wherein filthie
songes, and vncleane gestures, are vsed; lest they
incurre the suspicion of prophanenesse; vnder
the payne of such censures, as the Ordinarie shall

vnlesse the same bee allowed by the Ordinarie.
And if he hath delapidated the Rents, by setting
a Leasse of the Tithes for a small Duetie, or by

            <p>FOrasmuch as none haue ordinarie power, to

holie Orders; It is ordayned, That no Lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

presume to take vpon him the ministration of the
same; vnder the payne of <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. No Presbyter shall refuse, or delay, to
Christen anie Chyld presented by the Parentes,
or anie one of them, assisted by two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
although the same bee no ordinarie houre
of Sermon. And, though all the people bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,
to obserue THE LORD'S DAY,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17504:11"/>
for celebration of the Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
so farre as they may, and to bring their Infantes,
for that effect, vnto the Church; yet considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must bee had of the Childrens infirmitie;
and in that case the Presbyter shall not refuse to
goe where the Infant remayneth, and baptise
the same.</p>
            <p>3. Seeing the SACRAMENT of the
LORD'S SUPPER is instituted for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Fayth, and encrease of Grace, and
to bee a Testimonie of our holie Profession; It is
ordayned, That the same shall bee administrated
foure tymes everie yeare; whereof the Feast of
PASH shall alwayes bee one: Provyded, That
everie man or woman doe communicate with
their owne Presbyter, once a yeare, at least.</p>
            <p>4. And, for the better preparation of the
people, the Presbyter shall bee diligent in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them; especiallie those of the younger
sort; to see, that they holde the foundation of
CHRISTIAN RELIGION, and bee not guiltie
of anie grievous sinne vnrepented of. For which
cause, hee shall enquyre carefullie vnto their
manners; lest anie that are scandalous, or noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie
wicked, bee admitted therevnto. And
because strangers, not beeing of his Parochin,
can not bee so well knowne to him, hee shall not
receaue anie person of another Congregation,
without a Certificate from the Presbyter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
bearing, That hee doeth communicate with

that the Elementes bee circumspectlie handled;
and what is reserved thereof, bee distributed to
the poorer sort, which receaue that day; to bee
eaten and drunken of them before they goe out
of the Church.</p>
            <p>6. Superstition and Prophanenesse are both
of them, Extremities to bee avoyded: As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>the adoration of the Bread</hi> is condemned; so
<hi>the vnreverend communicating,</hi> and <hi>not discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <head>CHAP. XVII. Of Tithes and Landes, dedicated to

            <p>FOr-as-much as the Goods of the Church, of
what-so-ever sort, are not committed to the
disposing of persons Ecclesiasticall, but onelie to
their dispensing; IT shall bee lawfull to anie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17504:18"/>
Arch-Bishop, Bishop, Parson, Vicar, or anie
Church-man, to set, alienate, or put away from

Church-Rent, or anie part of the same, to
anie person, or persons; whether Wyfe or Chyld,
Friend or Stranger, mediatelie or immediatelie.
And who shall bee proved to doe the contrarie,
shall eyther bee compelled to restore the same, or
bee deposed from his Office, Benefice, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>2. It is agaynst all reason, that Ecclesiasticall
Livinges, should goe after the manner of Earthlie
Inheritances; or that the Incumbentes should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
the same, by setting Leasses, which are not
to runne out for a long tyme after their death; to
the hurt and prejudice of their Successoures:
THEREFORE IT IS ordayned, That no
Church-man shall set anie part of his Living and
Rent, longer than his owne lyfe-tyme; vnder the
payne of Deprivation, and Degradation.</p>
            <p>3. And because it falleth out often, that
Church-men, at the expyring of Leasses, and
other Rightes, made before their tyme, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the same, for a little and rediculous augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the yearlie Duetie; IT IS ordayned,
That no Church-man, from hence-foorth, shall
set anie Leasse, or make anie Right of his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Living, but for a reasonable Duetie, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereable
in proportion to that which is set.
And if hee take anie Grassume, or Entrie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to the hurt and prejudice of the Church, the
same shall bee employed to the profite of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17504:18"/>
Church, and Successour; as hee will answere it
before his Ordinarie.</p>
            <p>4. No Bishop, or Presbyter, shall appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to his private vse, anie part of the Landes
and Goods pertayning to the Church, or doted
to pious and holie Uses. And if they doe in the
contrarie, their Heyres, and Executors, shall bee
holden to restore the same. And for eschewing
such Questions, and freeing of the deceassed
Church-man from Scandall, IT IS thought
expedient, That the Thinges belonging to the
Church, bee knowne, and discerned from the
thinges appertayning in propertie to the Bishop
and Presbyter: Lest after their death, thinges
Ecclesiasticall, bee converted to private vses; or
thinges belonging to themselues in propertie, bee
taken for things Ecclesiasticall.</p>
            <p>5. Thinges dedicated to Holie and Religious
Uses, and such other thinges as are offered wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie,
or by Latter-Will left to anie pious Use,
shall bee carefullie looked vnto by the Bishop
and Presbyter, that they bee not lost, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to anie other vse. And if anie man shall
fraudfullie detayne thinges offered, or left by
Latter-Will to the Poore, or anie pious Use,
hee shall bee suspended from all benefites of the
Church, as a Murderer of the Poore, and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
crosser of the good intentions of People.</p>
            <p>6. If anie Presbyter shall with-holde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
or destroy, or deliver into the handes of
Competitors, anie Wryting, or Instrument
what-so-ever, where-by the Donation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall

may bee instructed, or in the pursuit of acquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them, shall privatelie transact with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
vvithout the knowledge and consent of the
ORDINARIE, to the hurt and prejudice of the

losses, which came by his deede, and bee depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <p>7. For the greater encowragement of people,
to the workes of Pietie, and Charitie, If anie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,

hee shall leaue his Goods, or a great part of them,

some places verie much abused; Yet, if anie of
the people bee grieved in mynde, for anie delict,
or offence committed, and, for the vnburthening
of his Conscience, confesse the same to the BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOP,
or PRESBYTER, they shall, as they are
bound, minister to the person so confessing, all
Spirituall Consolations, out of the WORD of
GOD; and shall not denye him the Benefite of
Absolution, after the manner which is prescry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in <hi>THE VISITATION OF THE SICKE;</hi>
if the partie showe himselfe truelie poenitent, and
humblie desire to bee absolved. And hee shall
not make knowne, nor reveale what hath beene
opened to him in Confession at anie tyme, or to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17504:21"/>
anie person what-so-ever, except the cryme bee
such, as by the Lawes of the Realme his owne
lyfe may bee called in question, for concealing
the same.</p>
            <p>10. Sentence of <hi>DEPRIVATION,</hi> or
<hi>DEPOSITION</hi> of a PRESBYTER, shall
not bee pronounced by anie other, but the
ARCH-BISHOP, or BISHOP of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the presence of three or foure graue
PRESBYTERS, called there-vnto by the
BISHOP.</p>
            <p>11. If anie person in holie Orders, lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
suspended, or deposed, shall presume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce
anie Ecclesiasticall Function, during the
tyme of his Suspension, or after hee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded,
let him bee excommunicated, and
delivered to <hi>THE LAY POWER,</hi> as
incorrigible.</p>
            <p>12. If anie man shall finde himselfe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by his METROPOLITANE, let him
appeale to Delegates, or immediatelie to the
KING.</p>
            <p>13. If anie BISHOP shall giue Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to one notoriouslie ignorant, or scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
hee shall bee suspended from the power of
Ordination for a yeare, and the person orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
deprived.</p>
            <p>14. If anie BISHOP shall giue Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a Man that is not of his owne Diocesse,
concerning whome hee hath not receaved Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Dimissorie from his owne BISHOP, let
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17504:21"/>
the BISHOP bee suspended for a yeare, and the
Ordayned punished, as the ARCH-BISHOP
shall thinke fit.</p>
            <p>15. And since the residence of Bishops wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin
their Diocesses, is no lesse necessarie, than
is the residence of Presbyters within their Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins;
Who-so-ever shall remayne foorth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for the space of sixe monethes together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee bee employed by the <hi>KING,</hi> or by
the <hi>CHVRCH,</hi> for the first fault let him bee
suspended from the Profites of his Bishopricke,
for a whole yeare; the second tyme, for two
whole yeares: and for the third fault, deprived
of his Bishopricke.</p>
            <p>16. In lyke manner, If hee doe not holde
his Visitations duelie, and redresse such Abuses
as are presented vnto him, so farre as hee is able,
or bee negligent in conventing Heretickes of all
sortes; so farre at least as hee is tyed by Law, let
him bee suspended a yeare from his <hi>BISHOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICKE,
toties quoties,</hi> hee shall bee found to
offende.</p>
            <p>17. If anie Arch-Bishop, or Bishop, shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie,
or indirectlie, bee proved to take Fee or
Money; for admitting anie into Sacred Orders,
let him bee deprived, as a <hi>Simoniacke,</hi> in the
highest degree, and declared, Not worthie of anie
Charge in the <hi>CHVRCH.</hi>
