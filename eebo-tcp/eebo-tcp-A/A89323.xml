         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have long been the object of many good mens pity and prayers, who have judged in charity that the temptations of your late Fathers Court have been too mighty for you. But now you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the object of their prayers and great expectations; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they thought you unable to prevent the wickedneſſe and apoſtacy which you have often ſeemed to mourn for in ſecret. But now the chief military power derived from any lawfull authority being fallen upon you, and all ſuch Officers and Souldiers in the Army as have any ſenſe of juſtice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in their uſe of arms, being ready to be commanded by you, and to rejoyce in their return to their firſt principles. They believe that God hath made your way plain before you to vindicate the profeſſion of Religion from the black re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that reſt upon it, to reſtore the peoples liberties, the Armies honour, and price of their bloud. And therefore they hope and pray that the Lord may ſay effectually to you upon this opportunity: <hi>Be thou ſtrong and of a good courage in this my work, and I will be with thee.</hi> But if you ſhould now ſit ſtill, they think as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eſther that deliverance and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall ariſe to the people from another; but you and your fathers houſe shall be deſtroyed.</hi> Now my Lord, do not imagine us either vain Enthuſiaſts or buſie bodies that thus mind you, what is expected from you. We are ſuch as engaged with you in the war againſt the late King, and do believe that you and we muſt render an account to the dreadfull God of the juſtice and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our intentions therein, and our ſouls are deeply affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to behold our righteous ends perverted, the bloud of our friends ſhed in the quarrell, trampled upon, the binding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of truſts, promiſes, and oaths, ſlighted, and the ſame (if not worſe) principles of Arbitrary power, Tyranny, and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exerciſed, aſſerted, and maintained, againſt which we have ſo earneſtly contended with a prodigall expence of our bloud and eſtates; and our hearts are wounded to hear our old cauſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115182:4"/>
now made a mock and by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>word by our enemies, and to ſee ſuch a black brand of infamy ſet upon all the Parliaments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, as if they had been all the vileſt hypocrites, who made pretences of Religion, and faithfulneſſe to their Countries Laws and Liberties, to be only a cloak for the blackeſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, as if none of them had ever intended any more, then by force and fraud to fat up themſelves upon the bloud and ruines of other families. But your Lordſhip knows, that the Kings invaſion of our properties and liberties, by taxes, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall impriſonments, and oppoſition of the Parliament in their ſupreme truſt of ordering the Militia for the peoples ſafety, did neceſſitate us to defend it by arms, as our native right, that the truſt of the peoples ſafety and welfare, their ſtrength, and purſes, was only in the hands of their ſucceſſive Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that they ought to be governed only by the Laws: And their conſciences, perſons, or eſtates, to be at no mans will or mercy; And doubtleſſe the defence of theſe Liberties is eſſentially neceſſary to the well being of any Nation, and to the being of publick morall righteouſneſs amongſt men. And your Lordſhip knows that all the ſucceſſes and victories have been owned, as from the wonderfull appearance of God for his people in this honeſt cauſe, and that you cauſed the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the chief Magiſtracie in <hi>England</hi> by a ſingle perſon to be aboliſh'd, becauſe it was dangerous to this righteous cauſe, as well as uſeleſſe and burdenſome. Now my Lord, let us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your conſcience whether we ought not to expect thoſe things we do, we are unwilling leſt it ſhould wound too deep to make a compariſon between the principles of Tyrannie and oppreſſion that were attempted to be practiſed by the late King, and were declared by you to be begotten by the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous arrogance of Tyrants upon their ſervile paraſites, and thoſe that have been practiſed &amp; avowed ſince God gave us victorie in the defence of our Liberties (and though we confeſſe the greateſt number of honeſt men have hitherto leaſt ſmarted under them, yet they will infallibly have the greateſt weight of them upon their backs hereafter, ſhould thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples get root amongſt us, they being the only likely men to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115182:4"/>
deſtroy them, and however, injuſtice againſt Enemie ought to be abhorred by righteous Men.) But let us tell your Lordſhip that it is the ſecret ſigh of every honeſt heart: Oh that God would now take away the reproach from this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their eyes are much upon you in it, and ſhoud you ſlight our eyes and expectations in this caſe, aſſuredlie the blood of our friends ſhed in the Cauſe, will crie aloud for vengeance againſt you.</p>
            <p>We have better thoughts of your Lordſhip, then that you ſhould ſeek to ſhelter your ſelf in your omiſſion of ſo great a Dutie, or in your proceeding in the evils begun under thoſe vain ſubterfuges which have been uſed of late: Oh be not deceived with pretences of Providences of God, leading you from your old Cauſe into things not to be juſtified by the morall Lawes. The holie God directs his People only into the paths of Righteouſneſſe, that is ſuch Actions as agree with his Lawes, 1, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 7, 8, 10. <hi>He that doth not Righteouſneſs is not of God,</hi> His Providences and his Lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alwaies ſpeak the ſame things, neither let any man deceive you with pretence of neceſſitie that conſtrains you to deſert your old Principles for the People of Gods ſake and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Chriſts Kingdome; For 'tis not poſſible there ſhould be neceſſitie to tranſgreſſe a Divine naturall Law that is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, there may be caſes of extream inevitable neceſſitie, that may diſoblige a man from ſome Divine poſitive Lawes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Superior that is a Divine, naturall Law may oblige him in that caſe; Therefore in everie caſe of higheſt nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſities, the immutable Lawes of Nature ought to be Guides and Commanders of what is to be done: And if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can make your Actions or Omiſſions conſiſt with thoſe, neither God nor his People will blame you. And in ſo doing onelie, you can advance Chriſts Kingdome: For then is he exalted when ſupream Reverence, and abſolute ſubjection is given to his Fathers Lawes in the deniall of our ſelves in all Countermands and Temptations, and when the ſword of the Spirit is uſed to increaſe the number of ſuch Subjects: For this Scepter, Throne and Wars are of and in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115182:5"/>
Therefore, we beſeech your Lordſhip without heſitation or delay, purſue the exaltation of Chriſt and his Kingdom, in following in ſimplicity and integrity of heart after thoſe righteous ends you propoſed and declared in the late warre, and unto which you have obliged your ſelf by all the ſacred Bonds of humane ſocietie: be not affrighted with ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, bugbears of Confuſion, if you ſhake the <hi>Diana,</hi> by which they hope to ſubſiſt, fear not aſſiſtance from every honeſt heart in <hi>England,</hi> and though ſome pretenders to honeſty, may out of cowardiſe, or ambition, or covetouſneſs, cry, ther's a Beare and a Lion in the way, yet even they ſhall run after you when they ſee you forward in your way; And to avoid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, let us beſeech your Lordſhip firſt to examine your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience preſently what you can anſwer to the blood of any poor Saint ſhed, that cries in your ears to ſettle that Libertie and Juſtice in his Countrie for which he ſhed his blood under your command.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what you can anſwer to the blood of Thouſands of the enemies, which are eſteemed by God as murdered by you if the Iuſtifick cauſe of the war be not effectually proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Will not their blood crie to God, and ſay, Lord, this <hi>Fleetwood</hi> killed us upon pretence that we ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied the Liberties of the People of God, in impoſing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie power upon them, which we did ignorantlie? And he hath done the ſame thing, and made or ſuffered more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Yokes to be impoſed; Pray remember it, The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Thinkeſt thou O Man, that judgeſt another, and doest the ſame things thy ſelfe, that thou shalt eſcape the iudgement of God,</hi> Rev. 1. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We beſeech you to examine what Cauſe you now maintain with conſtant expence of blood, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Eſtates, and how you can give an account to God for it. Remember what are the cauſes for which God alloweth mens blood to be ſhed without blood-guiltineſſe in him that cauſeth it; and trie whether that be one, to make a Nation greater ſlaves to <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Styles</hi> and his Confederates, then they would have been to <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Nokes.</hi> But we praie your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip if it be poſſible that anie pretence can be found for it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115182:5"/>
ſtate a juſtifick Cauſe of your preſent poſture of Arms, that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of tender conſciences may be ſatisfied how to pray for you in any of your preſent deſignes, if God ſhould not honour you in the work which they now expect from You.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now My Lord,</hi> if we would plead with you by worldly Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or motives, that concern your ſelf, it were eaſie to evince, that ſafetie, honour, and greatneſs to your ſelf, and familie, can be certainlie compaſſed by no other means, then by returning to the Principles from whence you are fallen, your daily tenors that now attend you and your Counſells, would ſoon vaniſh, you might have above threeſcore thouſand men of honeſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that would take themſelves concern'd to be in armes at an houres warning to aſſiſt you, and this without ſecond charge, and an armie of praiers 2. times as great, indeed who would or could hurt you, if you were a naked ſincere follower of that which is good. We appeal to your conſcience, whether you do not believ that your late Father was more ſafe with a Foot-boy onelie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him in the ſtreets when he was believed to intend that good that your Lordſhip may if you pleaſe effect, then he was afterwards (when he was believed to intend his own ambition) invironed with Guards, and encloſed with locks, and bolts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number; Indeed the onelie meanes of ſafetie for ſuch as will exerciſe great power over a people to the ſubjection of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, is a mercenarie Armie. And if that conſiſts of ſome of the ſame people, their intereſt will change as often as they get eſtates that are of more value then their pay, and then they will be readie to conſpire with any of the people to provide libertie and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their eſtate for their children, and then the power of the Tirants ſhake, And of how manie ſlaughters of the Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell do we read by their own ſervice; &amp; if mercenarie ſtrangers be intended to be Guards for Rulers in England, our Anceſtors taught us the way, when they were not ſo well inſtructed in their libertie to ridd our ſelves of them in a night, But if your own perſon could be ſecure for a while; what will be the portion of your familie, if th eir perſons and eſtates be left to the mercie of him that gets uppermoſt, And if you expect greatneſſe or honor, conſider whoſe names are delivered to us from former ages with reverence, and eſteem, and who have been moſt admired, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

            <p>WE preſumed lately to mind your Lordſhip of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent oportunity, and moſt important duty, and our ſouls wiſh that the the ſecrets of your thoughts upon it were revealed, that our hearts and prayers might be towards you, and for you accordingly we muſt tell your Lordſhip that you have ſince wounded the hearts of many precious Saints, by conducting your Armie officers, in an action of ſuch groſs hypocriſie, and palpable flattery, as that addreſſe you made to your new Protector, we have reaſon to believe that it had been impoſſible for your Lordſhip to have ſaid privately to an honeſt man without bluſhing, what you have ſaid there to the world under your hand, and if your Lordſhip will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (with God in your eye) what is ſaid of your father, and your brother in it, and of an unknown connexion between his perſon and your cauſe, which a lſo you cannot now, and as now (ſtate to your own conſcience as juſt,) we are confident your heart will ſmite you, and if your own heart condemn you, God is greater then your heart, and muſt much more condemn you. Truly my Lord, we were much ſtartled in our hopes from you, and praiers for you, (and we hear the ſame of others) when we ſaw that addreſſe, yet our remembrance of your ſecret expreſſions even with tears, of your ſenſe of the Armies backſlidings, and your earneſt intreaties of us to pray for you, together with the great reſpect we have, for your Lordſhip hath inclined us ſtrongly to the beſt thoughts of you, ſometimes ſaying one to another, ſurely he had not read our letter before his Addreſſe, yet we have been ſo ſtumbled, that we had troubled your Lordſhip no farther in this kind, if God had not ſo placed the intereſt of his cauſe and people upon our ſpirits, that we are reſtleſſe within our ſelves, untill we have ſaid ſo much, as may be either effectuall upon your heart, or at leaſt diſcharge our conſciences, and leave you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. If therefore the Lord hath made us his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers to you, and revived his fear in your heart, whileſt you conſidered what we ſent you, we have reaſon to conclude
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115182:7"/>
that you are come to theſe reſolves in your owne breaſt, viz. 1. That the peoples arms of this nation have been committed to your charge in your ſeverall capacities, as a ſteward of that high truſt for them, to imploy them for their benefit, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their rights and freedome, and that you muſt give an account to the eternall God of that ſtewardſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That you are under all poſſible ſacred and indiſpenſable obligations to be faithfull in your truſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the cauſe for which you were truſted was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain the peoples right to make laws for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thereby provide for their own welfare and ſafety, by ſuch perſons as they ſhould chuſe, and that without the negative controule of the King, and alſo to defend the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their conſciences, perſons, and eſtates, in being over the only government of their own laws, without ſubjection to the will or mercie of any man.</p>
            <p>And we ſuppoſe you may alſo conclude that you have now power and oportunitie caſt upon you to ſecure this libertie unto Gods people, according to humane prudence beyond the reach of wicked men, and that if you ſhould hide your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of power, in the napkins of fear, cowardiſe, ambition, or ſelf-intereſt, you will be condemned from the mouth of your own conſcience, for an unprofitable and unfaithfull ſervant.</p>
            <p>Now if God hath enabled your Lordſhip thus to conſider, with a pure underſtanding, and with integritie of heart thus to reſolve, we know you are continually ſaying within your ſelf, men and brethren what ſhall I doe, to ſhew my faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the cauſe of God, and the people, and to vindicate my poſſeſſion from ſcandall; and in hopes that God hath thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed your heart, we ſhall endeavour to inquire into your particular dutie.</p>
            <p>And in our ſearch we may aſſert this generall maxime, as an infallible pillar to guide you in your preſent dutie to your generation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the peoples liberties cannot be laſtingly ſecured to them by any other means, then an inſtitution of ſenſe, wiſe order or method, wherein the people may make and execute their own laws, and uſe their own arms and ſtrength,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115182:7"/>
for the common good of the whole ſocietie. This may direct all your Lordſhips thoughts and debates, about a ſettlement, and keep in your eieperpetually the white mark wherein all your deſignes and contrivances of publick concernment, ought to centre; this may prepare you, to paſſe a quick ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon all the ambitious propoſals of your Court-para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, this may cut off all thoſe Court debates, about impowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Prince, to check and controul the people by his nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in their making their laws. It ought to be no queſtion, whither the people ſhould make their own laws, God himſelf having reſolved it, the very point being the ſingle point whereupon you joyned Battell at firſt with the King, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that the Parliaments Ordinance for the <hi>Malitia,</hi> was a Law without the Kings conſent, and he denying it to be of any force, and affirming thoſe Traitors, that obeied that, and not his <hi>Commiſsions of Array</hi> (this by the Kings Confeſſion was the firſt quarrel) this libertie then being their bloud, cannot be taken from them, but by the higheſt robberie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Obligations to God and Man. Therefore your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips dutie is no more then to contrive the beſt, moſt prudent form, and order, wherein the people may injoy their own, with the leaſt hazard of being preyed upon by Tirants, or being diſquieted by their own ignorant diſorders and confuſions: Your dutie to the people, is like to that of a Guardian to an Heir, Not to give them an Eſtate, but to ſet down rules, how it ſhall be ordered for them, and they put in quiet Poſſeſſion of it, to their moſt advantage and ſecuritie, and this dutie is the more incumbant upon you, becauſe you have broken, and trampled to pieces, beyond repair all thoſe old Chriſtian forms, wherein they formerly injoyed their liberties, though with continuall Diſputes, and ſubject to daily injuries and oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>Now before we propoſe to your Lordſhip any Form or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſettled, it is fit that we diſcover to you the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and inconſiſtencies, of your preſent practices, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing deſign, both in themſelves, and in relation to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples liberties.</p>

Firſt, it's a grand errour in the foundation, if you imagine it poſſible to ſecure libertie or juſtice to the people, onelie by advancing good men to power over them, and truſting to the grace in their hearts, to rule in righteouſneſſe, good men upon the ſingle account of mortalitie, can be no laſting bottom, whereupon to ſettle liberty and juſtice. It's beyond the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man, to contrive an infallible proviſion, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age that the ruling power in the ſucceeding age, ſhall fall onelie into good mens hands, but what age ever produced men of ſuch enlightned pure minds? that of themſelves could diſcern right at all times, without the leaſt cloud of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt upon their underſtandings, and alſo purſue ſuch dictates of their minds, without interruptions by corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; we mention this, not as if our Souls did not wiſh, that all powers were veſted in the beſt of men, but becauſe we know that every man is vanitie, and a Lie; and yet we believe, it is often whiſpered in your eares, by ſome weak well meaning men, that honeſt mens liberty would then be ſecure, and they ſatisfied, if they could ſee good men put into power, ſaying we ſhould then need no lawes, for they would be a law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, having Gods law in their hearts, but thoſe that thus by conſequence beg advancement, know not what they ask, ſcarce intending to be the peoples lords and to rule them as their ſlaves, which is neceſſarily employed in the arbitrarie power they ask; neither do they apprehend, what horrid impietie it is, for any man in England now to erect, and exerciſe an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie power, they ſee not the blaſphemous arrogancy of ſuch as rule without lawes, being indeed, an attempt to erect their throne, in it's kind, higher then Almightie Gods, who rules and judges onelie according to his lawes, without which there is neither juſtice, nor injuſtice in things humane, or divine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the peoples ſecurity of libertie, and juſtice, muſt be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon excellent lawes, or conſtitutions, for the continued order, from generation to generation, wherein the people ſhall chuſe their own lawes and magiſtrates, and if good men in power, will in ſimplicitie and integritie joyn heads, hearts, and hands to eſtabliſh ſuch an order, or forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will be worthilie eſteemed the founders, though
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115182:8"/>
not the foundation of our Liberties.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, 'tis a groſſe miſtake, to think that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the peoples Liberties, and the creating of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince over them, (under whatſoever title) can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together, we mean ſuch a Prince or Potentate, the tenure of whoſe power, ſhall not be upon the people, and who ſhall not be ſubject, and accomptable to the Lawes of this Commonwealth, doubtleſſe the people may not be free, where there ſhall be a chief Magiſtrate, whoſe deſerved real honour and greatneſſe, may juſtly make him diſdain to look down upon the Throne of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, yet if he ſhares in the Soveraigntie, he ſubverts Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and the foundation of his own glorie: the very eſſence or formall reaſon of a Nations freedom, conſiſts in the peoples making their own Lawes and Magiſtrates, and therefore it is a contradiction to ſay, we are free under a Prince controling our Lawes in their Creation, or Execution, and impoſing his Officers upon us at his will and the conſequence of that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, even in our late Kings, hath cauſed all our preſent bloudie ruines, his Officers being naturally inclined, and reſolved to ſerve their Creator, to the ſubverſion of our Lawes and Liberties; beſides, if a Prince be inveſted with the leaſt Punctilio of the Soveraigntie, it is exceeding vain to imagine, that he ſhould not naturally aſpire to the top of it: every thing having an innate deſire of its owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and there being no other viſible meanes to preſerve from the peoples reach, that part which hee hath, but the deſtruction of their Libertie, you may as well ſuppoſe, fire not to aſcend, as ſuch a Prince not to be wiſhing and aſpiring to be an abſolute Lord, if he had neither ambition, nor pride in himſelf, nor in his appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes, his Court Paraſites, yet the unavoydable reciprocall fear, in the people, and ſuch a Prince, leaſt each ſhould diſpoil the other of his ſhare of Soveraigntie, will compell the Prince to provide for his own ſecuritie, and do your Lordſhip think he will believe himſelf ſafe, untill he hath ſet himſelf above the peoples reach, and brought them to depend upon his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115182:9"/>
will? It may be he that you would create Prince with a ſmall ſhare of Soveraginty, would at firſt thinke his power great, yet in continuance he would eſteem it ſmal, men naturally reaching beyond what they have attained; Liberty therefore and Principalitie, are incompatible, and can never laſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: It ſeems ſtrange to a People, that they ſhould be free, and yet ſerve, and be impoſed upon it's ſtrange to a Prince, that he ſhould be chief Lord and not command; The meane of Libertie, is the Mother of Murder, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie; any Freedome from Princes Commands being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to them, they by Violence take it away, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, and that forceth a Violent brutiſh Tyrany, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Government, We need not look farre for an inſtance of this, the bloud and ſufferings of our Anceſtours, and our own Age, witneſſe it, hath not our Princes and Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours been alwayes ſtrugling for four hundred yeares, and thouſands periſhed in it, that are known, beſides the ruine of many Worthies which no Hiſtory durſt mention, unleſſe with Infamie, to pleaſe the Tyrants, And your Lordſhip hath ſeen, with what an Earth-quake, Libertie ſubverted Principalitie, when it found Opportunitie. Therefore, if you wiſh us, and our Poſterities no greater good then onely Quiet, it behooveth you to make us wholly Free, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Slaves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is no ſmall fayler of foreſight, that you may imagine it feaſible in this Nation, at this time, to eſtabliſh a Principalitie, or Monarchie, of any probable continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, unleſſe you can deſtroy all preſent Reall Properties and veſt all, or moſt of the Lands of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> in your Monarch. Every Princes Power of Command muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe either from a voluntarie Submiſſion, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a People to ſerve him, as their Lord, or from a Violent Compulſion, of them to be ſubject to Him, and both thoſe are founded upon an inequalitie, between him and them, either reall or apparent. A Peoples willingneſſe to ſerve a Prince (if any ſuch be) ariſeth from their apprehenſion

               </gap>ion between him and them, either in vertue, intereſt, or power. The two firſt are proper to a Prince in his native countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or one that hath dominion over only a ſovereign Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who may be thought powerfull to one people, the laſt may be proper to protect a people, and that may be choſen a s the leaſt of ſome impudent miſchiefs; but if any people ever were, or ſhall be voluntarily ſubject to a Prince, upon their high opinion of his unequall tranſcendent vertue, that related only to his perſon, and never was or can be a ſolid foundation for an hereditary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but an unequall intereſt in the lands, may be, and is the common cauſe, either of a voluntary or conſtrained ſubjection: no man ſerves for nought, 'tis the need that people have of the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that procures him ſervants, and enables him to compell ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> that new moulded the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarchy, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a way for the King to get all the poſſeſſions into his hands, that ſo the people might ſerve <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which was a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. 'Tis evident that the relation of maſters and ſervants would ſoon be baniſhed the world, if all mens intereſts, vertues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtrength were equall, and much ſooner would the names of princes and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be for ever razed out of memory; ſurely then (my Lord) 'tis beyond diſpu e that if you intend to ſettle a Monarchy over us, it muſt be by violence, for it cannot enter into your heart, to imagine, that you ſhall find a man, whoſe glorious vertues ſhall be as a Sun amongſt the ſtars compared with all the vertues in this nation, and thoſe alſo to be ſurely intailed upon his heirs, neither can your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pretend, to find any family, whoſe intereſt in the lands is now ſo unequall, to the bulk of the people, that the nation ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by their intereſt to ſerve them.</p>
            <p>Now that a compulſive ſubjection to a Monarchy, muſt be the product of an unequall power, is as good as written with a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam, he that forceth muſt be ſtronger then-he that is forced, and 'tis as evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch a power is the only naturall fruit of an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall intereſt in the lands, upon which the beaſt of force muſt graze, that bears the Monarch power to force a nation, cannot be inherent in a ſingle perſon, and multitudes of hands, neither can nor will ſerve him to ſubj<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ons of ſervice; and therefore they will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of the land owners, only as the common thieves, whoſe hands are againſt every man, and ought to have every mans hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the robbery being in ſuch a caſe, to be renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon the land-owners, and the wound alwaies ſmarting, 'tis of more conſtant danger, to ſubvert the Monarch, then it were for him to cut the throats of ten thouſand land-owners at once, and poſſeſſe the lands, to plant his forces upon, as their ſtanding-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon their maſters own lands, either for their lives, or during his pleaſure. Surely (my Lord) it's not to be denied, that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in his domeſtick dominions, hath no greater rooted continuing power over a nation, then he hath an intereſt in the lands, ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in value, the intereſt of the whole people, as that intereſt grows, by murders, oppreſſion, and the other common artifices of Princes, (unleſſe the wrath of God interpoſeth) ſo doth his power root, and flouriſh, all other ſeeming power of a Monarch, hangs as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant uſe to ſay, by Geometry, and is without bottome; 'tis a tree whoſe root is dead, and may be kept up a little while by dead props that decays with it. 'Tis like an armies foraging into an enemies countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and plundering, not being able to gain the poſſeſſion of a town, caſtle, or houſe there, as a root of power over it. Indeed, no form of domeſtick government can be eſtabliſht to be of duration, in a nation, chiefly living upon their lands, if property in the land do not accompany the Empire, that is, if that order which governs (be it one man, or the few, or the people) do not poſſeſſe a greater ſhare of the land of that countrey, then the reſt of the people that are governed; and therefore where the Adminiſtration is moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular; ſervants, and all ſuch as have no eſtates are reckoned to have no ſhare, or voices in the government. And we conceive, thatt the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115182:10"/>
founders of governments, have either framed their models, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ballance of property, which they found amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or elſe have divided the property, and reduced it to their form. And your Lordſhip may remember when God himſelf formed the people of Iſrael, by <hi>Moſes</hi> hand, into a free Common-wealth, there was not only a ſuitable diviſion of the lands at the firſt, but a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall law of Jubilee, to prevent alienation of lands, and the growth of any to ſuch unequall intereſt, as his power might be dangerous to the government, and when that people rejected Gods form of their Common wealth for a Monarch, he foretold them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11. 17. that the firſt work of their King would be to alter the modell of property in the lands, ſettled by God and take away the beſt of their fields, vineyards, and olive-yards, and give them to his ſervants, for ſtrengthening himſelf, and ſo they ſhould become his ſervants. And if we ſhould not trouble your Lordſhip too much, we would ſhew from Hiſtory, that all the laſting Monarchies that ever were in the world, have been built upon this foundation, of poſſeſſing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſt in their countreys lands, either immediately, or by their Peers and their powers, being the naturall reſult of that, they have had their births, decays, and deaths together. Some kingdomes we ſay have been founded upon the Monarchs immediate intereſt, or property in the lands, as many ancient <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Kings, and the <hi>Turk,</hi> with other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Princes at this day, who are ſole proprietors or Landlords of the whole Territories where they reign, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their tenants at will, or at beſt for life, upon conditions of ſervice in war, proportionable to the value af their farms, whereby the <hi>Turk</hi> keeps an abſolute power over his ſubject by their dependance upon his will for their bread, and with his own proper revenue is able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to maintain an army of ſtrangers to ſtrengthen the other tie, he hath upon his vaſſalls, and upon this root of his property, (to the eye of humane reaſon) his power has grown to that monſtrous height Others kingdomes have been built upon the property in the lands, which the Monarchs, Peers, have had joyntly with and under him: ſo were theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> dominions after their conqueſt by the <hi>Northern</hi> people, who divided a land, when conquered, into ſo many parcels, as they had great Officers, leaving the choice of the beſt and largeſt ſhare to their Prince or leader, he becoming their King, and the

            <p>My Lord, wee hope it will be clear to your Lordſhip, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is now become an unnatural ſoyl for a Monarch. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the World by various providences hath ſo divided the land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the bulk of the people, that they can live of themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſerving, and it is prepoſterous to impoſe a Monarch upon us, as to make a law, that the weaker ſhall alwaies binde the ſtronger; we believe it no leſs impoſſible to eſtabliſh a laſting Monarch in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland without alteration of the intereſt, the multitude hath in the lands, and naturall power, then it were to ſettle a firm laſting free State, or Commonwealth in the Turkiſh Territories, ſuffering the <hi>Ottoman</hi> to Family to remain the ſole Landlord of the Territories, as now he is; and we ſuppoſe, that obvious objection, that England hath been a Monarchy for many hundred years, is clearly anſwered, from what we have ſaid, if you will take us as conquered, as much by your Army, as by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and think to ſettle a Monarchy like theirs, in a new line; you ſee the Materialls, for your building and theirs, are of a different form, and can never make a like buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; England then yielded earth to the Conqueror, by vaſt Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and Baronies, for the plantation of his new Potentates, and a few confiſcations or forfeitures made his own and his creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the lands to exceed all the reſt; beſides, the temper of the people, to whom any property in the land was left, was much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that you now finde, they being then bred to learn, and know no better; now being bred in ſome liberty, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall claim of the whole. Neither can your Lordſhip with reaſon hope to prop up a new Monarchy, by an Army of Natives, to be paid by Taxes, if you conſider how ſoon their Eſtates of inheritance and naturall love to poſterity, with their independency upon the Monarch, a diſguſt of the univerſall Odium, they muſt live under by extorting Taxes, will make them eſpouſe the nationall intereſt as their own, as did the forreign plants of the <hi>Normans,</hi> when rooted in lands of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, ſo that no ſort of Armes, to be maintained by a meet Tax, can long ſupport a Monarch, becauſe the very Tax, if nothing elſe, create's and maintain's him Enemies that have roots in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,

when his friends have none: we could now ſhew your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip invincible difficulties (as our Caſe is) to found a Monarchy though you ſhould confiſcate to your ſelves moſt of the peoples ends, to make your land property over weigh al the reſt but we believe the confiſcation of a people, that have never fought againſt you, but whoſe armes you have borne, to be an act ſo unnaturall and ſo full of blackneſſe and horrour, that it can never be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted room in your thoughts, and therefore we ſhall ſay nothing of it.</p>
            <p>Fourhly, but my Lord thereis a fourth miſtake that deſerves the firſt place in the file of Errors, that is, to conceive it poſſible to ſettle your Brother <hi>Richard</hi> and his heirs as our Prince, to ſhare in the Sovereign power, if the wounds of Monarchiall power in England, were not mortall, doubtleſſe his art and experience renders not him to be a Surgeon fit for the cure; it was poverty and famine that ſhot his deadly arrow into the heart of our Monarchy, and no plaiſter can heal it, but Mammon to make it ſelf new friends, and do your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip judge his eſtate and property ſufficient to make him friends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to compell this Nation to ſubjection? what can a prudent man fancy as a foundation of his Empire? wherein is the equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the people, even in your opinion, or the dictates of the preſent Armies conſcience? it was ſaid in the laſt Parlament fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that he was a ſtranger to the people of God, unknown to the Army, having never actually drawn ſword, and one that was never obſerved to have had any affection for the Parlaments Cauſe; if your Lordſhip pleaſe to conſider it, you will finde ſuch diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges attends your Brother, in his aſpiring to the Throne, as would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſettlement very doubtfull, if the baſis for Monarchy ſtood firm in England; We pray your Lordſhip think of the primary of his Education, the tenderneſs of his years, the meaneneſſe of hisnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority, the ſlenderneſs of his reputation as ſoldier, or Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and above all, the hatred and contempt the people hath conceived him; either of which, is ſufficient to ruine a ſettled Prince; and adde unto theſe, the claime and pretence he ſets up, by pretending to be our Prince, for <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> againſt himſelfe: (whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and friends forreign and domeſtique may at the leaſt be put in the ballance with your Brothers) which gives life to a growing root of a civill Warr; and adde farther, your rendring all knowing

            <p>Now my Lord, when we think upon theſe things, and the work you are called to, 'tis evident to us that God hath hedged up all the by-waies from your duty with thorns, or rather ſeas and mountains of difficulties, and made the path of righteouſneſſe plain and eaſy. 'Tis your duty to reſtore the people to their liberty, and lay ſolid foundations of common right and juſtice amongſt them, and in the natural courſe and order of things, it appears almoſt impoſſible to make them ſlaves. Oh then give glory to God, vindicate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of religion, and make your own name as ſweet odours to all generations in doing your duty, as a freewill-offering, chearfully and ſpeedily, leaſt your own neceſſities, and the peoples confuſions ſhould extort it from you. Your only buſineſſe then my Lord) is to ſettle the order for the continuall ſucceſſive aſſemblies of the people, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115182:13"/>
make their own laws and Magiſtrates, all preſent forms being broken by you, and an abſolute neceſſity upon you, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what ſhall be next, though you would return back to that imperfect form of Parliaments that's now become unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us as a free people. For it is eſſentially neceſſary to the ſecuritie of freedome, that the ſame aſſemblie ſhould never have the debating and finally reſolving power in them, leaſt it ſuddenly degenerates into an Oligarchie or Tyrannie of ſome few, that aſſembly being in ſuch a caſe able to perpetuate themſelves. Of this the providence of God hath given as an experiment in the long Parliament, who exerciſing both the debating and determining power, were ſtrongly tempted to have made themſelves perpetually legiſlators, and what elſe they pleaſe, and to have governed according to their private intereſts, which if it had taken effect, would have as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the common intereſt and common right, vertue and liberty, as the ſame power exerciſed by a ſingle perſon, who doth alſo naturally make his whole government, centre in his particular intereſt. Therefore the order that hath alwaies been in effect amongſt free people, (although with ſome variation of names and circumſtances) hath been this: They have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked themſelves into three orders, the people, the Senate, and the Magiſtrate, whereby they have made themſelves partakers of all the benefit of the naturall Democracy, Ariſtocracy, and Monarchy; that is, they have had the good effects of all the excellent endowments for rule and order, which God hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to any of their people, and by the wiſe diſtribution of the power amongſt them, with controuls to every of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, unto which they were prone, they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the miſchiefs apt to enſue, when the governing power happened to be placed ſolely in any of the three. By the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is to be underſtood, (in large populous places where the body of the people is too large to meet) the popular aſſembly choſen by the body of the people of intereſts and eſtates, who have right of ſufferage amongſt us. This Counſell or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ought to be numerous, as one thouſand or more, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115182:14"/>
their function ought to be, to give their affirmative or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to all laws, matters of peace, warre, and leveys of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that without debate, or arguing, which would bring in confuſion in ſo great an aſſembly. Therefore the matters ought always to be propoſed by the Senate, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time before, that the popular aſſembly may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed of them, before their meeting, and then they are to be ſummoned to meet, by one of their own choice for that purpoſe: and therefore they ought to reſide near the chief Citie, for the time of their power, which may be for two or three years, one third going out of Office every year the Aſſembly being filled by a new choice, and this is called the Power of the Common wealth; The Senate is the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Authoritie of the Common-wealth, which is a ſelect Company, not very numerous, choſen by the whole People at the ſame time and in the ſame manner with the popular Councell, and to continue for the ſame ſpace, with the ſame changes and recruits: The Office of this Councell, is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage affairs of Peace and Warrs, when the people hath De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, and to prepare all Lawes and Decrees, ready for their Sufferage, to command the Forces by Sea and Land, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch Lawes and Orders as ſhall be either Fundamental to the Government, (for there ought to be an Inſtrument of Government) or made from time to time by the Senate, and the people. So that the Senate is to debate and propoſe, and the people to Decree and reſolve all Lawes going in the name of both of theſe Deputies, both Senate and People ought to have moderate Sallaries allowed them, to prevent corruption, and in ſome recompence for the neglect of their private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, thoſe of the popular Aſſembly may have fourty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> week, &amp; thoſe of the Senate may have five hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> their pains, care, and expence, being to be probably much greater, regard being alſo had to their qualitie, now if it ſhould not be provided in the foundation, that the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſſembly ſhould not aſſume the debate, it would come to an Anarchie; but <hi>Athens,</hi> which periſhed by that means: and if the Senate ſhould take upon them the reſult, it would ſoon be an Oligarchy, (or Tyranny of a few) For they might
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115182:14"/>
with a Vote perpetuate themſelves, and govern the Nation according to their private intereſt; but both Counſels can never agree to perpetuate themſelves, for the popular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Office, being not of profit, but burden, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable when out of that Office, to be choſen into the Senate, which is of more profit and authoritie, it would be againſt their intereſt, which is the moſt certain Bond upon Mankind) to perpetuate themſelves, and the yearly change of a third in each Councels, bringing the whole number by Succeſſive Changes, ſo ſuddenly into their private Capacities, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Good, or ſuffer the harmes of what is done by the Councell, in an equalitie with the whole people, it is of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impulſe, that the whole Government, ſhould be onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the publicke reaſon and intereſt, and cannot be imagined to deviate from the proper ends of Government, neither can any Brazen-wall, be ſo firm and laſting, againſt the private Intereſt and Pretence of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> as the moulding the people into theſe Orders, there being no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the Senate and people ſhould agree to de-throne themſelves, to be yoaked by a Monarch: And we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that no people formed into theſe Orders, if their number held any neer proportion to lie under Monarchie, were ever yet ſubdued by a Monarch, from the beginning of the World, untill this Day, unleſſe they were firſt broken in pieces by themſelves, through ſome inequalitie in the Conſtitution of their Orders, but mightie Monarchs have been often led Captives by ſuch people.</p>
            <p>The third Order, is the Magiſtracy, wherein ſome are Chiefe, ſome ſubordinate, ſome Senatorian, ſome Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and are choſen accordingly, being all changeable, at certain times, and wholly ſubject to the Lawes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Common-wealth. And the Office of theſe, is to execute impartially all the Lawes made as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. It is poſſible it may conſiſt with the Common Intereſt, to have one chiefe Magiſtrate, in whom the Title &amp; Honour of the Common-wealth, may reſide in publicke Solemnities and addreſſes; So that no publick Action bee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115182:15"/>
left to his diſcretion, We ſhall not mention the Excellent Order of Armes, that is the Conſequence of Caſting a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into this Forme, whereby they ſubſiſt, and become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible by their own Armies, not by Mercinaries. We onely mention the firſt Forme, wherein the Foundation of Libertie to a people ought to be laid, that is by Eſtabliſhing the Popular Aſſembly, the Senate, and the Magiſtracy; theſe are Eſſentiall unto true Libertie, the Superſtructures have differed amongſt ſeverall free People, according to divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, We ſhall not preſume ſo well of our ſelves as to offer any Direction to your Lordſhip in them: but if God ſhall prepare your heart for ſuch a Worke of Righteouſneſs and Honour, we ſhall readily throw in our Mite of Advice to your Treaſury.</p>
            <p>My Lord, We have now not onely Cleared it to be your Lordſhips Duetie, to make us free, but ſhewed wherein the Foundation of our Libertie muſt be laid, and the ground is digged to your hand, the Lands being ſo diſtributed, that no one Man, or ſmall number of Men can over-power the whole People, by their poſſeſſions, If we thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to quicken your Affections to your Duetie, we could tell you from Reaſon and Experience how ſtrangely ſuch a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Libertie would transforme the manners of the people; Luxurie would Change into Temperance, Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Envie into Meekneſſe, and mutuall Love and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of Goodneſſe, ſervilitie aud baſeneſſe of minde, into Nobleneſſe and Generoſitie. Who would not follow Vertue for the Love? When neither alliance, flattery or any Vice, could make great, but a Generall Sentence from Popular Aſſemblies of Worth and Goodneſſe, we might tell you it would waſh foure Garments from the ſtaines of bloud, and the Armies honour from the black reproach that now covers it, and above all the profeſſion of religion from ſcandall and infamy; this would ſhew that you had nobler ends then yet the world believes to be in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: If ambition pricks in your breaſt, for your ſelf or your

brother; in thus doing you may ſet him upon a Throne more noble, lofty, and commanding, then ever the <hi>Stuarts</hi> poſſeſſed or deſigned. His free conjunction with your Lordſhip in this work may give him merit of greatneſſe in the ſouls of thoſe that now diſdain him, you may make your ſwords ſhine with a radiant glory beyond thoſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was only the ſame with that of the Plague and Peſtilence to deſtroy mankind, yours may reſtore liberty to England, and propagate it to mankind. And what ſhould hinder your Lordſhip, ſurely you can fear no reſiſtance in giving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their right, when you feared none in many deſtructive at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to their right &amp; freedomes, beſides you have an Army whoſe intereſts, conſciences, ingagements, yea their very paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections lead them this way, and in doing this you may extinguiſh all fears, and ſecure againſt all plots, and make all knowing men your voluntary vaſſalls in thankfulneſſe for their liberty. But if your private intereſt ſhould blind your Lordſhips eies, and lead you out of the paths of mercie, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and peace, to hew out a bloudy way to empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the naturall courſe of things. We believe it will not be long before oppreſſion and confuſion, the conſequences of ſuch violent actings wil extort that from you, which with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more trouble then to moddle the elections for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as they ought) you might give us above to your eternal honour.
