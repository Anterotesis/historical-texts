            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Covenant with God and with all men is Peace, and Life, and Light, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ends of the Earth, which is our Teſtimony to all men upon the Earth, and is not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them, which Covenant deſtroyeth the Devil and his works, the Author of all murderous Plots and treachery, betrayers which is under the Devils Kingdom, out of the truth and innocency and the Covenant of Light and life, which we have with God and all People, which ſeperates from ſin and evil, and deſtroys it; and in that is our peace, which is the Covenant, in which is no murderer, nor plotter, nor contriver, nor betrayer, ſo in that we ſeek the peace of all men, and have all men in eſteem, and the good of all men, in that we deny our ſelves and glory in the Croſs of Chriſt, the Power of God, which crucifies us from the World and their ploters and worldly things, and carnal weapons, and warrs, into ſpiritual weapons and war, with which we war, with the Devil and his works, which led People from God. But to plot and confederate, or to raiſe inſurrections, or to gather riotous meetings, or taking up arms outwardly, we utterly deny, and it is not our Principle, nor is it in the Covenant, for it is out of the Covenant, and Life, and Peace with God and the Light with men, though we cannot wear to this; for he that hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him, commands us not to ſwear at all, by Heaven nor Earth, nor any other Oath: but ſaith, in all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is more is evil, and to this is our nay, and ſo let the puniſhment be of yea or nay as for an Oath: and our yea is yea to that which is good, and nay nay to that which is contrary.</p>
            <p>The Lord God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son into the World, who hath all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth given to Him, and that all Power and Thrones, and Rule and Government ſhould be ſubject to him who is LORD of Lords and KING of Kings: and the Lord ſaith This is my beloved Son, hear ye him, this is the Prophet which Moſes ſaith like unto him that God would raiſe up, whom the People ſhould hear, whom we do hear that ſpeaks from Heaven. At ſundry times and in divers manners God ſpake to the Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but now in theſe laſt dayes hath ſpoken to us by his Son, which is the Heir of all things, upholding all things by his Word and Power, that hath all Power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth given to him as he ſaith himſelf, who ends the Prophets and the Iewes Power, and Authority and the Law, among whom was the Oath and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and firſt Covenant: and not only frivolous Oaths but true Oaths, that endeth the ſtrife and deſtroyeth the Devil the authour of it; which the Apoſtle brought as a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the ſubſtance of it we do enjoy (that is to ſay) Chriſt Ieſus to whom the Angels muſt bow: and His command to us is, Swear not at all, who ſaith He hath all Power in Heaven and in Earth given to him; but in all your communications keep to yea and nay, that are his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and his Meſſengers and Miniſters, obſerve it, as Iames 5. So if we love him we keep his Commandments and do the thing that he commands, but if we ſay we love him and keep not his Commandment, we are lyars and do not the thing commanded us: and we do know them that love him and keep his Commandments, in them dwelleth the love of God, and them that ſay they love God, and keep not his Commandments are lyars: And our yea is yea, and our nay is nay in that Doctrine of Chriſt who is the end of Oaths in the Law and firſt Covenant, Who are of the promiſe that remains, and are out of the promiſes of men that changeth: and we are out of Covenants with men that doe change, and in the Covenant of God with him that remaineth and doth not change, and cannot be broken, and in it is our yea, and our yea is yea in it, and our nay is nay in it, and if it be not ſo found among you and all People upon the earth from us, Let us ſuffer as much for the breaking it, as for breaking an Oath; For our life is in Chriſt Ieſus, Who was before murderous Plots were, that deſtroyes the Devil the Author of them, and our nay is againſt all murderous Plotters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers againſt the King or any of His People, or any man upon the Earth, &amp; we would have Him &amp; all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, Chriſt Ieſus, and that is our yea, for whoſe cauſe and ſake we do ſuffer, and this we will ſeal with our lives and eſtates and all, for which cauſe and teſtimony we have ſuffered all this while in eſtates and lives.</p>
            <p>Beyond Sea in Holland the Powers of the Earth and Magiſtrates that knows our friends cannot ſweare for conſcience ſake, does not force them nor impoſe fines upon them, neither impriſon them who keeps to yea and nay ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Doctrine. And Chriſt Ieſus ſaith ſwear not at all, Mat. 5.</p>
            <p>And Iames ſaith above all things my Brethren ſwear not at all Iames, 5. but let your yea be yea, and nay nay, for whatſoever is more cometh of evil.</p>
            <p>And in Turky paying tributes people may have their liberty to worſhip their God, and Paul had his liberty to preach in his own hired Houſe at Rome where the Emperours ſeat was, Acts. 18.13. though we paying our taxes are plucked out by the haire of the head from prayer out of our Houſes, and not ſuffered to pray together, as the Heathen would not ſuffer Daniel, and ſo this is contrary to the Apoſtles who ſaid pray every where, who met together in their ſeveral houſes, and went from houſe to houſe, Acts 2. .46. And this was the practice of the Church in the Primitive times which we obſerve, who were to edifie one another, and exhort one another, and build up one another, and pray for one another, and they was not to be tyed to one place, Synogogue or Temple, which the Iews were only, but ſome times they met on Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Hills, and ſometimes in Houſes.</p>
            <p>And the Church was in Aquilla and Priſcillas Houſe, 1. Cor. 16.19. there was a meeting ſet up in the primitive time.</p>
