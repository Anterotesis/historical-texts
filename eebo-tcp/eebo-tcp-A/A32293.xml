            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER I;</head>
            <p>YOurs of the 4th, Inſtant (which ſuppoſes me here at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and congratulates my arrival) came a day before me; for I left not <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſo ſoon by a fortnight as you imagined. Your Accounts <hi>I</hi> have ſleightly peruſed, but ſhall nothing to them till our Correſpondents at <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſend me theirs: nor can I ſtir from hence theſe ſeven Months; for (beſides the buſineſs I told you of) I muſt expect the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> which will not arrive till <hi>April;</hi> and in it I hope to find as much of 1. <hi>B</hi>'s effects, as will near ſatisfie the debt he owed me.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was at home (knowing the vain ſuſpitions of the Rabble) I neither ſent nor asked you any news; but now I am here, I by no means blame the deſire you have to underſtand the poſture of our affairs, &amp; how they have been managed; eſpecially ſince you pretend to no further an information (were I capable of more) than what any ſtranger that paſſes through the Countrey gives his acquaintance: I ſay I cannot blame this requeſt, having now the ſame favour alſo to ask of you, for the Relations I heretofore ſaw, were often very falſe and uncertain; nor can this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I hope, be any prejudice to our reſpective Governours, for what may be great ſatisfaction and news to thoſe in our ſphere, is none to them, who have ſpies (we are ſure) abroad, informing them at another rate of all occurrencies. But before I acquaint you with our misfortunes (too well known to the world) I muſt beg pardon, if for my eaſe (my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being long) I write in Dutch, which wants, I confeſs the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive harmony of your ſmooth and gentle Language.</p>
            <p>That <hi>John de Witt</hi> was a man of parts, is held by not a few of our wiſe ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet either his ignorance in the ſtate of your Kingdom (which has hidden myſteries in it not to be fathom'd, I think, by forreign Polititians) or God Almighties particular Judgment on thoſe that glory too much in the ſtrength of their underſtanding, brought him to that diſmal end, and with this misfortune alſo, as to be now eſteemed a fool and a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by the generality of his Countrey-men.</p>
            <p>Two irreconcileable piques he had to <hi>England:</hi> Firſt, becauſe from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thence he imagined, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would have a perpetual ſupport, and be at length the ruine of him and his Cabal: And ſecondly. by reaſon of its ſtrength, its Ships, its convenient Ports, &amp; inclination to Trade, 'twould at one time or other ingroſs all negotiation to it ſelf.

Theſe thoughts prompted him, and the reſt of them, inſtead of courting you in forrain Countries after the Peace, to countenance under hand all kind of private affronts &amp; Libels that could be invented, to leſſen you as well in our own eſteem, as among our Neighbours and Allies, and well m<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Though out Sea-men and Factors were thus a Gog, our Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours with you were ſufficiently ſubmiſs and pliant, calling it the drunken mirth of ſome private Subjects, and aſſuring your chief Miniſters, that our States valued your Monarch above all things; nor was it hard for them to believe this, ſeeing that he alone forced his Chriſtian Majeſty, in the height of his Conqueſt, to the peace of <hi>Aqui<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> was not ignorant, to be ſure, how much we wanted it's aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that it could never have a fairer occaſion to oblige us to do Juſtice (as you termed it) to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> who now was of a fit age to receive thoſe honours, which the merits of his Family had as 'twere entailed upon him.

            <p>Having done this, and not doubting of the acceptance of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſent to our Admirals, who were cruiſing with ſeveral Men of War, to ſtrike Flag to no ſingle Ship of yours; nor feared they any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, becauſe yo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Your King ſoon reſented this affront, and demanded Reparation with that warmth and vigour as was imagin'd, but whilſt Agents were paſſing to and fro, h<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your willingneſs nevertheleſs to accomodate all things with us, was not ſo pleaſing, as one would imagine, to <hi>De wit</hi> and his party; becauſe they knew that your terms would be much worſe as to their own intereſt than formerly; and therefore reſolving to give you no ſatisfaction, they buzz'd in every bodies ears, that your King had not a penny of money; That moſt of your Parliament being our Pentioners, would give him none; That the whole Nation hated the <hi>French,</hi> that not a Seaman of yours would fight; that your Non-conformiſts would be up in Arms: and in fine after a thouſand ſuch leſſening allegations, they declared it to be an unpardonable folly, to value or league with a people, that wanted both Fidelity and Power to help their Friends: all which noiſe ſpent not it ſelf in vain, but cauſed thouſands to believe you could do us neither harm nor good.</p>
            <p>The firſt unlook't for accident that touched our <hi>Politico</hi> to the quick, and made him tear his hair, was your King's poſtponing the Bankers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and converting the Receipts of the Exchequer to his own uſe; for now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all expectation, he ſaw his Majeſty might put out a Fleet of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; that your Subjects (who love not we know an overtopping Rival) would even for their own intereſt proſecute the War once a foot, let them be never ſo averſe to it in the beginning. But the thunder clap that gave him his mortal wound, was the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted to the People; this brought the Devil a thouſand times into his mouth, ſaying that nothing but he, who owed <hi>Holland</hi> a ſhame, could put it into your heads, and that ſhortly you would be as united as our ſelves, ſo that ever hereafter the Kings enemies muſt become the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy of the Nation: and I muſt tell you, 'twas not ſo in the laſt War.</p>
            <p>The effects of the Toleration were ſoon perceived by every body; for many of your Country men at <hi>Rotterdam, Delf, Leyden,</hi> and elſe where in this Land, frighted heretofore out of <hi>England,</hi> upon the ſcore of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have now not only Longings homewards, but are alſo generally lookt upon by our people as ſo many Spies to betray us, whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly no Dutchman was thought more faithful than they, to the wel<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

one, that a <hi>Quaker</hi> of yours at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> ſhould be ſo tranſported at the news, as to throw his Hat which had been naild at leaſt ten years to his head) into the fire, and to drink the Kings health with a <hi>Vive le Roy</hi> in his mouth.</p>
            <p>For my own part, though two deſcents have not, I think, waſhed away all my <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood, yet upon the account of my Mothers kindred, and my own buſineſs, who knows whether ever with convenience I can quit <hi>Holland</hi> or no, but this I muſt tell you, that my two Uncles &amp; their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives talk much of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore I ſhall deſire you to inform me what real foundation this Indulgence has, that I may accordingly adviſe my ſcrupulous friends, for there has been no queſtion more ventilated at any time in theſe Quarters. I do not, I'le aſſure you, ask this of you upon my own ſcore, but theirs; for had my Grand-mother had ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive or rather charitable a ſtomack as mine, I ſhould have at preſent a greater intereſt in <hi>Mark-Lane</hi> than now I am ever like to have. Yet to ſpeak to you with my old frankneſs, I am not able to conceive how a People ſo wedded to Perſecution, as you were thought in the general opinion of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can ſo ſuddainly forget it, as not to be graſping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at it again upon every ſlight pretence and humour; and thus having finiſhed my requeſt; let us if you pleaſe return to our <hi>Fac-totum,</hi> who had ſo groſlly reckoned without his Hoſt.</p>
            <p>He was, you may eaſily imagine much ſurpriſed at what had happened, yet outwardly no man ſeemed leſs, for in that way of diſguiſe he was eſteemed a great Maſter: never wanting ſome plauſible gloſs or other to leſſen the dread that ſuddain accidents brought along with them. For as to the ſtopping of the Treaſury, he pretended it the greateſt advantage to us in the world, ſince no private man would hereafter truſt the Crown let emergencies be never ſo great, and yet every Monarch muſt often borrow of his Subjects. And, as concerning the Toleration, he was not ignorant, he ſaid, of the zeal and ſelf love of your Clergy; who one time or other would get it repealed, and that then all Diſſenters would be ten times more diſobliged and implacable than before.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the former Reaſons ſtrangely ſatisfied the multitude, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honeſt man cryed that we had been miſtaken in our meaſures laſt war, that Kings find expedients when others little dream of them: That your Kingdom was a place whoſe Maxims and Secrets were not to be gueſſed at; for when we thought our ſelves wholly ſure, &amp; that you want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either mony or men, Allies abroad, or Uuity at home, and the like, ſtill ſome accident or other happened to deceive and ruine us. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſave them whom God infatuates; nor could this Macchiavel
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54135:4"/>
keep himſelf (as he imagined) above board without the raſh attempt of neglecting your Friendſhip; and having thus made a falſe ſtep, he was forced in deſperation to contrive (as they ſay) this following Treaſon.</p>
            <p>He had for a long time kept fair with <hi>France,</hi> and was as much in the Kings books, as a forreign Miniſter could well be; and this he did for a ſupport in caſe his enemies (the Prince beginning to be the Joy of the People) ſhould be able to contend, and if they abſolutely got the better, then here ſhould be a ſure Refuge and Aſylum for him. He continued (even after the Treaty at <hi>Breda)</hi> ſtill in favour with that Monarch, who preſently after daily more and more ſhewed his hatred to us: nor did the Faction fail to inſinuate to the people, as if the Prince encouraged the King to a quarrel, to become thereby his Tributary, if he worſted us; or at leaſt to be reſtored by the States to the Dignity of his Anceſtors, ſince an Army and a General muſt be in vogue in a War; and every body knows how much the Souldiers loved and adored him.</p>
            <p>They had been (as I ſhould have told you before) buſie to leſſen alſo the Princes eſteem in <hi>England,</hi> when they were forced in the year 70 to let him come over to you; for they fancied, that becauſe his Grandfather had by the aſſiſtance of our eſtabliſhed Miniſtry (whom he protected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized himſelf, and ſo cruſhed the potent Arminian Faction, that they were all hated for a time by us; therefore by the ſame rule; if your Church men could be put out of conceit with him (I mean the preſent Prince) your People by their inſinuation and power might be eaſily made averſe and irreconcilable to his perſon, let the King be never ſo kind. Hereupon, to make him ſeem a Phanatick (which is the grand bug-bear of your Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government) they expreſly ordered him never to receive in any of your Churches kneeling, but that the Miniſter ſhould bring him the Bread &amp; Wine, as he ſate in his Pew or Seat; for we called it an arrogant Inſtitution of your Divines, as pretending to be wiſer, forſooth, than all the Reformed World, ſeeing there is not one Proteſtant Congregation that ever knelt at the Communion beſides your ſelves. Here they were again unfortunate, and the plot vaniſhed in <hi>ſumo;</hi> for it ſeems your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Leaders (had they been diſguſted) have not that influence over you as we once imagined.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Juncto</hi> were now in no little perplexity (you may be aſſured) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being able to hinder the encreaſe of his Highneſs's eſteem in all our Provinces; or to put any ſtop to the <hi>French</hi> Preparations, whilſt on the other ſide your King called aloud for ſatisfaction by his Embaſſadors, who gave them alſo many a ſecret bite for their perfidious dealing with you, as he would have it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54135:5"/>
But their private reſolution was (as I ſaid before) to give you no Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to ſink ſooner than to have your Protection, aſſuring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that no Demand of <hi>France</hi> (though victorious) could be ſo deſtructive to their particular Intereſt as yours; nor is this kind of ſelf ends any news to Chriſtendom, ſince we daily ſee there are men in Authority that will rather ſubmit to the Turk himſelf than miſs of their aimes, or fall into the hand of a Neighbour, whom they hate or envy.</p>
            <p>'Twas therefore decreed to treat you with all poſſible fair promiſes, on purpoſe to make the <hi>French</hi> jealous, or thereby at leaſt to puzzel their meaſures: and if they could by theſe Artifices keep you a Neuter, till Spring, you would not have time to ſet out your Fleet, ſo that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding with his Chriſtian Majeſty (who miſſing your aſſiſtance would be far more tractable) we ſhould make you contemptible to both of us, and to the whole World alſo.</p>
            <p>This was the Deſign, but it failed, for you preſently ſhewed us you would not be amuſed, and therefore began about Chriſtmas to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quippe, and when they delayed you ſatisfaction, you became your own Carvers, ſetting on our <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, which I muſt tell you, ſeemed a happy omen to ſome pretenders to <hi>Wit;</hi> and a preſage to them of our future ſucceſs, becauſe you did not take them all.</p>
            <p>'Twas now plain you were in earneſt, yet there wanted not real good Patriots (though it ſeems they were deceived) that cheered both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and people, with a fancy that your Parliament, (which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail they ſaid, to ſit in <hi>October.)</hi> would queſtion this War, and never contribute to it; for 'twas in all our mouths, that the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was perſwaded, that the whole Proteſtant Cauſe lay now at ſtake, and that the Pope was the Contriver of this difference.</p>
            <p>Many alſo would have it advantagious to us, that the <hi>French</hi> Ships were to be joyned with you; becauſe your own Fleet, (which you too well know we all dread) would not be ſo great now, as were you left to your ſelves; beſides, they ſaid that Auxiliaries ſometimes by private Orders muſt not fight, at other times perchance they would not fight, at beſt there was to be a deference and winking at their faults, it being impoſſible for you to command them like your own Subjects: nay, ſome envious men rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that ſhould you now be ſucceſsful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do all your ſelves, yet theſe Allies would certainly rob you of (at leaſt) half the G<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Spring being now come, and the great Force both by Sea &amp; Land almoſt ready to fall upon us, the Juncto agreed to play their Cards thus, that is to ſay, they would put 10 or 12 thouſand men at leaſt into <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> as the place the Enemy would firſt attaque, and therefore the Towns on the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54135:5"/>
               <hi>Rhine,</hi> being left unprovided, they muſt ſoon become a prey to his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſtie, on whom they reſolved (if the worſt came to the worſt) to depend, nay, rather on the Devil, than to be at the mercy of the Prince, and his Party, into whoſe hands they knew alſo they ſhould at laſt fall, if the War were but procraſtinated; for in times of Action, Souldiers will alwayes over-top Gownmen; beſides, there being very little hopes by force to reſiſt two ſuch Monarchs (which is the beſt excuſe the world ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally makes for them) they thought fit to be thus before-hand, that their own Conditions and Terms might be the better.</p>
            <p>But though they determined in this manner, as to <hi>France,</hi> yet they thought fit to try one experiment firſt, which would be an advantage to them, what way ſoever it ſucceeded, <hi>viz.</hi> To put out their Fleet with all the haſt and privacy imaginable to intercept yours, before you joyned <hi>D'Eſtres;</hi> ſo that if you happened to beat us, they had a fair pretence of having done their indeavours for their Countrey, &amp; then the French in our conſternation might over-run us at pleaſure: But on the other ſide, if by ſurprize or chance we ſhould overthrow you at Sea, it would be eaſy to clap ſtore of men into theſe Towns which (we now ſay) were deſigned to be loſt, and no hard thing in the height of our Victory &amp; Joy to make ſome agreement with the reſt of our Enemies; and ſo to your loſs alone, all things ſhould be here juſt as they were before.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, one part of the Project was well carryed, for our Fleet weighed Anchor when few of our own News mongers thought it half rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but what the ſucceſs was, when we came to blows, you know, I am ſure as well as my ſelf; only this I muſt add, That <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> after the Fight, could not refrain ſaying to this purpoſe, That now he ſaw you were invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and more than men; for whether we caught you a ſleep, or awake, divided, or together, we ſtill returned with loſs: And truly, who could imagine that a little Squadron, nay rather 6 or 7 Ships, ſhould ſo long reſiſt our whole Navy; and that your Duke ſhould engage with ſo much valour and fury, as to change Ships (when refitting loſt time) oftner than great Generals at Land have done their Horſes.</p>
            <p>We loſt not above four Sail (or ſix as ſome ſay) but certainly we never had ſo many men deſtroyed, &amp; our Fleet ſo torn before; &amp; therefore not a few queſtion whether we could have repaired, and been fit to fight again laſt Summer, ſuppoſing we had had no other enemy to diſtract us. But the French Inundation that preſently followed, put it out of diſpute; for the great <hi>Sennacheri<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54135:6"/>
beſides the fear of you, there was none but had in this publick calamity concerns enough at home.</p>
            <p>This was our caſe, Sir, and now were we ready to yield up every thing, when it pleaſed God that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>treicht</hi> (like another <hi>Capua)</hi> or at leaſt the ſtrange rains, &amp; ill weather, ſhould put a ſtop to the Victorious French by Land, as alſo to the ruine your proud triumphant Navy was drawing on us, for what could have ſaved our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, having no Allies, nor Fleet of our own to protect us, but a three months ſtorm, which for the moſt part haſtened them forward, and put you into a continual diſorder, not permitting you to watch your prey, as otherwiſe you would have done: Nay, ſome on board have aſſured me, That had not the wind chopt about the ſame day, we got into <hi>Embden;</hi> we muſt nevertheleſs have fallen into the very midſt of you.</p>
            <p>But our tumultuous People made no other uſe of this reſpite, which God Almighty had ſent us, but to embrue their hands in the blood of the two <hi>De Witts,</hi> after that ſtrange and horrid manner you have heard of. I cannot (becauſe of the conſequences of it) juſtifie this Violence, though many an impartial man thinks them to have been really guilty by their Treaſon of all our miſery; as alſo of contriving the Princes Death, who now by the ill ſucceſs of their Government, had got (as they ever feared) all Authority into his hands; yet there want not others, who will have it, That the <hi>Orange</hi> Party hired the Barber to accuſe the Eldeſt Brother of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intentions of Poyſoning His Highneſs; and that the reſt of the cryes againſt them are but meer Calumnies.</p>
            <p>For my part, I will not poſſitively affirm what is laid to their charge, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I muſt ſay, that I have many more reaſons againſt them both, than for them; but whether the Accuſations be true or falſe, The Arminians have now loſt their Head, and being hereby depreſſed, are ſo full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and hatred, that they care not who maſters us, ſo thoſe in power, ſhare in the miſery: and therefore a villanous Miniſter or Preacher of theirs (when even the Catholicks of all <hi>Holland,</hi> and particularly of that Quarter, would by no means aſſiſt or joyn with the French) brought them by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret paſs to the relief of <hi>Woerden;</hi> by the taking of which, we ſhould, as many affirm, have regained half our Loſſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe good Actions have made many zealous Proteſtants much eſteem our Papiſts (who you know are numerous) and to reckon them very true and faithful to their Countrey. But who could have thought that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> thoſe ſuper-refined Sons of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould be our only Supporters againſt a Popiſh King, whom the Pope himſelf has (I warrant you) bleſſed and congratulated for his Zeal in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54135:6"/>
advancing of the Goſpel. But in earneſt Sir, let me tell you, The itch of propagating Opinions, and idle notions is (unleſs in your Countrey) quite out of faſhion in Chriſtendom; and I believe no body thinks that <hi>France</hi> in its intentions of Conquering us, ever thought of the Church; or that the Emperour troubled his head about Religion, when he deſigned our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: this was a frequent pretence about a hundred years ago; but time and experience has taught us all wit.</p>
            <p>The powerfull entreaties of the Spaniards (who fear the loſs of <hi>Flanders)</hi> were his Imperial Majeſties principal motive in taking up Arms, though naturally, you may imagine, he is troubled to ſee the ſtrength of one daily encreaſe, who has an eye upon the Empire, and hopes to ſucceed at the next vacancy. Nor does the ſurprize of <hi>Lorrain</hi> lightly ſtick in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſtomack, which is both a member of the Empire, and appertains alſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> whoſe Protection he has long taken upon him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are his great Officers ignorant, that there's much profit and advantage in helping a rich and plentifull Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> too has his ends, you may ſwear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it encourages him not a little, that his great Maſter <hi>Leopold</hi> is concerned in our affairs. The Princeſſe <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> has alſo a mighty influence over him, and it may be you I think it ſtrange if ſhe had rather have him our Patron, than her Grand-child; for ſhe cannot forget (as her back-friends ſay) that he is Son to your Princeſs Royal, whoſe great Birth ſhe could never brook, but envy. If we proſper, this Electour is to have, not only his own upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> free, which hitherto in a manner we kept from him; but alſo many other by-emoluments; and nothing encourages both Prince and Peaſant like gain.</p>
            <p>Our only hopes then at preſent, are in theſe Auxiliary Forces; and this advantage we have already got, that they have diverted <hi>Turene,</hi> and the main of the French Army, which would have undone us before this; and without all doubt, had not the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> been by their approach obliged to retire, we had not only loſt <hi>Groningen,</hi> but with the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that of <hi>Weſtfriezland</hi> alſo: Nevertheleſs he has done us miſchief enough, and ſayes, He'l teach us to paint him in a Pontifical and Military habit, riding on a Hog but who would have thought expreſſing him to be Maſter of the beſt <hi>Westphalia</hi>-Bacon, had been ſo great a Crime?</p>
            <p>The Prince, who is all in all among us, went lately, with the whole ſtrength he could make, towards <hi>Liege</hi> Countrey, in hopes of ſome great exploit, to repair his ill fortune at <hi>Woerden:</hi> How he will proſper, God knows; only this I am ſure of, that our Peop'e will judge of the Conduct according to the ſucceſs; and therefore his Friends do very much pity the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54135:7"/>
ſtrange hard game he has to play; for he muſt, as I ſaid, have alwaies good luck if he hopes to pleaſe; nor is he wholly to diſoblige you, whom he has ſo near a Relation to, and yet he muſt remember how eaſie it is for his Enemies to make him ſuſpected by the people, who by nature are alwaies jealous and violent. Beſides, if he ſtands in perpetual defiance of the late ruling Party, he'l find many inconveniencies by it, both as to his own, and to the publick good; but if he protects or joyns with them (for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have made him great promiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the commonalty may chance to forſake him, and think of another; and if that ſhould happen, what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance or relyance can he have on them, that have alwaies kept him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and perchance deſign this way for his final ruine and deſtruction?</p>
            <p>If his condition be tickliſh and ill, ours (I mean the Nations) is worſe; nay, as bad as it can almoſt be wiſhed by you; for there's ſcarce any Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage that fears not to be burnt, or at leaſt pillag'd before morning by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Our ſluces and damms are moſt of them pull'd up; our draining mills deſtroyed, and that water which protected many places in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, endangers them now if it ſhould freeze; ſo that Towns of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are in perpetual dread and terrour. Our Traffique is ceaſed, and little coming in, and leſs going out; and, which is yet ſtranger, moſt of our Sea-men are forced for a livelihood to run a Privateering; and when they get ſomthing, they muſt ſell it at half the worth, ſeeing our very home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade is quite gone by the loſs of the <hi>Moſe</hi> and <hi>Rhine,</hi> which heretofore brought us ſtill ſo much gain and profit. No wonder then if the Poor cry for meat, when the Rich can hardly live; and what Artizan can maintain his Family, when ſcarce any body will ſet him on work? Theſe are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Inſurrections in our Cities, and perpetual tumults among the Bores; nor have we had any comfortable news this long while; but the fond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerations of our Gazetts, or ſometimes the taking of a Prize from you, which to me I confeſs brings little joy, ſince it ſhows you are ſtill buſie in commerce, whilſt our Merchants ſit idle at home; and though perchance <hi>Sally</hi> and <hi>Algiers</hi> may weary you this way, 'tis not to be done by a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe whole glory and advantage depends upon Negotiation.</p>
            <p>Peace is the thing I cry for; and peradvanture God will at length hear us, ſince we begin to make good uſe of this affliction and chaſtiſement; for with admiration I ſay it, There was never a greater change in any Countrey, and mercy alwaies attends a ſorrowful and contrite people.</p>
            <p>One thing I had almoſt forgot to tell you, which makes the whole world ſtand amaz'd, and wonder how they have been thus long deceived concerning you; for all men of all Countries have ever cryed, That 'twas your Parliament that in truth governed; your King being no body, or at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54135:7"/>
moſt but half a Prince. This therefore made them generally conclude you an inſignificant people either to Friend or Foe; eſpecially ſeeing there muſt be continual application in all buſineſs to both theſe Powers, which (as 'twas thought) inſtead of agreeing, ſtrove to circumvent each other. But now the Scene is quite chaned; for ſince they have ſeen your King raiſe an Army, proclaim War, ſet out his Fleet, threaten Newters, aſſiſt Friends, pay every body, and all this of himſelf; they confeſs you are a potent Nation, fit to be courted, and that the ballance of Chriſtendome is in your hands. In ſhort, take it upon the word of an honeſt man, This unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of proceeding has done you over all Europe more real honour (and the honour of a Countrey is the beſt part of its ſtrength) than any thing that has happened to you in this age.</p>
            <p>Having thus fulfilled your commands in my plain and inartificial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which I am ſure your goodneſs will pardon, though your admirable judgement cannot; I ſay, having thus ſhewed my obedience, you muſt excuſe my longing to hear from you, and I doubt not but you will as frankly inform me how things ſtand with you. I deſire no intrigues of State (as I hinted in the beginning) but ſuch an account, as, were I at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (and 'tis by your King's favour lawfull) every body there would give me.</p>
            <p>When you write, direct your Letters to our Correſpondent at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> who grows rich by the great buſineſs that runs through his hands in theſe troubles: for many Merchants of note (and now you may ſee how the world is changed with us) are compelled to ſuch ſhifts, being ſcarce able to vent one penny-worth of Goods, without being beholden to others.

            <p>I Will not trouble you now with the private affaires betwixt us, ſince to thank you for your excellent and moſt ſatisfactory Letter, of the 26<hi>th.</hi> paſt is task enough, and far too much, were I to do it as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: but how could I expect leſs, from one who had <hi>Leyden</hi> for a Miſtreſs ſo many years, and (after the death of your father) ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the world, leaving then the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and your Dedication to Theo ogie, for this ſo profi able a Study. Yet for all I owe you many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, you muſt pardon me if I expreſs my mind freely in every thing, and complain, even in the beginning, of your writing in <hi>Dutch,</hi> which (though I underſtand it) ſhews in you methinks that averſion to us, you ever profeſt againſt; nor can you have any pretence for this our unuſual way of correſponding, unleſs reſolving altogether to be critical, you prefer your Mother-tongue before one which you have acquired half by Art.

            <p>One Maxime, I remember, you had ever in your mouths, That money was omnipotent, and therefore abounding in it; you could not poſſibly need or fear any thing; but now you ſee the fallacy of that opinion; and that you may want neceſſaries, though your Coffers are full, which (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I yet tell you) have been ever much emptier than you your ſelves pretended: and beſides, none are ſooner reduced to extremity, than atrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people once out of their method and bias.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge as to my particular concerns, I was extreamly glad at the Peace of <hi>Breda,</hi> and believed alſo you would remember the danger you riſqued in that War, having nothing in the leaſt to ſatisfie your loſſes,

but the Accident at <hi>Chatham,</hi> when we were wholly unprovided; and which you know we could have quickly redreſſed by a new Fleet, had not we then concluded with you.

            <p>Nothing 'tis true is more viſible than the ſtrange animoſity and hatred, which your <hi>fac totum</hi> (as you call him) and his friends bore us; yet I am ſo candid to his Memory as to be half perſwaded, that the greateſt part of his Treaſon, was the neglecting of the advice, which the old Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> left the State on his Death-bed: <hi>viz.</hi> To keep friendſhip with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> upon any terms, and That your ſtanding Army ſhould ever conſiſt for the far greateſt part of mercenary Neighbours, and not of your own Subjects and Countreymen: for what could be expected but the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of Towns as faſt as ſummoned, when the Souldiers minded trade more than their buſineſs, and when their Officers were both ignorant what an Enemy was, and diſheartned by the cryes of their Wives and Children? But this Councel was contrary to the Deſigns of your democratical and ſelf-intereſted Party, who know, Souldiers of Fortune will depend on their General, and that they ſhould never domineer at the Helm, whilſt this Great Commander had ſuch power.</p>
            <p>I think no man ought to wonder at our Kings inclination and zeal, for the eſtabliſhment of his Nephew; which, let me tell you, we Engliſh look upon in a manner as his Right; for, was it fit, do you imagine, that ſo mighty a Monarch as the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> ſhould marry his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54135:9"/>
Daughter to that Prince, were it not by a kind of cuſtome of Nations (as we ſee in <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> the Empire &amp;c. or by the private promiſes of your States aſſured, that their Children ſhould enjoy the honours of their Anceſtors; and if you once come to Gratitude, what people was ever more obliged, than you by this great and Princely Family.</p>
            <p>I dare beleive you, that your Rulers were afraid of our engroſſing all trade, ſince it has often with envy been repeated, that from 4 or 5 rich Merchants in the laſt Century, we have now an Exchange even crowded with ſuch, that do, or at leaſt are able to keep their Coach, and all things elſe proportionable.</p>
            <p>Let me alſo add (to what I have already urged) this one advantage more we have over you: <hi>viz.</hi> A plentiful Countrey by nature, ſo that we depend not wholly upon Trade, whereas, you that are altogether its ſlaves, muſt by any ill accident, undergo great moleſtation and diſturbance. And herein alſo you are extreamly unfortunate, that though you know you are ever to be beholden to your Neighbours, yet that Pride of yours which Riches create, will ſtill make you recalcitrate and diſoblige your beſt and ſureſt friends.</p>
            <p>Your preſent miſeries, I am ſure, convince you ſufficiently of your baſe uſage of us from time to time; and that you have now forced us (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the natural inclination of either Prince or People) to be as well your Deſtroyers as Founders; and yet we would have defended you (had you but deſerved it) with the ſame eaſe from this preſent attaque of <hi>France,</hi> as formerly we did from the fury of the powerful <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> you think has ſome particular Myſteries in it, which often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forreign Miniſters; and truly I am much of your ſentiment, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard more extravagancies and wronger obſervations in my life, than by Strangers concerning our Government and Policy: nay they have been ſo wedded to their opinion, and eſpecially about the power of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, that all the aſſurances that knowing men of our Countrey could give them to the contrary, ſerved only to confirm and harden them, and among this Sect of Polititians, tell me I beſeech you, who was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate than your ſelf?</p>
            <p>For how often have I told you (though to little purpoſe) That this Great Councel, this Epitome of all <hi>England,</hi> had no life but what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from its Prince; That it met only when he would, and again diſſolved at the leaſt motion of his lips; That being congregated from all parts of the Kingdome, it muſt needs know our ſeveral maladies, and having humby propoſed the remedy, leaves alwayes the fall determination to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Soveraign; That our Monarchs having received from their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54135:9"/>
People the greateſt free Demeſne and Revenue of any Potentate in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, had graciouſly promiſed thereupon never to take any mony from us without our own tendering of it, and yet it was never known when publick Neceſſities call'd (though the Royal Exchequer has alſo its own Rivers of Plenty) but that this <hi>Auguſte</hi> Aſſembly was ever more liberal in its offerings, than our Princes could be in their Demands. In ſhort, Sir, you now know what the Kings of <hi>England</hi> can do, and confeſs that the world at length acknowledges its errour.</p>
            <p>But why do I repeat the miſtakes of you Strangers in our more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and ſpeculative matters, ſince you daily contradict even your exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſes: for to this very moment ſhew me one Traveller in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, that calls <hi>London</hi> any more than one long Street; whenas there's hardly in the World a rounder and compacter City within its walls: and as for the Suburbs, do you but conſider whether from the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Southampton</hi>-houſe be ſo contemptible a bredth; and yet I might add to this (as they do in other places) the River, and whatſoever lies on the other ſide of it.</p>
            <p>'Twas therefore not ill obſerv'd by thoſe among you, [who cry'd (as you ſay) you had been always miſtaken in your meaſures concerning us, even when you thought your ſelves moſt ſure: and doubtleſs <hi>De Witt</hi> himſelf would have been of that opinion, had it not diametrically thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Intereſt; and we ſee that an earneſt and paſſionate inclination to a thing, often vitiates the greateſt underſtanding and capacity: for how could he imagine (had he been in his ſeuſes) that any little pique between us and the <hi>French</hi> (which for theſe ſeveral years has had no other grounds but their vain humour in over-valuing themſelves) could make us rather ſubmit to the continual and real injuries we ſuſtained by you, than joyn with them for Reparation?</p>
            <p>If in this our conjunction you are conquered, we ſhall certainly have a ſhare and proportion of the booty; nor will ſuch an addition do us any harm. But, by the way, ſuppoſe <hi>France</hi> ſhould alone, and to its own uſe ſubjugate your Country yet I look not, I confeſs, upon ſuch an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and union (though it ſeem a Paradox) half ſo able to offend <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as were you only <hi>bona fide,</hi> confederated againſt us: and we know in part by the laſt War, what ſuch a League can do.</p>
            <p>For firſt, the Diſcipline of the French (who are ſo volatile by nature) will be ten times more lax by the extent of their Dominions, than at preſent; and if they ſhould chance to have a careleſs, or leſs active Prince, they'l preſently full into inteſtine diſorder &amp; confuſion: nor was there ever ſince the Creation of the World, a potent people in a Continent (which is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54135:10"/>
true Seat for an Empire) that can ſhow fewer marks of their bravery than they; for though they have been alwaies in War, and a moſt powerfull Monarchy time out of minde, yet have they not one foot of Land out of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, except what they have got within theſe few years; and which in truth is not yet worth the ſpeaking of. In the next place, no body muſt imagine that the Shipping of <hi>Holland</hi> will be the ſixt part ſo conſiderable after the Conqueſt, as now it is; for the domineering temper of <hi>French</hi> Governours, and the obſtinate ſelf-will'd Genius of your people (that have been ſo long free as they call it) are ſo different, that moſt will rather beg than ſtay at home; and they that do chance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, will preſently change in a manner their whole courſe of living: and thus it hath fared with <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which formerly bred up as able Sea-men as any were in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet now it has nothing in it conſiderable, though this preſent excellent King be a greater Encourager of all Maritime Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs than will ſit, I dare ſay, on his Throne theſe many and many Ages.</p>
            <p>But all this is but a fancy, as I ſaid before, and though falſe, yet as true as ſome of the whimſies of your tranſcendent States-men, who were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to imagine <hi>England</hi> ſo fooliſh as to think the joyning with His Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty would prejudice the Proteſtant Cauſe; and yet your ſelves might innocently forſooth league with this very Monarch againſt us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, every body ſaw that neither we, nor you, nor any reformed State in Chriſtendom apprehended then the leaſt detriment to our Religion by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, why I pray ſhould it be otherwiſe now?</p>
            <p>As for the poſtponing the Bankers, I never doubted but it would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize your Grandees; and it was well reflected upon by ſome of you, that Kings find ſtill Expedients when others little dream of them: nor was yet this a far-fetch't one, ſince there have been few Monarchies or States that have not done at one time or other the very ſame thing; nay, were your Bank at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> call'd upon, 'twill be found that in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it never had enough <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to ſatisfie half its credit.</p>
            <p>And as your Wiſe ones erred in the thing it ſelf, ſo they may alſo well do it in their Conjectural conſequences; for (believe me) the Crown will never want Lenders when it really ſtands in need of them; nor, can any man that has thus put out his money (except a few that may have had perchance ſome preſent occaſion) be the leaſt inconvenienced thereby, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ſecurity the word of this King, the intereſt of his Succeſſors, and the Reputation even of the Kingdom it ſelf, which will never let ſo many good Subjects ſuffer, when their money (or what ſhould have reimburs'd them) was ſpent in a neceſſary War for the honour and ſafety of us all.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Sea, which ſurrounding us, keeps us from danger; and 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54135:10"/>
the Dominion of it which al our Princes have ſo c<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>refully lookt after; for if to ſhew our Juriſdiction 'twas ever lawful to oblige your ſingle Ships to ſtrike to our leaſt Man of War, we have ſtil the ſame Reaſon and Juſtice to require it from your Fleet; ſince your whole Navy has no more Right in theſe Seas, then any one of your Veſſels when it is alone; and if number and ſtrength may pretend (as you ſay) to exemptions, that plainly declares War, and by it you own your ſelves Aggreſſors.</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe that we ſet on your <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet, w<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hch abſolutely denied to pay us this duty: and if five of our Frigats were not able to take 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Merchant Ships mounted with 20 and 30 Guns apiece, yet they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd, with three more that came afterwards in, to ſink your Reer Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and to bring home ſome of the richeſt as Prizes, in ſpight of eight Men of War that convey'd them: And pray remember, you were here again Breakers of the Peace, ſeeing he that denies a Prince his uſual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, declares <hi>ipſo facto</hi> War againſt him, let them be before never ſo ſtrictly leagued together.</p>
            <p>Theſe extravagant and accumulative injuries have at length caus'd a breach, the effects of which (as was expected) you already with ſorrow feel, not daring now to put to Sea any Men of War, if there be the leaſt probability of meeting ours: And truly for my part, though I commend alwayes the ingenuity and artifice of an enemy, yet I can by no means think your late ſetting upon us at <hi>Sould Bay,</hi> deſerves the name of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, becauſe all Fleets muſt be at Anchor if they take in neceſſaries; and when they are ſo, any enemy (the wind blowing fair) may have this ſo frequent and ordinary advantage.</p>
            <p>There's no fence againſt this accident but Scouts, and ours gave us the alarm two hours before your arrival, and you ſoon found what reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance our very Vantguard could make; and had not we loſt the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and famoms Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> (whom nothing but a Fire-ſhip could maſter) this rencounter had been to us nothing but a paſs-time, in which notwithſtanding you loſt I dare affirm, neer double the number of what has been very publickly owned by you.</p>
            <p>But, though you had even then a ſtrange miſt, and other happy hitts to ſtand between you and utter ruin, as alſo afterwards a three months ſtorm (as you juſtly call it) for the protection of your <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Fleet, yet I know the proudeſt of you are now convinc'd that there's no dealing with us; and truly when I conſider our Ships, our Men, our Commanders, and above all, our great Admiral (who has given the world ſuch proofs of his prodigious Valour and Patience, Virtues that at laſt will conquer even Fortune it ſelf) I may without vanity, I think, and with all the Juſtice
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54135:11"/>
maginable ſay, we need never fear any thing here in <hi>England</hi> but our ſins.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> 'tis no marvel if it were <hi>De Witts</hi> nicking blow; for doubtleſs no one thing ever ſetled a diſtracted Country in ſo much Unity as this. His Majeſty for 12 years together ſuffered the Laws to be often ſeverely executed againſt all Diſſenters without exceptions, which had no other effect, but to incenſe moſt of them ſo far againſt the Government, that they had no manner of regard or tenderneſs for it, nay many (like ſick men that vainly expect eaſe by change) rejoyc'd at ill news, and ſeemed earneſtly to wiſh our ruine; and doubtleſs were not <hi>Great Brittain</hi> an Iſland, we had been over-run long ago. But now on the contrary, no people ſpeak more reverently of the King than they; nor do I know any one Sect here among us (though I am ſurrounded with their Meeting-houſes) that has committed the leaſt ſcandal ſince this his Royal Grace and Freedom.</p>
            <p>And now whilſt it is in my head, let me tell you, that if the <hi>Rotterdam Quaker</hi> turn'd Hector upon notice of this Indulgence, it had ſuch efficacy over his Brethren here, that whilſt it was but in projection they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly became Wits, and ventured to jeer the Players themſelves, their piquant and ſworn Enemies. For the King's Theatre hapening to be fir'd, with many hundred pounds loſs to the ſingle ſhare of Mr. <hi>Hart,</hi> an Actor; One of theſe Spiritual Drolls being ask't at their Aſſembly next day, what news was ſtiring? None friend, (ſaid he) that I know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the King's <hi>Meeting-houſe</hi> is burnt; and ſo gave the joyful Auditory a full account of all particulars: Nay then (replyed the Demandant) we need no longer fear thoſe blaſphemers of the Saints; for now without doubt their <hi>Heart is broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come to your Qu<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re concerning the duration of this Grace, be pleas'd to underſtand, that though there be among our wiſe and learned Clergy ſome <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s that value their <hi>Diana,</hi> and private concerns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tranquility and Settlement of the Nation, yet theſe (which is the happineſs of it) are ſo inconſiderable in every reſpect, that you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your friends, 'twill never be in their power to perſwade his Majeſty to recall his Declaration, which all men of parts do now aknowledge to be the Bond of Peace and Unity among us.</p>
            <p>Nor need you fear that any Congregation will be excluded, becauſe it fruſtrates the very intention of the Favour, by affrighting all Diſſenters whatſoever; for if any party be excepted, it muſt be becauſe they are not conſiderable enough to be apprehended by the Government; and then will the weakeſt of the Tolerated take the Alarm, and ſo from one to another 'twill preſently infect the whole Body in general. For which Sect
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54135:11"/>
can aſſure themſelves but that from a numerous Party (ſince Religion alſo has its ebbings and flowings) they may ſoon become Chriſt's little flock; and if ſo, they are certain beforehand to find no Mercy.</p>
            <p>Such an Excluſion alſo is wholly oppoſite to the King's Honour and Intereſt, his merciful Diſpoſition and Temper having gain'd him the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Non-Conformiſts, and is the grand thing on which they all rely; for Political Indulgence (they ſay) may change with every wind, but what Nature has eſtabliſhed ought to be look'd upon as fixed and permanent.</p>
            <p>But how comes it to paſs unleſs you continue overvaluing your ſelves, and taking wrong informations of us, that you think we are the only Wranglers in Chriſtendom about Religion. I muſt again aſſure you, you have very ill intelligence; for we now underſtand, as well as the reſt of the World, that true Proteſtant Doctrine, <hi>viz. That all Well-living Chriſtians may be ſaved,</hi> and therefore with reaſon defie thoſe that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute for Conſcience, which the Judicious alſo find to be the true cauſe of the ſpawning and growth of Sects. For be pleaſed to know, that though we have abounded in all other opinions imaginable, yet no man ever heard of an Engliſh Lutheran; and truly could I have notice of ſuch a wonder, I would (as old as I am) go 20 miles afoot to ſee him.</p>
            <p>Now I hope you do not believe that <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Book againſt that Patriarch, did ſo abſolutely convince the Nation, that it could never ſince digeſt his Tenets; for, were this the cauſe, what would have become of us all, had <hi>Calvin</hi> received a broad-ſide alſo? No Sir, the reaſon is evident, to wit, he never drew blood from the one, or made the leaſt Law againſt him, whereas he ſo worried the Diſciples of the other with his 2 leaſh of Articles, that the Doctrine became as fixed as <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the Poſt they were ſo often baited at.</p>
            <p>Thus dealt alſo Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Brother with our Anabaptiſts and the then Sectaries, drawing from them that blood which might have endangered their ſuffocation. Nay, in the like manner ſerved ſhe our Jeſuites, for having caught <hi>Campian</hi> (who, together with his companion, were the two firſt, as <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us, that ever came into <hi>England)</hi> he was no ſooner quartered, but from a few wandring Scholars without Stock, without Houſes, without Patrons, and abſolutely beholden to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces, they became preſently (even by aſſiſtance of <hi>Parſons,</hi> who was he that eſcaped) not only to be a body of their own, but Maſters alſo of Colledges in <hi>Spain, Rome, Flanders,</hi> and where not? and courted ever after by ſeveral great Princes of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>And now that our Papiſts come in my way, who have I muſt tell you,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54135:12"/>
(for you cannot outdo us in any thing) ſhewed as much Loyalty here, as your own at home; I ſay, now that we ſpeak of theſe Papiſts, they alſo demonſtrate not a little methinks, that Religions gain force by Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Holborn</hi> (the grand Road of thoſe they ſtile Martyrs) hath with its inletts more of that perſwſion, than any ten Streets, pick them where you will, throughout the City. Therefore (as a Corollary from this Theoreme) when I hear any man earneſtly talk of ſuppreſſing of Sects, and that all decency and Eccleſiaſtical order will otherwiſe fall (fancies which his little private concerns prompt him to) I preſently adviſe him to get two or three Sir <hi>Johns</hi> of his Party hang'd, and that I'le hang after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards if ever then we want either Tippet, Rochet, Cope, Organ, or any other ſuch like weighty and fundamental parts of Religion.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Sir, our eyes are opened, and we find that all Opinions in power have ſtill uſed ſeverities againſt their Adverſaries, and therefore none ought to blame his fellow, ſeeing we have all erred and ſtrayed, and followed too much the devices and deſires of our own hearts; for thus did <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, thus did <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, thus did Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> thus did Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> thus did King <hi>James,</hi> thus did King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, thus did the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> thus did the <hi>Rump,</hi> but thus will not King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> do any more, who knows by experience as well as inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what a virtue Mercy is; and really it vexes me to ſee even Papiſts themſelves call us into the liſt, and offer to ſhew, that we have executed more of theirs for Religion, than they of ours; adding as an alleviation on their ſide, That it is leſs cruelty in any man to deſtroy egs in their hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than a Covey that is pen-feathered, and at its full growth: but now, as I ſaid, our eyes are opened, and both they and you ſhall find we Engliſh underſtand good nature, and that <hi>Non ſaremo ſempre Polachi,</hi> We will not alwaies be <hi>Polanders,</hi> who (beſides their innate folly proverbially ſaid to their charge by <hi>Italians)</hi> could yet lately quarrel with one another even when the Turk himſelf was in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis your Countrymen that are, in truth, our Turks, and perchance as faithleſs as they, yet this difference is betwixt you, that they have got as many Provinces, as you have now loſt, though both happened by the ſame means, that is, by breaking Solemn Oaths and Promiſes.</p>
            <p>One command more I am to obey you in, and then I have done; and that is in giving you an account of the preſent State of the Country, which in groſs I aſſure you is the ſame as formerly, but in Affection and Concord much better; nor has any one Propheſy or Prediction of your partial <hi>Juncto</hi> even yet happened to us. Some Merchants of ours have loſt, 'tis true; yet yours, though they durſt not venture out to Sea, have felt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54135:12"/>
the fury at home, not only of Water, but of Fire alſo; as you will find by your Letters, which (like <hi>Job</hi>'s ſeveral Meſſengers) have, I queſtion not, brought you worſe and worſe tydings, ſince the writing of your laſt.</p>
            <p>Nor will your people (I'le be bound) ever hereafter boaſt of the gain or advantage had by Capers, it being ſo like to that of our Carters and Porters, whilſt the City was on fire, who got for the preſent ſufficient for Brandy, but were ready to ſtarve the following week, when not only their new but their old employment alſo ceaſed.</p>
            <p>God ſend you a good Peace, &amp; give you grace to accept it, if it be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which may perchance hinder your utter ruine; for otherwiſe there will be an Army, I can aſſure you, of above an hundred thouſand Freſh men within your bowels next Summer, and a greater Fleet of ours than ever, blocking up your Havens under his Royal Command, who has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready twice defeated you.</p>
            <p>I have tyred you, Sir, ſufficiently, though with truth, and therefore I will now ſtop here, after I have aſſured you, that nothing ſhall ever leſſen my kindneſs and reſpects for you; and that upon all occaſions I will be,</p>
