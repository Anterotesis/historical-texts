         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vnsufferable enormity wee abound in passages of good Writers in all Ages. In other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, the Romanists, like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, are tyed fast by the tailes: in this they are loose, and parted asunder, and they take direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courses. They disproue their own proofes and approoue our disproofes of them. <hi>Penelopes telam texunt, &amp; retexunt,</hi> they doe and vndoe. There is no argument of ours against them, which is not confirmed by some of them, no obiection of theirs against vs, which is not sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by some of their owne side; as thou mayst see through the whole, but especially in the last Chapter of this Discourse. Into which I Imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my studies the rather vpon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>About two yeeres since I was desired by a person of qualitie, to conferre with a L. a little before that time seduced by deceitfull guides, who first lead the party out of the right way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arminian tract, and afterward into the high rode of Popery lying not farre off. Vpon the first motion, I made some difficultie of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the party a meeting: because I suspected there might be shifted into the company, after their manner, some disguized Priest lying in <hi>subsidijs,</hi> or in Ambush as it were, that he might suddenly rush in vpon the least shew of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Yet after the messenger had assured mee, that there were none in the L<hi rend="sup">s</hi> companie, but such as sincerely affected the truth of the Gospell, I made then no scruple, but presently
<pb facs="tcp:21367:6"/>
accompanied him to the Honorable personages house. Where I found, notwithstanding that the L. was prouided of a second, and that the L. mouth was vsed onely as a trunke to shoote out those poysoned bullets, which M. <hi>Euerard</hi> the Priest, and Confessor to this person, had chammed before with his teeth. <hi>Aspis à vipera sumit venenum:</hi> the Aspe, according to the Prouerb, borrowed poyson of the Viper. The Priest, in a few passages of speech vnawares dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered himselfe, <hi>tanquam sorex suo iudicio;</hi> whereupon I drew backe, and was very desirous to breake of further conference, because I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted nothing lesse, then sincere dealing in a meeting, that was contriued by fraud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be acted in a masking manner. Yet when I obserued, that M. <hi>Euerard</hi> grew very insolent, and audacious vpon my withdrawing my selfe, and diuerse Knights and Gentlemen there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, religiously deuoted to the Truth, both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, and intreated me not to bee wanting to the necessarie defence thereof: <hi>(Cassium enim hunc sufflaminandum esse)</hi> at their instance, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke Master <hi>Euerard,</hi> and for many houres sometimes opposed, and sometimes answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in diuers points, but especially in the question most desired by both parties to bee particularly debated, touching the necessity of Communicating in both kinds. The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ended, I thought to haue heard no more of it, because it being on my part casuall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall; I conceiued it of little importance
<pb facs="tcp:21367:6"/>
either way. But being since informed by an ho nourable Lord, that M. <hi>Euerard</hi> after that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter had not only with his tongue licked all his wounds whole, but also with a venemous tooth fastned many slanders vpon me, I thought fit to send him the ensewing relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, requiring him to adde, or alter, what he thought conuenient in his owne arguments, and answers, and then to consigne it with his subscription, as I meant to doe the rest with mine also. Vpon the receit hereof, he promised to returne me an answer with speed: but after many moneths failing thereof, being vrged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and again, and vpbrayded with his tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations, in the end he sent me a flat denial by <hi>S. P.

                     <head>CHAP. II.
The first Argument, drawne from Christs Precept and example in the celebration of this Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>WHatsoeuer Christ commanded and did in the first celebration of this Supper, ought continually to be obserued and practized in the Church:</p>
                     <p>But Christ in the first celebration of the Supper, gaue the Cup, and commanded it to bee giuen to all there present, that before had receiued, the bread:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the giuing of the Cup to all Communicants at the Supper, ought perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to bee obserued, and practised in the Church.</p>
                     <p>The proposition is gathered out of Luk. 22. 19. <hi>This doe ye in remembrance of me:</hi> and 1. Cor. 11. 25. <hi>This do ye as oft as you drink in remembrance of me:</hi> and ver. 26. <hi>as oft as you eate of this bread, and drinke this Cup, you shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> In which words, the Apostle euidently implyeth, that the Commandement, <hi>this doe in remembrance of me, extends</hi> euen to <hi>Christs second comming.</hi> And verily, if Christs precepts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the first celebration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not a law binding the Church to doe the like in all succeeding ages; neither the Apostles themselues, nor the Church after them should haue had any warrant at all to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Lords Supper after his death.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21367:22"/>
Which to affirme were absurd impietie, or as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes in a case of farre lesse importance, <hi>most insolent madnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The assumption is set down in the very let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> Mat. 26. 27. <hi>He tooke the Cup, and gaue it to them, saying; Drinke you all of this.</hi> Mark. 14. 23: <hi>And he tooke the Cup, and when hee had giuen thanks, he gaue it them, and they all drank of it.</hi> Certainely, I perswade my selfe, that our Sauiour expressed the note of vniuersality, <hi>viz.</hi> in deliuering the Cup to all, saying: <hi>Drinke you all of this,</hi> and not so in giuing the bread, of set purpose, to preuent that abuse, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church of late hath brought in, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Cup. As in like manner the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith of <hi>marriage: It is honorable in, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all men.</hi> Heb. 13. 4. and he saith not so of virginity, or single life; although it bee most true, that single life, or virginity is, <gap reason="foreign">

The contrary practice viz. of them that giue milke in the Sacrament, how repugnant it is to the Euangelicall, and Apostolicall Doctrine and custome of the Church, will easily bee proued from the fountaine of truth; from whom the ordination of these mysteries did proceed.</hi> The Pope in this place drawes an argument from Christs institution, and practice at his last Supper both affirmatiuely, and negatiuely. Christ gaue bread and wine to his Disciples, therefore wee ought so to doe, he gaue not milke, therefore wee ought not. Christ is the <hi>Fountaine of truth,</hi> he is the <hi>Master of truth,</hi> hee is the Author of the Sacrament; therefore inferreth the Pope,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21367:23"/>
and in this particular infallibly; nothing must bee done in the administration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherwise then Christ did, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at his last Supper. The Romanists cannot confirme the Popes argument, but they must needs confirme ours in this point, they cannot infirme, or weaken ours, but they must needes weaken his, and not his onely, but that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctor, and glorious Martyr, Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> also; who fighteth with the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon against the heretiques called <note n="b" place="margin">Epist. 63.

                        <hi>Aquarij,</hi> wherewith we doe against the papists: <hi>No man may vnder colour of new, or humane constitutions depart from that which Christ our Master did and taught:</hi> and a little after: <hi>If in the Sacrifice which Christ offered, Christ alone is to be followed, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to obay and doe that, which Christ did, and commanded to be done, seeing he himselfe saith, in the Gospel, if ye doe that which I command you, I will not say, that you are serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but friends, &amp;c. Yet some out of ignorance, or simplicity in sanctifying the Lords Cup, and ministring to the people, doe not that which Iesus Christ the Author and Teacher of this sacrifice did and taught.</hi> If any Cauill, against this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Christ sate, or leaned at his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, gaue the Sacrament after supper, and that vnto 12, and those men, and no women, and yet we are not bound so to doe; and consequently, that the argument from Christs example is not of absolute necessity for vs to follow, but may be dispensed with by the Church:</p>
                     <p>I answer; first, that the argument proceedes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21367:23"/>
vpon substantiall acts, and not circumstances, such as are the time, and the place, and the number of communicants. Now that the Cup is a substantiall part of the Sacrament, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by Christs blessing, and consecrating it, and the words of the institution: <hi>This Cup is the new Testament in my blood:</hi> neither can the aduersaries deny it, who account it no lesse then <note n="c" place="margin">

Our argument is not grounded onely vpon that which Christ did, but vpon that which Christ did, and taught, or commanded should bee done. Now as Christ tooke the bread, and broke it, and said; <hi>Doe this:</hi> so in like manner he tooke the Cup, and said: <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> but Christ said not in like manner, sit you downe, or lye, when you take the sacrament, or receiue it late at night, or administer it to such a number of men onely. What he did and taught, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> soundly collects, must be perpetually obserued in the Church; the circumstances vsed at his last Supper hee did not command vs to vse; but the substantiall acts of administring the Sacrament in both kinds. <hi>Fecitet Docuit,</hi> he both did, and taught vs to doe. Wherefore as Saint <note n="d" place="margin">Confess. lib. 9. c. 2.

The second Argument drawne from the essence and perfection of this Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>THe Sacrament of the Eucharist is not entire, and perfect without the Cup.</p>

                     <p>The proposition is euident, by the institution of this Sacrament, and the confession of our aduersaries: for this Sacrament was instituted in two kinds, bread and wine: as Christ blessed the one Element, so the other; as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the one to be taken and eaten: so likewise or in like manner Luk. 22. 20. <hi>hee commanded the other to be taken, and drunke.</hi> As a man that hath but one eye, or one eare, or one arme, or leg, is not a perfect man, but a maimed, because nature intende all those organs to bee double; and the operation is more compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in both organs, then it can be in one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: In like manner he cannot be said to receiue the Sacrament entire, and perfect who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it but in one kind onely: because Christ
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21367:24"/>
instituted it in two kinds, and ordained the full significancie and efficacie to bee compleat in both, and not in one onely.

Argument 3. drawne from the Analogie of the thing signified to the signe.</head>
                     <p>THe signe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cup ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to none, vpon whom God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the grace signified by the signe:</p>
                     <p>Upon all faithfull Christians God confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the grace signified by that signe:</p>
                     <p>Therefore that signe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cup ought to be denied to no faithfull Christian.</p>
                     <p>The proposition is deduced from the words of <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 10. 47.</note> S. <hi>Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghost as well as we?</hi> Surely to whom God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the end, hee intendeth the vse of the meanes. <note n="n" place="margin">Lor. in hac verba.</note> 
                        <hi>Lorinus</hi> out of the ordinary glosse conceiues the Apostle to vse an argument <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori,</hi> which he thus reduceth to forme.</p>
                     <p>If God hath giuen that which is greater, no man ought to forbid the lesser:</p>
                     <p>But God hath giuen them the holy Ghost, which is the greater;</p>
                     <p>Therefore none ought to denie them the baptisme of water, which is the lesse.</p>
                     <p>This is all one, as if when the Pope hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed an Archbishoprick vpon any Bishop, the Datary should deny him the Pale: or when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21367:26"/>
the Vniuersity hath conferred the degree of Doctor, the Beadle should denie him his Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Hoode: or when the Captaine hath admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a souldier into his band, any vnder officer should forbid him to weare his colours. As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, if not far more, it is, when God the Lord and Master conferres the thing signified by the Sacrament, for man, the seruant, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to denie the signe.</p>
                     <p>The asumption is easily prooued; for the thing signified by the Cup, is either the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Christs blood,</hi> as the Apostle testifieth; <hi>The</hi>

                        <hi>Cup of Blessing which we blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ?</hi> Or it is remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins by the blood-shedding of Christ, as the words of the institution imply; <hi>This is the blood of the new Testament, which is shed for man for the remission of sins:</hi> Neither of which benefits the Romanists dare to exclude the Laietie from. They haue vnion with Christ by faith, therefore Communion of his blood: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the remission of sinnes by Christs blood shed vpon the Crosse, with what colour then can the Romanists take away from them the Cup, the signe and pledge thereof? if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against this argument, that children, &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious persons, such as cannot brook wine, receiue the thing signified, <hi>viz.</hi> remission of sins, and participate of Christs blood, and yet <note place="margin">A Popish cauill.</note> drink not of the holy Cup; the answer is easie; None are by this argument meant, but such as desire the Cup, and are capable thereof: such
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21367:26"/>

                     <p>NOne can drink in the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cup:</p>

                     <p>Therefore all that communicate, ought to haue the Cup giuen them.</p>
                     <p>The proposition cannot be denyed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is so neere betweene drinking and the Cup; none drinke but by taking the Cup; none taketh the Cup in the Lords Supper, but hee drinketh: Spirituall drinking indeed may bee <note place="margin">* For albeit the Pope at this day is said to sucke the wine out of a quill, and in some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches anciently the people dranke out of pipes, for feare of spilling: yet this drinking was not without the cup, out of which they dranke, though not immediately as we doe, and they ought to doe, according to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apostles themselues.</note> without a materiall Cup, or Chalice; but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and sensible, such as is drinking in the Sacrament, which is a visible signe, cannot be without the Cup.</p>
                     <p>The assumption may be collected, if not out of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 6. 53. and 56. <hi>vnlesse you drinke my
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21367:28"/>
blood you haue no life in you: and hee that drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me:</hi> (because some Iudicious Diuines vnderstand those texts of Spirituall, and not Sacramentall drinking) yet most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently out of other texts of Scripture, which by consent of all diuines, either directly point vnto, or manifestly allude to drinking in the Sacrament; As the 1. Cor. 11. 28. <hi>So let him drinke of that Cup:</hi> vers. 29. <hi>Whosoeuer drinketh vnworthily, drinketh damnation vnto himself.</hi> And 1. Cor. 10. 4.

                     <p>This whole argument is confirmed by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> himselfe, one of the learnedest of all the Popes, and best studied in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In his fourth booke of the Mysteries of the masse, <hi>c.</hi> 21. The <hi>blood of Christ is</hi>

And therefore albeit we should admit, that the blood of Christ might in some sort be taken together with the bodie, because
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21367:29"/>
now since his resurrection and ascention, they are neuer seuered; but where his body is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and really, there is his blood also: yet this doth not satisfie Christs command, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that we distinctly <hi>Drinke of the Cup, or wine, which he calleth his blood,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. and that <hi>we drinke his blood,</hi> Iohn 6. 53. which most of our learned aduersaries vnderstand proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of drinking Christs blood really present, as they belieue, in the Sacrament. Were his blood really present, as they suppose, in the bread by the words of consecration turned into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy yet certainely in eating the body they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to drinke his blood: for eating is not drinking; neither can any man possible imagine true reall and proper drinking of any thing, which is not <hi>sub liquidâ formâ,</hi> as Christs blood cannot bee <hi>sub forma panis,</hi> vnder the forme of bread, which is drie and solid.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21367:30"/>
If the Priest in receiuing the bread onely signifie not whole Christ, nor represent the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his blood shed for vs, as <hi>Alfonsus</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; neither doe the people in so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating either receiue whole Christ, or celebrate the memorie of his blood shed vpon the Crosse, and offered for vs, to which end especially this Sacrament was instituted. Lastly, if the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were instituted vnder a double forme, or in two kinds, not onely as a sacrifice represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christs Sacrifice on the Crosse, but also as a Sacrament (as <hi>Vasquez</hi> determineth the point) then doubtlesse it may no more be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Sacrament, then as a sacrifice; and he is as well guiltie of sacriledge, who takes away one part of the Sacrament, as hee who takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one part of the Sacrifice. If they answer, that though the Sacrament was instituted in two kinds, yet that it is really intire in one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the body is not now without the blood, nor the blood without the body: so we reply, that the Sacrifice is entire also in one kinde. If the doctrine of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>comitancie take place in the Sacrament, it must needs take place also in the sacrifice; if in the people receiuing the bread represents and exhibits whole Christ, it must needs do also in the Priests co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrating.

This answer is substantially refuted by <hi>Iansenius in Liturge.</hi>

                        <hi>lib. 4. and</hi> 7. and thereby the former argument very much strengthned. First, saith he, <hi>the answer were to some purpose, if Christ by will had disposed onely of the things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sacrament; but Christ in his legacie had respect not onely to the thing signified, but also to the signe, for the manifestation of his Passion, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of his death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee acutely and truly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the will of the testator might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, in giuing the whole legacie at once, or twise, if it were of the nature of monie, which may bee payd in one great piece, or in many small amounting to the same value: But <note n="c" place="margin">Nec res sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentales perplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res formas diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, nec Ecclesiae arbitrio sub v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam contrahi.

                        <hi>it is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21367:32"/>
not so in the Sacrament,</hi> saith he, <hi>the thing signified by the Sacrament cannot by the discretion of the Church be deuided into more formes, nor be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one.</hi> It is not in the powre of the Church, to make the body alone to be vnder the forme of bread; nor the blood alone vnder the forme of wine; nor both of them together vnder one forme, or kinde. Therefore, as when a man bequeatheth to any by his wil one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound in coyne, and one thousand pound in ancient plate of such a making; he that pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole legacie, either in coyne onely, or in plate onely, violates the will, because though he may giue the valew, yet hee giues not the thing in specie bequethed; so although it should be granted, which yet is not, that the Priest giueth to the people the body &amp; blood of Christ in the bread; yet hee violates the will of the testator, because he giueth it not so as it may be drunke, or in the forme of wine. Whence I conclude, that what the Apostle saith: <hi>No man offereth to the will of a man;</hi> The <note place="margin">Gal 3. 15.</note> Romanists offer to the last will and testament of God our Lord: and therefore are guiltie not onely of greuious sacriledge, but also of grand fraud and impietie, in violating the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of our Sauiour, and deceiuing the people of a most pretious legacie bequeathed by him vnto them.</p>

The eight Argument drawne from the end of the Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>THis Sacrament ought in such wise to be receiued by al Communicants, that thereby the death of Christ may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented and shewed forth:</p>
                     <p>But without partaking of the Cup, it cannot bee so receiued, that thereby Christs death may be represented and shewed forth:</p>
                     <p>Therefore without pertaking of the Cup, it ought not to be receiued by any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</p>
                     <p>The proposition is the Apostles. 1. Cor. 11. 28. <hi>As often as you eate this bread, and drinke this Cup, you shew forth the Lords death, till he come againe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The assumption is euident to sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: to sense for the breaking of bread repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth in no wise the effusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bloud: to reason for blood which is contained in the body and vaines, no way sheweth the killing or bloodie death of the partie; but the blood, if it be at all in the bread (which we denie,) it can be there no otherwise, as themselues confesse, then by concomitancie, as contained in, not seuered from the body: as inclosed <hi>in,</hi> not shed <hi>out</hi> of the veines. Therefore if it should be granted to our aduersaries, that the blood might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the bread by it selfe: yet by such recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21367:33"/>
Christs death by the effusion of his blood for vs, could in no wise be represented, or shewed forth; which yet is acknowledged to be the principall end of the celebration of this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>This whole argument is confirmed by <hi>

It may be, that wits, if they be put vpon the rack, may finde out euasions for any argument; but a true solution, on which a man may settle his conscience, no Papist can euer giue. For if the Priest be bound to consecrate, and receiue the wine a part, because otherwise hee should not represent the effusion of Christs blood: by the same reason, all Communicants that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament, ought to take the wine apart, being mystically Christs blood, as well as the Priests: because they in their eating and drinking are commanded to <hi>shew forth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Christs death,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth vs. Neither can it be said, that this manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, <hi>to shew forth Christs death,</hi> was necessary onely, till such time as the Church in the Councell of Constance had otherwise ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for the Apostles Canon extendeth to Christs second comming; <note n="e" place="margin">1.

                           <p>AFter the writings of the blessed Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whose testimonie in the ninth argument is discussed, I alleadge for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Church in this first age <hi>Dionysius Areopagita, Martialis Lemouicensis, Clemens Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius Antiochenus.</hi> For albeit I assent thus farre to our learned Critickes, that these Authors are not altogether currant; there is some drosse in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> more in <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
                              <pb n="35" facs="tcp:21367:35"/>
and most of all in <hi>Clemens:</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> is vndoubtedly <hi>post-natus</hi> 300. yeeres at lest yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then his age is set in the Romane register; yet for the reasons following, I thought fit to produce these Authors, and ranke them in the first age. First, because our aduersaries vsually so ranke them, and alleage them against vs for fathers of the first age; and surely if their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies bee good and ancient, when they seeme to make against vs, they are to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as good and ancient, when they make for vs.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, because we cannot make authors, but must take such as we finde, these are the only authors that are extant, out of whom te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies may be alleadged for this first age. Therefore as the sage Senatour of Capua, when the people vpon a iust distaste giuen by the Magistrates, had a purpose at once to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheere them all, aduised them: Before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue these, choose fitter in their places; and when diuers were named vnto them, and they could like of none, in the end hee perswaded them to keepe the old officers, till they could agree to name better in their roomes: so I would desire our Critikes to name vs more approued authors in this age, then these are, and if they can name none, then to let these hold their places, and the estimation they haue had for many hundred yeeres.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, because I hold it no good Topick, to argue <hi>à parte ad totum,</hi> affirmatiuely in this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21367:36"/>
manner. There are some false passages, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in an author: therefore the author is spurious, and of no credit. If we may thus fillip off ancient Writers, wee shall haue but a few left. If there are (as no doubt there bee) diuers dead boughes &amp; superfluous stemmes in these Writers of so long standing: let our Criticks prune them off, not cut the trees downe by the roots. <hi>Poliat lima, non exterat,</hi> saith <hi>Fabius,</hi> let the pluimer smooth the timber &amp; cut of the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged knobs, not grate or weare out the heart of it. <hi>Volo nasutum, non polyposum.</hi> Fourthly, because the testimonies I cite out of these authors, were neuer questioned, much lesse proued to be taken for good by the aduersarie, vntill he can disproue them, according to the rule of the Ciuill law: <hi>supponitur esse bonus, qui non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur esse malus,</hi> he is supposed to be an honest man, who was neuer proued otherwise.

                           </p>
                           <p>First, that if we may not trust the Greeke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> much lesse may we trust the Latine translations; especially since of late they are come into hucksters hands. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from a translation to the originall is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21367:39"/>
but to appeale from the originall to a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is a thing vnheard of. This is to make the brooke or streame to bee purer then the fountaine or spring. The Poet teacheth <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> another lesson:

                              <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as it is well knowne, wrote in Greeke, and therefore vnlesse <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can proue, that other Greeke copies agree with his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine translation, and not with ours, he speaketh nothing to the purpose: for a translation is of no credit further, then it agrees with the <note n="*" place="margin">And howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine copy, that translateth the words of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> sets them downe, <hi>vnus Calix totius Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae;</hi> yet <hi>Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemeus,</hi> and diuers other Latine copies following the original verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, render them thus, <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus calix omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus distributus,</hi> that is, One Cup distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto all.</note> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</p>

                           <p>First, <hi>Ignatius</hi> exhorts there all to vnitie, because all eate of one bread, and drinke of one cup. His argument therefore standeth both in the vniuersalitie of them that drinke, and the vnitie of the Cup: and it may be thus reduced into forme.</p>
                           <p>All that eate of one bread, and drinke of one holy Cup, in remembrance of one body offered, and one blood shed for all, ought to embrace vnitie:</p>
                           <p>But all you of the Church of Philadelphia (people as well as Priests) eate of one bread, and drinke of one holy Cup, in memory of one body offered, and one blood of Christ shed for you all:</p>
                           <p>Therefore all you of the Church of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia ought to embrace vnitie, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue.</p>
                           <p>If the pinch, or straine of the argument were in vnitie only, it would not hold; for if some onely dranke of this Cup, and not others, this should rather make more for a diuision, then for vnitie; it is the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of more in one, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> layeth for the ground of his argument, enforcing vnitie.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, howsoeuer the argument stands,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21367:40"/>
it makes no great matter; sith we insist not so much vpon the argument it selfe, as vpon that his expresse affirmation; <hi>That one Cup in his time was giuen vnto all.</hi> This assertion alone suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prooueth the practise of the Church in his time.</p>

                           <p>First, it is not true, which he here affirmeth; that there were but few Christians in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time: for all histories of those times, and the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> testifie the contrary, and in this very Church of Philadelphia, the holy Ghost testifieth, Apoc. 3. 8. That there were many Christians. Behold, <hi>I haue set before thee an open dore, and no man shall shut it, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, though the Primitiue Church were not of that large extent, as the Church in suceeding ages: yet the authoritie of the Church in that age, in which the Apostles liued, and their immediate successors, is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21367:41"/>
farre greater, then in any later age.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, in this last answere the Cardinall yeeldeth vs the cause; for we cite these words of <hi>Ignatius</hi> onely to prooue the practise of the Primitiue Church, and thus much <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, whereupon I adde; that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed practise of the Primitiue Church was grounded on our Lords precept: <hi>drinke you all of this;</hi> for the Church so neere Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee supposed to haue swarued any way from his institution, by adding any thing vnto it, or taking away from it: certainely, <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and the Churches, wherein he bore sway, obserued the order and practise of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> his master; and if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> administred the Cup in all Churches to the people, so did the rest of the Apostles; for they varied not from Christ, or among themselues in celebrating the Lords Supper. And what the Apostles did ioyntly, no Christian doubteth, but they did by the direction of the holy Ghost, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Lords will and commandement. And thus wee see this example amounteth to a precept, and the practise in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time, ought to bee a president for all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times.</p>

                           <p>This solution will no way beare water. First, it is euident to any that reads the whole place, that <hi>Iustin Martyrs</hi> words, wherein he mentioneth Christs precept, belongeth both to the Consecration, and to the Communion. For after he had spoken of the Communion, he subioyneth these words; <hi>And therefore they cannot bee seuered from the Communion:</hi> The <hi>series</hi> or method of the passage in <hi>Iustin</hi> is thus: hauing rehearsed the words of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, <hi>This is my body, doe this in remembrance of me, and this Cup is the new Testament; drinke you all of this:</hi> he addeth; <hi>and he commanded, that they onely should participate, as had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore washed in the lauer of Regeneration, and lead such a life as Christ prescribed them.</hi> These words? <hi>that they onely should participate,</hi> clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the Cardinall, and demonstrate, that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> extendeth Christs command both to the Consecration, and to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion it selfe: which in Christs precept cannot be deuided, both being enioyned in this one precept; <hi>doe this in remembrance of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> that is, Consecrate, and Communicate.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, howsoeuer the Cardinall by any tricke of sophistrie shall dismember the whole sentence, and pull these words, <hi>As Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> from the rest, and refer them to which part of the sentence he pleaseth; yet he can

                           <p>This answer of theirs is weake, and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>

                              <pb n="47" facs="tcp:21367:43"/>
First, because it is built on a weake and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous foundation. <hi>viz.</hi> the reall and carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christs body in the Sacrament vnder the accidents of bread and wine: which I haue else where by Scriptures and Fathers refelled. See the fisher caught in his owne net. part. 2.</p>
                           <p>That the doctrine of concomitancie is builded vpon the reall and carnall presence, is not denied by the Romanists, for they make the one the ground of the other.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, albeit wee should grant, that the Laiety in some sence receiue the blood of Christ in the bread; yet they receiue it not so as Christ commandeth: for they receiue it not by drinking; No man drinketh in eating, or eateth in Drinking.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the blood of Christ, which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the Sacrament, we receiue not as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in his veines, or as being a part of, or ioyned vnto his body; but as shed for vs: In which quality and manner it is impossible to receiue the blood of Christ together with, and in the body by naturall concomitancy.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, whatsoeuer becommeth of the deuice of concomitancy, our aduersaries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cannot shift off <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> For in his fifth booke, and second Chapter, hee speaketh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly of the Cup, and declareth his meaning to be, that the faithfull are made partakers of eternall life by drinking Christs blood, (my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically) in the Chalice: He confirmed the Chalice or Cup, which is a <note n="t" place="margin">Caliccm, qui est creatura, suu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sanguinem, qui effusus est, confirmauit, ex quo auget no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum singui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. <hi>Et post:</hi> quando mistus calix, &amp; fractus panis pereipit verbum Dei, fit Eucbaristia cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris &amp; sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Christi: quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo negant carnem esseca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacem donatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Dei, que est vita aeterna, quae sanguine &amp; corpore Christi nutritur, &amp; est membrum?</note> creature, to be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21367:44"/>
his blood, shed for vs, <hi>wherewith our blood is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished:</hi> and a little after; <hi>when the mingled Cup and bread broken receiueth the Word of God</hi> (that is the benediction, or consecration) <hi>it is made the Eucharist or Sacrament of Christs body and blood: how then doe they (the heretiques) denie, that our flesh is capable of the gift of God, which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, sith it is nourished with Christs body and blood, and is a member?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From these passages of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thus I collect his argument.</p>
                           <p>All they that in the Sacrament of the Lord Supper eate of the bread, and drinke of the Cup consecrated, are nourished by Christs body and blood to eternal life:</p>
                           <p>All faithfull Christians, or worthy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants eate of the bread, and drinke of the consecrated Cup:</p>
                           <p>Therefore all faithfull Christians, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy communicants are nourished by Christs body and blood to eternall life.</p>
                           <p>If the aduersarie will haue the assumption restrained to Priests onely, he must needs in like manner restraine the conclusion to Priests only; which is little lesse then heresie. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his intent and drift in that place is, to confirme all the faithfull in the doctrine of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therfore his <hi>medium</hi> must be vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, and such as holds as well for the Christian people, as for the Priest.</p>

                           <p>This answer of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is many wayes defectiue.</p>
                           <p>First, when we gaue him three wounds, he applieth a plaister but to one of them, and it is too narrow for that too: hee cunningly silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth our strong allegations out of <hi>Clemens,</hi> and singleth out one of the weakest.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that passage of <hi>Clemens,</hi> to which alone hee would seeme to say something, hee saith indeed nothing. For if the drinking of Christs blood bee a meanes to attaine our Lords incorruption, or immortality, as <hi>Bellar,</hi> out of <hi>Clemens</hi> confesseth, although he denyeth it to be the onely means; why should the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be depriued of this means? Our argument out of <hi>Clemens</hi> standeth thus.</p>
                           <p>None ought to be depriued of the meanes of attaining our Lords incorruption, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
                           <p>But the drinking of Christs blood is the meanes to attaine immortallitie:</p>
                           <p>Therefore none ought to bee depriued of the vse of the Cup: I meane none that are fit guests for the Lords table.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Clemens</hi> saith not, <hi>to take Christs blood, but to drinke it, is to partake of incorruption.</hi> And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21367:45"/>
therefore, albeit Christs blood might bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise participated, then by drinking of the Cup, this satisfieth not <hi>Clemens</hi> his intention and scope, who speaketh expressely of taking of it in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by drinking.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his answer beggeth the question. For he supposeth, that Christs blood, is taken in the bread, as his body in the Cup, which I haue before refuted out of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius.</hi>

The people may and do feede vpon Christs blood, though they

                           <p>This nicity will not serue the turne. First because <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh of the body and blood of Christ as distinct things, saying, <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re et sanguine.</hi> Now the blood taken as a distinct thing from the body, cannot bee fed vpon, but by drinking: we feed vpon the blood of Christ in the Sacrament as shed for vs; and therefore necessarily as seuered from the body. And how is it possible, to take blood, or feede vpon it as shed and seuered from the body, without drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it? All faithfull Christians in <hi>Tertullian</hi> his time fed vpon Christs blood, as distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the body; they dranke it therefore. Why then doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> vse the Verbe, <hi>vesci,</hi> signifying to feed vpon, &amp; not <hi>bibere,</hi> signifying to drinke? The reason is euident, because hee speaketh of the partaking of both the body and the blood, which he could not expresse by the word, <hi>Drinke,</hi> because wee drinke not the body; he vseth, therefore a common word <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> to feed, which may be applied to both acts, eating and drinking; namely, eating the body, and drinking the blood. Feeding is as the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to both, and may bee affirmed of both, For which cause <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking of both made choice of it, rather then of the Verbe, <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,</hi> which could not agree to <hi>Corpore,</hi> though

                           <head>The Refutation.</head>
                           <p>Neither of these answeres will beare scale, both of them are to light by many graines: the first of these is liable to these exceptions.</p>
                           <p>First, it is impertinent: for we bring the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to prooue the practise of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church concerning the Laieties partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the Cup: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> craftily waues that poynt, and questioneth by what right the people did Communicate. Admit that, which is most falfe, that the Bishop or Priest gaue the people all the right they had to the Cup, yet they had it, and vsed it; their practise therefore maketh for vs.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is inconsequent: for first, when a'man is Excommunicated, and hath lost his right to the Lords Table, a Bishop vpon the parties submission, and sorrow for his sin, and humble intreatie, may restore him to his right againe, and set him where he was: yet this prooueth not, that the Laietie had their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall right of Communicating from them; as a Bishop may vpon iust cause suspend a Lay man, or Cleargie from the Communion, so he may also exclude him from hearing of the word, and publike prayer; yet no man will hence conclude, that the Laietie, or Priest haue no right at all to come into the Church, and to pray, and to heare Gods word, but from the Bishop. Albeit <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his owne
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21367:49"/>
Church, and any other Bishop in his Diocesse may admit, or reiect some particular persons vpon iust cause from the Communion: yet it will not from hence follow, that the Bishop of Rome may take away either the Cup, or the Bread from Gods people in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, it is no good inference, that because the Bishop may depriue a man of the whole Sacrament vpon some causes, <hi>viz.</hi> for a great crime, or high misdemeanor, that therefore he may depriue him of a part of it without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fault at all, as the Romanists doe the Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in generall.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, a Bishop may dispence with his owne censures, or reuoke them; but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dispence with Gods law. To suspend a man from the whole Communion, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent deserue it, is agreeable to Christs and the Apostles discipline; but to admit him to one part of the Sacrament, and not to the other, is a manifest violation of Christs ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, who instituted this Sacrament in two kinds, and said to the same, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> to whom before he said, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, and lastly, if it were sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to redeliuer the Cup in these times to the Laietie, who haue been deseruedly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of it, namely to arme them against emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persecution, why should not the faithfull people of God, especially those, who neuer
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21367:49"/>
incurred the censure of Excommunication, or suspension, be much rather admitted to drinke of the Cup, to arme them against as great, or greater conflicts of temptations?

                           <p>This slight colour of answer is easily wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away: for</p>
                           <p>First, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in the originall Greek hath no word signifying <hi>parts,</hi> or diuision into parts, but saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, &amp;c. that the Priest fed on other things, and that the Laietie might not feed vpon the same: as for example; The laitie might not at all eat of the shew bread, and in the sacrifices the people might not eate of the same, <hi>specie,</hi> or <hi>numero,</hi> which the Priest eate. For the Law expresly set downe what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Priest to eate, and what to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21367:54"/>
people: but in the new Testament it is not so: for the people may eat of the bread, which the Priest eateth, and drinke also of the same Cup. This is euidently Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> meaning.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, although it is true which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> saith, that the whole Sacrament is eaten by euery Communicant; yet this must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the integrity of the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of the essence of that signe, not of the integrity of the quantitie of the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For no one man eateth the whole loafe, or quantity of bread, that is consecrated, nor drinketh the whole measure of wine, that is sanctified, but a portion onely. Herein then the difference is not betweene the Priests of the old Law, and the Priests of the new, that the Priests of the old Law might eate but a part of the Sacrifice, but the Priests of the new might eat the whole. For if we speake of the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, both receiued the whole, if of the signes, neither receiues the whole, that is, the entire quantity of the thing offered. The difference was in this, according to S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that the people simply might not eat of those things, of which the Priest might, but in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the people may eat of all that the Priests may.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, although we should admit of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> answer touching the condition of the Priest and people of the old law, and the new; that they of the old fed of the sacrifice apart, each hauing their seuerall portions appointed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21367:55"/>
for them; but that the Prists and people of the new, receiued the sacrament entirely, the Priest entirely, and the people entirely, which in some sence is true: yet this no way satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the words of Saint <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> who saith expresly, that <hi>one Cup as well as one bread is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all people, as well as Priests, and that according to Christs institution in the new testament.</hi>

                           <p>Among the Decrees of ancient Popes col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by <hi>Gratian,</hi> we finde that sentence of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius,</hi> which I haue set in the frontispiece of this booke, <hi>Grat. de consecra. dist. 2. cap. Comperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> 
                              <note n="l" place="margin">Aut integra sacramenta, percipiunt aut ab integris ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceantur.</note> 
                              <hi>We find that some receiuing a portion of Christs holy Body, abstaine from the Cup of his sacred blood: which because they doe out of I know not what super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, we comand, that either they receiue the entire Sacraments, or that they be entirely withheld from them, because the diuision of one and the selfe-same mysterie cannot be without grand sacriledge.</hi> In this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21367:58"/>
Decree of <hi>Gelasius,</hi> first, we are to note, that it is a Papall decision <hi>ex Cathedra;</hi> That the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Lords Supper must bee taken ioyntly. This <hi>Gelasius</hi> determineth not as a priuate man, but as a Pope <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> and therefore all Papists are bound to beleeue, that hee did not, nor could not erre in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is to bee noted, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper is not entire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cup, which quite ouerthroweth our aduersaries new fancy of concomitancy.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, it is to bee noted, that hee defineth the withholding the Cup from any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, or deuiding the holy mysterie, by halfe communicating, not onely to bee sacriledge, but to be grand sacriledge, or the greatest sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that can bee committed. For <hi>grande</hi> is more then <hi>magnum,</hi> or <hi>graue,</hi> and it signifieth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in the highest degree.</p>
                        </div>

                              <hi>Gratian,</hi> or his glosse in the title to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree would beare vs in hand, that this Decree concerneth the <note n="*" place="margin">Itarespondet Aquinas, part. 3. q. 80. &amp; Thomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stae passim.</note> Priests only, and not the Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For a Priest to consecrate, or to offer the bread without the wine, or after they haue consecrated both, to participate but of one, this <hi>Gelasius</hi> forbids, say they; but not the Layetie to communicate in one kind onely. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addes a second answer; that this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21367:58"/>
Canon was made against the Manichees, and Priscillianists, who refused the Cup in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, partly because they held wine in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, partly because they beleeued not, that Christ had true blood in him. These, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in token and testimony that they had reformed their former errour, are commanded to receiue the Sacrament in both kinds, or else not at all to be admitted vnto the Communion.</p>
                        </div>

                           <head>The Refutation.</head>
                           <p>Neither of these wards will beare off the blow. For first, it is not likely, that <hi>Gelasius</hi> made this decree against the Manichees, or Priscillianists: for then hee would not haue said, <hi>Quia nescio quâ superstitione astricti tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> that is, that they were intangled in I know not what superstition; but rather, <hi>Quia nota haeresi astricti tenentur:</hi> that is, they doe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are intangled in a knowne heresie.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, admit that the Manichees, and Priscillianists occasioned this decree; yet this decree is backed with a generall reason, which forbids all to Communicate in one kind only, vnder the perill of grand Sacrilege.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gratians</hi> euasion will no way saue the Laietie harmelesse, or acquit them of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege: where of the Priest by this decree, say they, is made guiltie: For that which is Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in the Priest, cannot be Religion in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21367:59"/>
people. <hi>Gelasius</hi> saith not, that the Sacrilege consisteth in the diuision of one and the selfe same sacrifice, but in the diuision of one and the selfe same mysterie. Now the selfe same mystery, or Sacrament is diuided as well in the halfe Communion of the people, as of the Priest.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, it is euident, that the decree concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Communicants, and not the Priests Conficients, or administring. For the word <hi>arceantur,</hi> that is, let them be kept from, or driuen from the entire Sacrament, must needs be meant of the people. For the people sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not the Priests from the Sacrament, but the Priests, or Bishops the people. Here Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Euerard</hi> is locked fast with a like paire of fetters to those, which <hi>Campian</hi> makes for Protestants. As he saith, <hi>Patres,</hi> so I say, <hi>Papas admittis? Captus es; exludis? Nullus es.</hi> Doe you allow of the Popes decissions? You are then taken. Doe you disallow of them? You are no body in the opinion of your owne selues. If you subscribe to the determination of two Popes, <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Gelasius,</hi> you must confesse your selfe guilty of Sacrilege: if you subscribe not to them, of heresie. <hi>Vtrum horum mauis, accipe.</hi>

                           <hi>Tullie</hi> writeth of <hi>Hortensius,</hi> that after his Consulship he decayed in his rare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of eloquence, though not so sensibly, that euery auditor might perceiue it: yet in such sort, that a cunning artist might obserue, that he drew not so cleare a stroake in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-pieces, nor cast on them so rich and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colours, as before. Such was the state of the Church in this age. It decayed and failed, though not so sensibly, and grossely, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary reader might take notice thereof: yet in such sort, that the learned and iudicious haue discouered in the writers of this age, and much more after, a declination from the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of former ages, both in stile and doctrine. Their Latine much degenerated into barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme; and their deuotion into superstition. Whence it is, that the prime Doctors of the Reformed Churches, who appeale from the late corruptions in the Romish Church to the prime sinceritie in the first and best ages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this their appeale within the pale of the fifth age.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, the reader is not to demaund, or expect from hence forth, either so frequent testimonies, or at least, of men of that eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and reuerend authority, as the former

were.

For first, the Fathers alleadged speake of the body and blood of Christ, as distinct things; and therefore not as of one inuolued in the other by the doctrine of Concomitancy: to approach vnto, to take the body of Christ and his blood, or the creature of bread and wine sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed into Christs body and blood, as <hi>Beda</hi> speaketh, is not to take bread onely, and wine by, I know not what, consequence; or the body onely in <hi>specie,</hi> and the blood by Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, could this answer be appliable to other generall sentences of the Fathers, yet not to these, in which there is expresse menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the <hi>Chalice, of powring out the blood of Christ, and taking it as drinke;</hi> and therfore vnder the forme of wine. And who are they that so receiue it? The Laietie as wel as the Priests, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse none but Priests are faithful Christians, or all lepers &amp; excommunicate, or suspended per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are to bee taken for Priests. <hi>Beda</hi> reacheth the Cup to the faithful indifferently, and <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to penitents after confession and contrition, of what ranck so euer. Yea leapers are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded simply, but secluded, that they might

For as the materiall food outwardly nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the body, and maketh it quicke and liuely, so the Word of God within nourisheth, and strengtheneth

Who soeuer</hi> (saith he) <hi>eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, he abides in me, and I in him. Wherefore of necessity we must take his body and blood, that we may abide in him, and be made members of his body.</hi> In these passages this learned Bishop euery way stops the mouth of our aduersaries. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, that he speakes of Priests only; for he speakes of all <hi>faithfull,</hi> that either are already, or are to bee made members of Christs body. Neither can they shift off this passage, as they doe some others, by granting, that the people may, but denying, that they ought to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in both kinds. For he presseth very farre the necessitie of thus communicating, without which he supposeth neither communion with Christ, nor eternall life can be obtained. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lastly, can they euade by their doctrine of concomitancy, saying, that the people parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the blood in the body, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the consecrated Hoste. For he speaketh distinctly of eating and drinking, bread and drinke, and <hi>sacraments,</hi> in the plurall number, which cannot possibly be vnderstood of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating the bread onely, or communicating in one kind after the Popish manner.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he saith, that <hi>Paschasius</hi> doth <hi>not expound the words of our Lord, as they are in Matthew, but as they seeme to be spoken of Christ, when the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is administred in the Church. His reason is; In the institution of the Sacrament, there were no other Ministers present distinguished from other belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and therfore Christs words, as they were vttered then, no way admitteth</hi> Paschasius <hi>explication, Drinke ye all of this, as well Ministers as other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</hi> Thirdly, hee saith, <hi>that the words of</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasius <hi>make much for the opinion of the Romish Church. For they signifie, that Christs blood is to bee drunk, but vnder the forme of bread, not vnder the forme of wine,</hi> As for <hi>Haymo,</hi> hee answers him with a short come-off, saying, He spake of the <note n="*" place="margin">Respondeo, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur iste au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (vt supra diximus Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; Chrysosto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum) de vnitate calicis.

                           <p>The threefold answer of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasius,</hi> is not like a threefold cable that cannot be broken, but rather like a rustie twisted wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-string, that breakes with the least strayne. First, he beareth vs in hand, that the place in <hi>Paschasius</hi> seemes to be corrupted. Corrupted?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21367:71"/>
By whom? by Papists? Surely they would neuer haue corrupted this text to make against themselues: by Protestants? That cannot be. for no Protestants haue set forth <hi>Paschasius,</hi> for ought we find, or haue had any thing to doe in that Edition of <hi>Paschasius,</hi> which we cite. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, in all the ancient impressions of <hi>Paschasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and the Manu-scripts, that haue come to our sight, the words are found as we cite them. Yea but <hi>Iohn</hi> of Louane suspects, that the copies are faulty, and that, <hi>bibite,</hi> is put for, <hi>edite, Drinke yee, for eat ye:</hi> why so? because the words going before are, <hi>he distributeth the bread by the hands of his ministers to the beleeuers, saying, Take yee, and drinke yee all of this.</hi> This reason like a rope of sand, hath no coherence at all. For though <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casius</hi> spake of bread, yet to proue that Christ is he, who alone by his Ministers distributeth the sacrament, he rehearseth the words of the institution both concerning the Bread, and the Cup; neither can, <hi>bibite,</hi> or drink you in <hi>Pascha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> be put for <hi>edite,</hi> eate ye, but must stand as it doth; <hi>drinke yee.</hi> For the words immediately following in <hi>Paschasius</hi> are, for <hi>this is the new and eternall Testament.</hi> Now what a ridiculous infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence were it, if we read the words, as <hi>Iohn</hi> of Louane would haue vs: <hi>take, eate this, for this is the Cup of the blood of the new and euerlasting testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Bellarmine</hi> his second answer is as absurd as his first. For <hi>Paschasius</hi> his words make more strongly for vs, and against himself, if <hi>Paschasius</hi> expound the words, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> as they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21367:72"/>
seeme to bee spoken by Christ, not at the first Institution, but afterwards, whensoeuer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is administred in the Church; If now also, whensoeuer the sacrament is administred in the Church, Christ commandeth, <hi>drink ye all of this,</hi> that is with <hi>Paschasius</hi> glosse, all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, &amp; other beleeuers; it followeth, that all other beleeuers, as well as Ministers, ought now by Christs command to drinke of the cup. Thirdly, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his first answer is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the text of <hi>Paschasius,</hi> and his second a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe, so his third is against common sence. How can blood bee drunke vnder the forme of bread? if we speake of drinking sigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely by faith, this kind of drinking the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists explode. If he speake of drinking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly with the mouth, euery suckling is able to confute the Cardinall, who know by meere sense, that nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be drunk, but that which is moist, and of liquid substance? Nay, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal discourseth like a man that had drank too deep of the wine, forgetting in this page, what he said in the former. There he saith, that the fathers doe not say, that Christs blood is to be drunke of the people by the mouth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but here he saith, that other beleeuers, as well as Ministers, by Christs command ought to drinke it, but after a manner neuer heard of before, to drinke it vnder the forme of bread.</p>
                           <p>Now for his answer to <hi>Haymo pari facilitate reijcitur, quâ profertur,</hi> tis as easy to be reiected, as vrged. For first, the Cardinal corrupteth the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21367:72"/>
text of <hi>Haymo:</hi> hee saith not, the Cup is the Communion, because all drinke of that <hi>one</hi> Cup, the word <hi>one</hi> is not in <hi>Haymo.</hi> Admit it were; this no way disapointeth our allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of <hi>Haymo.</hi> For still this word <hi>omnes,</hi> or <hi>al,</hi> remaines. And be it out of one Cup, or more, <hi>Haymo</hi> saith expresly, <hi>that all did partake of it, and receiued of the blood of Christ contained in it.</hi> If all, then the people, as well as the Priests.</p>

                              <hi>Councel indeed forbids the dipping of the bread, vpon this ground, that our Lord gaue not bread dipt, or sopt in the wine: neither can any such</hi>

                              <hi>If the Councell should haue said so, wee would haue answered, that the Councell speakes of that time, in which it was free for the Laietie to communicate in both kinds.</hi> For then if any desired both kinds, the Councell commandeth, that both be giuen vnto them, to wit, bread and wine a part, and not a sop of bread dipt in the wine.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21367:76"/>
The first thus presently dissolueth: the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Bracara doth as well command Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnion in both kindes, as forbid receiuing the bread dipt in wine for the intire Communion: for thus standeth the argument. In admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Sacrament, wee ought to doe as Christ did, and no otherwaies: but Christ at his last Supper deliuered first bread by it selfe, and then wine, and not bread and wine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a sop, or bread dipt in wine: therefore we ought in like manner to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in both kindes seuerally, and not by intinction, or sopping the bread in the wine. Who seeth not, that this Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is a two edged sword, cutting off Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancie on the one side, as well as intinction on the other: and giuing as deepe a wound to the late Councell of Constance, inioyning the mutilation of the Sacrament; as to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councell of Toures, inioyning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of it, by the infusion of the bread into the Cup. The second answere doth vanish to nothing: the Councell in deed spake of that time, wherein the Communion of both kindes was free. For so it had been from the time of the Apostles, and continued in the Romane Church, till the Councell of Constance: and in the Greeke Church till this day. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wrong is offered by the Romanists to the Laietie, from whom they haue taken the Cup after so many hundred yeeres possession. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such thing had been attempted in the time
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21367:77"/>
of this Councell at Bracara, they would haue been as earnest, or more earnest against this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, then they were against that in their time, which was farre lesse; for of the two, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to receiue the bread dipt in the wine, then the bread, and no wine at all. The Councell doth not ground it selfe vpon any supposed dispensation of the Church, for the Laieties Communion in both kindes, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, but vpon the institution of Christ, and the example of the Apostles, which in their iudgement ought to preuaile against any sanction of Councell, or custome of any place whatsoeuer to the contrarie.</p>

For, as he accounteth, the blood is neuer seuered from the body, and the blood is vnder the forme of bread. Hee therefore, who taketh the bread, taketh the body &amp; blood of Christ: and consequently communicateth intirely. But besides, that this proposition of his, hath beene heretofore refuted, I adde first in generall, that, albeit we should admit, that in the iudgement of the Fathers in this Age, the blood of Christ were with the body, and with the forme of bread: yet there is no Cup, nor Wine in the bread, no drinking in eating, no powring out of the wine, or blood into the mouthes of the faithfull. Of which the writers of this Age speake so expresly, that those of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who haue not rubbed hard their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, neuer so much as offer to make answer to these testimonies, but haue held it the wisest course, neuer to take notice of them. Secondly, for Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in particular, his words haue relation to the Institution of Christ, saying, <hi>The entire foode of the body and blood of Christ was that day first exhibited: nay, at our Lords last supper</hi> there was wine, as well as bread.

                              <hi>Bernard,</hi> saith he, speakes plainely of the other part of nourishment, which is taken by way of drinke vnder the forme of wine. What then?

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21367:90"/>
which distinction the Papists at this day hold before them, as a buckler to beare off our arguments, drawne from the necessity of representing Christs death in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by receiuing his blood apart, as seuered from his body. He also infringeth their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon argument for their halfe Communion, drawne from the example of the Disciples at Emaus, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his breaking bread in the ship. For he truly and acutely noted, that if these Texts are to be expounded of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in one kind only, that it would from thence follow, that it were not onely lawfull for the people to communicate in one kind on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for Priests, such as the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Disciples were, to consecrate in one kind onely. Thus he saw light as it were by a chinke; but <note n="p" place="margin">Historia Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilij Trid. lib. 6. pag 423.</note>

The Papists Arguments drawne from Scripture an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and retorted.</head>
                     <p>SECT. 11. THe first argument, vrged by our aduersaries for their halfe Communion, is drawn from the types and figures of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I will propound it in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne words, that they may not cauill, as they vse to doe, that wee marre their arguments in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them. Thus <note n="q" place="margin">Bell. de sacr. Euch. lib. 4. c. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> disputeth against vs: <hi>Most of the figures of the Eucharist in the old Testament signifie eating vnder one kind; it is not therefore probable, that Christ would command the eating of both kinds. For that which is figured, ought to answer the figure. The first figure was of the Tree of life in the midst of Paradise, which</hi> Paschasius <hi>in his booke of the body of our Lord, chap. 7. teacheth to haue been a type of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; but it was manifest, there was no drinke ioyned to that Tree. The second figure was of the Paschall Lambe, Exodus the 12. The third figure, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Exodus 26. The fourth was shew-bread, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus 25. The fifth, the sacrifices, in which the flesh
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21367:94"/>
was eaten, but the blood was not drunke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Argument we say,</p>
                     <p>First, that these figures were types of Christ himselfe, and not necessarily, or properly of the Sacrament of the new Testament. For types are shadowes representing the substance, and the body, not properly other types. Christ interpreteth Manna to be himselfe, Ioh. 6. <hi>I am the true bread that came downe from heauen.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Christ <hi>our Paschall Lambe,</hi> and saith, <hi>The Rocke that followed them was Christ.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Apoc. 2. by eating of <hi>the Tree of life in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of God, vnderstandeth not the sacramentall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi> which cannot be in heauen, where there are no sacred elements, but the spirituall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the flesh of the Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we admit, that the types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the old Law were representations of the Sacrament of the new; we answer then, that the types and figures of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be equally compared with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the new; part of them must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the part of these. For example, the Shew-bread, and Manna, and the flesh of the Lambe, and the Tree of life, prefigured one part, or kind in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to wit, the Bread: and the Riuers of Paradise, and the Waters that <hi>Flowed from the Rocke, and the Drinke-offerings, and the striking the blood of the Lambe vpon the doore-postes,</hi> represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mysticall effusion, and drinking of Christs blood in the Sacrament. There was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21367:95"/>
no drinking of the Tree of life; but there was drinking of the Riuers of Paradise: there was no drinking of Manna, or of the Shew-bread; but there was drinking of the Waters that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out of the Rocke at Horeb. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth of the Hebrewes, 1. Cor. 10. vers. 2, 3. that <hi>they were all baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea; and as they did all eate the same spirituall meat, so they did all drinke the same spirituall drinke. For they dranke all of that spirituall Rocke, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> If they will needs haue in one type a perfect image or embleme of the Communion in both kinds, <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp; other ancient Fathers, will direct them to <hi>Melchisedec;</hi> who <hi>brought forth bread &amp; wine not bread only, but bread &amp; wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this argument may be strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted vpon our aduersaries after this manner:</p>
                     <p>The Truth ought to answer the types: but the types of the old Law prefigured the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls communicating in both kinds, as is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ancient Fathers, S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> S. <hi>Austine,</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory.</hi>

                     <p>SECT. 2. <hi>The second reason,</hi> saith <note n="z" place="margin">Bell. de sacr. Euch. lib. 4. c. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine, is drawne from the doctrine and example of Christ. For our Lord in the sixth of</hi> Iohn, <hi>speaking of the fruit of the Eucharist, or Lords Supper, not once, but foure times teacheth one kind to be sufficient to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he that ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It cannot therefore be, that the same Lord should command both kinds to bee taken. Againe, our Lord proues the same by his example; first,</hi> Ioh. <hi>the sixth, where hee multiplied the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21367:96"/>
gaue them any drinke. Moreouer, in the 24 of</hi> Luke, <hi>in the supper with the Disciples at Emaus, hee tooke bread, and blest it, and brake it, and gaue it vnto them: but we reade of no Cup that there he tooke, or blest, nor indeed could: For the story of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell so ioyneth the distribution of the bread with our Lords departure, that it leaueth no place for the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or distributing the Cup.

quoted by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe in his first book of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and fifth Chapter. Christ in the sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> speaketh not at all of the Sacrament, which was not yet instituted, but a yeere after at his last Supper with his Disciples.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the words insisted vpon by <hi>Bellarm.</hi> in particular, Christ himselfe foure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times tells vs, that he meaneth by bread, himselfe, who came downe from heauen. verse 48. <hi>I am that bread of life. 50. this is that bread which commeth downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen.</hi> vers. 51. <hi>I am the liuing bread, which came downe from heauen: if any man eate of this bread, he shall liue for euer.</hi> vers. 58. <hi>This is the bread which came downe from heauen, not as your fathers, which did eat Manna, and are dead.</hi> If then there be any force in the number of foure, we answer; that our Lord, who foure times in this cap. attributeth life to the eating of bread, foure times expoundeth himself, that by bread he meaneth celestiall bread, not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall; for the sacramentall bread com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not from heauen, but is made of the graine of the earth, and many that eate of it, liue not for euer. <hi>Iudas</hi> and many other repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates haue eaten, yea Mise, Rats, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min may, and sometimes haue eaten the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, who yet neuer haue, nor shall taste the <hi>power of the heauenly gift,</hi> much lesse inioy eternall life. These texts therefore are mis-applied by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being mis-applied, proue nothing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21367:97"/>
for his halfe Communion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we say, that Christ hauing spoken of <hi>Manna,</hi> the Israelites bread in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, calleth himselfe <hi>bread,</hi> keeping the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and occasion, which he had begun to speak of: As Ioh. 4. 14. speaking with the woman of Samaria about drawing water, he promiseth her to giue her water to drinke, <hi>of which whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer drinketh, shall thirst no more.</hi> There Christ speaketh of drinking, and mentioneth no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but in the places of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> alleaged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of eating, and not drinking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Metaphore of drinking better fitted the subiect of his speech, which was water there; but eating better relished in the sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where the occasion of his speech was bread; yet as from these words of Ioh. 4. 14. no man may inferre, that drinking alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to saluation without eating; so neither may <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conclude from the sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the places aboue quoted, that eating is sufficient without drinking; as eternall life is ascribed here to eating, so to drinking, Ioh. 4. 14. as also vnto beleeuing, Ioh. 6. 47. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in me, hath euerlasting life.</hi> Beleeuing, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and drinking, are all meanes of eternall life, but not exclusiuely: euen by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whereby <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would prooue eating alone to be sufficient to eternall life; Because eternall life is promised to eating, hee may prooue beleeuing alone to be sufficient to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, without partaking the Sacrament at all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21367:97"/>
by eating or drinking; because eternall life is promised vnto beleeuing. Eternall life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to beleeuing, as blessednes is in the fifth of <hi>Matthew</hi> to pouertie, and to meekenesse, and to puritie in heart, and to godly sorrow, and to hungring and thirsting for righteousnesse, and to peace making, and to patience: Not that each of these vertues are sufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues alone to saluation, or to make a man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but that they are speciall meanes to make men happy, and altogether with faith make a man most blessed.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, this argument of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may bee retorted against him thus: Our Sauiour here speakes of such eating, whereby eternall life may be attained: But eternall life cannot be attained by eating exclusiuely, that is, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without drinking, as Christ in this very Chapter three seuerall times teacheth vs, vers. 53. <hi>Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you.</hi> And vers. 54. and 56. <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Therefore Christ in the places alleaged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaketh not of eating exclusiuely; but of such eating as is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with drinking. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if these Texts are meant of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they proue, that we ought to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in both kinds.</p>
                        <p>To the second place alleaged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> out of Ioh. 6. 11. we say:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:21367:98"/>
First, that there are three sorts of signes; signes of Gods wrath, and such are prodigious euents: signes of his power, and such are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: lastly, signes of his grace, and such are Sacraments? The multiplying of the loaues in the place alleaged, is to bee ranked amongst the second sort of signes, and not the last. It was a miraculous signe, not a mysticall signe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if it be granted, that this action of Christs was mysticall, and prefigured some thing besides the corporall refection of the people, yet questionlesse it had no reference to the bread in the Lords Supper. For that, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, represents vnto vs, that we <hi>are all one bread, and one body; because we partake of one bread:</hi> whereof the multiplication of the loaues in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> could bee no type, but rather on the contrary. Moreouer, in that place of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> there is mention of fishes multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which can haue no affinitie with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lords Supper. And this, if <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> had well considered, it would haue made him as mute as a fish in this argument.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the edge of this argument may bee retorted vpon our aduersaries thus:</p>
                        <p>The multiplying of the loaues, Ioh. 6. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out multiplying the wine, doth no more prooue, that wee may communicate in bread alone, then the multiplying, or miraculous supplying of wine without the like supplying of bread, Ioh. 2. in Cana of Galily, prooueth, <note place="margin">Vid. 170.</note> that wee may communicate in wine onely:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21367:98"/>
But the multiplying or miraculous supplying of wine, by turning water into it, without any miraculous supplie of bread, prooueth not, that we may Communicate in wine, or in the blood of Christ onely; (for such an halfe Communion the Church of Rome condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.)</p>
                        <p>Therefore the multiplying of the loaues in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh nothing for the popish halfe-Communion in bread onely.</p>
                        <p>SECT. 3. To the third place out of the 24. of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> the 30. and 31. verses:</p>
                        <p>We say; first, that the bread, which Christ there brake was common bread, and not the Sacrament, as may be prooued, both by the circumstances of the text, and the confession of our Aduersaries. In the Text wee finde no words of consecration of the Bread, or the Cup, no command to reiterate that action of Christ. The place was a common Inne, the Disciples came thither to receiue common foode, and to lodge there that night, they met not together for the Sacrament, nor reade we of any prayers before, or preparation meete for receiuing of so holy and heauenly a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; and therefore some Papists doubt of it, as <hi>Iansenius:</hi> whether the Bread here was Transubstantiated, or no. <note n="d" place="margin">Ians. concor.

body, that is of the Church, the vnity of which Church the Apostle commendeth in the Sacrament of bread, saying, We being many, are one bread, and one body.</hi>

                           <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> conceiue, that our Sauiour manifested himselfe in the breaking of bread, to commend hospitality, whereby, as the Saints of the old Testament, that vnawares entertained Angels, so the Disciples here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained our Lord. <hi>They layd the table,</hi> saith S. <hi>Gregory, and set forth bread and wine; and God, whom they knew not in the expounding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they knew in the breaking of the bread.</hi> Which obseruation <hi>Bede</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> seeme to haue borrowed from Saint <note n="p" place="margin">Euangelicarum quaestionum, lib. 2. cap. 51.</note> 
                           <hi>Austine,</hi> where the like words are found with this introduction, <hi>quia hospitalitatem sectati sunt, &amp;c. because they were giuen to hospitality, they knew him in breaking of bread, whom they knew not in expounding the Scriptures.</hi>

His plaine meaning is this, that as the Disciples at Emaus knew Christ corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in breaking of bread, so wee in breaking bread in the Sacrament know him spiritually. <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> hath a different conceit from all these: he will haue the knowledge of Christ, by breaking corporall bread at Emaus,

                           <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is neuer so well knowne, as by breaking of bread; this bread is spirituall, and not carnall; Christ hath broken bread vnto vs, hee hath expounded the Scriptures, and opened the meaning thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, wee answer, that extraordinary actions are not to be taken for presidents: that Christ here after breaking the bread, did not likewise take the cup, was, because (as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries collect) immediately vpon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bread, <hi>he vanished out of sight;</hi> which case is extraordinary; like as if when a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had consecrated, and participated of the bread, he should presently die, or bee caught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Spirit (as <hi>Philip</hi> was) before he had taken the cup. Now that which falleth out by accident, and vpon an extraordinary occasion, is not to be drawne into a common rule: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it is a bare example, without any precept annexed vnto it. Christ at his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when he had broken the bread, and taken the Cup, he added a Command; <hi>Doe this.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that this Command is of force <hi>vntill his second comming.</hi> That example therefore, which hath a command added vnto it, ought to bee followed; not that in Emaus, which was extraordinary, and without any precept at all.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, although there be no mention made of the Disciples drinking: yet no doubt they did drinke, as well as eate before they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21367:102"/>
rose. For who could imagine, that two trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, at that time of the yeere, in a Countrey so hot as Iudea, taking an Inne of purpose for their repast, should call for dry bread without any drinke? <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> and all those, who from hence commend hospitality, must needs be vnderstood by breaking of bread, to commend courteous entertaining of strangers at their table, which is not without refreshing them with drinke, as well as bread.

                           <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> vpon whose iudgement our aduersaries seeme most to relie, in the exposition of this Text, intimateth, that the Disciples at Emaus then did, and that the faithfull ought in the Sacrament, drinke, as well as eate; <hi>The Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> saith hee, <hi>knew him not, but in breaking of bread: and verily he that eateth not, and drinketh not damnation to himselfe, taketh knowledge of Christ in breaking of bread.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the point of this argument may bee turned vpon our aduersaries, and it woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them deepely both in their doctrine of the sacrifice of the Masse, and their Priests communicating. For they teach, that a Priest may not consecrate, or communicate in one kind onely, which was here done (if this place be to be vnderstood of the Sacrament, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Glosse.) This Text therefore, which they conceiue to make most for them, maketh most against them, and may be doubly retorted vpon them. First, thus: Without consecration of the Cup, there can be no sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21367:102"/>
or true sacrament: At Emaus there was no consecration of the Cup; For, as our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries teach, after Christ had broke the bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tooke the Cup, he vanished out of their sight: Therefore at Emaus there was no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ his blood offered, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this time administred. Here is then no ground at all for communicating in bread onely. Secondly, it may be thus retorted; <note n="r" place="margin">Suar. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </p>
                        <p>The third reason, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is drawne from the doctrine, and practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. For in the second of the Acts, vers. 42. the communication of the Eucharist is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed: <note n="t" place="margin">Bell. lib. 4. de sacr. Euchar. cap. 24.</note> 
                           <hi>And they continued stedfastly in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayer. In which place it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is

meant: as well because breaking of bread is ioyned with doctrine and prayer, as also, because it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a discommendation, then a praise of the faithfull, to say, that they continued steadfastly in dining and supping. Lastly,</hi> Luther <hi>in his Sermon of the Lords Supper, and</hi> Caluin <hi>in his fourth book of Institutions, chap. 17. acknowledgeth, that this place is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

                        <p>If the Romish halfe Communion be so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and apparant in these places, alleaged out of the Acts, I wonder the Fathers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Constance, Basil, and Trent saw no such thing in them. As for the ancient Doctors in the Primitiue Church, some of them expound these places of common bread, some of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, none of the Communion in one kind. In the 20. of the Acts, it is not certaine, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> speakes of the Sacrament; and in the 27. of the Acts, it is certaine he speakes not

                        <p>First, that there is no necessity at all enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vs to vnderstand by breaking of bread in either verse, the celebration of the Sacrament. The words of themselues are indifferent to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these three expositions; <hi>They continued in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship,</hi> and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their bread one to another, as each had need.

                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, if we should grant, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> by breaking of bread, vnderstood the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper, yet our aduersaries would gaine nothing by it. For it is certaine, that in the Hebrew phrase, to breake bread, signifieth to make a meale, to dine, or sup with a man: which, I trow, is not without drinke, as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21367:104"/>
well as meat. <hi>Is not this, saith</hi> Esay, <hi>the fast, that I haue chosen?</hi> And chap. 58. vers. 6. 7. <hi>Is it not to deale thy bread to the hungery, and that thou bring the poore, that are cast out, to thy house, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel. cap. 18. 7.

Therefore howsoeuer the cup, or drinking be not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this place of the Acts, yet it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be vnderstood by a vsuall Synechdoche in holy Scriptures. To the second place out of Acts the 20. 7. We answere as to the former Acts 2. that the disciples meeting <hi>to break bread,</hi> was either to keepe a feast of Charitie, which they called then <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>To the third obiection out of Acts 27. 35.

                        <p>Lastly, this third &amp; last argument of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries out of the scriptures, drawn from the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Disciples, and Apostles in the Acts, may be forcibly retorted vpon them.

were Priests, and Ministers of the Sacrament: in whom, as wee learned before out of the Glosse of the Canon law, and Cardinal <hi>Caietan,</hi> it had beene sacrilege to communicate in one kind onely. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saw this retortion in <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> and seekes to auoyde it by telling vs that in the second of the Acts, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the faithful peoples continuance in praier, and receiuing the sacrament, and not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles communicating, which he yeelded was in both kinds.

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they are caught on both sides by this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</hi> Either breaking of bread in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not celebrating the sacrament, or if it be, their is a synechdoche in the words, whereby one part is put for the whole.

                        <p>No priests may consecrate, or communicate in one kind onely:</p>

Whereunto in generall we answer, first, that either these Councels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue not the halfe Communion, or they are not approued themselues. The Councell of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus is an approued Councell, but it appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the halfe Communion; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Constance and Basil approue the halfe Communion; but they are not themselues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, no not by the Romane Church, much lesse by the Catholicke Christian Church.</p>

                     <p>In particular, we answer to the allegations made by <hi>Hosius, Harding,</hi> and other Papists out of the Councell of Ephesus; that they tooke it vpon trust of some ancient Schoole-man or Canonist, who thought it a matter of merit, to forge an ancient record for the good of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques cause, and defence of the Romane Church. For neither in the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Ephesus, nor in any approued history is there any footstep, or print of any such consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as is pretended by our aduersaries to be made, for the halfe Communion, and that vpon this occasion; <note n="h" place="margin">Caietan. in 3. part.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21367:107"/>
at least of truth, which here is wanting. For neither did the Nestorians maintaine any such error touching the sacrament, as neither had the Councell of Ephesus any reason thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to haue prohibited the vse of the Cup to the Laiety. For what a consequence is this? The heretikes denyed any blood to bee in the body of Christ in the Sacrament; Therefore Catholikes and right beleeuers of the Laietie ought to be depriued of the vse of the holy Cup in the Sacrament. To coyne new Fathers is a vsuall practise, and therefore of no transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding merit: but to coyne new Canons of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels, and to forge records of such antiquitie (as is the true Councell of Ephesus) can be no lesse then a worke of superarrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To the allegation out of the Councell of Constance, we answer: first, that it was no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell. The Easterne Church of as large, or larger extent, then the Westerne, sent no Patriarch, or Bishop thither.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this Councell is impeached by the Romane Church it selfe. <hi>Bellarmine de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. cap.</hi> 7. <hi rend="sup">k</hi> speaking of this Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) saith, <hi>this Councel, so much as concerneth the</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> is yet hotter against this Councell, saying, that it decreed against the order of nature, against manifest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, against the authoritie of all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and against the Catholicke faith of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21367:107"/>
Church. What credit is then to be giuen to this erroneous, and perfidious Councell? Which both adulterated the Christian faith by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical decisions, and brake their morrall faith by bloody crueltie, exercised against <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of Prague, to whom safe conduct to the Councell, and backe againe was promised. If the Romanists themselues reiect this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in point of the Popes Supremacie, why may not we in point of the Sacrament?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, out of this very Councell wee may draw an inuincible argument against the halfe Communion.</p>
                     <p>The institution of Christ and practise of the Primitiue Church ought to sway more with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good Christian, then any constitution of a late Councell, neuer generally approued of by the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>But the Communion in both kinds hath the institution of Christ, and the practise of the Primitiue Church for it, as is confessed by the Fathers in this Councell:</p>
                     <p>Therefore euery good Christian ought to communicate in both kinds, the prohibition of the Councell of Constance to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
                     <p>To the allegation out of the Councell of Basil, our answer is the stronger, by how much the authoritie of this Councell is weaker, or rather of no validitie at all.</p>
                     <p>First, there lyeth against it the same excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we tooke before against the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21367:108"/>
of Constance; that none of the Bishops of the Easterne Churches were present at it, and in this regard it cannot bee held for an Occo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall, or generall Councell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, while the Fathers of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell sate at Basil, the Pope fearing least some thing might be done to his preiudice, called an other Councell at Ferrara: and <hi rend="sup">•</hi> in this regard the Councell of Basil cannot be esteemed a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or totall Councell, no not so much as of the Westerne, or Romane Church.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Acts of this Councell are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the Councell of Florence, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran. <hi>Pighius</hi> writes as bitterly against it, as against the Councell of Constance; and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <note n="k" place="margin">Huius Concilij nihil est ratum &amp; probatum, nisi quaedam dispositiones circa beneficia. Cor. cil. verò ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum reprobatur in Concil. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. sess. 11. <hi rend="sup">l</hi> Vasq. in 3. part. Thom. quest. 80. art. 12. disp. 215 cap. 3.

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writing of it, saith, <hi>There is nothing of this Councell ratified and allowed, but certaine orders, about benefices: the Councell it selfe is reiected, and condemned in the Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, Sess.</hi> 11. No maruell then, if Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants account the decrees of this Synode, no better then drosse, when by the Roman test it selfe, they are proued to bee no good mettell. Wherefore as the Romane Oratour makes a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> touching <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Antonie,</hi> being in Armes one against the other; <hi>if</hi> Brutus <hi>bee a preseruer of his country,</hi> Antonie <hi>is an enemie; if</hi> Antony <hi>be a Consul,</hi> Brutus <hi>is an enemie:</hi> so may we say of those two Councels of Basil and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran; if the Councell of Basil bee Catholick, Lateran is hereticall; if Lateran be Catholick, the Councell of Basil is hereticall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:21367:108"/>
Lastly, be this Councell of Basil, of what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie it may be, the Romanists loose more by it, then they gaine. For though the halfe Communion were after a sort established in this Councell, yet the Bohemians petition for the intire Communion was yeelded vnto, and signed in this Councell; whence we thus argue against them.</p>
                     <p>If the Papists arguments drawne from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of irreuerence, inconueniences, examples, or testimonies of antiquity, and pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of Scripture were necessary and concludent, the Councell of Basil could not lawfully grant to the Bohemians, and Moraui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the vse of the Cup: but the Councell of Basil might lawfully, and did yeeld to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians, and the Morauians the vse of the cup: Therfore the reasons of the Romanists drawn to the contrary from the heads aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are not necessarie, or concludent.</p>

                           <p>First, although wee grant, that the antient <note place="margin">Answ.

They had no reason, nor neede so to do, because, as Saint <note n="n" place="margin">Omni hebdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada offeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est, si non quotidie perigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, incolis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men velbis in bebdomada.</note>

If the Cardinall fly to a miracle, I answer, that by the same miracle, whereby the bread was kept a whole yeere from moulding, the wine was, or might haue beene kept from sowring.</p>

but may easily breake one another, and bubbles in the water, deface one another; so false holds and errors may destroy one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they can in no wise establish one the other. The administring the Communion to Infants is an abuse, if not a prophanation of the holy Sacrament. How then can it iustifie the Romish halfe Communion, sith it selfe is vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable?

                           <p>Wee acknowledge, that there is often mention made in the Ancients of the Lay <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> Communion. For <hi>Cyprian</hi> speakes of it in his 52. epistle, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his sixth booke of Ecclesiasticall storie. <hi>Inocentius</hi> the first, in his 22. epistle.

But wee denie, that this Laick Communion was the Papists halfe Communion. The meaning of the antient in their decrees touching the permitting of Cleargymen to participate of the Laick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or communicate as Laicks, was this; that in regard that these Priests had sometime or other scandalized their calling, they should be degraded, &amp; neuer admitted to consecrate, or administer the Sacrament, but receiue it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the hands of the Priests meere Lay men; not in the <note n="e" place="margin">Concil.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21367:116"/>
the Church among the common people. This argument therefore of the Papists is a maine <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> or begging the point in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to wit, that the Laick Communion, or Communion of Laicks, was in one kind onely. The contrary whereof hath beene proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the testimonies of all Ages. This headlesse arrow therefore of our aduersaries may be thus headed, and shot back vpon them by Retortion.</p>
                           <p>If the Laick Communion spoken of by the Antients, were in both kinds, then nothing can be gathered from it against, but for the entire Communion:</p>
                           <p>But the Laick Communion spoken of by the Antients was in both kinds:</p>
                           <p>Therefore nothing can be gathered from it against, but for the entire Communion.</p>
                           <p>That the Laick Communion was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cup, Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who first named it, clearely sheweth in those words: <hi>in calice san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificando, &amp; plebi ministrando:</hi> in sanctifying the Cup, and ministring it to the people. Nay, which is very remarkeable, Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himselfe in this very argument, (to verifie the obseruation of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> that euident truth striketh into the eyes of such, as are shut against it) acknowlegeth as much: <hi>The</hi>

                           <head>The answer.</head>
                           <p>This argument hath two parts, the, first is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the custome of the Greeke Church, <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> the latter from a custome of the Romane. To dispatch first the latter, because it is of smal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we say, that there is no ground for this custome: we dislike it no lesse, then the halfe Communion it selfe. For why should not the Sacrament be consecrated vpon good Friday, as well as any other day? Or what an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this; the Priest communicateth in one kind alone on good Friday, therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to be depriued of the Cup all the yeere long? And why, I pray you, doth the Priest receiue the Sacrament on Good-Friday in bread onely, more then any other day? And why doe they communicate in such bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as was consecrated the day before? Why might they not consecrate it on that day? As some Gramarians excuse all <hi>Homers</hi> fables of the Gods, by turning them into Allegories, and Mythologicall expositions. So <hi>Harding</hi> diuision 22. arti. 2. salueth this superstitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, by telling vs, that it was not without sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of a singular mysterie. This mysterie is reuealed vnto vs by Pope <hi>Innocentius, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and <hi>Hugo Cardinalis. Innocentius</hi> saith, that it is, because the Apostles ran their way that day, and hid themselues. <hi>Aq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>
                                 </gap>inas</hi> saith, they conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate not on Good-Friday, because if any had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21367:117"/>
consecrated that day, whilst Christ lay dead, the body had beene without blood, and the blood without the body. And others say, if the Sacrament that meane while had been kept, it would haue been dead in the Pixe. <hi>Hugo Card.</hi> saith, Christs Passion is the truth, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a figure of the same. Therfore when the truth is come, the figure giueth place. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider we the weight of these reasons: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles fled sixteene hundred yeeres agoe on Good-Friday; therefore we must not now on that day consecrate the elements, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in both kinds. On Good-Friday Christ suffered, his blood then was seuered from the body: Therefore now wee must not receiue his body and blood on that day. Christs Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was on that day; therefore wee must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiue the figure thereof on that day.</p>

the body and blood of Christ, &amp;c. Since his ascention, his body now in heauen is a liue bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and therfore hath his blood in his veines, and is informed, and glorified by a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent soule: Therfore Christ <hi>cannot say truly, that a body voyd of blood, sence, and soule, is his body, but soule, life, and blood, must needs follow and concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his body, wheresoeuer it bee.</hi> Therefore when the Priest in the person of Christ, or rather Christ by the mouth of the Priest, saith, <hi>This is my body,</hi> the meaning must bee, a liuing body with blood in the veines.</p>

                           <head>The answer.</head>
                           <p>First, the doctrine of naturall Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, presupposeth the naturall body of Christ to bee substantially, and carnally, vnder the <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> forme of bread: which we deny; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this argument, from concomitancie, is of no force. The words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> being rightly expounded by <hi>Austine, Tertullian, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi> and many other of the ancients to be no other, then, this bread is a signe, a figure, or a sacrament of my body, not this bread is turned substantially into my body, or vnder this is contained my very body, flesh &amp; bones. Where Christs naturall humane body is, there wee grant his blood, and soule, and diuinitie are. But, That his body, is now in heauen, Acts 3. not in any place vpon the earth; much lesse in euery place, where the Masse is celebrated.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, although we grant, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21367:120"/>
of Christ cannot really bee seuered from his blood, yet the signes of his body, and blood are really seuered: if wee speake of sacramentall Communion, the Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, <hi>that the bread, which wee break, is the Communion of Christs body, and the Cup, which wee blesse, is the Communion of his blood: neither can wee truly and properly, say, the Bread is the Communion of his blood.</hi>

                           <p>Whosoeuer receiueth Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to receiue whole Christ, to wit, his body, and blood:</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21367:121"/>
of the soule, and the representation of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faithful with Christ, and among themselues.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <div type="subsection">
                           <head>The answer.</head>
                           <p>First, there is a double essence of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> the generall essence, which makes it a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in generall, and the specificall essence, which makes it in speciall, Baptisme, or the Lords Supper. To bee a visible, and effectuall signe of inuisible sanctifying grace is sufficient to proue a sacrament in generall: but not to proue the Lords Supper; the entire definition whereof is, a <hi>Sacrament of the new Testament, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto vs the perfect nourishment of our soules, by the participation of the sacred elements of bread and wine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, there are two sorts, or parts essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, <note place="margin">2</note> or integrall. For example; the essentiall parts of a man are <hi>animal rationale;</hi> the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall parts are legges and armes, and other members. In like manner, in the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the essentiall parts, which <note n="p" place="margin">Bel. loco supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citat species panis &amp; vini non tam essentiales, quam integrales par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes huiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will haue to bee the signe and the thing signified, there are integrall parts, to wit, the elements of bread and wine, of which if either be wanting, the sacrament may be as truly called a maimed or vnperfect Sacrament, as a man that wants an arme, or legge, is truly called a maimed, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect man, though he haue in him the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of a man intirely, to wit, <hi>animal</hi> his Genus, and <hi>rationale,</hi> his difference.</p>

Thirdly, although in the Romane halfe Communion there be a signe, and a thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; yet neither is there the whole signe, nor the whole signification; not the whole signe, because bread is but a part of the signe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Christs body, and not his blood; not the whole signification, which is such an entire refection and nourishment of the soule, as bread and wine are of the body.</p>

                           <p>Lastly, this Argument, as the former, may be retorted vpon the aduersary.</p>
                           <p>The Lords Supper is the Sacrament of Christs body and blood:</p>
                           <p>The bread is not the Sacrament of Christs body and blood;</p>
                           <p>Therefore bread alone is not the Lords Supper.</p>
                           <p>Or in this wise:</p>
                           <p>The Lords Supper essentially includeth and signifieth such a perfect refection, and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soule, as bread and wine are of the body:</p>
                           <p>Communicating in one kind neither inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, nor signifieth such refection:</p>
                           <p>Therefore communicating in one kind is not the Lords Supper, nor containeth in it the whole nature, and essence of this Sacrament.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The third Argument of our aduersaries, drawne from reason, is an off-spring of the two former.</p>
                        <p>If the faithfull receiue as much benefit by communicating in one kind, as in both, they haue no cause to complaine of the Church, for the restraining of them from the Cup:</p>
                        <p>But the faithfull receiue as much benefit by communicating in one kind, as in both:</p>
                        <p>Therefore they haue no cause to complaine of the Church, for the restraining of them from the Cup,</p>
                        <p>That they receiue as much benefit by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in one kind, as in both, it seemes to follow necessarily vpon the two former sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posalls; that whole Christ is in each kind, and that the whole essence of the Sacrament is found in either.</p>
                        <div type="subsection">
                           <head>The answer.</head>
                           <p>First, the two props of this Argument being <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> before taken away, it must needes fall to the ground: neither is whole Christ contained vnder one kind, neither in it is preserued the whole essence of the Sacrament. Therefore questionlesse the fruit of the halfe Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be any at all, cannot bee equall to the fruit of the whole.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="206" facs="tcp:21367:123"/>
Secondly, the consequence of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not found: For neither the onely, nor the principle thing to be regarded in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is our benefit, but Gods glorie, and the testification of our obedience to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. Therefore, albeit it were granted, that the people lost nothing by the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Cup from them, yet they haue iust cause to complaine of the Church of Rome, for the violation of Christs Institution, and hindring them from discharging their whole duety in communicating in both kinds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his commandement.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, vnworthy Receiuers receiue no benefit at all by the Communion, but eate and drinke their owne damnation. <note n="q" place="margin">Ambr. in 1. ad Corinth. cap. 11. Indignus est Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino, qui aliter mysterium cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat, quàm ab eo traditum est.</note> And Saint <hi>Ambrose pronounceth him to be an vnworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, who celebrates these mysteries otherwayes, then the Lord hath appointed:</hi> Therefore they amongst the Papists, who consent to this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Christs Institution, and mutilation of the Sacrament, may expect no benefit at all by this their sacrilegious practice; much lesse may they looke to share equally with them, who communicate entirely, according to Christs commandement.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <note n="r" place="margin">Halensis part. 3. qu. 11. mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro. artic. 4. sumptio sub v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traque specie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris est effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae, &amp; comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21367:123"/>
as both together. Therefore this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as all the former, may be retorted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aduersarie.</p>
                           <p>The efficacie of Sacraments is answerable to their significancie: for they effect that, which they signifie, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>But the significancie of one Element is not equall to the significancie of both.</p>
                           <p>Therefore the efficacie of one Element, is not equall to the efficacie of both. Which conclusion is assented vnto both by <hi>Halensis,</hi> and <hi>Vasquez, Gasper Consaluus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> the sixth.</p>

                        <p>Therefore it ought not to be administred in both kinds.</p>

                           <head>The answer.</head>
                           <p>First, this Argument toucheth not the point in question: for wee finde no fault with the Church of Rome, for her indulgence in this kinde, but for her sacrilege; not for her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing with them, that cannot receiue in both kinds, but for prohibiting them that can, and desire it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Lawes, as <note n="r" place="margin">De leg. &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. consult.</note> 
                              <hi>Pomponius</hi> obserueth, <hi>Prouide for those things, that happen commonly, or for the most part, and not for such things as happen to few, or seldome.</hi> A man can scarce finde one in a Kingdome, that hath such an Antipathy to Wine, that he cannot indure so small a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of some kinde of Wine, as may suffice for the Communion.

And is it any way reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, out of respect to so few, to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law for the restraint of the Cup from the Laietie? Is there any reason, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilitie of so few, should preiudice the right of all the rest of Gods people? Some Priests haue at some times so weake stomackes, that they cannot taste wine, and some both of the Laietie and Cleargie, through infirmitie of stomacke, or drought in the throat in hot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, cannot swallow downe the bread; will they therefore make a generall law to take away the Cup from the Priests, or the bread from both?</p>

Thirdly, for Nazarites, if there be any in the Church, they are to bee taught, that there E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall liberty releaseth them of the strict rigour of their legall vow, and that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours command, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant for them to drinke of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall wine at the Lords Table, though they drinke no wine else where. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother of our Lord, though as Saint <note n="t" place="margin">Hier. in Catal. Viror. illust.</note> 
                              <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth of him, he kept strictly the Nazarites vowe in abstaining from wine, and strong drinke at other times; yet he was amongst the twelue at Christs last Supper. And Saint <hi>Marke</hi> testifieth that all dranke of the Cup; and for such, whose stomacks cannot away with the smalest quantitie of wine, it may be sufficient for them to take the Cup into their hands, and shew their desire; or they may haue a Cup by themselues of wine so allayed with water, as their stomackes may brooke; as the fathers in the Counsell of Towers ordered to giue to sicke folke bread sopt in wine, because they were not able to take downe dry bread.</p>

                        <p>The first and last Argument, which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries draw from reason, may be thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</p>
                        <p>The Sacrament ought to be so administred,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21367:125"/>
that all inconueniences in the celebration thereof may be preuented.</p>
                        <p>But many inconueniences cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, vnlesse the Cup be with-held from the Laietie:</p>
                        <p>Therefore in the administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Cup ought to be with-held from the Laietie.</p>
                        <p>The inconueniences, which they pretend to arise from the publicke vse of the Chalice, are summed vp by <hi>M. Harding, art. 2. diuis. 8. viz.</hi> irreuerence of so high a Sacrament, whereof Christian people in the beginning had a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous care and regard; the loathsomenesse of many, that cannot brooke the taste of wine; the difficulties of getting wine in countries neere situated to the North pole; and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of keeping it long.</p>
                        <div type="subsection">
                           <head>The answer.</head>
                           <p>First, inconueniences in a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, may be pondered and put in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> scale against the commodities in the thing in question; and if the inconueniences be such, as cannot be preuented, and they are greater, and more in number, then the profits, or aduantages that are like to grow vpon the vse of it, in this case wisedome aduiseth to take away a thing, that is not necessary: I say, if the vn-auoydable inconueniences exceede the certaine profits thereby. But in religious
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21367:125"/>
duties, which cannot be omitted, without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Gods Law, and Christs Ordinance, inconueniences must not turne the ballance: onely we must take all the care that may be, to preuent such inconueniences: Which though they be neuer so many, yet are they rather to beindured, then Gods absolute Command dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, or Christs Institution corrupted.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Christ and his Apostles, and the Christian Churches throughout all the world, <note place="margin">2</note> for twelue hundred yeeres, foresaw the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences which our aduersaries now pretend: yet they thought it not fit in regard of them, to violate Christs Institution by restraining the Cup to the Cleargie onely: For they, as wee haue proued by abundant testimonies, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ordinarily gaue the Cup to the Laietie, as well as the Bread.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if they would from these wants and impediments inferre, that some fauourable <note place="margin">3</note> course should be taken, and dispensation gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to such, as cannot taste wine, or liue in such countries where wine cannot be got: we would not much striue with them. Wee censure not the Priests in Russia, who for want of wine, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consecrate in Methegling, nor call <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the eigth into question, howsoeuer now many Papists condemne him for it, for dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the Priests in Norway to consecrate without wine. That which in this question we charge the Church of Rome with, is a manifest transgression of Christs Ordinance, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21367:126"/>
prohibition of giuing the Cup to the Laietie, where wine may be had, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants are able and willing to drinke, if the Priests will admit them. As some Lay men cannot brook wine, so at some times the Priests through some disease after drinking of the Cup, may be enforced to cast it vp. And as the peoples hands may shake in taking of the Cup, and so spill a drop: so may the Priests also: And as some Countries haue no wine, so, if we may beleeue <hi>Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Arianus,</hi> and many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Geographers also, some Countries haue no bread. Yet the Church of Rome her selfe neuer thought it fit, in regard of such few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and rare accidents, to make a generall law, either to depriue the Priests of the vse of the Cup, or the Laietie of the vse of the bread.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, for the matter of irreuerence, if any through carelesnesse or contempt, spill a <note place="margin">4</note> drop of the consecrated wine, or let fall a crum of bread, he ought to bee punished for it. And if hee amend not his fault, to bee denyed the Communion. But if such a thing fall out through infirmitie, or by some casualtie against a mans will, it is no irreuerence at all. And for the difficulty of getting wine in the Northerne parts, especially where Vines grow not, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that wine is easier to be gotten, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, which the Romish Church vseth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. For Vines grow in many Countries, and that in great aboundance: True Balsamum but in one. Yet the Church of Rome, in regard
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21367:126"/>
of this difficulty in getting it, will by no meanes suffer, that their Sacrament to be administred without it. Yet their Chrisme is a meere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuention, but wine in the Lords Supper is Christs ordniance. But what do they pretend impediments, that are not, and surmise diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties against common experience? He is but a stranger in Geography, who knoweth not, that by the benefit of Nauigation, store of wines are brought into those parts, where no vines grow. In the reformed Churches in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Denmarke, Norway, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regions situated neerer the North-Pole, the Sacrament is administred in both kindes, and neuer yet any complaint was heard of the difficulty, much lesse of the impossibility of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding wine for the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Surely if there may be had wine for the Priest, their may be had also for the people. Who euer heard of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that transported wine in so smal qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity, that there might be a draught for the Priest, and none for the people? If there be none for the Priests, how can they consecrate without facri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, according to their owne Canon?</p>
                           <p>Lastly, this argument, as all the former, may be thus retorted vpon them.</p>
                           <p>The Councell of Basil yeelded the vse of the Cup to the Bohemians; and the whole Councell of Trent reserued it to the Pope to grant the vse of the Cup to all the Germanes; and the Pope assented thereunto vpon certaine conditions, notwithstanding all the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21367:127"/>
Therefore it is not inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency they stand vpon. But the true cause why they at this day with hold the Cup, is either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, lest they should seeme to yeeld any thing to the Reformed Churches, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their former error, or pride to maintaine a prerogatiue of their Priests aboue the people. Which, as I shewed before out of Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> ought to be none in <hi>partaking the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mysteries.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To conclude, howsoeuer they pretend in this their erroneous practise, like <hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
                              <hi>Aesop,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue that stone, at which all that came into the Bath, stumbled at; yet in truth they rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble <hi>Aesop</hi> in some thing of another nature. For as he was accused to haue stolne away a piece of holy plate, that was found among his carriages, from the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at Delphi; so these grand <hi>Aesops,</hi> and Coyners of Fables, whereby they delude the simple people, are clearely conuinced of sacrilege, in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Chalice from the Lords Supper. For they haue taken away the <hi>Cup of blessing</hi> from the people, and in stead thereof, offer the Whore of Babylons cup of abomination.</p>

All the Ancients, both Greeke and Latine, seeme to be of opinion, that in the lawfull and solemne celebration of the Sacrament of Christs body and blood, and administring it to the people, that both kinds, to wit, bread and wine ought to be vsed at the Lords Table. And it appeares both out of the workes of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, and the old Rites, and formes of the diuine mysteries, that this custome was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in all the Easterne, and Westerne Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And a little after: <hi>Hereunto they were induced by the Example and Command of Christ, who in the institution of this Sacrament, speaking to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, then representing the persons of all faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, said, Take and eate: and presently after said to the selfe-same, Drinke ye all of this:</hi> which <hi>Radbertus</hi> according to the mind of the Ancients expoundeth, <hi>as well Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, as other belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</hi>

of publike Churches bee taken away from the faithfull, or they be not permitted to resort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as in time of persecution it hath been, and in some places is at this day: the Pastors, and their flocks may meete <hi>in Cryptis,</hi> that is in priuate, and secret places; as they did in the Primitiue Church.

A Bishop hath an eminencie of degree in the same order, but his ecclesiasticall order is essentially the same with the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Priests. But what doth this question concerne any here present? Neither wee, nor, for ought I know, the Papists themselues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to be a matter of faith, necessary to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to resolue this way, or that way.

                     <p>After this passage, some speech hauing been cast in by some of the table, concerning diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in point of Religion among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of England; D. <hi>Featly</hi> said, it was to bee considered, that the differences amongst the true members of the Church of England were only in point of Discipline and Ceremony, not in point of Doctrine, or matter of Faith. But the Romanists differed one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another in point of Doctrine, and matter of Faith; for the present, saith he, I will instance in two remarkeable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. First, touching the conception of the blessed Virgin; secondly, touching the Popes supreame authority euen ouer Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells. In the first point, the Iacobins, or domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants maintaine, that the blessed Virgin was conceiued in Originall sinne: the Iesuites Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans, and Sorbonists hold the contrary.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <speaker>D. Featly.</speaker>
                     <p>They may both keepe a Feast vpon the same
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21367:142"/>
day, and that for the Conception of our Lady. But certainely they, who beleeue she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in sin, cannot without hipocrisie keepe a Feast of the <hi>immaculate Conception.</hi> Touching the second point, the Sorbonists haue euer held, and doe hold to this day, that a Generall Councell is aboue the Pope: but the Iacobins, Iesuits, &amp; all orders of Friers generally, besides many Secular Priests hold the contrary, that the Pope is aboue a Generall Councell. When I liued in Paris in the Ambassadors house, I heard of a generall <hi>Chapter,</hi> as they called it, held by the Iacobins in <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> Schoole. Where for many dayes together diuers diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity questions were handled, and among other, this question touching the Popes superioritie to Councels. An acute Serbone Doctor there present, thus impugned the Iacobins assertion.</p>
                     <p>Whatsoeuer is defined in a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, confirmed by the Pope, is infallibly true, <hi>&amp; de fide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is defined in a generall Councel, to wit, the Councel of Constance, confirmed by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, that a Generall Councell is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Pope:</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is infallibly true, and <hi>de fide,</hi> that a Generall Councell is aboue the Pope.</p>
                     <p>The Auditors (the greater part of them) very much applauded this argument of the Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, and expressed their applause by a kinde of shout. But the Iacobin respondent in a kinde of scorne answered it by retortion thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:21367:143"/>
Whatsoeuer is defined in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell confirmed by the Pope, is infallibly true, and <hi>de fide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is defined in a Generall Councell, to wit, the Councell of Lateran, confirmed by <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, that the Pope is aboue a Generall Councell.</p>
                     <p>Therfore it is infallibly true, and <hi>de fide,</hi> that the Pope is aboue a Generall Councell.</p>
                     <p>At this Syllogisme, the Iacobin had neere as great an applause, as the Sorbonist. Wee that were present of the Reformed Churches (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the Romanists) receiued very much satisfaction, to heare Papists amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thus bandy Councell and Pope, against Councell and Pope. For from both, we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: that, sith contradictories cannot be both true, and it appeared in matter of Faith, that Generall Councels, confirmed by Popes, had decreed direct contradictories: that therefore Generall Councels confirmed by Popes, might erre, and consequently, that the strongest pillar of a Romanists Faith is weake, and tottering:</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had come home to your assertion, yet it followeth not, but that it is new and erroneous.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the reason Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> vseth, is not found, that because the Latine Church, hath preserued the Faith purer, then the Greeke: therefore the Latine Bibles, kept by them, are freer from corruption, then the Greeke Originall. For it is not true, that the Latine, that is (as he meaneth) the Romane
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21367:146"/>
Church, hath kept the Faith more sincerely, then the Greeke. Beside, the originall Greeke hath not oenly beene kept by the Greeke Church, but also by the Latine Church, which Latine Church, no doubt, had as great, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care to preserue the Originall from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the Latine Translation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth not so much, as you doe. For he speaketh not a word of the Hebrew of the old Testament in this place, but onely of the Greeke of the new. Whereas you preferre the Vulgar Latine not onely before the Greeke of the new, but also the Hebrew of the old. Neither doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> say, that the Vulgar Latine is simply to be preferred before the Greeke of the new, but that the Latines were more carefullin keeping their Latine, then the Greekes in keeping their Greeke. This might be <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Iudgement, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Latine absolutely before the Greek. For albeit the Latine for a Translation were better kept, then the Greeke for the Originall, yet he might say still, that the Translation must needs come behind the Originall simply. <note n="h" place="margin">This <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> must needs say, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

But that we may not digresse from the point proposed vnto vs, touching Communion in both kinds, here I promise you, that in discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this question, I will alleage no text of Scripture, wherein our English Translation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not both with the Originall Greeke, and the Latine vulgar.

                     <p>Secondly, I deny not, that the Laietie may receiue in both kinds, if the Church giue them leaue, but they are not bound by Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, so to receiue. It is sufficient, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in one.</p>

                     <p>I assent vnto this condicion, especially in this point, wherein the continuall practise of the Church is vndoubtedly for vs: as also the cleare and expresse letter of Scripture. And this I prooue, First, by the words of the Institution, Matth. 26. 28. <hi>Drinke yee all of this. For this is the blood of the new Testament, which was shed for many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Christ commandeth the same to drinke, whom he commandeth to eate:</p>
                     <p>But he commandeth the Laiety to eate the bread:</p>
                     <p>Therefore also to drinke of the Cup.</p>
                     <p>And Againe:</p>
                     <p>He commandeth those to drinke, <hi>for whom his blood was shed,</hi> saying, <hi>drinke yee all of this, for this is my blood of the new Testament shed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Christs blood was shed for the people, as well as for the Priests:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the people are to drinke, as well as the Priests.</p>
                     <p>By the words of our Sauiour, Iohn 6. 53. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you.</hi> This Text is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and most Papists, as a strong proofe of the reall presence of Christs body and blood in the Sacrament. And if that you grant, that these words are to be vnderstood of the Sacrament, you must needes confesse, they require all people, as well as Priests, to receiue the Communion in both kinds, to wit, to eate
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21367:147"/>
the flesh of the Sonne of Man vnder the forme of bread, and drinke his blood vnder the forme of wine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1.

                     <p>First, I answer, that these words are meant disiunctiuely thus; Vnlesse yee eate his flesh, <hi>and,</hi> that is, <hi>or</hi> drinke his blood, as in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> except a man be borne of Water and the Spirit, that is of Water, or the Spirit.</p>

                        <hi>And</hi> for <hi>or,</hi> a coniunction for a disiunction, is a forced interpretation. And the place you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage for it, maketh against you. For if our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours words, (except a man be borne of Water and the Spirit) are taken disiunctiuely, then that Text no way inferreth the necessity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of Water, for which it is alleaged by the best diuines, euen of your owne side. If a man may enter into the Kingdome of Heauen, that is, be borne againe either of Water, or of the Spirit, it is sufficient then to be borne againe of Water without the Spirit, or of the Spirit without Water. And consequently, this place so expounded, no way proueth the necessitie of Baptisme of Water; or at least, no more maketh a necessitie of the spirituall, then of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Baptisme.</p>

                     <p>You know well, that wee hold a threefold Baptisme: <hi>fluminis, flaminis, &amp; sanguinis:</hi> and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21367:150"/>
that a man may enter into the Kingdome of Heauen, that hath any of these Baptismes.</p>

                     <speaker>D. Featly.</speaker>
                     <p>I know, that the Baptisme of water is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, and simply necessarie; but it is then onely necessarie, when it may be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglect or contempt of it is damnable: but not the ineuitable defect. Baptisme is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, where it may bee had. But if these words <hi>(except a man be borne of Water, and the Spirit)</hi> may be meant disiunctiuely, that is, <hi>of Water, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> this Text so glossed, proueth not the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of Baptisme, when it may be had. For it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to bee borne of the Spirit without it, by your exposition, which is contrary to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the best learned diuines, ancient, and latter.

                     <p>But the Priests are commanded according to your owne Doctrine, to communicate in both kinds:</p>

Which I thus make euident. Before you said, that the words, eating and drinking were not taken properly, but figuratiuely: now you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they are taken properly, or must so acknowledge. For</p>
                     <p>Where proper eating, and formall is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the words commanding must needs be taken properly:</p>
                     <p>But in these words <hi>(Except you eate)</hi> formall, and proper eating, and not figuratiue, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as you grant:</p>
                     <p>Therefore these words <hi>(except you eate)</hi> are to be taken properly, and not figuratiuely; and consequently the former answer was false, and you now contradict your selfe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, out of your owne answer I inferre; that all Christian people, that liue by Christ, are bound to communicate in both kinds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:21367:153"/>
The formall acts of eating and drinking in the Sacrament (as you grant) are here inioyned to all men:</p>
                     <p>But the formall acts of eating and drinking in the Sacrament, are communicating in both kinds:</p>
                     <p>Therefore the communicating in both kinds is enioyned to all men.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, whatsoeuer is commanded in formall and expresse words, is commanded <hi>formally:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all men that haue life in Christ, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in formall and expresse words, to eate and to drinke in the Sacrament:</p>
                     <p>Therefore they are commanded to eate and to drinke formally. And consequently your former answer hath the formality of an answer, but no truth and realty at all.</p>

Nay, by a Sarcas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he glance that him, and checketh him for making himselfe a Bishop of Bishops, and goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to compel other Bishops to subscribe to his iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Your second answer is controwled by the direct words of Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi> If any besides Christ, to wit, his supposed Vicar the Bishop of Rome, haue powre to place Bishops in the Church, and censure their Synodical Acts; then it is false which Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> heere saith, that <hi>Christus vnus, &amp; solus,</hi> that Christ alone hath this power. The Pope with Christ is not, <hi>Christus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> much lesse; <hi>Christus solus.</hi> But Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>Christus vnus &amp; solus; one and onely Christ</hi> hath this power: therefore not the Pope.</p>

                     <p>In Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> time there were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings, or Emperors; and therefore this exception could not bee taken against the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Martyrs words.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Christian Kings within there owne Dominions grant <hi>Conge de-lires,</hi> to Deanes, and Chapters, and confirme their Elections, and giue Mandates to Metrapolitans to consecrate: but they take not vpon them to bee Bishops of all Bishops through the world, as the Bishop of Rome doth: nor as Bishops or Archbishops to consecrate any Bishops, but vpon persons ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to bee consecrated by order of the Church, they conferre and collate such Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, as lye within there owne dominion.</p>

                     <p>It doth not appeare by scripture, that Christ, or his Apostles mingled water with wine, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it was the manner of those hot Countries to temper their wine with water, many of the ancients, and amongst them Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> conceiued, that Christ at his last Supper did so. Which if he did, yet seing he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs not to follow his example any further, then to doe that which hee did, that is to take bread, and breake it, to take the Cup, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it; we transgresse not Christs Institution, whether we communicate in leauen or vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread, whether in pure wine, or in wine mingled with water. The commandement lyes vpon the substance, to eate of the bread, and drinke of the Cup, and therein of the fruit of the vine: but not on the circumstances, which are left free, and indifferent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this epistle, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bendeth this discourse against the Aquarij, certaine heretikes, who contended, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ought to be receiued in water onely. Against these he proues most strongly, that we ought to receiue in wine. This is his maine drift, and thus farre we hold with him. On the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21367:158"/>
by, he speaketh of mingling wine with water, which was the vse in his time: and we dislike it not, only wee hold, the Church is free in this kind to receiue it in pure wine, as it is the maner of some Protestant Churches, or in wine min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with water, as it may bee in some other. But Master <hi>Euerard,</hi> if you had read this epistle, vpon which you so much insist, you might haue found, that though Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> by the way fauoureth your practise of mingling wine with water, yet he condemneth your Church by the maine scope &amp; drift of the epistle, in the very point now in question. For hee saith, that Christ taught, that the Cup ought to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ministred vnto the people, which you doe not, <note n="*" place="margin">Cur quidam in calice sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando, &amp; plebi ministrando non hoc faciunt, quod Iesus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Deus noster sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficij huius au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, &amp; Doctor, fecit, &amp; docuit.</note> 
                        <hi>In sanctifying the Lords Cup, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string it to the people, why do some through ignorance, or simplicitie not that which Iesus Christ our Lord and God, the author and teacher of this Sacrifice both did, and taught?</hi>

                     <p>This is a true Relation of the some of the Conference, so farre as I can remember.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21367:165"/>
of Reall presence and of Transubstantion, and determining the point in question to bee this. <hi>Whether the body of Christ were truly and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Sacrament, vnder the formes of bread and wine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which being done, hee entred into a large discourse, to set downe the proofes and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the affirmatiue, vsed by their Church:</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he was challenged by M. <hi>Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of a breach of the third Law: and so, after Master <hi>Featly</hi> had for his part promised him to answer all his arguments at another time, when the hearers should thinke good, D. <hi>Smith</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased.</p>
                  <p>And M. <hi>Featly</hi> explained the termes of the Question as followeth.</p>
                  <p>There are two termes, (said hee) in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Presence,</hi> and <hi>Reall:</hi> I distinguish of both.</p>
                  <p>First, The Scripture speaketh of a fourefold <note place="margin">Fouresold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; 1. diuine; 2. spirituall; 3. sacramentall; 4. corporall. Ephes. 3. 17.</note> presence of Christ, first, <hi>Diuine,</hi> according to which, he is present in all places. The second, <hi>Spirituall,</hi> according to which hee is said after a speciall manner to dwell in the faithfull. The third, <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> according to which, he is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Sacrament both mystically and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. For the Sacrament doth not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him, and his death to the eye of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but also truly present, and offer him, and all the benefits of his Passion to our soules. It doth not onely signifie, but also by vertue of Christs promise, truly, and effectually exhibit
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21367:165"/>
                     <hi>Grace:</hi> The fourth, is <hi>carnall</hi> and <hi>corporall,</hi> of which those words are meant, <note n="a" place="margin">Verbum care factum est, &amp; babitauit in nobis.</note> 
                     <hi>The Word was madeflesh, and dwelt among vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In like manner the word <hi>Reall</hi> is diuersly taken; 1. Sometime as it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to that, which is fayned, and imaginary. Secondly, as it is opposed to that, which is meerely figuratiue, and barely representatiue. Thirdly, as it is opposed to that which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and immateriall; in which sense, <hi>Reall, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,</hi> and <hi>Corporall</hi> are co-incident.</p>
                  <p>We beleeue, that Christ is present in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <note place="margin">Stat. Quaest.</note> and that Really, in the two former sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of <hi>Reall,</hi> and the three first accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Presence: we deny it in the last of both. In summe, Christ is there many wayes <hi>Really,</hi> not <hi>Corporally;</hi> that is, <hi>not according to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his naturall body, shrouded vnder the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread and wine; which he thus prooued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That doctrin which hath no foundation in the <note place="margin">The maine Argument.</note> Word of God, and is repugnant to the doctrine of the true ancient Church, and ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the principles of right reason, implying pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable absurdities, and apparent contradictions, is to be reiected as erroneous and hereticall:</p>
                  <p>But the Doctrine of the Church of Rome, touching the bodily presence of Christ in the Sacrament, is such:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is to be disclaimed.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Smith</hi> here denyed the minor.</p>
                  <p>Which Mast. <hi>Featly</hi> vndertooke to proue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the parts: but the time permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21367:166"/>
to prosecute onely the proofe of the first: which was, <hi>That the Papists haue no ground in Scripture for their Reall Presence of Christs body in the Sacrament.</hi> And thus he proceeded.</p>
                  <p>First, if there be any ground in Scripture for this your opinion, certainely it is either in the words <note n="b" place="margin">Hoc est corpus meu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>This is my body;</hi> or in those, the 6. of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 53. <note n="c" place="margin">Nisi carnem meam comede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Vnlesse you eate my flesh, &amp;c.</hi> vpon which all Papish build their beliefe in this point.</p>
                  <p>But neither the one, nor the other are any sure ground for it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> You haue none.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Smith</hi> in this Syllogisme, as in the former, denyed the assumption.</p>
                  <p>Which was thus confirmed.</p>
                  <p>If the words of the Institution, <hi>Hoc est, &amp;c.</hi> and the other Iohn 6. are to be taken figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not in the proper sense: out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, they make nothing for the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or carnall eating of Christ with the mouth.</p>
                  <p>But the words aboue alleadged in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to bee construed figuratiuely, and not properly according to the rigour of the letter; which I proue (saith he) by vncontrollable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Fathers, and euident arguments drawne from the circumstances of those texts.</p>
                  <p>And first he alledged a place of <hi>Tertullian, li. 4. cont. Marcionem cap. 40.</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Acceptum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butum discipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, corpus suum illud fecit, Hoc est corpus meum, dicendo, id est figura <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

withal, that if D. <hi>Smith,</hi> or any other could being a more pregnant place for the figuratiue exposition out of any Protestant, hee would yeeld him the better.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Smith</hi> could bring none, but made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <note n="e" place="margin">Ex Autogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho.

                     <hi>Those words of</hi> Tert. <hi>are so to be vnderstood, that the words (a figure of my body) are to be referred to the word</hi> (this) <hi>which is the subiect of Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and doe explaine it so: that the meaning of</hi> Tertullian <hi>is: This that is a figure of my body, is my body;</hi> or: as he afterwards mended it, <note n="f" place="margin">Id quod erat vctus figura, est corpus meum.</note> 
                     <hi>that which was of old a figure of my body, is now my body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which, M. <hi>Featly</hi> thus replyed. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse this answer, is to refute it: if it bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto a speech of three words to ad <hi>(id quod erat vetus)</hi> to the <hi>subiectum;</hi> and <hi>(corpus meum)</hi> to the <hi>praedicatum:</hi> and to referre the words <hi>(idest figura)</hi> not to the <hi>praedicatum,</hi> as all men do in the like; you may make <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this D. <hi>Smith</hi> answered out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was a very obscure Writer, and had a very ill gift in expressing his minde.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto it was reioyned; If he bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure in other places, what is that to this which is most cleere to any, that will not shut his eyes? discredit not <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed, that hee let no day passe without reading some part of his workes, calling for him by the name of his Master: <hi>Da Magistrum, Tertullianum videlicet significans.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hier. Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>al. vir: illustr.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he replyed, that how ill soeuer a gift <hi>Tertullian</hi> might haue in expressing his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21367:167"/>
owne minde, he could not be so dull in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our Sauiours mind, as to make this to bee the meaning of our Sauiours words;) <hi>This is my body,)</hi> that is, the bread which was a figure of my body in the old Law, is now my body: seeing that our Sauiour speaketh neuer a word there, nor hath any relation at all to any figure of the old Testament, neither in the words going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor comming after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, admitting this most strange, and forced interpretation; yet out of this place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> I inferre necessarily, that the words of the Institution be figuratiue. For this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. <hi>The figure,</hi> or that which was the figure of my body, <hi>is my body</hi> (which is your expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tertullian)</hi> cannot be true, but by a figure: sith <hi>panis,</hi> and <hi>corpus Christi,</hi> are <hi>disparata;</hi> which cannot properly be one affirmed of the other; Let the Pronoune demonstratiue, <hi>Hoc,</hi> stand for <hi>figura corporis mei,</hi> as you will haue it, and adde thereunto the <hi>copula</hi> and <hi>praedicatum,</hi> you faine, <hi>est corpus meum,</hi> saying, <hi>figura corporis mei est corpus meum:</hi> you must needs fly to a figure to make this Proposition true. For whether you put the Bread, or the accidents to be the onely figures of Christs body, all is one: sith neither Bread, nor the accidents of Bread can bee truly, and properly said to be Christs body.</p>
                  <p>Here D. <hi>Smith</hi> was forced to acknowledge a figure in the words of the Institution. These are his owne words; <note n="g" place="margin">Ex autogr. Ego agnos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>o, quòd in verbis, hoc est corpus meum, est figura, sed non mera figura, aut figura vacua à veritate, quae figuratur.</note> 
                     <hi>I acknowledge, that in these words this is my body, is a figure, but not a meere figure
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21367:167"/>
or a figure voyde of that truth, which is figured by it.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the words of consecration make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Transubstantiation, or any thing else.

                  <p>The words vsed in the consecration of the <note place="margin">2. Arg. deductum à circumst. contextus.</note> bread are so to be expounded, as the like in the consecration of the Cup:</p>
                  <p>But the words vsed in the consecration of the Cup are to be expounded by a figure, or more:</p>

                  <p>Thus (quoth M. <hi>Featly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> these are the words, as they are recorded, Luk. 22. 20. <note n="x" place="margin">Hic calix est n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>I will not contest with you (quoth D. <hi>Smith)</hi> about <hi>Calix;</hi> let that bee a figure: but I deny there is any figure in the word <hi>Testamentum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is well (quoth M. <hi>Featly)</hi> you grant one figure in the words of consecration: I assure you, D. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> is of another mind; to grant one figure, in his iudgment, is to loose all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what priuiledge haue you more to set a figure vpon the words of consecration of the Cup, then we vpon the like of the bread? Where are now your exclamations against vs, for obscuring, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauing, and disfiguring the words of Christ by Tropes and Figures? One figure you grant, and it shall goe hard, but I will multiply it, and make more figures of it. Either there is a figure in the word Testament, or that, which you say, is meant by <hi>Calix,</hi> is properly <hi>Christi Testamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi>

But that cannot bee: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I demonstrate it: By <hi>hic calix</hi> you meane <hi>hic sanguis:</hi> but <hi>sanguis Christi</hi> is not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè testamentum.</hi>

                     <hi>Probatur</hi> (quoth M. <hi>Featly,)</hi> No substantiall part of the Testator is properly his Testament: But the blood of Christ is a substantiall part of the Testator: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not properly his last Will and Testament.</p>
                  <p>In this Syllogisme D. <hi>Smith</hi> denyed the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior, affirming, that if any man should signe any <note place="margin">Resp.</note> thing with his blood, that blood being an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall signe of his Will, might be properly called his Testament.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon M. <hi>Featly</hi> replyed; Blood proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Testament? I reade in Scripture of blood <note place="margin">Replic.</note> of the Testament: but neuer heard of a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or blood a testament. Certainely the word Testament signifieth properly the Will it selfe of the Testator, but by an vsuall phrase of speech, or figure, it is applyed to the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is (speaking properly) but a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Will. As for the blood, or marke wherewith any man signeth his Will, he neuer heard any man call that his Testament, no not by a figure, much lesse properly; <note n="a" place="margin">Testamentum est voluntatis nos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>To this D. <hi>Smith</hi> answered, that our Sauiour spake this of the Cup of the old Testament, mentioned in <hi>Luke,</hi> not of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Which answer M. <hi>Featly</hi> thus infringed: These words in Saint <hi>Matthew, This fruit of the Vine,</hi> must haue relation to the Cup, of which Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> spake before: but Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> spake of no Cup before, but of the Cup of the new Testament: therefore these words: <hi>This fruit of the Vine,</hi> must needs be vnderstood of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21367:175"/>
Cup of the new Testament. If I should take here a Cup, and after I had dranke of it, say, I will drinke no more of this, were it not ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to vnderstand me of any other cup, then that I tooke last in my hand, and dranke of?</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Smith</hi> repeated his former answer, and said: it was sufficient that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> spake of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Cup.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Featly</hi> replyed: what, is it sufficient to make perfect sense in a sentence set downe in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> to fetch a proposition, or narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Saint <hi>Luke</hi> his Gospell?

                  <p>He answered onely as before, that their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was probable: but he preferred his owne before it: and yet triumphed, as if he had gotten the day, saying; Are these your demonstrations?

                  <p>And it was replied; Are these your best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,

and defences? Is your great brag of the Fathers, and of the Councels come to this; that when they are alleaged against you, you either discredit them, as you did <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or make miserable excuses for them, as <note n="k" place="margin">In resp. ad hoc arg. lib. 1. de sacr.

                  <p>I must willingly subscribe to the truth of that, which D. <hi>Smith</hi> did so voluntarily present to our eyes and eares; And for the rest, which
