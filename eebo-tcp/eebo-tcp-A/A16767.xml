            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Well said Boy, but let me talke a word or two with thee: Thou hast been abroade in the world, and hast seene more then thou hast eaten, and hast left many a good Towne behinde thee for fault of carriage: tell me I pray thee, whence camest thou now?</p>

               <p>Directly from the Vniuersitie, where I haue made no long stay: for had it not lyen in my way, I had not come at it at all, such was my haste home, as well first to shewe my duetie to you, as to acquaint you with the occasion of some matters, which at leysure I wil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto you.</p>

               <speaker>Cre.</speaker>
               <p>I vnderstand you well: me you come to see, but my money is the matter you would talke of, for certaine occasions you thereunto moouing: but by the way, let me aske you what newes are abroad?</p>

               <p>Newes enough, but fewe worth the hearing: and in the place from which I came (I meane the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme) there are but two pointes the Schollers stand

               <p>For prouision of apparell which is necessarie, meate and drinke, and lodging, which are necessarie: horse and furniture, which are necessarie: maintenance
<pb facs="tcp:5011:5"/>
of wife, children, and seruants, all which are necessarie: to keepe good courses, with good company, which is necessarie: to procure aduauncement, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: to keepe off want, which is necessarie to helpe the needie, feede the hungrie, and relieue the oppressed, which is necessarie: In all which necessarie causes, the spirit being mooued by grace and reason, to effect that which cannot be done without money, he is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a necessarie seruant, and a seruant at all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but wisdome which is a directer of the spirit in all good, and necessarie courses, &amp; the employer of wealth in all necessarie causes, is to bee honoured aboue all thinges, whatsoeuer man can be master of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>Well said; but superfluity then, money hath nothing to do withal, as thus: better want money then waste it vpon drunkennes, wantonnesse, or wickednes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when one hath a coate that will keepe him warme, which was the cause garments were first made, and money is employed for them to lay on needeles lace of threed, Silke or Siluer, or Golde, which makes the garment more weightie then warme, money is to be pardoned for any such vnnecessarie expence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam.</speaker>
               <p>Pardon me Sir, it makes the garment more comely, and comelinesse is necessarie so farre that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not reason in measure: furthermore it is an vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Silke, an vpholder of traffique, and maintainer of Arte.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>So Sir, well said Maister Scholler, how finely you can make superfluitie in pride, be a reliefe of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and necessarie to maintaine traffique<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, content your selfe, cloath the backe warme, satisfie hunger and thirst, and so farre my money hath bene my Seruant,
<pb facs="tcp:5011:6"/>
and so farre hee shall bee yours. Why so you may say of a house, when the first cause was to keepe Man drie: to make more roomes then there is vse for, more Chimnyes, then is fier for; more Windowes then there is wit for, and more Painting and Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then there is good reason for: why should not monye lie still rather then bee employed in such vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie humors?</p>

               <p>Oh Sir, are not many poore men emploied in their labours, many men of trade exercised in their Arte? and is not the beautie thereof comely to the eyes of the beholder? which may as well praise God in the worke-man-shippe, as haue pride in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it? oh, it is the ill minde of one that misconstrueth the good meaning of an other: and therefore monye being made for necessarie vses, and many necessarie vses in the building of faire houses, monye is to bee employed and the builder for his wisdome to bee honoured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>I thanke you Sir: but for my selfe, hee hath serued me to builde roomes necessarie for my vse and no further, and for a house fit for your calling my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye shall serue you and no further: why, you perhaps will defend feasts, and banqueting, when monye is onely to bee employed for necessitie to satisfie hunger and thirst.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam.</speaker>
               <p>Without offence, I thinke I may say, that Feastes are as necessarie as Fasts: for, as the one doth pull downe the flesh from rebelling against the Spirit, so doth the other giue the Spirit more life in reioycing vpon a iust cause of ioy: as in many excellent Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as well Diuine as humaine, wee may reade: but
<pb facs="tcp:5011:6"/>
to allowe thereby of Drunkennes or glotonny, I haue no such meaning: As at mariages, holy daies, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest merrie meetings, a little too much, is better then much too little: further-more the varieties of meates and drinkes, as Ale, Beere, Wine, Sugar and Spices, are the better knowne, wherein God is glorified, and praised for his blessings, and the Vintner, the Grocer, the Comfit-maker, the Cooke, the Brewer and the Butcher, doe by the venting of their wares, the better maintaine their trades<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that I thinke I may well say, that monye in the prouision of Feastes and banquets, is to bee employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a seruant of necessitie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>So Sir, you say well: but money hath serued mee for the good loafe and the Cheese, Beefe, and Mutton, and nowe and then a Goose and a Chicke, or a Ducke of mine owne breede or your Mothers; and a cuppe of Ale or Beere of our owne brewing: this outlandish drinke (this Wine) is more costly then wholsome: I warrant you the greatest part of this Countrie standes vpon Corne, and Sheepe: and where haue you a Plough-man or a Shepheard, that almost knowes what Drinke it is, or cares for it, when he sees it? No, Ale and Beere is our best liquor, and therefore so farre as may kill hunger and quench thirst, monye hath serued mee, and so farre shall it serue you: but, whether is more wisdome in getting money to serue necessities, and keepe it for necessarie causes, or to studie trickes to lay it out vpon nice inuentions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam.</speaker>
               <p>Truely Sir, (as I said before, monye is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons seruant, &amp; wisdom is reasons maister: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if reason
<pb facs="tcp:5011:7"/>
the Seruant to wisdom, can finde meanes euen among fooles to get money, either by Labour, Arte, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: and wisdome onely be the director of reason in the imployment of that money, to the necessarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and honour of man: I holde it a greater wisdome well to dispose of a Seruants businesse, then to come by the Seruant, for money is euerie mans Seruant in one sort or other: but wisdome liueth but with a fewe, whome shee maketh more honorable then the money-Master.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, how can that bee? what honor is there without money? the best Scholler without money may make a hard dinner, and goe in a threed-bare Coate: and for all his grace in the Schooles, haue little grace in the world.</p>

               <p>But heere me a little, I thinke if a man should touch you with a tickling humor, of an effeminate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you would defend it to bee good, and money necessarie to bee vsed in such a seruice: and were not that a prettie piece of learning?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam</speaker>
               <p>Howsoeuer Sir you thinke of it: I can shew good reason for it: for Loue is an humor of the minde infused into the heart, by the vertue of the Spirit: which by the grace of wisdome, the art of reason, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of money, worketh honorable effectes in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for when the eye beholdeth beautie, nature is pleased in the obiecte; when reason findeth wit, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is delighted in the Subiecte; and when wisdome findeth grace, reason is ioyfull in vnderstanding; and then all these meeting together in conceite, must needes work together for contentment: for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of which, money must be a seruant of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. As thus: If your neighbour had two Sonnes, the one were wise, learned, valiant, and honest, yet did want money to aduaunce his vertues, &amp; the other had
<pb facs="tcp:5011:8"/>
much monie, and no other good matter to mooue the least humor of good liking my sister to whom my gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother hath left a good Portion, should effect this younger Brother without monye, and leaue the other to his all money: is it not fit and necessarie, that her money should rather bee an aduauncement of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and a content of her kindenesse, and perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of her comfort, rather then bee a choaker of Midas, with more money then he can swallowe, and be an increaser of Idolatry: and perhaps, a griefe to you in the Prime of her owne comfort: so if it should fal out with me to affect the hope of my fortune, would you spare your Pursse to procure my preferment? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it father, the best loue is begotten by the eyes bred in the Braines, &amp; growes to perfection in the heart: and shall not money bee a seruant then of necessitie to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the commaundement of Loue? fie on this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-matches, where mariages are made without affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and obedience is performed by a grieued patience: no let money be vsed as a Seruant to reason, and not a Maister of Loue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>Oh fine boy; I almost finde where you are, but let me tell you, though your wordes hang well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet me thinkes, money lies better together: for if a Wench that hath money Loue thee, spend of her purse, or els thou wantest wit: if thou haue money and loue her that hath none, her wit hath made a foole of thee: for, tell me a tale of a Tub, of eyes &amp; eares, and hearts, obiect and subiect, and wisdome, and reason: without money, tis not worth a whiffe: for <hi>Aurum pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> is a strange quintescence: it will make age young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it will giue the heart a life beyond all the phisicke
<pb facs="tcp:5011:8"/>
of the world: why Gold is halfe a God on the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hath such power among people, Let a wench be weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and set out in her brauerie, though she bee painted for her beautie, and scarce gentill for her parentage, yet, if she catch the name of a Lady, she must bee honoured like Queene <hi>Guineuer</hi>: &amp; if she be but neere a Princesse, she shal bee almost worshipped like a Goddesse. Why goe no further but to our owne neighbours: what a slut will haue a husband if shee haue but a little money. and what fine Wenches match with Clownes, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their Farmes and their stockes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but Father, what followes? Iealouzie and Cuckoldry, and Bastardry, &amp; Rogery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she cannot Loue him, nor he her: youth cannot loue age, age will be Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of youth, and loue wil haue his working: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I said before, the cause is couetousnes and the roote of all euill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>Well said againe boy: but yet twill not serue your turne, for I wil haue an other bowte with you: for money is a matter of more moment then you make account of: why? money makes the medicine for the sicke, pleades the Clients cause, maintaines the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Trade, makes the Soldiers fight, and the Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man worke, the Trauailer treade lightly, and the olde Mare trot, and the young Tit Amble: it doth, I knowe not what, nor almost what can on earth be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it? It frameth the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, tuneth the strings, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; singeth the song it furnisheth the court, graceth the citty, &amp; maintaineth the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try: In summe, let me tel thee, it is a matter of such moment, as there is neither youth, nor Beauty, Valour, nor Learning, wit nor wisdome, but if it want money to grace it, it shall
<pb facs="tcp:5011:9"/>
haue little grace in the world: and therefore let him be first counted wise that gets it, then wise that keepes it, and last wise that knowes how to vse it: and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer opinions are of it, holde you with me this assurance of it, that he is wise who hath it, and so contrarie to all them that say against it, say you, he is wise that is rich.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Father I am sorry to heare you speake so feelingly of your loue to money: which you haue bene long in getting, carefull in keeping, and will be sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in leauing: Oh let it not haue such power ouer you, to make you a slaue to your Seruant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is but a drosse trodden on by the feete of Beastes, serueth the begger, as a greater person, the wicked as the vertuous, the Iewe as the Christian, embrodereth the Horses cloathes as the Lords cloake, and the Maides kertell, as her Ladies petticoate: it begetteth Pride, breedeth warres, procureth Treasons, and ruynes countries: and yet let me say this of it: the fault is not in it selfe, but in the vse of it: and for the good that is done by it, is not of it selfe but in the wisedome of him or her that hath the vse of it, and therefore let it bee left indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent good or euill, or neither of both, but fit for either as it is vsed: and count him rather wise that knowes how to vse it, then how to get it: for many get it by a wicked Father, which being wise, will not leaue it to a wicked Sonne: many get it by Dice and Cardes, which being wise, will imploy it in better courses: many get it by an olde blinde widow, that haue wit to spend it with sweeter creature: many get it by piracie at Sea, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it in a better course at Land: In briefe, the getting of it sometime is so grieuous to a good conscience, as can approue no wisedome in it, and the employing of it
<pb facs="tcp:5011:9"/>
may be to so good an ende, as prooueth great wisdome in the mannaging of it: and therefore in my iudgement, knowing no man wise through riches, but, many rich through wisdome, I holde him rich that is wise, not him wise that is rich.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre.</speaker>
               <p>So then you would haue me that haue been carefull to get money, which I haue lying by me for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vses, bestowe it vpon you that knowe (as you thinke,) how to prooue more wisdome in the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: it may bee I will doe so with parte of it, in hope, that you that can speake so well of it will knowe as well what to doe with it: but before we come to that point, let mee talke a little further with you touching your trauaile: what haue you chiefely noted for your benefit?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pam.</speaker>
               <p>The natures of the Soiles, the inhabitants of the Countries, the dispositions of the people, and the wisdome of the Gouernours: To the first, I noted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the climat of wihat heate or coldenes, drie or moystnes, what fruite, what store, and in what season, what Riuers, fresh or salt, what Cattell, and Fowle, and Fish, what Mineralles, and what Mines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chre</speaker>
               <p>And for Fish, you could bring none home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, nor sweete: and, haue not our Seas, and fresh-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as good Fish as other? And for Cattell, there can bee no better Beefe nor Mutton, then ours: Now for Fowle, both Land and water Fowle: there are in our heathes, woodes and fens, I thinke as good and as great varietie with vs as any where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it may be, far fetcht and deere bought is good for Ladies, and if you haue hit on a little monster, as a Camelion, or an Indian Flie, it may bee, if you can vse the matter hansomely, fooles
<pb facs="tcp:5011:10"/>
may giue you money for the sight of it: now for Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, how much money soeuer you found in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I feare you haue brought but a little out of it, and therfore for these notes, I think for any profit you made of your trauaile, you had bin as good a taried at home: Nowfor the people, I thinke, they are as we are in shape though by some of those outlandish, they mishape the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their apparel, I know not what to say to them, but, if the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be rich, it is like they will keepe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and if poore, they will either begge, cheat, or steale, and so liue as long as they can: and for the women, if they bee faire, they knowe what to make of their beautie, and if Fowle, how to make of their money. Olde Folkes can tell howe to gouerne Children, and youthes will play the wagges, if it bee with their owne Fathers: for Boyes (God send them Grace) had neuer more witte then they haue now a daies. Now for the Gouernours, where there are manye, it is strange if there bee not one wise, and if the rest will obserue good notes, their wittes may prooue nere the worse: now if there bee manie wise, it will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one wit too much to take notice of them all: and therefore Sonne, though a little expence of money haue bought thee a little experience, and the varietie of knowledge haue giuen thee a little contentment, yet, let no Idoll corrupt thy conscience, no vanitie corrupt thy wit, nor folly bee Maister of thy will: thy natiue soyle is naturall, thy Countriemen nearer to thee then strangers: thy kindred, then vnknowne people, and thy Fathers house will giue a kinder wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then the Pallace of a Princesse: Let not the alteration of the Ayre, alter thy nature, the obiect of
<pb facs="tcp:5011:10"/>
thine eye the Iudgement of thy minde, nor the sound of the eare, the sence of thy heart: If thou bee returned home, as thou wentest out, I shall bee glad of it: but if eyther France haue taught thee fancies, Italye wantonnesse, Flaunders drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, or any place wickednesse, I shall bee sorrie for thy Trauaile and wish thou hadst neuer gone: Oh let not wars make thee bloudy, Courts make thee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, trade make thee couetous, lawe make thee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, women make thee wanton, nor flatterie make thee proude: for, as Trauaile is the life of youth, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie the loue of knowledge, so yet after all thy Trauaile learne this, nay by thy varietie of thy knowledge learne this Lesson, couldest thou see all the worlde, thou shouldest see nothing but a worlde, and in the ende of all, finde all haue an ende: Riches must ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be spent or lefte, beauty must decay, honour must be transported, nature must growe weake, sences loose their sence, and life must ende, and then when all is gone, then vanitie, vanitie, and all is vanitie: in the graue there is no beautie, no honour, no wealth, no sence, no life: &amp; thither you must as well as I, and who knoweth, who first? now whether it bee in the Sea, or in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in a Fishes belly or a Leaden Coffin: all is one, a graue there must be, of whosoeuer it be: and therefore before thou commest to that last Inne of thy worldes Iourney, let me wish thee wheresoeuer thou goest, and whatsoeuer thou seest, be still one man &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber one thing: serue but one God, loue but one &amp; thine owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, haue but one wife &amp; trust but one frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods breedeth heathens miseries, many countries trauailers humors, many wiues me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s purgatories, and

many friends trustes ruine: first God gaue thee life, loue him for it: yea hee loueth thee, liue to him for it: your Countrey gaue you foode vnder God, loue it for it: your Countrey gaue you knowledge first vnder God, liue in it for it: your wife giues you Issue, loue her for it, she easeth your house cares, liue with her for it: and your friend conceales your secrets, loue him for it: and is an other your selfe, liue neere to him for it: and leauing the vaine desire of varietie, liue to the onely loue of vertue: spend your thoughts in contemplation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine comfort, your substance in the seruice of God, and benefit of your countrey: wagge not wanton with the wandring eyes, nor trifle out time in vnprofitable toies, couer not your balde head with Periwigs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed hayre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> curle not your beard with hot Irons: leere not aside like a Beare-whelpe, nor looke vnder the browes like a Bull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Dogge, march not in a towne of peace like a Souldiour, nor runne out of your wits in an humor: carry not a picke-tooth in your mouth, a flower in your eare, nor a Gloue in your Hat, for it is apish and foolish, deuised by idle heads, and worne by shallowe wits: binde not your inuention to Poetry, nor make an Oration of an Epistle: Learne but two partes of speeche, to speake good wordes, and to good purpose: goe cleanely but not gaiely, and gaine honestly, and spend thriftilie: feede sparingly, drinke moderately, sleepe soundly, but rise earely, so passing thy time merrily, thou shalt liue happily and die blessedlie: this lesson hath been taught me at home, and I doubt: you will scarce finde a better abroad: but least I growe teadious to thee, thus to take thee to Schoole as soone as thou commest home, I pray thee

               <p>Truely Father I knowe not the minde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man, nor how fullye to define content: but when wit hath found out, reason hath Iudged, and nature hath receiued the pleasure of the Spirit in the delight of the sences, I thinke, if in the world there bee any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it is there: Now, be it at home or abroad, all is one, for there is an olde sentence which is oftentimes new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in effect. <hi>Omne Solum fortis patria:</hi> euery house is home, all Countries are one to a resolute minde: a friend is a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dabroad, &amp; an ennimie is an ennimie at home: ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is limited to no place, but honoured in al persons, &amp; loue hath a worlde to walke in, to take the pleasure of his fortune, where varietie of choise tries the wisdome of judgement: my father, if I beholde him but as a man, I can loue him but as a man, but when I thinke of his loue, I loue him as a Father: now, loue being bound to no place, cannot forget his owne nature any where: nay absence of place strengthens the memorie of Loue: and therefore if I beholde my selfe, in being a sonne, I remember my Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I behold your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I remember your blessing, and honour your Loue: so that still I say, it is not the place, that perfecteth affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, no not in nature: and sometime absence is the cause of the more Ioy in loue, as in the Souldiour, who after Conquest returneth with more honour then he had at home: the Marchant after a voyage, pleaseth his mistris with better wares then she had at home: the Courtier after trauaile, tels his Lady a better tale, then of a Foxe and a Goose, and the Scholler after Trauaile, makes a better verse then at home: why the Clowne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:5011:12"/>
trauaile can learne to kisse his hand, &amp; maide Maul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin after trauaile, can make new countenances &amp; new complexions: oh father, this home humor wil soone be worne so threed-bare, that if it were not shifted with some trauaile (euen with lazy) wit would grow louzy: for in place of accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where knowledge is to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there is more matter then for the Market, and of more judgement then maister constables: were the wise that haue seene the world, note the necessarie good of Trauaile: who neuer heard but a Iacke-Dawe would thinke a Parret a spirit, &amp; either be affraide of her, or in loue with her, when he that knoweth her what shee is, wil regarde her as shee is: now he that neuer saw but an Ape, would thinke a Baboone a little deuill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he that hath trauailed where they are bred, will know them for ordinary beastes of those countries: he that neuer saw a Mountibanke, would take a curtizen for a better crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but hee that had seene their traffique would neuer care for their trade: he that neuer saw a Whale would thinke it a Deuill in the Sea, but hee that had been where they are bredde would knowe it there, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Fish: hee that neuer saw a Picture would goe neere to thinke it an Angell, but hee that knowes them what they bee, will thinke of them as they are. Oh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Tiranny of one Prince makes the mercie of an other more glorious: the terror of warre, makes peace seeme more joyfull, and the daunger of the Sea makes the Land more wished for: doth not the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse of one Countrie make sobrietie in an other seeme more gratious? the Treasons in one Countrie make loyalltie more honourable in an other? and who hath not seene the one, how can he Iudge of the other?
<pb facs="tcp:5011:12"/>
now, for further causes of contentment, what Golde is in the Indies? what Arte in China? what workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe in Millaine? what building in Florence? what Fountaines in Genoua? what State in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberge? and for Venice who hath not seene it cannot praise it, but who hath seene it, and can judge of it, I leaue him to speake of it. Oh the Corne, wine and fruite of France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Oyle, Spice, Drugges and fruite of Spaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Rosen, Pitch, Tarre, and Hempe, Waxe, and Honie from the Easte Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Veluets, Sattens, Taffaties and Silkes of Italy, and other farre Countries! are these at home? yea, but howe? not to bee seene with that contentment that it is at their home: for, to see the little Worme that windes the Silke, how shee liues before her working, and then, how with her worke, shee payes for her liuing, howe neate the Maides bring them to Market, wound vp in their worke, how finelye they are wound out of their worke, and their Silken threedes wouen into diuers fine Stuffes, as well Cloath of Golde, Tissue, Siluer, or Tuffed or plaine Veluet or Satten, or stuffes of other names, the rarenes in the Arte of it, and the neatenes in the dooing of it, it is a thousand times more contentiue, then to buye it in a Shoppe, and to weare it in slappe: Oh to see a Generall in the middest of an Armie, or a Cittie besiedged! to see the Beautie of one, and note the strength of the other, and to tarrie the fortune of both, it would make you breake your Spade, and your Flaile, and as olde as you are, trye the Fortune of your Sworde, to see but one such a sight in all your life:
<pb facs="tcp:5011:13"/>
why in a Chamber to see a woman of worth sued to, by the better sort, to heare the excellencie of her wit deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at the ende of her tongue, with such a grace of modestie, as might cleere suspicion of vngratious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when her eyes like starres did sparckle in the little Element of her face, and her hayres like wiers, might winde vp the thoughts of loues heart, while her wordes like Oracles, should coniure honour to loyaltie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold such a queene-like creature in the richest of her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray. to reade her in the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of her wit, &amp; heare her in the excellencie of her musicke, were such a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the spirit of good vnderstanding, as would make the heart to rise, to the highest of his worldes ioy: and, is this to bee seene at home in a cupboord, or a Corne-lofte, or a Cowe pastor? no, no, I confesse, flesh and blood, red and white, and louely browne, will doe well where are no better: but a countrey daunce is but a Iigge to a stately Pauen: no father had you seene that which I haue seene, and know that I knowe, you wold long as well as I to see that I would see: for an olde Mans lesson, is knowledge by experience, and a young Mans Loue is varietie of vnderstanding, which is the fruite of Trauaile.</p>

               <p>Well Sonne, I sayed it not for nought, that Boyes in these daies, haue wit at will, God send them grace to vse it well: but, now I haue heard you at ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, giue mee leaue to answere you a little touching contentment: you say, euery house is a home, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Countrie alike to a resolued spirit, but he that selleth Land at home, to looke ouer Land abroade, when his money is spent, and hee hath neither house nor home, what then followes, but, insteede of content, play Mal-Content:
<pb facs="tcp:5011:13"/>
and for the commoditie of Land, better haue an Acre of land in Cheape-side, then a hundreth in the Land of waste, for it is either vnder water, or subiect to drowning, and therefore tell not mee of your outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish earth nor the fruites of it: for, I can haue as good hearbes and fruites here at my doore for my money, as you can haue any where in your trauaile, I know it: for I haue heard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say it, that haue tried it: why? haue not we our Cherry, our Strawberry, our Raspesse, our Goose-berrie and our Mulberie, and I knowe not how many berries, as the Season serues? haue not wee the Plumme, the Peare, the Apricocke, the Apple, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the Quince, the Walnut and the Filberd, and the Hasell Nut, the Medler, and the Ches-nut, and al in their seasons, growing in our countries, &amp; brought to our markets? and are they not cheaper heere then to trauaile for them, I knowe not whether? Indeede, I thinke we haue them not in such aboundance, for I holde no such necessitie: now, for Mineralles, I doe not thinke but you may finde more Golde and Siluer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground in one Acre in Cheape-side, then you may finde in ten of the best Acres in your Trauaile: and therefore, for Earth I thinke we haue as good at home, as you can finde abroad: and so much for your earth. Now for your fine wormes, and your worming Maides, it is a prettie idle thing to stand peering on a Worme, but, perhaps we haue wormes at home, that winde themselues vp in Silke, though they bee not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Market, one of which are better worth then a hundreth of your wormes, &amp; for Maides, if our maides be not as cleanely on the market day, as they are on a Holy-day, trust mee no more, and I am sorrie you can
<pb facs="tcp:5011:14"/>
say no more for yours: for they that bee not Sluts, will bee neate, and there is an ende: and for your Silkes and Veluets, wee haue our Sattens heere with such a glasse, that you may almost see your face in it, vppon the backeside of a Vardingale: and therefore talke no more of it: wee haue it heere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trauaile, as well as you haue it thore with your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and so content your selfe: Now for your Parrats, your Apes, your Whales &amp; your trickes, some of them we heare speake, and other we see daunce, &amp; other wee heare of, and what care we for more? they that will bee fooles to giue money for fancies, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone with their follies, I wish not to Trauaile for any such toyes: Nowe for your Campe and your Cittie besiedged, howe gallant soeuer the sightes seeme pleasing to your humor, yet I thinke the heart of a wise man will bee better pleased with a poore peace, then a Rich Warre: though commonly Warre bee the cause of pouertie, and peace of wealth: Nowe for your wenching humor, so fine and so wise, so faire, and so sweete in her lookes, and her wordes, and her trickes, and her toyes, I thanke God, the thought of that world is done with mee, and I would it were neuer to bee thought on with you: for let an Olde Mans lesson bee what it will, a faire wench is a young Mans Loue, and so I allowe it should bee: but then I would haue it neere home, that I might Iudge the better of it, for there are as I heare, so many Painters of Womens faces, so many Instructers of Womens tongues, and so manie flatterers of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens humors, that if a man haue not both his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and his outsight, he may pay home for his blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<pb facs="tcp:5011:14"/>
and therefore, let Wiers, And Oracles, and such Poeticall figures or fictions passe, and for a flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or a browne hayre, for a chaste eye, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest face, for a good complexion, and a gratious disposition, I thinke all the worlde is not better prouided for good Wenches then our Countrie, talke of your farre Countries what you list, and therefore I see not howe you are benefited by your Trauaile, more then to haue libertie to tell more then many well beleeue: but let mee aske you one thing in your Trauaile, did you not reade any Auncient Histories?</p>

slye meaning, and an humble minde, a couered crafte: but so I hope hath not your mistris.</p>
