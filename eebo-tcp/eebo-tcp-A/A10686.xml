            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That Sunday Night, led by their deepe Deuotions,</l>
               <l>Three hundred Persons were assembled there,</l>
               <l>Of diuers Sects, sundry Degrees and Nations,</l>
               <l>Some English, Scottish, Welch, and Irish were,</l>
               <l>Prepar'd (it seemes) a Sermon for to heare,</l>
               <l>Which there a Iesuite was to solemnize,</l>
               <l>One <hi>Drury</hi> fitted to that Exercise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And hauing Crost himselfe in publike view,</l>
               <l>He enters straight the Chayre and Preaching-place,</l>
               <l>The people yeeld him reuerence, as was due,</l>
               <l>And to his Sermon numbers flock'd apace,</l>
               <l>He being (with them) a Man of chiefest grace;</l>
               <l>Who there his Text did open and vnfold,</l>
               <l>Shewing such doctrines as their Church did hold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus while he Preacht, deliuering forth at large</l>
               <l>Such Points of strange Beliefe as they are taught,</l>
               <l>The Peoples waight the Chamber did surcharge,</l>
               <l>Which breaking downe their sad Confusion wrought</l>
               <l>When of this Accident they neuer thought:</l>
               <l>The Chamber full three Stories from the ground,</l>
               <l>Which brast in sunder with a hideous sound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And when the vpper Floore that first did breake,</l>
               <l>Fals on the second, where they hop't to stay;</l>
               <l>Yet on the sudden ere a man could speake,</l>
               <l>They on the ground all bruiz'd and smothered lay,</l>
               <l>Some stifled vp with Lome, Stones, Dust, and Clay:</l>
               <l>And some for helpe and succour loudly calling,</l>
               <l>All broken, bruizd, and mangled in their falling.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Husband cries out, Oh my louing wife,</l>
               <l>The Wife cries out, Oh saue my Husband deare,</l>
               <l>The Father cries, Would I had lost my life,</l>
               <l>His Childrens woes doe touch his heart so neare,</l>
               <l>All things so rufull, dreadfull, doe appeare:</l>
               <l>Thus Tyrant death with his all-peircing dart,</l>
               <l>Acts many a fatall Scoene, and bloudy part.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Brother bids the Sister quite adue,</l>
               <l>The Sister cries, Farewell my louing Brother,</l>
               <l>The Infants losse doth make the mother rue,</l>
               <l>The Child cries out, Oh where's my carefull Mother?</l>
               <l>All these (alas) stones, lyme, and timber smother.</l>
               <l>Yea many there which on their friends had gazed,</l>
               <l>Yet knew them not, they were so much amazed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Seruant cries, Oh I haue lost my Master,</l>
               <l>The Master for his Seruant doth complaine,</l>
               <l>The faithfull Friend laments his Friends disaster,</l>
               <l>Wishing that for his sake himselfe were slaine:</l>
               <l>Thus teares gush out on euery side amaine.</l>
               <l>Some swound with feare, vnable for to speake,</l>
               <l>Which might a Christians heart with sorrow break.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus some were buried vp aliue in dust,</l>
               <l>Some mangled, bruized, wounded with the fall,</l>
               <l>Some brain'd with Timber, some in pieces crusht,</l>
               <l>Of those that scap'd the number was but small;</l>
               <l>A fearfull Doome and Summons to vs All:</l>
               <l>Calling vs to repentance many wayes,</l>
               <l>Considering well the shortnesse of our dayes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O Lord defend thy Church and Common-weale,</l>
               <l>Maintaine thy Gospell free in this our Land,</l>
