            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, and hath been long time a question more enquired into vpon occasion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soundly weyed for the good of Gods Church, whether there be any moe waies of right handling the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then one? and if there bee, which is the best thereof? The solution whereunto (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the infinite varietie of preaching among vs Englishmen more then in all the Churches of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides) hath been, that there are indeed diuers manners of preaching, which may all be profitably vsed for the edification of the bodie of Christ. But if the practise of many be well weyed, it will easily appeare (supposing that there be diuers) that we haue been very carelesse to enquire after the best and to vse it. For, whilest some giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vpon the least occasion, to enter into a common place of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and to handle it most largely (which is the right way in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising and laying the foundations of Religion) and others labour to shewe themselues learned in the tongues, and humaine Artes, or of great reading in diuine and heathen writers, we see that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is brought either into such amazednesse, as they thinke that any thing may be made of the Scriptures, or to such an vnsetlednesse in iudgement, as they rather hunt after varietie of teachers for their straunge manner of preaching, then for sound instruction for their owne edification. How this sore may bee cured, I will not take vpon me precisely to say, for it is easier rightly to espie a fault, then to shew the way to amend it, and it may be that there is not one, but diuers causes of this enormitie, some whereof are growne to such vlcers, as may not without danger be touched. Onely I will be bold to say some thing to the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded before, not so much striuing whether there be diuers kinds of teaching, as labouring to shew such away as
<pb facs="tcp:19537:3"/>
must needes be the best and most profitable. First therefore we are to know that the end wherefore Christ Iesus when he ascended into heauen, and leading captiuitie captiue gaue guifts vnto men, was for the edification of the bodie of Christ, <hi>Eph. 4. 12.</hi> that is, to build vp Gods people in the true knowledge of his holy word, and so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in the faith, and reforme them in their liues. Now to the end that this may be done, I suppose euery one will confesse first, that the workman whom God hath fitted to this great worke, must be that scribe taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, which is like vnto the housholder that bringeth out of his treasurie things both old and new, <hi>Matth 13. 52.</hi> that is, furnished with al kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge meet to expresse Gods will to his people in most effectuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Then it cannot be denied that, seeing it is onely the word of God that can perswade the conscience, the first thing that is to be done in the right teaching of the same to Gods people, must needes be, the cleere and euident deliuerance of the sense of the text in hand; that out of the same, as from a fountaine that runneth cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all that he is further to deliuer may be seene to be deriued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, seeing what soeuer was written aforetime was written for our learning, <hi>Rom. 15. 4.</hi> it must needes be that euery sentence of the holy Scripture containeth in it (at least) one generall doctrine; and therefore the sense being once vnderstood, the next thing that is to be considered, is, the collecting of the same out of the text, in such plaine and manifest manner, as must needes be acknowledged in the conscience of the hearers to be so; which being enlarged by the examples and testimonies of the Scriptures, and manifested by the force of reason grounded vpon the same, must needes take such roote in the consciences of the hearers, as they shall either bee throughly perswaded of the trueth of it (if it be rightly and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually handled) or leaue such a print therein as shall conuince the same. Thirdly, seeing the generall doctrine is like vnto goodly meat set vpon the table before young children, which needeth to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto them, that euery one may haue his portion in due season, <hi>Mat. 24. 45.</hi> Therefore is the right vse to be propounded vnto them of the same doctrine, that it may appeare how it is profitable, either for all Christians in general, or for certaine special ones in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This is that which the Apostle meaneth when he saith, that the whole scripture is profitable to teach, (that is, to learne doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:19537:3"/>
out of it, and not onely so, but also) to improue, (that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all errors contrary to wholsome doctrine) to correct, (that is, to reproue the mishehauiours of them that walke disorderedly) <hi>To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in righteousnes,</hi> (that is, to direct Gods people in all the wayes of godlinesse) <hi>2. Tim. 3. 16.</hi> yea and to arme vs with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and comfort in all kindes of trouble, <hi>Rom. 15. 4.</hi> This course being taken by the Preacher shall not onely free him from the slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of running out of his text, but also be so profitable for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, as experience shall prooue this kind of teaching to bee such as is not iustly to be excepted against. But is not this (will some say) a great iniurie offered vnto others that preach after another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shton, and a straightning of the giftes of Gods spirit which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, to some thus, and to others thus, and yet by the same spirite wrought to the edification of the Church of Christ? I answere, first, as concerning men, let them be assured that they haue awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the word, and aperswasion in their hearts, that the care of Gods glory and desire of edifiyng his people did lead them to their maner that they vse, and then is all this nothing against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for them. Secondly, the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of one kind of teaching as most profitable, doth no way bound the spirit of God further then it hath pleased the Lord to limite himself by the rules of his own word. I confesse that God giueth vnto diuers men diuers measures, and to some to excell in one thing, and to some in others, for one hath an excellent dexteritie in interpreting the text; another can in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner gather doctrines; another exceedeth in application, but let it be considered that all these are branches of that method hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto commended vnto vs: so that, whosoeuer is endued with speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ability and facilitie in one of these, must labour also to performe the other aright, and not to account it a course different from his owne, further then that one doth his duetie in greater measure, and in a higher degree then another. Yet would I not so be vnderstood, as though I did affirme it of necessitie to gather euery doctrine at all times that the text may afforde, or out of euery doctrine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue both matter of reproofe, correction, instruction, patience, and comfort. For albe it I doe not doubt but that the word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as God himselfe is, infinitely rich euen in euery sentence for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery branch of edification: yet seeing the deuiding of the worde of
<pb facs="tcp:19537:4"/>
God aright, is the wisdome of the wise steward to dispence the same in due season, it belongeth to the teacher to see what is most meete &amp; expedient that way, who shall often discerne apparant necessitie to stand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, when there is as euident reason to omit, or, at least, not to vrge or enlarge the other: and therefore as it is a sure grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for the hearer to learne to discerne of and chuse his teacher by his abilitie and dexteritie in expounding the text, and gathering the doctrines out of the same; so is it hardly within his power to iudge either of his choyse of doctrines or of the vse and application that he maketh (so that he vse none but that which is found and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the text) sauing so farre as concerneth his owne edification in particular. This I am sure of (for I haue seene it in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) that the want of this way in the teacher is the cause that he often thinketh his text so barren, as hee is glad to runne into by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to fill vp his time, and so maketh his labour as water spilt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a stone that neuer profiteth any, and the want of power to see who handle the word of God aright, and grace to vse their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie ordinarilie, is the cause, not onely of the gadding of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (where they may easily come to varietie of teachers) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the rents and distractions that so many fall vsually into; for if they had been seasoned with that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly teaching which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ministerie of him that deuideth the word of GOD aright, doth afforde, not onely their iudgements would haue been better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to discerne the spirit of error when it is tendred vnto them, but also this wandering and confused kind of teaching that many do vse, would haue seemed vnsauorie vnto them.</p>
            <p>But my purpose is not, either to set downe any directions for the preacher, or to prescribe a course for the hearer, saue onely to shew, and that briefly, such a way as is proued by experience to bee most comfortable for the minister, seeing his labour thereby to be blessed, and not to be in vaine, and most profitable to the hearer, who shall thereby attaine to the greatest measure of knowledge and soundnes of iudgement. Now (because examples are the most easie way of teaching) I with the comfortable assistance of another brother, (who when this booke commeth to his hands may see his share in the trauaile therof) hauing occasion to goe thorough the two first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of these Lamentations, and the most parte of the third, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the method and matter might be not altogether vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:19537:4"/>
vnto others: and therefore I reuiewed the chiefe notes that we had collected from the larger discourse therof, and adding thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other two chapters haue set the whole downe in such manner as thou seest. The particulars, I confesse, as they bee set downe, are farre more briefe then when they were spoken, and more short then is meete to be vsed many publike ministerie, or expected by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different auditorie (for why should I trouble the Reader with large discourses in that which may as wel be expressed in short sentences?) seeing I haue laboured to abridge rather then to enlarge any thing, which will be as profitable to the Reader of any tolerable vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as if euery thing were amplified to the vttermost. For as to a Musitian that hath so much skill as to knowe the concords and rules of descant, it is as good a direction to haue the ground, as if he had euery seuerall poynt pricked out vnto him, seeing hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured with the manner of deuision vpon euery poynt according as it falleth out in the ground: so to him that is any thing well qualified either with the gift of teaching, beeing a minister, or of hearing with iudgement and discretion being a priuate person, this short handling of these chapters may be as plaine a direction vnto him as if euery poynt were amply enlarged.</p>
            <p>To conclude, that thou mayst the better perceiue and reape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by this present exposition, vnderstand that in al things I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for breuitie: and therfore it may peraduenture seem somwhat obscure, especially seeing how the doctrines are gathered out of the text is seldome set downe; yet for the better direction therin I haue expressed in another character the words, or at least some part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with &amp;c. out of which it doth arise. I am somwhat more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the two first chapters, then in the rest; partly because the same things did often occurre, and that now and then in the selfe same wordes; and partly that it may appeare what varietie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of matter is contayned in the holy scriptures; and yet where the greatest plenty is expressed, I haue not set downe all the doctrines that my selfe could haue collected, much lesse that which the text in it selfe contayned: for who can draw that fountain drie, which is bottomlesse? this I doe therefore say, that euery man, who either hath the calling to teach the word of God vnto his people, or prepareth himselfe to be furnished thereunto, when the Lord of the

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> GEnerallie out of the whole verse. God often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the outward estate of his Church in this <note place="margin">1</note> world. The truth of this doctrine appeareth, not only by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19537:13"/>
examples of the scripture, especiallie in the Israelites and the Apostles; but also the stories of latter times and euen by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie experience. The causes moouing him thereunto are; first, that he might dailie declare himselfe the disposer and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all things: secondlie, to take from vs (that doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie settle our affections in the earth) all occasion of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selues any certaintie heere. The vse of this doctrine is; first, to prepare our selues to all conditions, whether pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie or aduersitie, sicknes or health. &amp;c. according to the example of the Apostle <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. 12. for else it is certaine that affliction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vpon vs, will be most grieuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. Secondlie, to teach vs to settle our affections vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heauen and the things that leade thereunto, which is a most certaine anchor-holde, and will neuer faile vs, as this world will doe, euen in the most excellent things thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [How]</hi> the maner of the speech teacheth this <note place="margin">2</note> doctrine. It is our duetie to striue with our selues to bee affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the miseries of Gods people. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 28. 29. The reason hereof is; for that we are fellow-members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die whereof Christ is the head. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25. 26 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The vse of this doctrine is; first, to reproue them that seeke onelie for their owne good, not respecting the state of their brethren. Secondlie, to teach vs to put on tender compassion and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (according to our callings) to profite the whole church of God and euerie member thereof: els cannot we assure our selues to bee liuelie members of that bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [was]</hi> God giueth sometimes vnto his church <note place="margin">3</note> an outward estate that flourisheth both in wealth and peace. This appeareth in the example of this people, especiallie in the time of <hi>Solomon</hi> and other kings after him. The reasons hereof are; First, that he might giue his people a taste, euen of all kinde of earthly blessings. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 2. <hi>&amp;c. Psal.</hi> 84. 11. Secondly, that they might haue all oportunitie to serue him, and euery kinde of encouragement thereunto. The vse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is; first, to reproue the follie of Fryers and Iesuites that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a continual voluntary pouerty, and afflicting of their own bodies, seeing euery me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is to be partaker of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19537:14"/>
blessings that God bestoweth vpon his church. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it confuteth the opinion of them that thinke the Church of God to be alwaies vnder the crosse outwardly. Thirdly, it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to prayse the Lord that vseth all kinde of meanes to manifest his loue vnto his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which praise must be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by vs if we enioie any share of this outward prosperitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [remaine solitarie that was, &amp;c.]</hi> The outward <note place="margin">4</note> flourishing estate of Gods Church lasteth not alwaies, but is often changed into affliction and aduersity. This appeareth by the whole course of the scriptures: for the reason and causes hereof see the first doctrine. The vse is; to teach vs, to make the time of our peace most profitable vnto vs, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vs in the waies of godlinesse; else, in aduersitie wee either fall away, or at least the burthen will seeme intolerable vnto vs as wee see it is to such as promise to themselues continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prosperitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine, [solitarie, ful, &amp;c.]</hi> God often changeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">5</note> of his seruants in this life, from one extreame to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: examples hereof; <hi>Ioseph,</hi> from imprisonment to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of a Prince. <hi>Iob,</hi> from great riches and honour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pouertie and reproach; the Israelites from intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruitude in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to the most renoumed amongst the Nations. The reasons of it are, First, that his mightie power might appeare to all the world, especiallie to his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, that we may learne to ascribe all vnto his Maiestie, and nothing to our selues or any other.

Secondly, the godlie haue alwaies (especially in the dayes of their humiliation by fasting and prayer) been brought thereunto, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12.

This appeareth manifestly by the examples of all ages and euen by daily experience. The reason is, because, the enemy seeketh to please himself in sinne, and to suppresse all goodnes, as being a hinderance thereunto: but the godlie is of a contrarie disposition. The vse is, to teach vs to mourne when the Lord giueth the enemies of the trueth the vpper hand against the godlie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [aduersaries chiefe &amp;c.]</hi> It oftentimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to <note place="margin">2</note> passe that the wicked prosper in all things of this life, and the godly contrarie. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 4. <hi>&amp;c. Iob.</hi> 21. 7. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, God wil by giuing them prosperitie make the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked without excuse. Secondly, the godly being assured of Gods fauour and yet pinched, they may the more earnestlie bend their affections to the enheritance which is prepared for them. The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to admire too much the successe of wordlings: secondly, to assure vs that, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state cannot last long, and therfore to teach vs patience, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 18. 24.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [aduersaries enemies]</hi> the hebrew wordes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie properly, oppressors and haters: teaching vs, that it is the <note place="margin">3</note> naturall disposition of the wicked towards the godly, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse them in action and hate them in affection: this hath appeared true in all ages. The reason is, because of the vnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaseable malice of <hi>Sathan</hi> and the wicked his instrumentes against the godly. The vse is, to teach vs, first, how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of all that are enemies to religion, though they cary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19537:19"/>
neuer so faire a shew of frendship to vs: secondly, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that we walke wiselie towards them, neuer prouoking them, and yet neuer giuing anie aduantage to them against vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [for the Lord &amp;c]</hi> The wicked neuer preuaile against the godly, further then the Lord giueth strength vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">4</note> them, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 11. 12. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 31. 32. The reason is, because, all power is of God, and euerie one of his creatures haue their bounds giuen them of him, which they cannot passe. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to feare man but God, from whome his power commeth: secondly, to labour to be at one with the Lord, and then shall all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures worke to our good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Psalme.</hi> 91. 1.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [the Lord hath &amp;c]</hi> In all our afflictions we must <note place="margin">5</note> not looke to the instruments but to the Lord that smiteth by them. The godly haue euer done so. <hi>Ioh</hi> 1, 21. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 28. The reason is, because, they haue no power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, except it be giuen them from aboue, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19. 11. The vse is to teach vs, first, to bee more patient towards the instruments, and not to be as the dogg that snatcheth at the stone cast at him, not regarding the thrower. Secondly, to seeke the cause of our afflictions in our selues; for els the iust Iudge of the world would not correct vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [afflicted her &amp;c]</hi> All our afflictions come from <note place="margin">6</note> the Lord, who is the chiefe worker thereof. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, all power is in his hand. The vse is to teach vs, in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, heauinesse, &amp;c. not to seeke vnto the Phisitian, Musicke or such like; but first vnto the Lord by true repentance, and then to these as second causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [for the &amp;c]</hi> It is the sinne of the godly that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <note place="margin">7</note> the Lord to lay all their troubles vpon them; so hath the Church euer confessed. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. The vse is to teach vs, first, how horrible sinne is in Gods sight, that causeth him to correct so seuerelie those that he loueth so dearely: &amp; therefore we must hate it with a perfect hatred. Secondly, whensoeuer we are afflicted to examine our selues, and finding out our sinnes, repent therof and leaue them; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19537:19"/>
which time (if God loue vs) he will neuer leaue smiting of vs.</p>

[multitude]</hi> when God withdraweth his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth <note place="margin">8</note> from his seruants they fall into many grieuous sinnes, one in the necke of another: so did <hi>Dauid,</hi> from adulterie to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Vriah</hi> drunke, after to murther him: and <hi>Peter,</hi> first to deny his maister: then to forsweare him: after to curse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe if euer he knew him. The reason is, because we haue no custody of our selues. The vse is, to teach vs, to labor to keep a good conscience in euery thing, lest we fall from sinne to sinne, and at length make conscience of nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [her children]</hi> when God meaneth to punish <note place="margin">9</note> man, he will not spare to depriue him of that which is most deare vnto him. The reason is, because, the Lord meaneth to humble him sufficiently. The vse is, to teach vs, that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Lord dealeth so with vs, it is because of the hardnes of our harts that otherwise wil not be thorowly softned; and therefore to take it patiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [are gone &amp;c]</hi> The wicked beare such malice <note place="margin">10</note> vnto the truth, that when they get aduantage, they spare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age, nor sex, thinking to roote out the godly from vnder heauen. The reason is, as <hi>Doctr.</hi> 3. The vse is, not to thinke our selues forsaken of God, though we should fall into the hands of such spoilers, seeing it hath been the lot of his dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren heretofore.</p>

[her beautie]</hi> The Church of God doth esteeme <note place="margin">1</note> the exercises of religion the most excellent and glorious thing that can be had in this life.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19537:20"/>
there is more true comfort in them, then in the whole worlde besides. The vse is, to teach vs to esteeme them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly (if we wil prooue our selues liuely members of the Church of God) and to be more grieued with the losse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (if they be taken from vs) then of all worldly blessings whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [her Princes]</hi> the weakning of the Rulers is the <note place="margin">2</note> height of miserie vpon the rest of the members of that body. The reason is, for that without the strength and authority of the gouernours, the rest are exposed to the violence of all their enemies, and contrary. The vse is to teach vs, to pray heartely for them, and to maintaine their strength and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the vttermost, that vnder their winges we may finde shelter against the iniuries of our enemies, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wil spoyle vs.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> That people hath a heauie iudgement vpon <note place="margin">3</note> them, whose guides are destitute, and depriued of necessary courage. The reason is, because their authoritie and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lead the rest (as we see in Magistrates and ministers) which otherwise are easily quailed in any good thing. The vse is, to teach vs to pray vnto God that our magistrates and ministers may neuer want courage to do as they should, and to bewayle the want of it wheresoeuer it appeareth.</p>

Secondly, they should haue been guides and examples of all goodnesse to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, but prooue (often) cleane contrary. The vse is to teach vs, first, how vaine a thing it is for a man of authoritie or wealth, to promise to himselfe any immunity of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment because thereof. Secondly, that the more we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with outward priuiledges, the more carefully wee ought to take heede to our wayes, lest our iudgement proue heauier then it should haue been if we had been of meaner condition.</p>

[remembred]</hi> the time of aduersity is fit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may best recount the prosperity that in former times <note place="margin">2</note> we haue enioyed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [did mocke]</hi> It is a certaine note of an enemie to religion, to mocke and deride the exercises of the same: the <note place="margin">5</note> reason is, because, their inward disposition is manifested by their outward behauiour. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our loue to the trueth, by our reuerence that we yeeld to the exercises thereof: secondly, to knowe them for ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the trueth, that scorne the same, and to shun them: thirdly, to learne to mourne when we see the mouth of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy opened to reproach the trueth and professors thereof. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

[hath sinned]</hi> their sinnes the cause of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, being againe mentioned vnto them, teacheth this <note place="margin">1</note> doctrine. It is necessary whensoeuer we are afflicted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count often, our sinnes to haue procured the same to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs: the reason is, because, first, we are naturally vnwilling to blame our selues for any thing, and ready to impute the cause of any euill to others. Examples, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah, Gen.</hi> 3. 12. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, if we rightlie charge our selues and our sinnes, we shall be the better prepared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to true repentance, and right humiliation.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19537:21"/>
to teach vs to vse all good meanes to drawe vs to be rightly humbled when we feele any of Gods rods vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [therefore]</hi> it is peculiar to the godlie to impute the cause of all their miseries vnto their owne sinnes; whereas <note place="margin">2</note> the wicked doe either lay the cause vpon other things, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate their fault, blaming God of rigour; or else breake out into raging impatience or blasphemie. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the godlie haue Gods spirit to teach them to iudge rightlie of themselues; the wicked are led by <hi>Sathans</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and iudge according to their owne sensuall and brutish conceites. The vse is, to teach vs, earnestly to pray vnto the Lord alwaies to guide vs by the light of his spirit, else shall we be sure to mistake euerie thing to our owne destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [driuen away]</hi> it is our sinne that depriueth vs of <note place="margin">3</note> anie good thing that we haue heretofore enioyed. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, God created vs (as al other his creatures) exceeding good, and placed vs in a certen and happie estate in all things; which we first lost by sinne and so doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie: secondlie, anie kind of griefe is the peculiar fruite of sin. The vse is, to teach vs, to acknowledg this in euerie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; as when we are depriued of inward comfort, outward peace, health, wealth, libertie, or any other good thing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining either to the soule or the bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [honored her]</hi> when we truelie feare and serue the Lord, he honoreth vs in the sight of men. 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 2. 30. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, <note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham, Ioseph, Dauid &amp;c.</hi> we see the same also in often experience. The reason, first, that it may appeare, that godlinesse is not without her reward euen in this life: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to giue a tast vnto the godly heere, of that honor which they shall once enioy without measure or end. The vse is, to teach vs, to praise GOD highlie when such a blessing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon our selues or anie of our brethren, and not to be proud of it, as the wicked are of those good things that they doe enioy.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19537:22"/>
to teach vs, to be so carefull to leaue our sinnes and walke in the waies of the Lord, as we are desirous of estimation, and to auoid contempt among men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [honored her, despise her]</hi> the estimation that <note place="margin">6</note> the godlie haue among wordlings, is onely whilest they are in outward prosperitie. The reason is, because they doo not esteeme them for those spirituall graces that are in them, (which they haue no tast of) but that outward applause that goeth withthem, which being gone, the cause why they liked them is gone also. The vse is to teach vs, not to make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the fauour or friendship of earthlie minded men, seeing there is no certeintie in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, because, <hi>Sathan</hi> blindeth them in their owne estate, lest they should see it and repent: and imployeth their mindes wholie in prying into, and carping at the faultes of others. The vse is, first, to teach vs, that it is not possible to hide our sinnes from the Lord, seeing that not onelie our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, but <hi>Sathan</hi> and wicked men can find them out, and accuse vs of them. Secondly, to make vs verie warie how we walke in the sight of the vngodlie, seeing they are so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in finding out our faultes, and so wide-mouthed in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of them to the dishonor of our holy profession.</p>

                  <hi>Drctrine. [filthinesse] heb:</hi> nakednesse. There is nothing that maketh man so filthilie naked as sinne. The reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <note place="margin">8</note> first, it depriueth him of all those graces that did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne him in the sight of God and men: secondly, it maketh him as if he wallowed in the most stinking and filthie mire that may be found out. The vse is to teach vs, to hate it in all men, but especiallie in our selues with a perfect hatred, euen more then the Deuill of hell himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [sigheth]</hi> the godly doo take to hart with earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est affection the crosses that the Lord laieth vpon them. The <note place="margin">9</note> reason is, because, first, they esteeme them to come from the Lords hand, and therefore may not regard them lightlie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19537:22"/>
they iudge their sinnes to haue angred his maiestie and procured him to smite them, which must needes greatlie grieue them. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that in the hardnesse of their hartes, passe ouer their afflictions lighlie. Secondly, to teach vs, to labour to be seriouslie affected with our afflictions, els shall we neuer profite by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [backward]</hi> the godlie are sometimes brought <note place="margin">10</note> into so hard estate, as that they are in mans iudgment vtterly depriued of all the signes of Gods fauour. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first of their sinnes against the Lord that haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the same: secondly, that they may learne to know their misery, if they be left to themselues: thirdly, to trie their faith, constancy, and patience, &amp;c. The vse is; to teach vs, first, to looke for many great and grieuous extremities, and not to wonder at them as vnwoonted things, seeing the godly haue felt them before vs: secondly, not to dispaire, though in reason al hope of recouery be past, seeing God vseth to bring light out of darkenesse, and to helpe his when they seeme to be vtterly forlorne.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [her filthinesse, &amp;c.]</hi> In that a confession of sinnes is set before petition of fauour, we learne this doctrine; <note place="margin">1</note> whensoeuer wee beg release from sinne or the punishments thereof at the hands of God, it is necessary to begin with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our sinnes. So did the godly vsually, <hi>Psalme</hi> 32. 5.

                  <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reason is; first, that by recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our sinnes, our hearts may be the better stirred vp to pray feruently. Secondly, that our owne confession may iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Lord in punishing vs: Thirdly, that it may appeare that we are rightly humbled and truely penitent; which if we be not, we will be more ashamed to confesse our sinnes then to commit them. The vse is; first, to reprooue them, that either Pharisaically stand vpon their owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or hide their sinnes, thinking the confession thereof needlesse: secondly, it sheweth that those that be ignorant of Gods worde (which onely teacheth the right confession of sinnes) cannot pray aright. Thirdly, it teacheth vs alwaies before we pray (if we looke to be heard) to enter into a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration of our sinnes, that wee may the more thoughly acknowledge them.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [skirtes]</hi> this being their estate, and yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <note place="margin">2</note> the true visible Church of God, teacheth vs this doctrine: foule spots and grosse sinnes may be in the face of a true visible Church. The reason is, because, first, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may remaine though much corruption, both in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and life be builded thereupon; as was in the Churches of the <hi>Iewes, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Gallatia:</hi> and secondly, because the life and being of a Church is the faith in the couenant of grace through Christ Iesus, which may remaine entire though there be many wants and corruptions; euen as a man may, and ought to be esteemed a man so long as he hath life in him, though he be both lame, deformed, and want a leg or an arme, &amp;c. The vse is, first, to confute their opinion which be called Brownists, who iudge the Churches of England no churches of God, because they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t some things they should haue, and haue diuers corruptions still retayned in them. Secondly, to teach vs, that it is not sufficient to be of the visible Church, except we labour to be partakers of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God bestowed therupon, lest we be found such rotten members as (when the day of tryall commeth) shall be cut off and cast into the fire.</p>

were thus wicked, &amp; yet were a true visible Church and had the dayly vse of the outward exercises of religion; we learne this doctrine: To be within the visible Church of God, and to be partakers of all the outward exercises of religion, is not surficient to lead vs to a godly dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without the inward grace of gods spirit, nor to proue vs true Christians without fayth and sanctification. The reason is, because, first, these outward meanes are but the instruments which God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to whome he will; else are they of no force, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. &amp;c. Secondly, many are in the Church as chaffe in the barne floore, and Cockle in the field, that are not of the Church: and therefore shall be gathered out, bound in a bundle, and throwne into the fire. The vse is, to teach vs that it is a vaine thing for vs to say, I am a professor, wee haue a famous Church, &amp;c. and in the meane while liue a prophane and wicked life. Secondly, to make vs carefull to heare, learne and professe the trueth with an earnest care, and hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God that wee may beleeue it and liue according to it.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [in her skirts]</hi> They that beleeue not Gods ministers, exhorting them to repentance (which was the <note place="margin">4</note> case of these Iewes, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.) grow into the most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse of sinne of all others. The reason is; because, first, the word is either the sauour of life to amend, or of death to make worse all that heare it, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 15. &amp;c. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God in his righteous iudgement giueth ouer those that regarde not the trueth into a reprobate minde, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all wickednesse with greedinesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. 2. <hi>Thessalo.</hi> 2. 10. The vse is, first, to shew vnto vs that the horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse that is in many that professe the trueth, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the profession (as wicked ones doe blaspheme) but because they neglect the profession, sauing to make it a cloake for their wickednesse. Secondly, to teach vs with trembling and feare to labour to walke worthy our calling, else shall it be easier for <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the day of account, then for vs.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:19537:24"/>
those things which continuall experience, and the light of reason doe dayly call to remembrance. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, the dayly custome of things without grace to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme them aright, breedeth contempt of them in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. Secondly, Sathan blindeth the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, lest they should rightly regard good things and profite by them. The vse is, to teach vs, first, in what fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full estate they be, that growe full with, and are wearie of good things, such as are the hearing of the word of GOD, prayer to God, dayly meditation in the law of the Lord &amp;c. Secondly, to labour with our selues to haue these and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods ordinances and worke, euery day in more high reuerence then other, and not to neglect the due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them if they be ordinarie.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [remembred not]</hi> The forgetfulnesse of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of sinne throweth men headlong into iniquitie, but <note place="margin">6</note> the remembrance of it stayeth vs from many euils, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 16. 8. The reason is, because, the affections haue no whoe, when nothing is respected but the satisfying of them, whereas the waying of the desire by the euent of it, maketh vpright iudgement the ruler of the action. The vse is, to teach vs in al things that we purpose to take in hand, euer to remember that we must be called to account for it, before that most righteous Iudge, which will iudge of vs by the rules of his most holy word.</p>

[wonderfully]</hi> according to the maner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <note place="margin">8</note> of sinne, so is the punishment from the Lord for the same, when he visiteth the committers thereof for it. The reason is, that Gods anger against sinne, and his Iustice in punishing it, might the better appeare. The vse is, to teach vs to looke for Gods heauie hand vpon vs (except we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent) whensoeuer we giue our selues to delight in sinne, or to waxe colde in goodnesse.</p>

[O Lord behold mine affliction]</hi> the only refuge in <note place="margin">9</note> distresse, is to flie to the Lord by faythfull &amp; feruent prayer: the reason is, because, first, he it is that smiteth, and none else can heale. <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, he hath promised to heare and deliuer vs, calling vpon him in the day of our troubles, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that repyne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, waxe impatient, or vse vnlawfull meanes to winde themselues out of their troubles. Secondly, to teache vs, in all our distresses to labour our owne hearts, that we may pray vnto the Lord for his grace to deliuer vs, and in the meane while for strength to support vs.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> This prayer being made by the Prophet in the <note place="margin">10.</note> name of the people, teacheth vs this doctrine. It is a great blessing of God to that people that hath a minister, who is both able and willing, not onely to teach them the truth, but also to be their mouth in praier to direct them. The reason is, because, first, very few of the people (though otherwise well affected) are able to conceiue prayer, and vtter the same rightly: secondly, the ministerie is Gods ordinance, not onely to teach his will to vs, but also to offer our supplications vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; which he hath promised to regarde in speciall maner. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that make no account of the ministerie, or in the pride of their heart, thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as able to these duties as the minister is. Secondly, to teach vs to praise God for it, as for an exceeding treasure, if we haue such a minister set ouer vs; if he be remooued to vse all good meanes to haue him restored, or if that cannot be, to seeke out such another, by whose labours wee may bee builded vp in those good things that the former hath begun in vs.</p>

euer. The vse is to teach vs, first, to magnifie the great and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable mercies of the Lord our God. Secondly, neuer to dispayre though our estate be most miserable, but alwaies to be assured that his mercy shal preuaile against al our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ad an end vnto them, &amp; to giue vs euerlasting peace.</p>

Secondly, Sathan ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to abuse all Gods blessings to their greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

The reason is; because, first, the Lord vseth the wicked as a rodde to scourge his people, and not as a tormenter to tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them. Secondly, God doth euer resist the proude, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 51. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 18. 27. The vse is to teach vs, first, in all our prayers against the enemies of the trueth, to alleage their pride vnto the Lord, as a reason to moue him to heare vs; for so did the godly euer vse to doe. <hi>Isay</hi> 37. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to assure our selues, that when the enemy groweth to the height of pride his fall cannot be farre off. <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 16. 15. and therefore with patience to waite vpon the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, because of their vnmeasurable malice against them, and their exceeding desire to extinguish their memorie from being a people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 83. 4. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to trust the wicked, nor be familiar with them though they speake neuer so kindlie to vs. Secondly, to bee carefull to walke warily before them, left the get aduantage against vs: thirdly, to pray dailie and earnestly to the Lord to deliuer vs from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [vpon all her &amp;c.]</hi> the outward things of this world are vncertaine and made subject to the violence of the wicked (yea euen appearing members of the Church, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. 8. 9.) the reason is, because, first, earthly things are giuen by the Lord indifferently to the godly and the wicked; which maketh them vncertaine vnto any Secondly, outward things are not within the compasse of those blessings that God hath assured his people to enioy. Thirdly, God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Sathan great power in this world; who setteth his seruants on worke, to spoyle all that are not of his Kingdome. The vse is, first, not to desire the things of this lise too much. So did Christ teach vs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. 34. <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 33. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to learne when God giueth them vnto vs, to employ them aright, so shall we haue comfort with them and without them.</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, God will shew himselfe the punisher of man euen in the things that he abuseth: secondly, that it may appeare that God regardeth more the punishment of euill,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19537:26"/>
then the preseruation of his word, blessings, and ordinances. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that holinesse standeth not in any outward thing that man can take away, for true godlinesse cannot be shaken by men nor angels. Secondly, that GOD can saue his people without meanes when it pleaseth him to deny them the meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [she hath seene]</hi> the iniuries that the wicked do <note place="margin">4</note> vnto the godlie in their sight, are more grieuous vnto them then those that they do only heare of. The reason is, because, that which the sight (being the quickest of the sences) bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the minde, hath deepest impressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therein of al others. The vse is, to teach vs (seeing it was the case of this people) to take patientlie whatsoeuer outward extremitie, the Lord giueth the wicked power to lay vpon vs; yea though it bee death it selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is; because, first, they are set on worke by <hi>Sathan,</hi> that with greatest violence seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ouerthrow of all good things: secondly, they be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie minded and cannot fauour any spirituall things. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to discerne in those that take such courses, the wickednes of mans nature and the horrible prophanation that <hi>Sathan</hi> bringeth the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into. Secondly, to learne to esteeme and handle all holy things most reuerently; else shall we not differ from these wicked ones.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. and 84. 1. <hi>&amp;c. Nehem.</hi> 1. 4. The reason is, because, first, they proceed from him whose actions in all things they esteeme most holie: secondly, they are the meanes that the Lord vouchsafeth to make most comfortable to his seruants. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to know them to be of no religion, that do not holilie vse these meanes. Secondly, to trie our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19537:26"/>
selues what measure of Gods feare and his true religion is in vs, by examining our selues what measure of loue and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we yeeld to his ordinances appointed to that vse.</p>

The reason, because, first, it is Gods ordinance so to doe, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 6. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, it maketh much for the preseruation of the Church in sound doctrine and innocencie of conuersation; both which will decay if this be neglected. The vse is, first, to reproue them that thinke there should be no separation, but that all indifferentlie should be receiued into the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faithfull. Secondly, to declare vnto vs how farre the professed wicked ones are from hauing (without repentance) any portion of that heauenlie <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the Church in earth, wherein yet manie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine that shall neuer be saued <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, to teach vs, so carefull as we are, to haue Gods Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the members thereof in particular preserued in good estate, to be so diligent (yet keeping within the compasse of our callings) to labour the amendment, or the casting out of all heretiques and irreligious persons.</p>

blessings: secondly, they are necessary to support vs heere, and (being well vsed) to make vs the fitter to serue him. The vse is, first, to reproue the Stoicklike opinion of them, that thinke we should not be moued with the losse of outward things. Secondly, to teach vs, as in the aboundance of earthly things, to acknowledge Gods large mercies, so in the losse or want of them to confesse our sinnes and Gods displeasure vpon vs for the same, and therefore to lament.</p>

The reason is, because, first, it is the most precious of all earthly things, they being giuen for the vse of it, and not it for them. Secondly, God hath giuen greater charge to preserue it then them. The vse is to teach vs, to vse all lawfull meanes for the preseruation of our life, that wee may imploy it to Gods glory and the good of his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [see O Lord and, &amp;c.]</hi> Their example teacheth <note place="margin">3</note> vs, that in all our miseries we must seeke reliefe only at Gods hands. The reason is, because, first, he hath so commaunded, <hi>Psal</hi> 50. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, all power to helpe is in his hands alone. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 6. without whose blessing all meanes doe vtterly fayle. The vse is, first, to reproue them that seeke to be relieued by Saints, Angels, or any other in Heauen then God alone. Also them that seeming to seeke onely to the true God, doe vse vnlawfull meanes to haue his help, as by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers, Witches, or such like. Secondly, to teach vs in all our distresses to seeke onely to the Lord, and that alone by such lawfull meanes, as he hath warranted in his word.</p>

[I am become vile]</hi> the contempt that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">5</note> of God be of in the eyes of the wicked, being alleaged in prayer vnto the Lorde, is a forcible reason to moue him to heare and relieue them. The reason is, because, first, the Lord pittieth the miseries of his seruants. Secondly, the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them commonly for their professions sake, which the Lord wil haue to be preserued from ignominie &amp; contempt. The vse is to teach vs, first, to alleage it in our prayers when we desire to be freed from such miseries: Secondly, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to waite the Lords leasure, being assured that he will rescue his seruants in his good time, from all the wrongs that they suffer at the hands of wicked men for well dooing.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [beholde and see]</hi> corrections laide vpon others <note place="margin">2</note> ought not to be neglected, but duely considered of, as the rest of Gods workes. The reason is, because, first, God often
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19537:28"/>
smiteth some to instruct others thereby: secondly, we being of one moulde should take to heart the condition one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The vse is, first, that we may learne to knowe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of Gods exceeding iustice and mercy in generall: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to be induced thereby to feare and loue him the more, who maketh vs onely the beholders of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laide vpon others, which our sinnes deserued to haue been laide vpon our selues.</p>

The vse is to teach vs, first, to giue all glory to God for all things done in this world, whosoeuer be the instruments. Secondly, the more that God doth by vs, to labour to bee the more humble, least we proue the instruments of his glory to our owne destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [not vnto you]</hi> The wicked haue no cause to reioyce when they preuaile against the godly, though they <note place="margin">4</note> doe it vsually. The reason is, because, they are but the Lords rods, who (without repentance) shall be cast into the fire, <hi>Isay.</hi> 10. 5. and 14. 25. &amp;c. Secondly, they doe not as they imagine, ouerthrow the godly &amp; establish themselues, but cleane contrarie. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our sinnes alwayes to be the cause that they at any time preuaile against vs. Secondly, to call to God for grace to repent, that so their power may be weakned. Thirdly, to beare with patience those rods that God layeth vpon vs by the wicked, being assured that God in his good time will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease vs and punish them.</p>

The reason is, because, first, God loueth vs, and would weane vs from delighting in this world, to long after
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19537:28"/>
heauen and heauenly things: secondly, our nature is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse as it will not be framed to any spirituall things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many and grieuous corrections. Thirdly, Sathan and the worlde doe hate vs, and labour continually to seeke our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to be offended at the great afflictions that we heare of, or see to befall such as feare God: secondly, neuer to promise our selues worldlie peace and prosperity, but to prepare our selues to looke for one rodde to succeed another whilest we liue here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [any sorrow like, &amp;c.]</hi> It is a vsuall thing with vs, <note place="margin">6</note> to thinke our owne troubles more heauie and intolerable then any others doe suffer. The reason is, because, first, wee feele all the smart of our owne, and doe onely a farre off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that which others doe beare. Secondly, we are more discontented with our owne crosses then we should, which maketh vs beare them the more impatiently, and thinke them the more intolerable. The vse is to teach vs, first, by the due suruey of our manifold sinnes, to acknowledge wee haue deserued the most grieuous punishments that can be. Secondly, in the consideration of our afflictions, to call to mind rather how many and grieuous rods we are freed of, that wee might by Gods iust iudgement susteine, then to thinke of the grieuousnesse of that we beare, which others feele not.</p>

[sorrow]</hi> The afflictions that God layeth vpon <note place="margin">7</note> his seruants, are, and ought to be grieuous vnto them for the present time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. The reason is, because, first, wee iustly haue deserued them through our sinnes. Secondly, we must be lead by them to repentance, or we abuse them. The vse is, first, to reproue the stoicall blockishnesse of those that are not affected with afflictions. Secondly, it teacheth vs to sorrow when we are afflicted, but so as we be not swallowed vp in it.</p>
               <p>

Secondly, to learne to seeke vnto the Lord especially, for release from our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and not to be wholly employed about worldly means, as they doe that be worldly minded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [wrath]</hi> The anger of God is hot against sin, <note place="margin">9</note> euen in his dearest seruants. The reason is, because, first, he is most righteous, and cannot beare with any euill. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it tendeth to his great dishonour. The vse is to teach vs, first, if he cannot beare it in those whome he loueth, howe much lesse will he suffer it vnpunished in the wicked? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to make vs abhorre sinne in all men, but especially in our selues, euen as much as we desire to haue the Lord to loue vs and be pleased with vs.</p>

The reason is, first, that by punishing sometimes he might declare his displeasure against sinne. Secondly, by sparing them often, he might shew his great loue vnto them. The vse is to teach vs, first, to acknowledge his wisedome, iustice, and mercie in dealing so with vs. Secondly, to take afflictions patiently when he layeth them vpon vs, seeing we haue them not alwayes, but many good things in stead of them: this vse did <hi>Iob</hi> make of this doctrine, 2. 10.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [from aboue hath he sent]</hi> this often mentioning <note place="margin">1</note> of Gods hand, teacheth this doctrine. When God punisheth vs by the hands of the wicked, we are hardly brought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it to him alone; and they from thinking that their own haed and power hath done it. The reason is, because, first, our vnderstanding taketh deeper impression of that which we see with our eyes, then that which our spirituall knowledge teacheth. Secondly, the wicked can see no further then their owne hand reacheth. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell though the vngodly offend in that which we are hardly reformed in: Secondly, in all our afflictions to looke vnto the Lord whose hand hath done it; and not be like the dog, that snarleth at the stone which is throwne at him, neuer regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him that did cast it: see <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [bones]</hi> when God layeth afflictions vpon vs, <note place="margin">2</note> they ransack the most secret partes that are in vs The reason is, because, God hath ordained afflictions to be the meanes to trie vs. The vse is to teach vs, first, that afflictions are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for vs, seeing we should else thinke stil better of our selues then (in deed) we are: secondly, not to bee amazed though the soule and body bee fraught with miseries, seeing it hath been euer the meanes that God hath put in practize, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his seruants withall vnder his hands.</p>

This appeareth, not only in the wonderfull beginnings, processe, &amp; ending of the afflcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ioseph, Dauid, Iob, Christ &amp;c.</hi> but also in the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the godly, that liue vnder the crosse. The reason is, first, that the Lord might in special maner declare himselfe to prouide for his seruants in al extremities, as the euent doth alwaies make manifest: secondly, that Sathan and the world
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19537:30"/>
might daily see, how they cannot goe beyond their tedder that God hath measured vnto them. The vse is, first, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them that thinke all things to be guided by fortune, or at the least, that God ruleth not the particulars but onely the generall course of the world: secondly, to teach vs to obserue Gods wonderfull power, and mercifull prouidence, in all our seuerall troubles, whereby we cannot but be constrained at the length to say, it is good for me that I haue bin in trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 19. 71.

The reason is, because, all power is in his hand, so as whatsoeuer man purposeth, yet it is he alone that disposeth. The vse is, first, to reproue them that take any thing in hand as grounded vpon their owne strength: secondly, to teach vs neuer to attempt any vnlawfull things, seeing Gods hand can neuer help vs in them, except it be in his anger to punish vs: thirdly, to teach vs in all things that we take in hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will, to seeke his assistance and help, by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and faithfull prayer.</p>

The reason is, because, all things moe or lesse, are disposed by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The vse is, first, to reproue them that say mine owne hand and power hath done this or that: secondly, in generall to acknowledge all things to bee done of the Lord, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for our sinnes if hee afflict vs, by taking our wealth, friends, liberty, or any good thing else from vs, and from his

[daily in heauinesse]</hi> according to the measure <note place="margin">8</note> and continuance of Gods afflicting hand vpon vs, so must the measure and continuance of our sorrowes be. The reason is, because, first, heauie and long troubles are a signe of Gods heauie and sore displeasure against vs: secondly, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of afflictions argue that we are not sufficiently hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, doe not vnfainedly repent for our sinnes, nor call vpon the Lord so effectually as we should. The vse is, first, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them that by continuance vnder the crosse doe growe hard harted, which condition is a fearefull signe of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting of them. Secondly, to teach vs the heauier and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that troubles are vpon vs, the more earnestly to labour with our selues to growe in repentance, zeale, and feruencie of prayer.</p>

When God meaneth to punish his seruantes, he will encrease the meanes that may further the same, and vtterly disappoint al contrarie endeuours. The reason is; because, first, nothing can stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him to hinder the execution of his will. Secondly, all things in heauen and in earth are at his appointment, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his pleasure. The vse is to teach vs, first, that there is no counsel or strength against the Lord: secondly, to take pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently whatsoeuer it shall please his maiestie to lay vpon vs.</p>

Thirdly, they (being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlie taken to hart) doe after a sort, possesse the soule with the verie torments of hell. The vse is to teach vs, first, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any torments in this life, rather then be drawne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinne against God: secondly, to labour aboue all things to be reconciled vnto God, through Christ, and so endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the keeping of a good conscience, no trouble or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bodie shall be grieuous, but verie tolerable, yea ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs.</p>

The vse is to teach vs, first, not to commit any thing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and so thinke that it shall be forgotten in time; for God seeth all things past, as though they were present: secondly, not to continew in sinne or put off repentance from day to day, for in so doing we multiply and heape vp matter against our selues for the day of our punishment.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine [neither am I able to rise vp]</hi> God sometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth <note place="margin">7</note> his people so grieuously, that their state seemeth des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and irrecouerable in the iudgment of flesh and bloud: Examples, <hi>Ioseph, Dauid, Iob, yea Christ himselfe.</hi> The reason is, first, that he might shew his mightie power in restoring them. Secondly, that all meanes being taken away, they might learne to looke vp to heauen and rest vpon him onely. The vse is, first, to reproue them that iudge the case of Gods people desperate when all worldlie meanes be against them. Secondly, to teach vs, neuer to despaire whatsoeuer extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe befall vs in this life.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [midst]</hi> GOD can as easilie destroy in a fensed Citie, as in a battell. The reason is, because, first, his power is <note place="margin">2</note> present euerie where. Secondly, there is no Counsell nor strength against the Lord. The vse is to teach vs, neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our affiance, or thinke our selues safe in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, but onely in dwelling vnder the protection of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, <hi>Plalme.</hi> 91. 1.</p>

The reason is, because, all power to doe any thing is from him alone. The vse is to teach vs, in all our distresses to rest vpon God, and seeke to him aboue for helpe and deliuerance.</p>

[virgins]</hi> the nicenesse of those that haue liued <note place="margin">5</note> daintely, is no reason to free them, but rather a prouocation to bring afflictions vpon them. The reason is, because, first, the pampering of our selues is none of the ends, for which God bestoweth his blessings vpon vs. Secondly, such coy nicenesse as many be of, is seldome without speciall sinnes that are incident to that condition; which God will not let passe vnpunished. The vse is to teach vs, first, to take heede that we bestow not Gods blessings giuen vs (to further vs in his seruice) to make vs the vnfitter to beare his roddes. Secondly, neuer to promise our selues freedome from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, what priuiledges soeuer we can alleage, especially

if we walke not most vrightly, and bestowe not his blessings most faithfully.</p>

The reason is, because, first, God dealeth with euery one according to that which is in himselfe: Secondly, the promise <hi>[I will be thy God and the God of thy seede]</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable to such children, as walke in the faithfull steps of their godly parents. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that rest vpon their forefathers faithfulnesse, they themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnfaithful: secondly, to teach vs to seeke that in our selues and not in others, which may be an argument to proue vs in the fauour of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [for these things]</hi> note (besides the same with <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1.) this doctrine. It is not onely lawful, but also <note place="margin">1</note> necessary for the godly to be so greatly grieued when God punisheth them for their sinnes, as may drawe them into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame weeping. The reason is, because, first, Gods heauie hand is as the roaring of a lyon, whereat all the beasts of the forrest doe tremble, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 8. &amp;. 2. Sinne against God, and the punishment thereof, ought to grieue vs aboue all things that can be fall vs in this world. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that thinke it a fault to be passionate in such cases: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs to labour our hard hearts, that wee may be most liuely affected with sorrowe, and mourne in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

maner when the Lord doth lay his grieuous crosses vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs.</p>

Secondly, nothing must be more odious vnto vs, then sinne, which (we hauing committed) must cause vs to lament exceedingly. The vse is, first, to reprooue them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre out of frame, that can easily weepe at the losse of goods, friends, children, &amp;c. being taken from them by the ordinary hand of God; but can hardly be mooued with those spirituall losses that do more neerely concerne the saluation or damnation of the soule and body eternally: secondly, to teach vs aboue all things to be humbled with the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our sinnes, and Gods displeasure for them, and not so much for the losse whatsoeuer it be.</p>
               <p>

[descendeth water]</hi> they were naturally a hard harted people as the scripture testifieth often; yet are they <note place="margin">3</note> now constrained to weepe, whereby we learne this doctrine; There is none so stoute, or hard harted, but afflictions will bring him down. The reason is, because, first, God is stronger then any, and will preuaile in all that which he purposeth: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, God will constraine man at one time or other, to giue glory vnto him, by acknowledging his power. The vse is to teach vs, that we neuer set our selues against Gods hand in punishing vs, but willingly submit our selues vnto him in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [comfort]</hi> It is a grieuous plague to be depriued of comforters in afflictions, the contrary whereof is an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">4</note> blessing: for the reasons and vse hereof see <hi>verse</hi> 2. <hi>Doctrine</hi> 3.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [should refresh]</hi> It is the duety of euery one, to comfort and relieue others that be in distresse. The reason is, <note place="margin">5</note> because, first, God hath so commanded, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we are members one of another, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, we may haue the like need our selues another time.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19537:33"/>
The vse is, first, to reprooue them, as being no feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that regarde no further then their owne good, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to relieue those that neede with such blessings as they haue: secondly, to teach vs to labour more and more with our selues, that we may be affected with the condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, mourning with them that are afflicted, and helping them to the vttermost of our power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my children]</hi> the church, as also the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <note place="margin">6</note> is to declare her selfe a kinde mother vnto euery one that is trained vp therein; and to haue compassion of their miseries, helping them to the vttermost. This duety is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to be performed by the ministers in the one, and the magistrates in the other. The reason is, because, first, they are especially honoured by the whole body, that euery member might receiue especiall good by them: secondly, they are, or should be, of greatest knowledge and conscience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should declare the same by the most excellent fruites, whereof this is not the least. The vse is, first, to declare vnto vs in what miserable case that Church or common wealth is, whose ministers or magistrates be persecutors and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the best members thereof: secondly, to teach vs to praise God when our gouernours are good, and to pray for their preseruation and continuance, or if they be euill to pray for their amendment, and in the meane while mourne for the miseries that are vpon vs by their vngodly demeanors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [stretoheth]</hi> It is a necessary duety in Gods <note place="margin">1</note> people, to seeke out all good meanes of their release from troubles. The reason is, because, first, they know that God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily worketh euery thing by meanes: secondly, they know not by what meanes, nor when God will deliuer them, therefore must they vse al, and continue therein, committing the successe vnto the Lord. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that are slothfull in vsing the meanes, wickedly saying, God will bring to passe his owne purpose and no more, though wee doe nothing: secondly, to teach vs alwaies to put all good meanes in practize, and yet neuer to rest vpon them, but to depend vpon the Lord alone, in whose hands the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues of all things are.</p>
               <p>

The reason is, because hee would haue vs follow the meanes that be before our eyes, and yet is not himselfe tyed thereunto, but prospereth them as he will, and when he will. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to despayre, though the meanes that we haue vsed preuaile not: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to continue still in vsing good meanes, though they haue not that successe which wee looke for, seeing we knowe not when God hath appointed to blesse our meanes.</p>

The reason is, because Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and the wicked haue greatest malice against them. The vse is to teach vs, not to promise our selues the applause of men in this life, but to knowe that to bee euill intreated

and esteemed most vile, is our share, if we will liue godly in Christ Iesus.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [is righteous]</hi> Gods people doe acknowledge <note place="margin">1</note> his iustice in all his workes, yea euen in his punishments laid vpon them. Examples hereof are, <hi>Iob, Dauid, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> The reason is; because, first, his word and spirit hath reformed their iudgmentes, teaching them how to thinke of his holie maiestie in all thinges. Secondly, the conscience of their owne sinnes causeth them to iustifie the Lorde, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselues. The vse is, first, to reprooue in our selues, or others, all repyning against God, and accusing of him, as things farre differing from the disposition of the godly, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reformed. Secondlie, to teach vs to grow in the feare, and worship of GOD, praying alwaies for his grace to assist vs, who is so righteous in all his workes. Thirdly, to teach vs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to beare, and contentednes to vndergoe, what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soeuer the Lord, that is so righteous, doth lay vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [for I &amp;c.]</hi> it is the duetie of Gods children to seeke the cause of all their euils in themselues. The reason is, <note place="margin">2</note> because, first, GOD is righteous, and layeth nothing vpon them but that which they iustly deserue. Secondly, they know their owne manifold sinnes, and their exceeding weaknesse in weldoing, which they cannot so see in any others. This
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19537:35"/>
doctrine is hardly learned, because of our naturall blind selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, &amp; pronenesse to accuse others. The vse is, first, to iustifie God, when he is iudged. Secondly, to teach vs, to betruelie humbled vnder the Lords hand, when he layeth his roddes vpon vs. Thirdly, to giue vs direction how to seeke the right way of release from those crosses that are vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [rebelled]</hi> though God punish vs often for other <note place="margin">3</note> causes, yet the matter that he worketh vpon is our sinnes. The reason is, because the righteous GOD cannot punish without desert. The vse is to teach vs, to labour to find out and forsake our sinnes so often as we are punished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [rebellion]</hi> being an high degree of transgression teacheth vs this doctrine. We must not lessen our sinnes, but <note place="margin">4</note> account them most heynous in our owne eies. The reason is, because, first, they are so in the sight of God. Secondly, they keepe so many good things from vs, and bring so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series vpon vs. Thirdly, it is a special note of a reformed hart; and the lessening or hyding of our sinnes, is a marke of the contrarie. The vse is, first, to teach vs thereby the better to be prepared vnto true repentance: secondly, to comfort vs with assurance that we are out of loue with our sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [his commandement] [heb. his mouth]</hi> it is our duetie (especiallie in religion) neither to goe further, nor to <note place="margin">5</note> come shorter, then Gods reuealed will; but to attend vnto it, as the seruantes eye doth vnto his maisters hand: <hi>Psal</hi> 123. 2. The reason is, because, first, we are so commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. &amp; 12. 32. <hi>Prouerbs.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, we can doe nothing well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the direction thereof, seeing we are naturallie blind in iudgment, and corrupt in affection. The vse is, first, to reproue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that think it vnperfect, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ad traditions vnto it, as the Papists. Secondly, to teach vs, that the written word of God is the persect rule of all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Thirdly, we must carefully learne to know this rule, or else how can we be directed by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [rebelled]</hi> it is rebellion against the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">6</note> to be disobedient vnto the voice of his ministers, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his trueth. <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. 16. The reason is, because first, they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19537:35"/>
speake nothing in their owne names, but from the Lord. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the disobedience is not to the minister, but to that he vttereth which is the Lords. The vse is, first, to reprooue their error that thinke they may hate the instructions of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and yet loue God. Secondly, to teach all ministers to take heed what they teach in the name of the Lord, lest they prophane his blessed maiestie, abuse his holie ordinance of the ministerie, and seduce his people.</p>

[his commandement]</hi> now their acknowledging <note place="margin">7</note> that to be Gods mouth, which in their prosperitie they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, teacheth vs this doctrine. We are constrained in our aduersitie to acknowledg Gods hand in those things, which in our prosperitie we neglected. The reason, because, first, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie reformeth the iudgment, and causeth a more serious consideration of matters then before. Secondly, GOD will haue his iudgments iustified by those whome he punisheth; this is verified euen in the wicked, as in <hi>Pharaoh Exod</hi> 9. 27. <hi>Nabuchadnezzar Dan.</hi> 4 31. <hi>Achab.</hi> 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 21. 27. &amp; <hi>c</hi> The vse is to teach vs, to acknowledg the voice and hand of God in all things, when the first occasion is offered vs: so shall we haue profit and comfort by it, els shall we be constrained to acknowledge it in the end, to the doubling of our sorrow.</p>
               <p>

[heare &amp;c. all people]</hi> when Gods people are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, <note place="margin">8</note> they are not ashamed, but willing to tell all men of it, and to declare their sinnes to be the cause of it. The reason is, because, first, aboue all things they desire to haue the Lord iustified in all mens iudgmentes. Secondly, they desire that their owne example might teach others to scrue God better. The vse is, first, to reproue them, as being farre from a godlie disposition, who either accuse God when they are punished; or labour to hide from the eies of all men the affliction that is vpon them: secondly, to teach vs, that it is a right signe of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, to be free in consessing our sinnes, and Gods iust hand on vs for them, and that without shame or blushing sauing for the sinnes onelie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [all people]</hi> the manifesting of our punishments <note place="margin">9</note> vnto the world as from Gods hand because of our sinnes, can
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19537:36"/>
neither dishonor the Lord, nor harden others in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, but is a iust occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, it is matter of great honor to God, to let no sinnes escape without punishment, when he offendeth: secondly, it giueth others iust cause to thinke, that except they repent, they shall all likewise bee punished. The vse is, first, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them that would not haue it knowne to the world how seuerely the Lord afflicteth his seruants in this life: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs to desire to let others know how little the Lorde liketh of sinne, seeing hee punisheth it in his dearest children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my virgins, &amp;c.]</hi> in that they were in such wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition euery way, we learne this doctrine. It may fall <note place="margin">10</note> out to be the lot of the Church of God, to be depriued for a time of all worldly comfort, and of the ministerie of the word and sacraments also. The reason is, because it was the condition of this people, who yet were the only true visible Church, that was then vnder the sunne. The vse is, first, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the vanity of the Papists, who esteem the Church to be alwaies a famous visible Monarchie, and of worldlings, who thinke it should be free from all molestations and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: secondly, to teach vs not to be dismaied nor to forsake the trueth, notwithstanding the innumerable troubles that doe befall the Church that professeth the same.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [I called vnto, &amp;c.]</hi> It is an increase of sorrowe, to <note place="margin">1</note> be disappointed of their help, by whome we looked to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of our troubles. The reason is, because the hope
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19537:36"/>
of help by those meanes doth often promise speedie deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and in the meane while administreth patience; which being frustrated, the heart is sodainely fraught with many griefes that it looked not for. The vse is, first, to reproue them as guilty of a great sinne, who giue the distressed any hope of succour, and yet disappoynte them when they might haue helped them. Secondly, to teach vs, especially to rest vpon God in our troubles, and not to relie vppon the outward meanes, least they deceiue vs, and so our sorrow be increased thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [louers deceiued]</hi> God often maketh our friends <note place="margin">2</note> that loue vs vnfeinedly, vtterly vnable to doe vs any good in our distresse. The reason is, to shew vs that it is a vaine thing to trust in man. The vse is to teach vs, to put our whole affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Lord alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my Priests and mine Elders perished]</hi> the misery of that people must needes be great, whose rulers can neither <note place="margin">3</note> help themselues nor others. The reason is, because, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours are the staffe of the peoples strength, which being broken, there is no help left. The vse is, first, to shew vs in what excellent steed our rulers doe stand vs, and therefore to teach vs to obey them, honour them, and pray for them: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs not to despayre, though they be made vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnable to help vs, seeing it was so with this people, and yet God found out a meanes to deliuer them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [perished]</hi> Gods plagues doe often ouertake the great ones, aswell as others. The reason is, because, first, they <note place="margin">4</note> vsually sinne as greatly as others, if not aboue the measure of others: secondly, be they neuer so great amongst men, yet are they nothing when God taketh them in hand. The vse is to teach vs, not to sinne by vertue of any priuiledge that we haue in this life, seeing it cannot free vs from those punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which our sinnes doe deserue.</p>

The reason is, because, first, outward things are no part of their felicitie, which is purchased for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19537:37"/>
them by Christ Iesus: secondly, God will now and then, shew himselfe the preseruer of his people, when all meanes doe faile. The vse is, to teach vs, not to rest vpon any thing in this life, for that were to build vpon the sand which will fayle in the tempest. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 26. 27.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, God hath commaunded to pray without ceasing, and set no time when we shall be heard. The vse is, to teach vs, that God by deferring to heare vs, first trieth our faith and patience: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, sheweth his exceeding anger against our sinnes: thirdly, giueth vs occasion to increase in repentance and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of praier: Examples hereof are the Israelites in Egypt, and in the Captiuitie. <hi>Iob, Dauid, &amp;c.</hi>

[behold, &amp;c.]</hi> God seeth all things: but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in laying open their miseries before the Lord, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">2</note> this doctrine. We must with lamentation, lay open our miseries before the Lord, if wee looke to bee relieued. The reason is, because, first, mercie is denyed to them that hide

their sinnes, <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 28. 13. secondly, forgiuenes is granted vpon a free confession, <hi>Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 32. 5. The vse is, first, to reproue them, as hauing no sparke of right repentance, that coldly, or not at all, doe acknowledge their particular sinnes vnto the Lord: secondly, to teach vs to ransack our owne waies, that in the daies of our repentance wee may bee able throughly to lay open our transgressions vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine [for trouble is vpon me]</hi> we then pray most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, <note place="margin">3</note> when we feele most sensiblie the burthen of that wee would be rid of, and the want of that we would haue. The reason is, because, first, els we are continually secure: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we earnestly desire the contentment of our owne hearts: which cannot bee whilest wee haue that we would not, and want that we would haue. The vse is, to teach vs, first, the necessitie of affliction, seeing it is euident we are then (only) touched effectually: secondly, to striue that we be not cold, but more and more affected with the sense of our sinnes, to loath them, and with a longing after righteousnesse, to walk therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [be mudded: heart turned]</hi> There is no rest nor <note place="margin">4</note> quietnesse within vs, when God presseth vs with the weight of our owne sinnes. The reason is, because, first, they are so many and so grieuous. Secondly, he can, and doth vrge them more forciblie, then that we can sustaine his heauie hand. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to pitie those that are afflicted in conscience for sinne, aboue all others that are any waies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed. Secondly, to esteeme of, and bee thankfull for the peace of conscience, as the greatest treasure that we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy in this life. Thirdly, to auoyd sinne alwaies, as that which will procure vs the greatest hurt both in this life, and in the life to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [greatly rebelled]</hi> The godly doe alwaies in the <note place="margin">5</note> due consideration of their sinnes, aggrauate them against themselues in greatest measure. The reason is, because, first, they see best into their owne offences. Secondly, they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them by the heauie anger of God deserued by the same, as did the Publican, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19537:38"/>
trie our selues how we stand affected this way, seeing it is a speciall note of true repentance, and the contrarietie of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie. Secondly, to labour more and more to aggrauate our sinnes in our owne eyes, that wee may bee humbled the more effectually thereby.</p>

Secondly, they are no further vnto vs as blessings, then so farre as he giueth them in his loue and fauour. The vse is, to teach vs, first, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of any of Gods creatures against vs to acknowledge our sinnes against God to be the cause. Secondly, to labour first of all to bee reconciled to GOD in Christ Iesus, and to walke in obedience vnto his lawes: so shall all his creatures serue to our good, els doe they encrease our condemnation.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their hatred that they beare to the righteous, maketh them be glad when any euill lighteth on them.

Wee are the fitte schollers to learne Gods worde, and make right vse of it, when afflictions are vppon vs. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, in prosperitie we forget God and our selues also.

Thirdly, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions we can more easilie consider of our estate both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, past, and to come. The vse is, to teach vs, how necessary

afflictions are, to frame vs to be of a right disposition: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to humble vs, seeing we are of so vntoward a disposition.

The reason is, first, that the Lord might declare himselfe an aduersary to sinne in all men without partialitie: Secondly, that he might reduce his seruants from running on headlong to hell with the wicked. The vse is to teach vs, first, to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the righteousnesse of God, as in all his workes generally, so in the afflictions of his Church particularly: secondly, not to perswade our selues to looke for any earthly peace (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promises of this life are conditionall) though we be the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith, but to prepare our selues for continuall calamities one in the necke of another.</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because of the great commodities and contentment that come vnto vs thereby, when we enioy them peaceably; as euery mans experience can teach him in particular.

               <p>

               <p>

[of the daughter of Iudah]</hi> It is the sinne of the Church, that causeth the Lord to spoyle the same of any <note place="margin">7</note> blessing that she hath heretofore enioyed.

The vse is to teach vs, when we are depriued of any blessing, not to fret against the wicked (Gods roddes) that are the instruments thereof: but to acknowledge our owne sinnes, that caused the Lord to set them on worke to spoyle vs, and by repentance to seeke reconciliation with him, so shall we enioy his blessings againe, or otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>

Secondly, they know, or should know, best Gods anger for sinne, and the transgressions of the Church. Thirdly, they must giue accompt for them that are committed to their charge. Fourthly, they know how deare the Church is vnto God. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that good Ministers are an exceeding blessing vnto the Church, and ill ones the greatest

The reason is, because it crosseth both our affections, and theirs, who are deare vnto vs. The vse is, to humble vs, when it is our share; because God sheweth vs, that he is angrie with vs, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs power to doe that good which we would gladly doe.</p>

The reason is, because, else we are so dull and blinde, that we cannot discerne it rightly. The vse is, first, to mourne when we perceiue our selues vnable or vn willing to search out the workes of the Lord: secondly, to ascribe all punishments to his iustice for sinne, and all blessings to his mere mercy; so shall we be sure to iudge rightly in the generall.</p>

The reason is, because it easeth griefe, to thinke that others haue been in the like case, whereas by the contrarie it is aggrauated. The vse is, to teach vs, first, in all our troubles to search out whether the godly haue felt the like, and to be comforted by it; this is vsuall in the scriptures: Secondly, though we cannot finde an example like ours; yet is it no cause of despayre, seeing it was the case of Gods people in this place.</p>

The vse is, to teach vs, first, that all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19537:50"/>
ministers must be learned, wise, &amp; godly, else they cannot do this duety in any tollerable measure: secondly, it is a duety of great waight and care to bee a minister: and therefore they that make insufficient ones, and those that accept of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling being not qualified thereunto, doe commit a great sinne against God, and against his Church, and against their owne soules.</p>

First, hardest speeches from the mouth of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, be often most profitable, yea euen to the afflicted, if they be not sufficiently humbled. The reason is, because, our sinnes are like a festred sore, that needeth sharp corrosiues, or like a disease sticking fast in the partes of the body, that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a strong purgation. The vse is, to teach vs, that it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary part of a ministers office, to rake in the consciences and launch the depth of the heartes of his hearers.</p>
               <p>

[that I may comfort thee]</hi> the second doctrine. <note place="margin">4</note> That minister loueth vs best, that dealeth most plainely with vs. The reason is, because plaine reproof doth vs more good, (if we haue grace to take it aright) then smooth speeches can doe.

Thirdly, that true teachers of Gods word being disgraced, are not to be dismayed, though hyrelings and time-seruers be receiued in their steades, seeing it was the lot of the Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles.</p>

The reason is, because whom God sendeth, them he furnisheth with the word of truth: but Sathan putteth a lying spirit in the mouth of them that he stirreth vp to be seducers. The vse is, to teach vs, to take heede we be not seduced by such: they are discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by these and such like speeches. All is well, we are the most reformed Church that was since the Apostles times; many are too precise; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may take liberty of pastimes on the Lords Sabbaoth; it is a small fault or none to sweare by faith, &amp;c. all men that will professe in name to be Christians, are to be receiued vnto the Sacraments, and such like.</p>

The reason is, because, if the doctrine be onely generall, men will misapplie it, and alwaies turne it vpon others, saying, he touched such a man, and such a man to day, &amp;c. The vse is, first, to reprooue those teachers that doe not deale sharpely, either for feare of displeasure, or because themselues are some way infamously guiltie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to reproue those hearers, as men not led by the spirit of God, that cannot endure particular reproofe, but will set themselues against the reproouers, vexing them by all meanes.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [to turne away]</hi> the onely way to auoyde Gods <note place="margin">5</note> plagues, is gladly to suffer our selues bitterly to be reproued by Gods ministers. The reason is, because it is the meanes that God hath appointed to bring vs to the sight of our sinnes, and so to true repentance. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that they who cannot endure this course, can looke for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gods heauie hand, to be euery way stretched out against them: Secondly, if we looke for Gods fauour, to vse all meanes that we may haue such teachers.</p>

Examples hereof are many in al ages.

The vse is, to teach vs, first, that it is the lot of the godly to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the wicked: so was Christ, so were the Prophets, and Apostles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs'look for it, &amp; not murmur at it, nor shrinke from the trueth for it: secondly, that sin is a most ougly thing in Gods sight, that causeth him to deale so seuerely with his deerest childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thirdly, that we take heed of being in league with the wicked, for they are our enemies &amp; must scourge vs.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [all thine enemies]</hi> the wicked will ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1</note> to vexe the godly, though otherwise they be enemies one to another, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 2. Examples hereof <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 12. The reason is, because they hate nothing, neither any persons so much, as the truth and the professors thereof. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that the greatest part of men shall alwaies be against the godly, and therefore let vs not be carried with the multitude: Secondly, not to trust the friendship of the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [opened their mouth]</hi> it is a speciall property of the wicked, to rayle at the godly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 11. 12. <note place="margin">2</note> The reason is alleadged by our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 34. The vse is, to teach vs, how to discerne of a wicked man, and to take his reuilings patiently: Secondly, to take heede that wee bee not tainted with so vile a faulte, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19537:53"/>
God hath made a marke of a wicked man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [we haue deuoured, &amp;c.]</hi> the wicked bee often <note place="margin">3</note> so inflamed with malice against the godly, as nothing will satisfie them but their blood, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 11. 16. <hi>&amp;c.

The reason is, because they think to haue rest when they are dead, which they cannot haue whilest they see them liue, <hi>Esth.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The vse is, to teach vs, first, that bloodie cruelty being the property of the wicked, we must labour to be farre from that disposition: Secondly, to looke for all mischiefe from the wicked that they can accomplish against vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [this is the day]</hi> in that once they did beare <note place="margin">4</note> great shew of friendship to them, and now so cruelly deale with them, we learne this doctrine. Though the wicked doe alwaies hate the godly, yet they will often dissemble friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and shew forth their malice onely, when they haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie thereunto, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Amos.</hi> 1. 9. The reason is, because they are wise in their owne generation, and can wait their best aduantage. The vse is, to teach vs, first, neuer to trust the faire shew of a prophane man, but so to behaue our selues, as we be still aware of him: Secondly, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary the godly should now and then fall into troubles, that their dissembling friends may be discouered.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [the Lord hath done] i.</hi> It is the hand of GOD <note place="margin">1</note> that worketh all the afflictions which fall vpon his Church. This doctrine wee had often before, the bookes of <hi>Ioshua, Iudges</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> are full of examples of it. The reason is,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19537:54"/>
because, first, he is almightie, and doth all things. Secondly, he loueth his people, and letteth nothing betide them, but that which seemeth good vnto him. Thirdly, hee hath the commandement of all creatures. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to learne to feare, and obey him especially, in whose fauour nothing can hurt vs. Secondly, that in all afflictions we looke vnto him that striketh, and examine our selues what cause wee haue giuen him. Thirdly, to seeke reconciliation with him by true repentance, so shall the meanes that are against vs, be imployed for vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [that he purposed]</hi> Euery thing that the Lord <note place="margin">2</note> determineth shall stand, and come to passe, whosoeuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. The reason is, because he is so powerfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that nothing can alter him, or disswade him. Obiection: How is he then sayd so often to repent? Answere, that is not in his purposes, but in the performance of his promises, and his threatnings, which are alwaies vttered with condition. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that his promises and his fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable assistance (wee beleeuing therein) shall alwaies stand by vs, to assist vs in all distresses. Secondly, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned in the word against the impenitent, shall certainly light vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [fulfilled his word] i.</hi> Gods purposes (so farre as they are for vs to knowe) are reuealed in the word, and no <note place="margin">3</note> where els to bee sought. The reason is, because it is called his will, according whereunto if any man speake not, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no trueth in him. The vse is, first, to reproue them that say, who can tell Gods will? Secondly, to teach vs, with all diligence to search the Scriptures, and to rest on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereupon, seeing it is the certaine will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [his word]</hi> So much of Gods purposes as men may take knowledge of, or enquire after, is reuealed in the <note place="margin">4</note> written worde of GOD. The reason is, because the secret things belong vnto the Lord (as the saith by <hi>Moses, Deut.)</hi> and those that be reuealed to vs and our children. The vse is, first, to reproue the Anabaptists that looke for reuelations besides the word. Secondly, to teach vs, that we neuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19537:54"/>
well, but when we haue our warrant from the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [commaunded]</hi> God setteth nothing downe in <note place="margin">5</note> his word, but that he will haue taught by his Ministers, and learned by his people. The reason is, because, whatsoeuer is written, is written for our learning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. The vse is, to teach vs, that no part of the Scripture is needlesse to bee knowne, or a storie onely and no more to bee made of it, but of necessarie and profitable vse to euery particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, because, first, he will thereby trie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancie and patience of his children. Secondly, that he might suffer with long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the vessels ordained to destruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. The vse is, to teach vs, neither to despaire of the promises, nor thinke the threatnings shall neuer be accomplished, but to make as certaine accompt of them, as if they were present, seeing nothing thereof shall fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>

The reason is, because, first, God esteemeth them as the apple of his eye, <hi>Zacha.</hi> 2. 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with him in Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 20. Secondly, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doe all of hatred to our religion, and not for our sinnes. Thirdly, they are set on worke in desire to satisfie their owne affections, to the exceeding breach of Gods lawes. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that they shall be sure not to prosper: so it was said and done in the like case, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 32. well it may be that they shall preuaile, till our sinnes bee throughly punished, but no longer: Secondly, to pray feruently for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to hope for deliuerance in Gods good time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [O wall]</hi> in speaking to the wall when he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to speake to them, we learne this doctrine. The sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <note place="margin">2</note> creatures are often more moued, when God sheweth his anger, then we are. The reason is, because, first, there is no corruption in them, but by our sinnes: secondly, wee are made by sinne more blockish then any creature besides. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to be ashamed, and humbled, that are so vntoward: secondly, to assure our selues that no excuse will serue, seeing the dumbe and senselesse creatures shall beare witnesse against vs, <hi>Isay</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, to take great paines with our selues, to labour our affections to goodnesse; otherwise wee shall profit but a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [wall]</hi> when the aduersaries impugne the truth, all the members of the Church ought to crie vnto God ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly. <note place="margin">3</note> The reason is, because, Gods glory ought to be deare
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19537:55"/>
vnto all: Secondly, it concerneth all that looke for any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the trueth: Thirdly, the Spirit that giueth sympathie to euery member of the bodie, and to all betweene them and the head, perswadeth and directeth thereunto. The vse is, to teach vs, to take to hart the case of the whole Church more, then our owne, and Gods glory most of all, so did <hi>Moses Exod.</hi> 32. 32. and <hi>Paule Rom.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [let teares]</hi> grieuous affliction ought to bring <note place="margin">4</note> vs to exceeding sorrow for sinne. The reason is, because grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishments doe argue the heynousnes of our offences. The vse is, to teach vs, the more wee are punished, the more earnestly to labour with our owne hearts to increase lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [no rest]</hi> wee must not bee weary of vsing the <note place="margin">5</note> meanes of continuall repentance. The reason is, because we doe sinne continually. The vse is, to teach vs, that true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance standeth not in a fit of sorrow or prayer, and so an end: but in a continuall performance of those dueties, euery day in better maner then other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [neither let]</hi> he that will doe his duetie in Gods <note place="margin">6</note> seruice aright, must not giue place to his owne affections. The reason is, because they must be subdued in spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, else they either taint, or wholie defile all that is taken in hand. The vse is, to teach vs, to trie our selues how much we haue profited in godlinesse, by examining what rule wee haue ouer our affections.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [night &amp;c. watches]</hi> we must vse all the meanes we may, to fit vs to prayer, and to helpe vs to continue in it <note place="margin">1</note> without disturbance. The reason is, because els we performe it very vntowardly, such is the difficultie of it, &amp; our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The vse is, to teach vs, not to enter rashlie vpon so high an action, but with all circumspection and watchfulnesse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our owne corruptions, and Sathans sleights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [heart]</hi> Our prayers must be feruent, or they will not be regarded. The reason is, because, God is of such <note place="margin">2</note> maiestie, as he looketh for all earnestnesse in our petitions. The vse is, first, to reproue the common manner of praying with lip labour onely, as a matter highly offensiue in the sight of the Lord. Secondly, it teacheth vs neuer to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that great action, but with all carefull preparation and diligent attention vnto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [young children]</hi> in that one of the miseries, <note place="margin">3</note> which is most patheticall, is named, we learne this doctrine. Gods Ministers must vse the most forcible reasons that can be deuised, to perswade vnto godlinesse. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the meanes that can bee vsed, are scarce sufficient to perswade vs, such is our dulnesse. The vse is, to teach vs, that Ministers ought to be men of great skill, and dexteritie in perswading, els they shall doe little good.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [O Lord]</hi> they were in a desperate case, and yet pray for helpe, whereby wee learne this doctrine. The onely <note place="margin">1</note>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:19537:56"/>
way of remedie in our greatest miseries, is to call vpon GOD in feruent praier. The reason is, because, first, it declareth that we are humbled, and our pride broken, in confessing no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to bee in our selues, and seeking helpe else where. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he is of greatest power, and none els can helpe vs. Thirdly, he will haue all the glorie of our deliuerance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. The vse is, first, to reproue many sorts of offenders, as Atheists, that doe not acknowledge Gods hand in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series; Idolaters, that seeke helpe of others, then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; Infidels, that seeke to Sorcerers or Witches; those that relie so much vpon men, &amp; those that pray coldly or careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Secondly, that we must not giue ouer prayer, though our caseseemeth most desperate, but be the more earnest therin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [behold and consider]</hi> by this vehement kinde of speech wee learne this doctrine: In right prayer vnto God, <note place="margin">2</note> the frame of our words must be according to our affection. The reason is, because, the heart chiefly doth pray, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out words according to the abundance of it, els is there hypocrisie. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that vehement words in ordinary prayer is vaine, and not in due time. Secondly, that dulnesse of affection in ordinarie prayer or lip labour at any time, is a great fault, seeing the words must be according to the heart. Thirdly, to labour our affections before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and in the action of prayer, that the mouth may speake from the abundance of the heart, and therefore to take heed of vsing a set prayer too much, lest it growe to a meere lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [to whom]</hi> The chiefest reason to moue the Lord <note place="margin">3</note> to pitie vs, is the remembrance of his couenant of mercie in Christ Iesus. The reason is, because it is the ground of our faith, without the benefite whereof we are enemies to God, and he to vs. The vse is, to teach vs, to labour to approue our selues the children of God, (by professing Christ aright, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing stedfastlie in him, and liuing as becommeth the members of his bodie) els are our prayers abominable in his sight.</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because it bringeth his curse which ouerturneth all, as it did man, woman, earth, serpent, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. The vse is, to teach vs, first, the horror of sinne, and fearefulnesse of Gods wrath vpon it: Secondly, to pray to God neuer to giue vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to our heartes lusts, which is the heauiest iudgement that can befall vs.</p>

[children]</hi> there is sufficient cause and matter <note place="margin">5</note> in all the infants of Gods people, why God should in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice destroy them. The reason is, because they are conceiued and borne in sinne, <hi>Psal</hi> 51. 5. The vse is, to teach vs, first, what cause we haue to be humbled, that are infinitely more sinfull then infants: Secondly, to magnifie Gods exceeding mercie that (notwithstanding our manifolde sinnes) doth not destroy vs.</p>

The reason is, because he hath promised speciall protection vnto them, and threatned seuerely to reuenge their wrongs. The vse is, to teach vs, especially to take heed that we doe them no harme, but doe them what good we can.</p>

The reason is, because, no place hath freedome to sinne in it: Secondly, no place had euer any priuiledges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to it, but vpon condition of obedience. The vse is, first, to reproue the Papists, that thinke Gods promises tyed vnto Rome, notwithstanding the disobedience and rebellion of them that dwell therein: secondly, to teach vs, neuer to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our sinnes vnder the pretence of any priuiledge; for it will not serue to keepe vs from Gods hand, in the day of his anger.</p>

Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hereof are the Israelites in generall, <hi>Iaacob, Moses, Iob, Dauid: Christ</hi> himselfe in particular. The reason is, because, first, God will not haue them in loue with this world: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Sathan and the wicked beare an vnappeaseable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against them: Thirdly, they are thereby made fittest to serue God and obey his lawes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 67. The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to looke for any other condition, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire soundly to continue in the seruice of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27. else afflictions when they come, prooue either intollerable vnto vs, or cause vs to fall away: Secondly, to esteeme afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not a note of infamie, but rather a speciall mark of Gods fauour in his Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [I haue seene, &amp;c.]</hi> the whole people speaking as one man, teacheth vs this doctrine. Euery member of the <note place="margin">2</note> Church of God, hath his portion in afflictions, one way or other, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. for either he shall be crossed in his wife, children, kinred, or outward estate; or else in his minde, by grieuous temptations; experience of all estates and ages doth shew it to be so. The reason is, because, first, euery one hath need thereof: Secondly, it maketh them conformable vnto their head Christ Iesus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. 5. The vse is, first, to confute their opinion that perswade themselues, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers suffer, yet they may escape.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [Led and caused me, &amp;c.]</hi> Afflictions are against the naturall desires of the godlie. The reason is, because they <note place="margin">1</note> are bitter to flesh and blood; whereas naturally wee desire the things that delight flesh and blood. The vse is, to teach vs, first, the cause why afflictions are so grieuous vnto vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they crosse our affections: Secondly, God doth it, least we should be too much in loue with the world.</p>
               <p>

[darkenesse]</hi> afflictions are both grieuous and <note place="margin">2</note> dangerous vnto the godly, except the Lord doe specially as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them. The reason is, because, first, they remoue worldly delightes from vs: Secondly, they bring many sorrowes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs: Thirdly, we are quickly very weary therewith: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are most weake in them, and vtterly vnable to stand vnder them.

[not into light]</hi> the consideration of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings <note place="margin">3</note> which we haue lost, is a speciall meane to affect vs with the crosse, when it is vpon vs. The reason is, because we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme more highly of them when they are gone, and we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19537:59"/>
feele the contrarie, then when we had them. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to be the more sorie for our sinnes that caused such an alteration: Secondly, to be the more earnest to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and to pray to be restored into our former good estate againe.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [Onely]</hi> God punisheth (in comparison) none <note place="margin">1</note> in this life, saue his seruants onely. The reason is, because, first, he loueth them, and wil not let them goe on in sinne: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eternall punishments are prepared for the wicked, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they the lesse punished here. The vse is, to teach vs, first, in the multitude and the greatnesse of afflictions, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods great mercy, and to labour to take them patiently, and contentedly: Secondly, to esteeme their case fearefull that are without afflictions, seeing it is a signe that they are bastards and not children, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [turned]</hi> as God declareth all his mercie to vs in his fauour, so are all his arrowes against vs in his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; <note place="margin">2</note> the Israelites are a manifest example hereof. The reason is, because, first, their sinnes bee greatest that haue had the most meanes to keepe them in obedience: Secondly, Gods iustice must punish according to the qualitie of the offence. The vse is, first, to shew vs the cause why God punisheth his seruants more then others in this world: Secondly, to teach vs, the greater blessings wee haue receiued to bee the more carefull that wee prooue not thanklesse, least we receiue the greater iudgements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [against mee]</hi> God is neuer indeed against his, <note place="margin">3</note> but it seemed so in their present feeling, this is the doctrine. Gods people seeme often in their own perswasion to be cast off of God, and pursued as his enemies: <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> are notable examples hereof. The reason is, because we iudge according to our present feeling, which is a greatfaulte. The vse is, first, to shew how it is in our nature to be in extremes; either too secure or too much cast downe: Secondly, to teach
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19537:60"/>
vs to be staide in a patient expectation of his mercie, and not to despaire though our estate seeme neuer so miserable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [all the day]</hi> as God is long or hee punish, so is he long or hee cease punishing of his children. The reason <note place="margin">4</note> is, first, that in his iustice, correction might insome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure recompence the abuse of his patience: secondly, that hee might frame vs aright, which is hard to doe, and long first, because of our vntowardnesse. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to looke for present riddance from any crosse: secondly, not to despayre though we haue suffered long, and prayed long, and yet are not relieued, but to abide it patiently and pray more earnestlie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [caused to waxe olde]</hi> Gods punishments for <note place="margin">1</note> sinne doe often appeare euen in the bodie of man. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, sinne is committed in the bodie: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the body being the more sensible part, might affect vs the more when we feele Gods punishments in it: thirdly, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may haue the more cleare example in beholding our bodies punished. The vse is, to teach vs, when we are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in our bodies, first, to acknowledge Gods iustice in it for our sinne, which worldlings will not doe, but doe account thereof onely as an ordinarie thing: secondly, to ascribe it to his mercy that correcteth vs in this life, to learne amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my flesh and my skin]</hi> the wasting and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the body is to be acknowledged a punishment from <note place="margin">2</note> God; and the flourishing of the same to be a speciall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. The reason is, because we were created in a flourishing condition: the contrarie comming vpon vs for sinne. The vse is, to teach vs, to praise God for the health and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bodie, more then we doe (for that it is ordinarie)
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19537:60"/>
and to confesse our sinnes the causes of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [broken my bones]</hi> there is no torment so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, <note place="margin">3</note> but the godly feele it, when Gods hand is vppon them for their sinnes. The reason is, because first, his anger is most grieuous and intollerable: secondly, hee would haue vs thoroughlie affected and humbled. The vse is, to teach vs, patientlie to endure any extremity that the Lord laieth vpon vs, and not despayre vnder the waight of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[He hath builded against me] i.</hi> he hath euery way enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [builded]</hi> the punishments that God laieth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, are inuincible, and no way to be escaped. The reason is, <note place="margin">1</note> because, first, of his greatnesse and the infinitenesse of his displeasure when it sheweth foorth it selfe: secondly, our weakenesse which then especially we feele. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to take heede that we doe not by our disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence incurre his heauie displeasure: secondly, to humble our selues vnder his mighty hand when he smiteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [Gall]</hi> the afflictions of the godly are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the most grieuous things that can bee felt: Examples, <note place="margin">2</note> Israel in Egypt, <hi>Iob</hi> in his agony, and many others. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because God would haue them feele a taste of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of the desart of their owne sinnes. The vse is, first, to teach vs, how iust cause we haue to be humbled: secondly, to let vs see the great mercie of God to vs, that might punish vs most extreamely and eternally in the torments of hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [weariesomenesse]</hi> the godly are often brought in this life to feele nothing but griefe and sorrow. The reason <note place="margin">3</note> is, because, God would thereby bring them to a thorough hatred of this world, and longing after heauen. The vse is, to teach vs, first, how hardly wee are sufficiently humbled, that neede to bee so sharpely dealt withall: Secondly, that grieuous and continuall afflictions are mostnecessarie for vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[He hath set me in darke places] i.</hi> he hath brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [darke place]</hi> afflictions are both grieuous and <note place="margin">1</note> dangerous vnto the godly, except the Lorde doe specially as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them therein. For the reason and vse hereof, see verse. 2. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [dead long agone]</hi> God often bringeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">2</note> to bee of a desperate estate in their outward condition: examples hereof are, the Israelites at the red sea, <hi>Iob, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and many others. The reason is, because, first, God will declare his power the more euidently in their deliuerance: Secondly, that it may appeare that there is no helpe in man. The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to thinke it strange when God dealeth so with vs: secondly, neuer to despayre though wee fall into such extremities; but still to rest vpon the Lord, and to hope for his outstretched arme to deliuer vs.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19537:61"/>
take heed of striuing or murmuring against God, seeing he is strongest and must preuaile.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, because, troubles do first breake the vntamed heart of man: secondly, take away blind pride, and make vs see our selues. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to see the corruption of our nature, that needeth such meanes, or els will not rightly be framed. Secondly, that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are no signes of reprobation, seeing the godly feele them, &amp; waxe the better by them. Thirdly, to giue our selues (especially in affliction) to fasting and praier, seeing the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue done so, and got much comfort thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [also]</hi> The heauiest plague that man can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <note place="margin">2</note> in this life, is to haue God to refuse to heare his prayer when he calleth vpon him in distresse, <hi>Prouer</hi> 1. 28. <hi>lere.</hi> 14. 11, 12. The reason is, because, wee can looke for no helpe in our miseries but from him. The vse is, first, to shewe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding follie of the presumptuous, that doe deferre to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thinking to be heard at any time. Secondly, to teach vs not to put off amendment from day to day, seeing God refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to heare, when his anger is gone out against sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [shutteth out my prayer]</hi> God often deferreth to heare the prayer of his children, when yet he purposeth in <note place="margin">3</note> due time to graunt their requests, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 77. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Obiection, why then are they commanded to pray alwaies? Answere, because he hath promised to heare their prayers, though he hath limited no time thereunto. The reason why he doth so, is first, to trie their patience, &amp; exercise their faith: secondly, to moue them to continue and to grow in feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The vse is, to teach vs, that (howsoeuer our naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction perswadeth otherwise) it is for our good to be deferred now and then, in the obtaining of those petitions, which we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19537:62"/>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [he hath stopped]</hi> This being in effect the same that often hath hetherunto been sayd, teacheth vs this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. <note place="margin">1</note> The often repetition of the greatnesse of our afflictions is profitable for vs. The reason is, because, it worketh vs the better to true sorrowe for it, which is the end of it. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that we are very dull and hard to learne how greatly God is offended with vs. Secondly, that we must bee truely humbled before we can thoroughly repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [stopped]</hi> when God mindeth to continue our <note place="margin">2</note> afflictions, he will frustrate all the meanes vsed to bring vs out of them. The reason is, because, no meanes can preuaile contrarie to his purpose. The vse is, to teach vs, whensoeuer we are crossed in our deuises, not to fret at the instruments thereof, but to acknowledge it to be the worke of God.</p>

The reason is, because, first, his anger is heauie of it selfe, seeing he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Secondly, our sinnes are great and grieuous, deseruing seuere punishment. Thirdly, our strength is most weake whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue to doe with the Lord. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to reuerence and feare him aboue all, that can cast both bodie and soule into hell fire, and to take heed of sinne that maketh him angrie with vs; but wee often doe cleane contrarie: for we feare men so much, as to auoyd their displeasure, wee let not to sinne against the Lord.

The reason is, because his anger is heauie, our sinnes are grieuous, and wee weake: as in the last <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The vse is, first, to confute the errour of satisfaction, seeing we cannot answere to God one for a thousand, <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to teach vs, how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our great corruption is done away. Thirdly, that we may see how needfull it is for vs now and then to feele Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against vs, that wee may thereby learne to knowe our selues, and haue our stubborne hearts broken.</p>

same: Examples hereof, <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren selling him into Egypt; The Iewes putting Christ to death, &amp;c. The reason is, because man purposeth many things peruerslie, which God disposeth to his glorie, <hi>Prouer.</hi> 16. 1. 33. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to magnifie the mightie power and wisedome of God in all things. Secondly, to acknowledge (as the trueth is, and often appeareth to vs by experience) that when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth our purposes and actions to another end, it is the onlie wisest and best way for vs that could be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [pulled in pieces]</hi> God often bringeth a people, <note place="margin">2</note> yea and one man, vnto a most desperate condition, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnrecouerable in the iudgement of flesh and bloud. The reason is, because he will shewe his mightie power in bringing to the gates of hell, and restoring thence againe. The vse is, to teach vs, neuer to despayre, but still to trust in the Lord whatsoeuer extremities we fall into.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [desolate]</hi> God often leaueth his people desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <note place="margin">3</note> of all outward helpe and comfort: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5.</p>

Examples hereof, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15. The reason is, because, he is slowe to anger, and desireth rather our repentance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 13. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to acknowledge Gods great mercie towards vs, in that he giueth vs warning by the preaching of his word.

                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The plagues that God layeth vpon his people <note place="margin">3</note> doe not onely touch their bodies, but also they enter in most grieuous manner into their hearts and soules, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 2. 3. The reason is, because, first, else were they not afflicted as Christ their head was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. &amp;c. Secondly, the soule first and chiefly sinneth. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre though we be afflicted both in soule and body.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [derision]</hi> The godly are vsually more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to reproches, then any other people. Examples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">1</note> bee in all ages, as, <hi>Habel, Isaac, Israel</hi> often, <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles. The reason is, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause godlinesse seemeth meere foolishnes to them that are naturally minded. Secondly, they shew (as they thinke) their owne wisdome in disdainful contemning of the godly. The vse is to teach vs, first, that reproches and scoffes are notes of the godly. Secondly, to prepare our selues to bee subiect vnto the same condition, if wee looke to be of the number of those that walke in true godlinesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> This following vpon the mentioning of their <note place="margin">2</note> afflictions, teacheth this doctrine. Then are the godly most derided by the wicked, when the hand of God is heauiest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onthem, to afflict them. Examples hereof are, <hi>Dauid, Iob, Ieremy, Christ, &amp;c.</hi> The reason is, because, first, man iudgeth after the outward apparance: Secondly, the godly seeme then to be in a desperate condition. The vse is, to teach vs,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19537:64"/>
first, to knowe the disposition of the wicked, who (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they seeme to be to vs in our prosperity) will shew their malice against vs in our afflictions: Secondly, to looke for reproach in euery time of trouble, for else it is nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [to all]</hi> all sortes of people (though diuers one <note place="margin">3</note> from another) doe deride the godly in their aduersitie. This is verified in the Examples of all ages. The reason is, because, whatsoeuer a wicked man loueth, he will be sure to hate the trueth, and consequently the professors thereof. The vse is to teach vs, not to expect the aduancement of the trueth from worldlings; for wisdome is iustified of her owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my people]</hi> Those that are neerest vnto the <note place="margin">4</note> godly, and not fearing God, will be crosses vnto them in the time of trouble: Examples, <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, 2. 9. and his friends, 4. 6. &amp;c. &amp; many others. The reason is, because the bond of their loue is earthly, and can administer no help to the inner man. The vse is, to teach vs, not to be dismaied when Parents, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, &amp;c. forsake vs: for so it hath been often with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, That religion is not to be professed, neither is it supported by any worldly reasons, or meanes; but by the spirite, and for the hope of life by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [their song]</hi> the wicked doe greatly delight <note place="margin">5</note> themselues in mocking the godly. This appeareth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the foes of <hi>Isaac, Iob, Dauid, Christ,</hi> and others. The reason is, because, first, thereby they thinke to suppresse and disgrace the trueth for euer. Secondly, they think their own follie by that meanes well iustified and aduanced. The vse is, to declare vnto vs what enmitie the vngodly doe beare to the trueth. Secondly, to teach vs to walke wisely least wee giue them matter of triumphing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [all the day]</hi> The wicked are neuer satisfied, but doe still continue their hatred against the godly. The reason <note place="margin">6</note> is, first, because they doe greatly delight therein. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are afraid that they haue neuer done enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame them. The vse is, to teach vs, to looke for continuance in afflictions, when we are in them, &amp; to vse all good meanes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19537:64"/>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [he hath]</hi> This sorrow did arise especially from the derision they were in by their aduersaries, and yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1</note> ascribed vnto the Lord, teacheth vs this doctrine.

                  <hi>Doctrine. [filled me]</hi> This great griefe spoken of vpon the <note place="margin">2</note> derision that they were in, teacheth this doctrine. There is no outward trouble more grieuous to the godly, then to be reproched by their aduersaries in the time of their affliction. The reason is, because, first, we are much comforted in the hope that our sufferings shall aduance the truth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed derision hindereth. Secondly, such reproches are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with much blasphemie and wickednes. Thirdly, such dealing carrieth many weake professors from the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of our cause and sufferings. The vse is, to teach vs; to take to heart the reproches that we suffer for the trueth, euen more then our other afflictions. Secondly, not to be dismaied as though God were not with vs, albeit these things seeme heauy vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr. [bitternesse]</hi> The godly haue often vpon them al &amp; the greatest griefes that can be deuised. The reason is, first, <note place="margin">3</note> that which is the reason of the first <hi>doct.</hi> of the first <hi>ver.</hi> of this chap. Secondly, that God might shew his detestation of sin eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in punishing his own so seuerely. Thirdly, that they may be truely humbled, and sufficiently, which the stoninesse of our nature will hardly yeeld vnto. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to looke for such extremities, and not to promise our selues
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19537:65"/>
securitie in worldly peace. Secondly, to esteeme those heauy crosses good for vs, howsoeuer they be heauy vnto the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [he hath filled]</hi> It is the Lord aboue that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our hearts to be affected with our afflictions, else they <note place="margin">4</note> remaine stonie and astonished. The reason is, because, first, we are naturally hard harted. Secondly, none can deale with the heart but God alone. The vse is to teach vs, first, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the exceeding hardnesse of our hearts naturally: which euery one that rightly discerneth of his owne estate hath experience of. Secondly, to pray earnestly vnto the Lord to mollifie our hard hearts, and to make them supple and pliable to his holy will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The godly may not be as Stoickes, but must be <note place="margin">5</note> most passionate in their afflictions. The reason is, because, first, their sinnes procure them their troubles, which ought to grieue them most of all, that God is offended with them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, God afflicteth that we shuld repent, which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not doe without great remorse. The vse is, to teach vs, in our afflictions to labour our affections hereunto; which is done, first, by meditation of our estate, how corrupt by nature and how miserable by sinne it is. Secondly, by earnest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer to God to frame vs vnto his liking. Thirdly, by watching ouer our owne wayes and shunning the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr. [drunken]</hi> The godly are often so loaden with mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <note place="margin">6</note> that they are exceedingly distracted ther withal, both in body and minde. The reason is, because they furmount their reach and natural strength. The vse is to teach vs, not to despayre, though we neither seeme able to beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then God layeth vpon vs, nor see any issue or meanes to bee rid out of it.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [he hath broken]</hi> The expressing of the same thing in so many tearmes and sentences, teacheth vs this <note place="margin">1</note> doctrine. We must labour in our meditations to exemplifie, and enlarge vnto our owne vnderstanding the miseries that we doe suffer in the time of our afflictions. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, else we vse to passe them ouer with a sigh. Secondly, we shall the more equally iudge of them. The vse is, to teach vs thereby, to make our hearts the fitter to powre out our suplications vnto the Lord, for the feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of our prayer is according to the seriousnes of our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Secondly, that the Lord may see the carefulnesse of our spirits to ponder rightly our wayes, which is a notable motiue to cause him to heare vs.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [with a stone]</hi> The Lord may bring his children <note place="margin">2</note> for their sinnes, into the greatest worldly paine, and yet loue them; Examples hereof, are many in the scriptures, and in experience: for the reason, and vse hereof, see <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>doct.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [vnder the ashes]</hi> It is not for the godly to stand <note place="margin">3</note> vpon any worldly credite to cleere their cause withall, but onely vpon the testimonie of a good conscience, and the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse of their wayes. The reason is, because God often taketh all outward blessings from his seruants. The vse is, to teach vs, to contemne (in comparison of a good conscience) al that flesh and blood admireth, seeing it is so transitorie, &amp; labor aboue all to be sound in the feare and seruice of God.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my soule]</hi> The outward troubles of the body <note place="margin">1</note> doe often procure affliction to the soule. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first of the sympathie betwixt the one and the other. Secondly, the soule is caried in the body, and must consider the accidents thereof. Thirdly, the soule is chiefe in the sin that procureth affliction vnto the bodie. The vse is, to teach
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19537:66"/>
vs to labour the soule vnto repentance whensoeuer the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath any trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my soule farre from peace]</hi> It is the heauiest of <note place="margin">2</note> all crosses that we can feele in this life, to want the peace of the soule. The reason is, because, first, it is the chiefe and most sensible part of man. Secondly, it respecteth God and his mercie or iustice: but the body hath regard vnto things that are belowe. The vse is to teach vs, first, to pittie them that are afflicted in minde especially, and to praye for them most earnestly. Secondly, to pray to God in our outward affliction to keepe vs in the peace of the soule, so shall al out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles be light vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [I forgate]</hi> God often bringeth his children so farre from prosperitie that they are out of vse with it, and <note place="margin">3</note> thinke not of it. The reason is, because, first, they are so much accustomed there withall. Secondly, they see so little hope of peace and worldly successe. The vse is to teach vs, first, that afflictions are ordinary and continuall exercises for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, God giueth great patience and contentment to those that make right vse of their troubles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> This verse generally teacheth this doctrine: The godly are often brought to such extremitie, as they find <note place="margin">1</note> no way out of it. This appeareth verified in many examples in the scriptures, and by daylie experience. The reason of it is, because, first, God will shew thereby our want of power to help our selues. Secondly, it maketh the foes more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to hasten thereby their ouerthrow. Thirdly, Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is made more manifest in our deliuerance. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to esteeme it a condition which the godly are not subiect vnto, to be so low brought. Secondly, when it is our case to learne therby, first, reuerence of Gods migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19537:66"/>
power and wisdome: secondly, humility: thirdly, patience: fourthly, feruencie in prayer, fiftly, longing after the fruition of the ioyes of heauen, where all miseries haue an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [strength and hope]</hi> according to our strength, <note place="margin">2</note> generally of knowledge and particularly of feeling, so doe we hope. The reason is, because hope is grounded vpon faith, and faith vpon knowledge, without which there is no hope at all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. The vse is, first, to confute their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that say they haue hope when they neither haue any knowledge or care to haue it: Secondly, to teach vs to be as carefull to growe in knowledge, as we are to haue an assured hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my strength and my hope]</hi> the godly in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions <note place="margin">3</note> doe recount what blessings they haue lost. So did <hi>Dauid.</hi> The reason is, because, first, of the loue and delight that they had therein, which is most remembred when it is lost: Secondly, that their hearts may be made the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with griefe for the losse thereof, and with desire to be restored thereunto againe. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to take the same course when we are depriued of any blessing, if we desire to be thoroughly affected there withall. Secondly, to applie it to our selues, as a remedie against despayre: for the consideration of Gods former mercie, giueth hope that he will be fauourable againe; seeing hee is no changeling; &amp; whom he loueth once, to the end he loueth them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [is perished]</hi> the godly doe not alwaies feele the comfort of Gods fauour in the like measure; this is verified, <note place="margin">4</note> not only in the examples of <hi>Iob, Dauid, Ieremie, &amp;c.</hi> but also in the continuall experience of Gods most excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. The reason is, because, first, God will make it the more delightfull vnto them by intermission: Secondly, that they may see what they are, if God should leaue them vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: Thirdly, that they may be the more carefull to vse all good meanes to keepe it whilest they haue it. The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to be dismaied though now and then God hide the fauour of his countenance from vs, seeing he vseth to doe so with his dearest children: Secondly, to make the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19537:67"/>
best of our comforts whilest we doe enioy them, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting thereof may support vs in the time of distresse.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [perished]</hi> the godly are often so grieuously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, <note place="margin">5</note> as they growe to a great measure of desperation: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof, are <hi>Iob, Dauid, Ieremy,</hi> and many other in all ages. The reason is, because, first, of their great weakenesse when God that is strong, trieth them. Secondly, they iudge according to their present feeling. Thirdly, of the conscience of their desertes for sinne. Fourthly, the aboundance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infidelitie, which alwaies being in vs, doth then appeare to haue the greatest power. The vse is, to teach vs, first, when distrust groweth strongest in vs, not to thinke any other, but that God both may, and will raise vs vp againe: so must wee also iudge of others in the like case. Secondly, neuer to yeeld our hearts to be ruled by despayre (howsoeuer it doe long and mightily assaile vs) but to vse all good meanes to stay vs: as, first, reading and hearing the word: Secondly, daylie and earnest prayer: Thirdly, the meditation of our former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: Fourthly, the consideration of fauour restored to other in the like case: Fiftly, and last of all, to bee resolued, as <hi>Iob</hi> was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 15. to trust still in the Lord, though he should kill vs.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, it calleth to minde Gods anger for sinne, which is more heauie to the godly to thinke vpon, then any thing in the world. Secondly, it doth bring againe (as it were) the feeling of paines endured, which recalleth the same (or greater) feare. Thirdly, it administreth doubt whether Gods anger be appeased or no. The vse is, to teach vs, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for vs to be afflicted, because it maketh vs more rightly to consider of our estate. Secondly, when wee desire
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19537:67"/>
to be humbled, and increase in feeling, we must meditate of our sinnes, and the punishments for them, which heretofore we haue felt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [affliction, and weeping]</hi> though griefe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe <note place="margin">2</note> be naturally the effects of affliction, yet in the godly it must be, because of the sinne committed, and not for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty sustained. The reason is, because, first, it is sinne that causeth affliction. Secondly, God afflicteth vs to bring vs to repentance. The vse is, to teach vs, first, in euery affliction to search out our sinnes the cause thereof. Secondly, to labour our hearts to true repentance, which is the cause why wee must be humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [the wormewood and the gall] i.</hi> in recounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">3</note> former thing, we must take onely so much thereof as may serue our turne. The reason is, because, first, it may affect vs the more. Secondly, that our mindes be not imployed about any other matter. The vse is, to teach vs, carefully to vse meanes to keepe our affections to the thing in hand, and to shunne the meanes of the contrary: that is especially to bee put in practise, when we goe about the exercise of the word or prayer, for Sathan will labour to steale our mindes from them.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [throughly remembreth]</hi> There is no meditation that is auaileable to further in godlinesse, but that which is <note place="margin">1</note> earnest and effectuall. The reason is, because, first, els it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the heart. Secondly, nothing els preuaileth with the affections. The vse is, to teach vs, to vse all good meanes to make our reading, hearing, praying, &amp;c. most effectuall vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [my soule]</hi> The heart must be throughly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">2</note> before wee can profite by any action of religion that we take in hand. The reason is, because, first, euery poynt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion concerneth principally the heart. Secondly, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19537:68"/>
nothing, but that which proceedeth from the heart. The vse is, to teach vs, not to content our selues with any outward action, but to labour that it may proceede from the sincere affection of our soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [museth in me]</hi> When we are throughly affected with any part of Gods word, or his workes, then doe wee <note place="margin">3</note> much consider of it, and cannot easilie forget it. The reason is, because, first, it hath taken roote in the heart, which is the fountaine of all serious meditations. Secondly, it setteth the affections on work, to digest it, vnto the end whereunto the heart desireth to bring it. The vse is, to teach vs, to labour that all such serious cogitations may leade vs to growe in true godlinesse: for els they are daungerous, and draw vnto destruction, or some other euill extremitie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [I consider]</hi> It is a speciall stay to the troubled <note place="margin">1</note> heart, to consider how it hath striuen to be at peace. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, it calleth to minde the strife betwixt the flesh and the spirite, which argueth that God hath a portion there. Secondly, it sheweth our desire of weldoing, which must needs be the worke of grace. Thirdly, it daunteth Satan our aduersary, depriuing him of hope to preuaile. Fourthly, it administreth vs hope that wee shall stand euen in the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest temptations. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that in all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we examine our hearts for the time past, how vpright and carefull of weldoing they haue been, so shall we bee the stronger in the day of triall. Thirdly, to beare with patience the present crosse with hope of comfortable issue, though all meanes in mans iudgement be cleane taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [this &amp;c. therefore]</hi> The right and thorough me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation <note place="margin">8</note> of Gods punishments vpon vs for sinne, and our stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to profite thereby, hath alwaies hope for the issue. The reason is, because, first, it taketh away all those refuges which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19537:68"/>
naturally wee flee vnto, as, friends, wit, riches, strength, &amp;c. and forceth vs to flye vnto God. Secondly, the Lord respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and is readie to helpe the broken and contrite hearted, <hi>Isay.</hi> 66. 2. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to lay to heart whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee haue done or left vndone, wherewith God is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Secondly, that we be not dismaied, though griefe for it doe seeme to swallow vs vp: for God will make the end ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as he did to <hi>Iob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [haue hope]</hi> Al our care in peace and in affliction <note place="margin">3</note> must bee how to gather to our selues a certaine hope that God will bee mercifull vnto vs. The reason is, because, first, we haue more neede of it then of all things els. Secondly, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will labour more to depriue vs of it, then of any thing els. The meanes to attaine vnto it, be, first, to search in Gods worde the way to attaine vnto it. Secondly, to learne the markes of those that haue it, as they be there expressed; and to trie our selues whether wee haue them or no. Thirdly, to pray vnto God earnestly to giue vs not onely to haue those markes in vs, but also to bee assured of them, and comforted daylie by them. The vse is, to teach vs, that if we haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace of the heart, and comfort of the soule in Christ Iesus, euery thing is full of ioy vnto vs, though our life seeme most bitter, els are all the ioyes of the world meere miserie vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [will I hope]</hi> It is our duetie to hope for Gods <note place="margin">4</note> fauourable hand to rid vs out of any trouble that we are in, though it continue and increase vpon vs, and no meanes of redresse doe appeare. The reason is, because, first, God afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs not to cast vs off, but to amend vs, and trie vs. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he vseth so to deliuer his seruants. The vse is, to teach vs, contentedly to take, and patiently to endure the afflictions layd vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [therefore will I hope] i.</hi> The consideration of Gods heauie rods vpon vs in this life, giueth vs hope to finde <note place="margin">5</note> fauour for the life to come. The reason is, because, first, God chastiseth those whom he receiueth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a token of bastardie to be without correction. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19537:69"/>
the whole life of the godly hath been continual affliction: Examples hereof, are <hi>Iaacob, Ioseph, Dauid, Ieremy, Israel, &amp;c.</hi> The vse is, to teach vs, first, neuer to promise our selues world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace, if we looke to be in Gods fauour, seeing it is our lot not onely to beleeue in Christ, but also to suffer for his name, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to labour to suffer willingly, seeing it is a note of the godly, and administreth hope. Thirdly, (which is the vse of affliction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12.) to grow more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in good things, and more obedient to the trueth thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[It is the Lords mercie] i.</hi> it ariseth from the abundance of <note place="margin">

Therefore it is not by our owne power and strength, but by Gods infinite mercie, that wee are preserued, <hi>Isay</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [the Lords mercies]</hi> The godly neither can, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looke to escape destruction by any other meanes, then <note place="margin">1</note> onely by the mercies of the Lord, in pardoning their sinnes. The reason is, because, first, in many things we offend all; the least whereof deserueth euerlasting hell fire. Secondly, sinne prouoketh Gods anger which is infinite as himselfe, and can not bee satisfied by any that is no more then a creature. Thirdly. The Scripture maketh Gods mercie the first part of our righteousnesse, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 32. 1. The vse is, first, to confute them, that thinke they haue it in their owne free will to bee saued; and them that looke to obtaine heauen by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Secondly, to teach vs to feare and tremble, that wee fall not into Gods vengeance, and to seeke especially for his mercie, esteeming it aboue our liues, or any earthly thing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19537:69"/>
that we can desire. Thirdly, to acknowledge it to bee of his meere mercie that wee liue, &amp;c. and to praise him daylie for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [Gods mercie that &amp;c.]</hi> The mercies of the Lord <note place="margin">2</note> are sufficient to redeeme all his people from all their sinnes, and to deliuer them from all the punishments that they can fall into. The reason is, because, first, they are infinite as his maiestie is. Secondly, els none should be saued, seeing there is none other meanes of saluation. The vse is, first, to confute Poperie, that resteth vpon workes for deliuerance (at least) from the punishment of sinne: which must needs be a grosse error, seeing the punishment deserued is as infinite, as he that is offended Secondly, to confirme vs against despaire, seeing the Lords mercie is an anchor hold, so sure and stedfast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [that wee are not consumed]</hi> The chiefest of the <note place="margin">3</note> godly when they are at the best, doe deserue Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and vengeance. The reason is, because, first, in manie things wee sinne all, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. and he that faileth in one is guiltie in all, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 10. Secondly, our regeneration is but in part, as experience teacheth. Thirdly, the righteousnesse of the best is mingled with sinne. The vse is, first, to confute the <hi>Cathari,</hi> the Family of loue, and the Papists, that thinke themselues able in this life to fulfil the law of God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it teacheth vs to abandon all pride and securitie from vs, ascribing it vnto God alone that we haue any power to doe well. Thirdly, to acknowledge Gods iustice in all our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test plagues that euer he hath layd, or doth lay vpon any, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their sinnes doe deserue the same.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [compassions fayle not]</hi> Not one of Gods elect <note place="margin">4</note> can finally fall, or possibly perish for euer. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, Gods guifts are without repentance. Secondly, his mercies, whereby they stand, faile not. The vse is, first, to confute Poperie, that teacheth saluation or damnation to be in our owne power.

                  <hi>Doctrine. [euery morning]</hi> God neuer suffereth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be tempted aboue their strength, though hee punish <note place="margin">1</note> them now and then for their sinnes. The reason is, because, first, he knoweth their weaknesse, and respecteth it in fauour. Secondly, else should none be saued.

be saued because of our naturall miserie. Thirdly, hee hath giuen his sonne Christ Iesus to euery one of his seruants, and so with him all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. The vse is, first, to confute the opinion of workes foreseene, seeing we could haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing foreseene in vs but that which he had appointed to giue vs. Secondly, to ouerthrow their pride that swel in that they haue: for what haue they that they haue not receiued? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. 7. &amp;c. Thirdly, to teach vs to be humbled with the view of our owne nakednesse and pouertie.

The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to trust in the outward seruice of God prescribed in his word, seeing it is abhominable before God, without the pure affection of the heart. Secondly, not to esteeme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their outward profession onely, except we see such fruits as must needes come from the heart. Thirdly, that all shewes of religious deuotion, without warrant of the word, be sinne. This confuteth all the deuises of Poperie, that men haue inuented and do make so much of.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. &amp;c. Secondly, God wil haue none of his glorie giuen to any other. Thirdly, none can doe any thing for vs, or against vs, without his power assisting them. The vse is to teach vs, first, that none can perseuere vnto the end, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in hope of saluation, vnlesse he rest in God alone: and therefore neither Infidels that beleeue not Gods word, nor Papists that relie so much vpon Saints, nor ignorant ones that are without knowledge, and so without fayth, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient persons that tarie not Gods leysure, but vse vnlawful meanes, can by any meanes haue part of this perseuerance.

                  <hi>Doctrine. [the Lord is good]</hi> Gods goodnesse sheweth it <note place="margin">1</note> selfe dayly and bountifully to his people. This is verified in the examples of the whole scriptures, and in daylie experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to their bodies and their soules in matters peculiar to them, and common with the wicked: for this life, to prouide for the body and comfort the soule: for the life to come, to deliuer from hel and bring to heauen. The onely reason hereof, is, because his good pleasure is such. The efficient cause, is his loue: the materiall cause is, the obedience of his sonne: the end is, his glory, and our saluation. The means whereby he conueigheth it vnto vs, is, his word and his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. This hath been manifested in all ages, as the booke of God and dayly experience doth witnesse. The vse is, first, to teach vs to magnifie his exceeding loue vnto his children, whom he might haue created the vilest of his creatures, and after haue cast them into hel fire with the diuel and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Secondly, to allure vs to serue him in al feare and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; or else to leaue vs the more cleerly without excuse, at the day of account.</p>

The reason is, because, first, they beleeue them to be vndoubtedly true. Secondly, they are assured in their hearts to be partakers thereof, because they finde the notes of the godly in themselues. Thirdly, they are assured of his loue to them, his power to doe what he list, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to bestow and performe when he seeth meete, that which may tend to his glorie and their good. The vse is to teach vs, first, to trie our selues; if we can finde our selues so affected, to reioyce and goe on: if not, to repent of it and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. Secondly, to strengthen our patience in euery tryall, which is the exercise of our faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [to the soule that seeketh him]</hi> The greatest care <note place="margin">3</note> that Gods seruants should haue in this life, is to seeke the Lord (how he may be knowne and feared aright) by those meanes that he hath appoynted thereunto. The reason is, because, they can finde no peace in any other thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the same; if they doe, their case is fearefull. Secondly, they know that the treasure of all good things must needes be in the true knowledge and worship of him that made and gouerneth the whole world, and all that is therein. Thirdly, they haue heretofore found much comfort therein, which encouraged them thereunto euery daye more and more. The vse is, to trie our selues how carefull we are herein; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the excusing or accusing of our hearts: and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by our care and diligence in hearing, reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and prayer. Secondly, to reprooue them, as giuing fearefull tokens of being without God in this world, who make no care to seeke him according to his word.</p>

The reason is, because, first, it setteth the heart at rest, which maketh all outward troubles easie to be borne. Secondly, it sharpeneth the affections in all spirituall exercises, especially in the longing for heauen. The vse is to teach vs, to vse all good meanes to attaine vnto it, and to account all things vile in respect of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [to trust]</hi> we must trust in the Lord, though the things that we desire appeare not. The reason is, because, <note place="margin">2</note> first, God often hideth his countenance from his seruants, to trie them. Secondly, we knowe God will be as good as his promise, being neuer yet iustly charged to be short of his word. Thirdly, it is the nature of faith to trust to obtaine that which appeareth not, <hi>Rom.</hi> S. 24. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. thoroughout. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that we may not alwaies looke to haue the present enioying of that comfort, which God hath promised, and we desire; seeing it shall sometimes be ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed vnto vs. Secondly, to hope certainely for whatsoeuer God hath promised, though we feele it not, and not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>

meanes to bring a man vnto true godlinesse. The reason is, because, first, our nature is otherwise vntameable, &amp; will not receiue instruction, <hi>Psal</hi> 119. 67. &amp;c. Secondly, it bringeth vs to the consideration of our selues, and (if God blesse it) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth many sinnes that in prosperitie we runne into. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to esteeme afflictions most necessary for vs. Secondly, to knowe that when God afflicteth vs, it is to frame vs to his will, and to learne to profit thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [yoke]</hi> afflictions are heauie and vnsauorie to <note place="margin">2</note> flesh and blood. The reason is, because, first, they crosse the naturall desires thereof. Secondly, they drawe vs to that, which naturally we haue no will vnto. The vse is, first, to shew vs the peruersenesse of our nature, that doth so greatly mislike that which is so good for vs. Secondly, not to be cast downe, though we feele the waight of afflictions very heauy vnto vs: but to beare them willingly and patiently, seeing we haue benefit by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [in his youth]</hi> The sooner that we be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">3</note> with afflictions, the better it is for vs. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, younger yeares are more plyable to any instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as we see in the learning of humaine artes or tongues; yea in the taming of any wilde beast. Secondly, longer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome thereunto, maketh it more easie and more profitable vnto vs. The vse is to teach vs, first, the cause why the godly haue (almost) with the profession of religion, entred into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions. Secondly, that though our afflictions begin and end with our life; yet are we not to be cast downe or grieued but to reioyce in it, seeing it is good for vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[He sitteth alone and is silent] i.</hi> in quiet maner he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 28.</note> the affliction, and meditateth secretly of it <hi>[because he hath layd it vpon him] i.</hi> seeing the Lord Almighty, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, hath laid his rod vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [sitteth alone, &amp;c.]</hi> Afflictions do frame Gods <note place="margin">1</note> people to patience, and humilitie. The reason is, because, first, their vnbrideled stomacke is broken thereby. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their sinnes and desert thereof be layde before their eyes by them. Thirdly, Gods ineuitable hand is seene in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:19537:73"/>
Fourthly, they obtaine much profite in godlinesse by them. The vse is, first, to teach vs, that they are necessary for vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to trie our selues by our increase in patience and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, how much we haue profited by such afflictions as we haue suffered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [alone and is silent]</hi> Afflictions doe giue vs iust occasion of meditation for the examination of our selues, <note place="margin">2</note> what is amisse in vs. The reason is, because, first, God (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iust) wil not punish vs without our desert thereof. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he wil not withdraw his rod to our comfort, without our amendment. Thirdly, we cannot throughly amend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out serious meditation. Fourthly, the heart is much eased with a thorough examination of ourselues, and calling vpon God for the amendment of that is amisse. The vse is, to teach vs, that when we be afflicted, we must enter into such an account with our selues, if we looke for any profite by the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [he hath laid it]</hi> The godly are contented to <note place="margin">3</note> beare whatsoeuer the Lord laieth vpon them. The reason is, because, they haue deserued much more at his hands. The vse is to teach vs, first, to trie our selues whether wee be so affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or no. Secondly, to labour more and more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with whatsoeuer condition it shall please the Lord to lay vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[He giueth his mouth to the dust] i.</hi> he humbly throweth downe himselfe before GOD, acknowledging al to be iust <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Doctrine. [he putteth]</hi> The godly, hauing rightly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their afflictions, doe reuerence Gods power in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them, and doe humble themselues vnder his hand. The reason is, because, first, they are assured of his power, wisdome, and loue. Secondly, they wil not be driuen from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19537:73"/>
him by any extremity, knowing that out of his fauour there is nothing but horror. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to iudge of the crosse according to our owne carnall reason, but according to Gods iustice and righteousnesse. Secondly, to striue to accept patiently whatsoeuer he layeth vpon vs, bee it neuer so extreame and grieuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [it may be there is hope]</hi> we must trust in God, <note place="margin">2</note> and waite for the performance of his promises, though there be no hope in the iudgement of flesh and blood. The reason is, because, first, he is both able and willing to bee as good as his worde, though hee haue reserued the time when, in his owne power. Secondly, he hath alwaies in greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities deliuered his people. Thirdly, hee bringeth vs into straights to trie vs. Fourthly, it is the nature of fayth not to be quailed, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 4. The vse is to teach vs, first, that faith is a thing that reason or mans strength cannot attaine vnto: and therfore we must beg it of God, and vse the meanes that hee hath appoynted in his worde to attaine vnto it, and to grow in it. Secondly, to trie our selues how strong in fayth wee bee, by our resolution and perswasion of a ioyful issue, though we be in the greatest straights that any of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue fallen in to.</p>
               <p>

The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <note place="margin">1</note> first, they know it cannot be done by them without the Lord. Secondly, they are assured that it is for their good. The vse is, first, to reproue the impatiencie and reuenge that naturally we are addicted vnto. Secondly, to teach vs to trie our selues how much wee haue profited by affliction, by the measure of patience (being iniuried) that we haue attayned vnto.</p>

                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:19537:74"/>
vexation by the hands of all sortes of men. The reason is, because, first, whatsoeuer the wicked do loue, they are haters of the trueth, and the professours thereof. Secondly, the godly are not of this world, but chosen out of it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, they doe not runne to the same excesse of riot with the wicked, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. The vse is to teach vs, first, to looke for many and diuers molestations from the wicked in this world. Secondly, to learne to take them patiently, and so profit in godlinesse by them.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [for]</hi> An assured hope of deliuerance groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Gods promises, is the onely cause of the patience <note place="margin">1</note> and humilitie of Gods children in their troubles. The reason is, because, first, the corruption of mans nature being of it selfe wayward, cannot take afflictions patiently, without su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall helpe: therefore we say without hope the heart would breake. Secondly, where there is no hope, there is no fayth: where there is no faith, there is no comfort to giue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Thirdly, else the damned might haue patience which they haue not, as appeareth by their gnashing of teeth. The vse is, to teach vs to be carefull to vse the means of obtayning hope, and growing in it, praysing GOD for such meanes as we haue, and mourning for that we want.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [forsake]</hi> The godly in the extremities of their afflictions, do somtime imagine that GOD hath forsaken <note place="margin">2</note> them. The reason is, because, first, their guilty conscience acknowledgeth al damnation due vnto them. Secondly, the waight of Gods anger that darkeneth their faith for the time. Thirdly, God doth thereby make them knowe what they are without him, &amp; causeth them to make more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account of his fauour, when it is renued vnto them. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to cast off all hope either of our selues, or others, though we be brought to the pit of despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19537:74"/>
in our owne iudgements. Secondly, to distrust our owne strength and know the weaknesse thereof, that we may grow more and more in knowledge and in the fruits of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [for euer]</hi> It is impossible that God should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake <note place="margin">3</note> for euer, any one of his children. The reason is, because, first, whome once he loueth, to the ende hee loueth them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 1. seeing his giftes are without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> else none could haue hope in their troubles but all must needes despayre. The vse is to teach vs, first, how to vnderstand the speech in the scripture that saith, God repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Secondly, that it is spoken according to mans capacitie, for that it seemeth so to vs when hee stayeth his threatned iudgements. Thirdly, vpon what ground to condemne their doctrine that think any of the elect ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perish, or any of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates be saued. Fourthly, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted in our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, seeing we once felt comfort, and God is no changeling.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [if he afflict]</hi> God doth necessarily afflict one <note place="margin">1</note> waie or other, euery one of his children. The reason is, because, first, euery one angreth him by those sinnes which he dayly committeth. Secondly, correction is a seale of Gods loue towards them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them, if it be rightly taken, and vse made of it. The vse is, first, to reproue their iudgements as most foolish, that thinke them the greatest sinners, that haue the most grieuous punishments in this life. Secondly, to teach vs not to pray for a freedome from afflictions in this life, for that were against faith and Gods loue to vs. Thirdly, to reioice in troubles, enduring them patiently though they be most bitter to our nature, and to praise God for them, seeing we haue (or may haue) so many benefites with them.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, because, first, else none could stand, seeing the weaknesse of mans nature would yeeld vnto the least temptation. Secondly, it is an insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable propertie of God to shewe mercie, whensoeuer it is expedient for any of his seruants, <hi>Isay</hi> 54. 7, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 33. 34 <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 2.

Secondly, man is not able of himselfe to thinke a good thought, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. al his righteousnesse being as a filthie cloute, <hi>Isay</hi> 64. 6. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to be humbled in the consideration of our owne miserable estate without Gods mercie. Secondly, to seeke onely to God for all good things, vsing the meanes approued by his word for the obtaining of the same, and auoyding all other.

The reason is, because, first, Gods mercie is ouer all his workes, and reioyceth against iudgement. Secondly, his mercie is infinite as his maiestie, and cannot be ouercome of sinne. The vse is, first, to confute the Popish distinction of veniall and mortall sinnes: for the greatest are veniall if God forgiue them, and the least mortall if he shewe not mercie. Secondly, to teach vs, to admire Gods great mercies towards vs, and not to take libertie to sinne thereby, but to vse the

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:19537:76"/>
the wicked be raysed vp by Gods hand to afflict his people for their sinnes, yet shall they not thereby be excused, but (without repentance) condemned for it. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, it is here sayd that GOD alloweth of no such thing. Secondly, to condemne the innocent and iustifie the vngodly, are both an abomination vnto the Lord, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, though God worke their action, yet is he farre from the euil of their affection therein: for hee hath one purpose in it, which is most holy, and they another which is 'most wicked, <hi>I say</hi> 10. 5. 12 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, they shall not be held excused, seeing Gods purpose therein is not onely to feare his children from offending, but also to make the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the wicked the more iust, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 33. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God hath such loue to his children, that he hath giuen speciall charge for their defense, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 105. 15. and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned seuere punishments to fall vpon their oppressors, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 14. The vse is, to teach vs, first, what cause the wicked haue to be afrayd of, shewing violence to any of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Secondly, to doe no wrong vnto others by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nor any way lay the blame vpon God for any thing, seeing that were to aggruate our owne offences.

                  <hi>Doctrine. [to stampe, &amp;c]</hi> It is the lot of the godly to bee <note place="margin">2</note> oppressed and abused by the wicked in this world. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, they think it a speciall meanes to make them fall from the trueth, and terrifie others from belieuing it, seeing them so numbred among the wicked, and seeing bondage crosseth our natural affection Secondly, God seeth afflictions profitable to his people, to bridle their natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and to make them haue the pleasures of this life in lesse account. The vse is, first, to reproue the corrupt iudgement of them that account all that are in affliction as most wicked and miserable, seeing it was euer the condition of the best: Examples hereof, <hi>Iaacob, Ioseph, Ieremie, Dauid, Christ,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19537:76"/>

[all the prisoners]</hi> Though magistrates haue <note place="margin">3</note> power from God ouer the subiects bodies, yet will hee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish al wrongs, and want of protection, that they vexe them withall. The reason is, because, first, their power is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, but limited to the rule of Gods word. Secondly, there is no respect of persons with God, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 82. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34. The vse is, first, to teach all superiors to take heede, lest they goe beyond the power that GOD hath giuen them, seeing the mischiefes are infinite that flowe from misgouernment. Secondly, to teach vs rather to suffer then to bee a meanes of euil, though the magistrate should iudge vs to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [to wrest, &amp;c.]</hi> It is the lot of Gods children to be oppressed before magistrates by false accusers and lying <note place="margin">4</note> witnesses: Examples hereof, are <hi>Naboth, Christ, Steuen,</hi> &amp;c. The reason is, because, first, the tongue is most easily abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Secondly, the trueth is thereby most disgraced, seeing it carieth a shew of being done iustly. Thirdly, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made the more like to Christ our head. The vse is, first, to teach vs, not to be too much dismaied with such dealings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, seeing it is the lot of the righteous. Secondly, to teach magistrates to search out such false accusers, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and to punish them with that they sought to lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the innocent: for so should it be by the law of God: the want of practise whereof maketh both Church and common weale to flow with false accusers.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [to ouer-beare, &amp;c.]</hi> It is the lot of the godly to be ouer-borne by the wicked in euery controuersie.

The vse is, to teach vs, first, to auoyd all occasions of hauing controuersie with the wicked, as much as may be. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not therefore onely to esteeme a man faultie because he is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19537:77"/>

The reason is, because, God is not only iust in all his owne wayes, but also a seuere reuenger of the vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of men. The vse is, to teach vs, of what condition soeuer wee bee, to take heede that wee doe not wrong any man, either couertly or openly, seeing GOD will call all men to accompt, and iudge of euery one according to his deedes.</p>

The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, God is Almightie; that is, all might and power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming onely from him: therefore is he said to make the earth swallow vp his foes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 31. to remoue mountaines, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 5. to measure the windes and waters, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. 25. to turne mans heart, and send plagues, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to say to the North, giue, <hi>Isay</hi> 43. 6. and to the deeps, be drie, <hi>Isay</hi> 44. 27. to deuide the roaring sea, <hi>Isay</hi> 51. 15. and to be are rule ouer the kingdomes of the earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 29. The vse is to teach vs, first, howe bruitish they bee that thinke to doe any thing as of themselues, or (as it were) not regarding, or, in despite of the Lord: to such he giueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table foyles euen in this world; as, to <hi>Pharaoh, Exod</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Senacherib, Isay</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to acknowledge his mighty power, and in all things that we take in hand, to bee sure we haue the warrnt of his word, crauing his strength to assist vs therein.</p>

The reason is, because (as in the former doctrine) all power is of God: so as, man hath no power but from him, and yet is he not the author of sinne, seeing hee doth all things to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, and with a most pure affection: whereas man doing the selfe same action, hath a sinister purpose in it, and doth it with a sinful affection, which maketh it a sinfull action in him: this is euident in the selling of <hi>Ioseph into Egypt:</hi> in the spoyling of <hi>Iob:</hi> and crucifying of Christ: all which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he did to an holy ende, with a most pure affection: but man did them to an euil intent, with a corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The vse is, to reproue them that thinke the Lord doth onely suffer many things to be done, and yet the scripture tearmeth him a doer (and not onely a sufferer) of such kind of actions, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 3. he hardened <hi>Pharohs</hi> heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 13.

The reason is, because (as in the former doctrine) he is the principall doer of all things. The vse is, first, to confute the vaine opinion of Fortune, whereunto the Philosophers and carnall ignorant people vse to ascribe the thing whereof they see not an apparant cause. Secondly, to teach vs to acknowledge him the author of our good, and praise him for it: and not to stay vpon the meanes as naturally we do: and to take patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly afflictions as from him, not fretting at the instruments, which could doe nothing without him, but finding the cause in our own sins: as the next verse teacheth.</p>

Secondly, hee wanteth Gods spirite which is the worker of patience, and comfort in distresses. The vse is, first, to declare vnto vs in what miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are by nature, if God should leaue vs therein. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs to trie our selues in all afflictions, what measure of godlinesse we haue by the power that patience hath in vs to rule our naturall affections.</p>

Thirdly, our nature is so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that of it selfe it can doe no good thing. Fourthly, Sathan laboureth to keepe vs in error. Fiftly, God onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth to weldoing, which naturally we are farre from.

The reason is, because, first, GOD is iust, and cannot doe any wrong. Secondly, all men commit many sinnes, the least whereof deserue all that can be layd vpon vs. The vse is to teach vs, first, in al our afflictions to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our sinnes to be the cause therof, and to learne to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereby to amendment.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [let vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.]</hi> Those that will soundly turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, must diligently examine their former life. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">1</note> is, because, first, none can repent him of that which hee doth not seriously thinke of. Secondly, repentance is not sound if any knowne sinne bee not particularly repented of. Thirdly, it will lay the multitude of his sinnes before him at once, which wil grieue him and humble him the more. The vse is to teach vs, first, that they are farre from repentance, which goe on sleepily in a carnall course, not recounting what they haue been. Secondly, that if we will prooue to our selues that we doe truely repent, wee must heedfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with this searching of our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [trie]</hi> In examining our selues (which is the <note place="margin">2</note> beginning of true conuersion) we must trie our former beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, how agreeable it hath been to Gods will. The reason is, because, else we cannot loath and leaue that is amisse, and goe on in that which is well. The vse is to teach vs, first, that they are farre from conuersion that are ignorant of Gods word, the touch stone in this triall. Secondly, that we must be carefull to obtaine the knowledge of Gods will, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our selues continually by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [turne]</hi> It is nothing that we looke to our waies and see what is amisse therein, except wee repent of it, aske <note place="margin">3</note> God forgiuenes, beleeuing to obtaine remission, and leade a new life. The reason is, because, first, the knowledge of our sinnes (if wee goe no further) shall doe vs no good, but make our condemnation more iust, euen in our owne iudgement. Secondly, we arh to trie, and search our waies,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19537:79"/>
to the end that wee may turne vnto the Lord. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that they are neuer the neerer to God, that can talke much of their owne sinnes, and Gods mercies, if they haue no reformation in their liues. Secondly, to bee carefull (if we will proue our selues rightly to feare God) that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our selues, in whatsoeuer Gods word condemneth, and walke in that which is prescribed by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Let vs lift vp our hearts] i.</hi> by heartie prayer send vp our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 41.</note> petitions <hi>[with our hands] i.</hi> and lift vp our hands; that by that outward gesture, our affections may bee more stirred vp vnto prayer <hi>[vnto God] i.</hi> vnto the creator and gouernor of the whole world, that onely is able and willing to forgiue vs our sinnes <hi>[in the heauens] i.</hi> aboue all earthly things: and therefore our faith must looke vpward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [let vs lift vp &amp;c.]</hi> True repentance worketh in vs most earnest and heartie prayer. The reason is, because, <note place="margin">1</note> first, in it, we see our miserie in our selues, and what need we haue to seeke to God for helpe. Secondly, it assureth vs of Gods loue to vs, and readinesse to heare vs. Thirdly, it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth vs to call vpon the Lord, who in our conuersion hath giuen vs experience of his vnspeakable mercies. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to be as diligent in performing this prayer aright, as wee are desirous to proue to our owne hearts that our repentance is vnfained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [our hearts]</hi> Prayer to GOD consisteth not in words, but in the feruent and faithfull lifting vp of the heart. <note place="margin">2</note> The reason is, because, first, God is a spirit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 24. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth not the outward action in his worship. Secondly, diuers haue prayed aright, that haue vttered no words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that thinke prayer standeth in saying ouer certaine sentences; which is the disposition of all men naturally; but the Papists exceed in it; of whom the saying of the Prophet is verified, <hi>Isay</hi> 29. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to teach vs, to take heede that in prayer our hearts be set vpon that we pray for, and neither be carried away with any other by-thoughts, nor contented with an ordinarie affection therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:19537:79"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [our hands]</hi> Wee may vse all outward meanes <note place="margin">3</note> (that haue warrant in the word) to stirre vp our affections, to be more seruent in prayer. The reason is, because, first, we are naturally dull in it. Secondly, our hearts are often moued with the things that our out ward sences doe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. The vse is to teach vs, first, to what ende kneeling, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the eyes, and hands, &amp;c. are commended vnto vs, in the holy scriptures; to wit, not as partes of Gods seruice, but as meanes to further vs in it. Secondly, to take heede that we rest not in any of these outward things, but be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to the in ward duety by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [vnto God]</hi> All our prayers are to be made vnto <note place="margin">4</note> God alone, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. The reason is, because, first, it is he only that can grant our requests. Secondly, we are not commanded in the scriptures to call vpon any other: and therefore if we doe, it is not of faith; and consequently it is sinne. The vse is, first, to reproue the dotage of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that prayed to the sunne, moone, and starres: and of the Papists, that pray to Angels, and Saints. Secondly, to teach vs to make all our prayers vnto the Lord alone, in the name of his sonne Christ, for such things as he hath promised in his word, and in such maner as he hath prescribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [in the heauens]</hi> The prayer of the faithfull <note place="margin">5</note> must neuer rest vpon anything in this world, but looke vnto the mighty God, the author of all things. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause faith reacheth aboue reason, or things that are seene. The vse is to teach vs, not to measure our hope when wee pray, by our owne worthinesse or vnderstanding, but by the promise of God, grounded vpon his power and trueth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[We haue sinned]</hi> The hebrue word signifieth, a failing, or comming short of our duetie: the meaning is, wee haue <note place="margin">

               <p>The three first doctrines are gathered generally out of this large confession following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:19537:80"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The time of affliction requireth a speciall kinde <note place="margin">1</note> of shewing our repentence, both more feruent, and with longer continuance then ordinarie. The reason is, because, first, God therefore afflicteth vs, that we might be brought to a more thorough repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, Gods anger against vs for our sinnes, is manifested vnto vs by afflictions: which must be turned away by our vnfained repentance, or we shall be consumed. Thirdly, God hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually brought his people to such speciall declaration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and blessed them therein, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 5. 6. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; <hi>c. Hester.</hi> 4. 16. The vse is, first, to reproue the Papists, that haue set times offasting euery yeare, whether they haue cause to mourne or to reioyce. Secondly, to reproue earn all professors that thinke fasting, &amp;c. to pertaine to the olde Church onely, and not to vs; seeing Christ said, it should be also somtimes vnder the Gospell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, it techeth vs, that we must performe especial dueties, both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate &amp; publique, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the punishing hand of God is vpon vs in particular, or the Church in general. Fourthly, it sheweth that afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is most profitable for vs, seeing it increaseth our repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, &amp; whetteth the feruencie of ouraffectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine,</hi> It is necessary for Gods people to begin their prayers to God with a free confession of their sinnes, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 32. 5. <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 6. The reason is, because, first, els wee obtaine no forgiueuesie. Secondly, else wee haue no assurance that we haue repented, seeing confession doth alwaies accompanie repentance. Thirdly, otherwise we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly and thoroughly condemne our selues, and cleere the Lord for punishing vs. Fourthly, by the confession of our sinnes, we are the more humbled, and pepared the better to prayer. The vse is, first, to reprooue all them that iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselues like the proud Pharisie, and offer vp their owne workes for satisfaction vnto God, as the Papistes doe. Secondly to reproue them that will not gladly beare sharp reproofe for their sinnes, nor be contented to be censured by those meanes that God hath prescribed in his worde for the same purpose. Thirdly, it teacheth vs for to loue them that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19537:80"/>
admonish vs often, and reproue vs sharpely, when we haue offended, esteeming them our deerest friends, and auoyding such as flatter, as <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 18. seeing it is the meanes to bring vs to this confession, which is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> It furthereth to thorow repentance that Gods <note place="margin">3</note> people doe in their prayers adioyne to their confession of sinnes, a recitall of the iudgements that are vpon them for the same. The reason is, because, first, they may thereby (if they will learne them by no other meanes) know and think vpon the multitude, and heynousnes of their offences. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thereby they are made to feele what neede they stand in of Gods mercie, that they may the more earnestly seeke to him in feare and trembling. Thirdly, Gods mercie is readiest for them that most freely acknowledge his iustice in punishing them. Fourthly, to teach vs to recount Gods iudgements vpon our selues, and others, generally or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that we may be the better humbled and fitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [sinned: heb. failed]</hi> Euery childe of GOD is <note place="margin">4</note> iustly punished that fayleth in any duety whatsoeuer it bee, that God hath commanded him in his word. The reason is, because, first, all are his creatures, and are to bee obedient wholly to his commaundements. Secondly, hee made vs able in our creation to fulfill his whole law. Thirdly, the least failing in our duety, is sinne that prouoketh Gods anger, and bringeth a curse, seeme it neuer so trifling a matter in our corrupt iudgement, The vse is, first, to reproue the Papists, that turne many of Gods commandements into counsels, aud so make them not enioyned vnder paine of Gods curse: also accounting many sinnes veniall in themselues. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to reproue them that thinke themselues wronged, if they be punished, &amp; haue not fallen into notorious grosse sinnes; neuer remembring that dueties must be done, as well as vices auoyded. Thirdly, to teach vs, to acknowledge God to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, iust and righteous, whatsoeuer he lay vpon vs here: also uot to content our selues with a ciuill life, seeing we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19537:81"/>
to doe whatsoeuer God hath commaunded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [rebelled]</hi> It is rebellion against the Lord, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise <note place="margin">5</note> any of his lawes, though all humaine lawes should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue vs therein. The reason is, because, first, God is king of kings, and will be serued without exception. Secondly, else God should yeeld vnto men. Thirdly, wee are to obey men (onely) in the Lord, and no further. The vse is, first, to reproue rulers that require obedience of their subiects to all their owne decrees, not regarding whether God bee disobeyed thereby or no. Secondly, to reproue them that pretend mans lawe to defend themselues in their sinnes; as in the breach of the Sabboth, contentednesse with the dumbe Ministerie, putting of money to vsurie, &amp;c. Secondly, it teacheth vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to hold this both in iudgement and practize, <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God then men, Acts 5. 29.</hi>

                  <hi>Doctrine [not spared]</hi> No excuse nor priuiledge can shield <note place="margin">6</note> any man from Gods plagues for sinne. The reason is, because, first, God cannot hold the wicked innocent. Secondly, God must necessarily in loue correct his children, that they may know their sinnes, and the desert thereof, and be reformed thereby. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to gather the heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our sinnes by the grieuousnes of our punishments. Secondly, to shun all excuses by priuiledge of birth, wealth, authoritie, &amp;c. (for no excuse will serue) but to acknowledge Gods iustice and mercie in punishing vs. Thirdly, so often as we are any way afflicted, to labour to amend our liues, if we looke to be cased.</p>

[not spared]</hi> Men feele not Gods hand suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <note place="margin">5</note> to be humbled thereby, except the Lord smite them most seuerely. The reason is, because, first, of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blindnesse and blockishnesse to follow that which is righteous in Gods sight. Secondly, such is our hypocrisie, that else we would seeke shifts. Thirdly, our course in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is naturally so strong, that it wil not otherwise be stayed. The vse is to teach vs, first, what monsters we are by nature. Secondly, to renounce our selues and all that we can doe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Gods iustice howsoeuer hee punish vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing it to his meere mercy, that there is any good thing in vs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [couered thy selfe, &amp;c.]</hi> The sinnes of Gods people doe often separate betwixt God and them, that his <note place="margin">1</note> mercies might be kept from them, <hi>Isay</hi> 59. 2. <hi>Ieremie</hi> 5. 25. The reason is, because, first, our sinnes prouoke his wrath till it be appeased. Secondly, els we would not much feare Gods anger: such is our corruption. The vse is, first, to reproue them that blame God or his word, ministers or Gods means
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19537:82"/>
that he vseth when any plague is vpon them. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to teach vs to blame our sinnes for euery iudgement that is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. Thirdly, to labour our hearts carefully to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and to obey the Lord, seeing it is the nature of euery sinne, to separate betwixt God and vs, chusing death (if the will of God be such) rather then life by sinfull meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [prayer should not]</hi> God often deferreth to heare <note place="margin">2</note> the prayer of his children when yet hee purposeth in due time to graunt their requests: for the reason, and vse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, see <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>doctr.</hi> 3.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [the sweepings]</hi> When God meaneth thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to humble his people, he maketh them odious in the eies <note place="margin">1</note> of all men, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. The reason is, because, first, hee would take all matter of worldly ostentation from them, which whilest they haue, they are hardly pulled downe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the enemies in the error of their iudgement might haue a perswasion of wel-doing in molesting them. Thirdly, that they may know by experience, the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vanitie of worldly confidence: and so (being out of loue therewith) long for heauen, and delight in heauenly things. The vse is to teach vs, first, the peruersenesse of our disposition, that needeth so sharpe meanes to doe vs good. Secondly, whensoeuer we fall into disgrace with the world, to better our wayes, by leauing our sinnes and being more zealous in godlines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.

The reason is, because he is Almightie, and doth all things, as <hi>vers.</hi> 37. <hi>doct.</hi> 1. The vse is, first, to reproue them that ascribe such things to fortune, and them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect chiefly the instruments of their disgrace. Secondly, to teach vs whensoeuer any such thing befalleth vs, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19537:82"/>
it to be the hand of God vpon vs for our sinnes, and to learne amendment by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [in the middest]</hi> That which tendeth to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the godly, is more generally receiued, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">3</note> tidings whatsoeuer. The reason is, because, first, God will haue it a matter to humble them, and a stumbling blocke to the wicked. Secondly, it is the longing desire of the wicked to fasten any thing vpon the godly that may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to iudge of any by the reporte of the world. Secondly, not to be amazed when it is our case, but to profite by it to amendment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[All our enemies] i.</hi> all that are against vs, of all nations, <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> In that this followeth vpon Gods giuing them ouer into reproach, we learne this doctrine. God must giue <note place="margin">1</note> his people ouer into reproach before that the wicked can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile them. The reason is, for that the tongues aswell as the actions, of all men are directed by the Lord, and stopped at his pleasure. The vse is, to teach vs, to bee humbled by it when wee fall into the reproach of men, acknowledging it the hand of GOD: so did <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Samuel</hi> 16. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [all our enemies haue opened, &amp;c]</hi> It is a special <note place="margin">2</note> propertie of the wicked to rayle at the godly, and reuile them: for the reason, and vse hereof, see <hi>chapt.</hi> 2. <hi>verse</hi> 16. <hi>doctr.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [Feare, &amp;c.]</hi> when the wicked insult against the <note place="margin">1</note> godly, then are they in greater vexation then vnder any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crosse that can befall them. The reason is, because,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19537:83"/>
first, religion it selfe is therby disgraced, which ought to be dearer vnto them then their liues. Secondly, they haue cause to feare that GOD will wholly deliuer them and their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be troden vnder foote of spoylers. The vse is to teach vs, first, to trie our selues how zealous we are of Gods glory, by the measure of our griefe, when the enemies doe blaspheme. Secondly, to striue to take to heart more and more the dishonour of the trueth by the reuilings of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [the pitte]</hi> Gods people are sometimes brought <note place="margin">2</note> to such extremities, as they cannot possiblie see any way to escape. The reason is, because, first, God will let them see that their help is not in themselues, but in him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thereby wee know what grieuous things our sinnes doe deserue to bring vs into. Thirdly, God sheweth vs thereby the hatred of the enemie, that wee may learne to shunne him. The vse is to teach vs, first, not to iudge of our selues or others by the outward estate of his life. Secondly, to looke for such a condition, and to prepare our selues to beare it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [desolation]</hi> when the wicked doe preuaile <note place="margin">3</note> most, then is the miserie of the godly greatest. The reason is, because, they cannot both flourish together. The vse is, to teach vs, to pray heartily vnto GOD for the suppression of the vngodly, and protection of his people from the fury of the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [destruction]</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God bringeth his people into <note place="margin">4</note> straights, it is an easie thing for the wicked to make hauocke of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The reason is, because, first, the Lords stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that was for them, is then turned against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly, the godly hold it lawfull to vse good meanes onely, whereas the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise any, whether good or euill to serue their turne. The vse is, to teach vs, not to wonder at the sodaine grouth of the wicked, but to acknowledge our sinnes that doe giue God such cause to stirre them against vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [destruction]</hi> In the desolation of the Church of God, there doe fall out great distraction, and rents among <note place="margin">5</note>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:19537:83"/>
the members thereof. The reason is, because, first, Gods presence, the bond of their vnitie, is remoued from them. Secondly, they follow their owne deuises, which are all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers one from another. Thirdly, they are ready (in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their nature) each to lay the blame vpon others, and none vpon themselues. The vse is to teach vs, first, to trie thereby who doe feare God soundly, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to take heede that wee bee no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of schisme among brethren whatsoeuer extremitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [mine eye, &amp;c.]</hi> The godly ought more by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">1</note> signes to declare their sorrow for the ouerthrowe of the Church of God, then for anie other calamitie that they can haue share of in this life. The reason is, because, first, Gods glory is thereby defaced. This caused <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 32. 32. and <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 9. 3. to be so earnest, as to neglect their owne felicitie in respect thereof. Secondly, the faith of euery one in particular is much shaken thereby, the meanes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining it being ouerthrowne. Thirdly, those that are lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with vs in the nearest bond, are in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of falling away. Fourthly, the aduersaries mouth is opened to blaspheme, The vse is, to teach vs, when we heare or see this desolation, to labour with our selues that we may be affected with it, and not passe it ouer carelesly, though it goe well with vs in particular: thus did <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [riuers of water]</hi> When teares are shed for the <note place="margin">2</note> ouerthrow of religion, they are vndoubted signes of the true feare of GOD. The reason is, because, first, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Gods spirite dwelleth in that heart, whereby reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which naturally wee regarde not) is made deare
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19537:84"/>
vnto it. Secondly, it argueth a fellow-feeling betwixt the bodie hurt, and the partie weeping; and consequently an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feined in grafting into Christ Iesus. The vse is, to teach vs, to trie our selues, what measure of this sorrowe is in vs, for the desolations that the Church of God hath euery where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Mine eye droppeth] i.</hi> floweth from mee in teares <hi>[and</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [and staieth not]</hi> when God smiteth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without intermission, then ought they to mourne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">1</note> ceasing. The reason is, because, he smiteth to bring them to thorowe repentance; wherunto when they attaine, he wil stay his hand. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that take not their afflictions to heart for amendment, and those that thinke mourning for a day sufficient, <hi>Isay</hi> 58. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to teach vs, to labour our selues, and increase in mourning so long as the Lordes hand continueth heauie vpon his Church in generall, or our selues in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Till the Lord looke downe] i.</hi> till God declare by his fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [till, &amp;c.]</hi> When the Lords correcting hand is <note place="margin">1</note> vpon his people, hee seemeth to neglect them, and not to looke vpon them. The reason is, because, first, he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the feeling of his louing fauour in many respects. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they iudge (especially in their agonie) according to their present feeling. The vse is, to teach vs to vse all good meanes to continue the Lords louing countenance; and if he frowne, not to thinke our selues forsaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [till the Lord, &amp;c.]</hi> The godly in affliction doe neuer giue ouer mourning and humbling themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">2</note> God, till the rodde be remoued. The reason is, because, first, it is the nature of faith, not to be ouercome in affliction. Secondly, they knowe they must be afflicted till they be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently humbled, and therefore they labour to growe in it.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19537:84"/>
The reason is, first, to reproue them that cast off the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of godlinesse, because afflictions goe with it, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this present world with <hi>Demas.</hi> Secondly, to teach vs, not to be so much wearie of the rod, as of our sins that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it vpon vs, because they are not repented of.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [mine eye]</hi> The eye in seeing the outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series that God laieth vpon vs, is a speciall meane to make vs <note place="margin">1</note> the more sorrowfull in heart for it. The reason is, because, first, the sight is the quickest of the senses. Secondly, things seene are most surely and amply knowne and vnderstood, seeing a report may deceiue vs, but not the sight; for that it vieweth all the circumstances, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 31. <hi>&amp;c. Ier.</hi> 52. 10 The vse is, first, to administer comfort vnto those that want their sight, seeing they cannot behold the things that are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, as those that haue it. Secondly, to teach vs to vse our eyes to the beholding of lawfull things onely, lest GOD cause vs to see that which shall make a most deepe impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of griefe into our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [aboue all]</hi> Naturall affection of the most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate <note place="margin">2</note> woman can bring no such griefe of heart, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of the Church of God doth often worke in the godly. The reason is, because, first, they mourne for things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, these for spirituall. Secondly, they haue nothing but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection to set them on worke; these haue Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit also that helpeth them herein, and worketh a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Gods trueth, then any affection of nature can worke in a mother to the child of her wombe. The vse is, to reprooue them that would haue men become voyd of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as the Stoikes; and those that call this sorrow melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, and fantasticall motions; deriding those that do thus mourne. Secondly, to teach vs to learne by the affection of naturall women, how to lament for the decay of religion,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19537:85"/>
and the afflictions of Gods people.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [mine enemies]</hi> The true Church and faithfull people of God doe neuer want enemies whilest they liue <note place="margin">1</note> here, who doe most egerly pursue them, by all meanes seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ouerthrow them. The reason is, because, first, many walke in the broad way, who being of contrarie qualitie to the godly, doe therefore hate them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15. <hi>&amp;c. Psal.</hi> 124. 6, 7. <hi>and</hi> 129. 1. 3. <hi>and</hi> 56. 1 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath disposed that it should bee so, for the more iust condemnation of the wicked, and the greater good of his seruants. The vse is, first, to reproue the Papists, that make multitude, &amp; a visible Monarchie a note of the true Church. Secondly, to teach vs, to take heede of familiaritie with the wicked, lest we be either smitten by them, or drawn to ioyne with them in smiting the innocent. Thirdly, to looke alwaies for such hatred, if wee desire to walke soundly in the waies of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [as a bird]</hi> The godly of themselues are so simple <note place="margin">2</note> and weake, that they can neither preuent, nor withstand the pollicies or strength of their aduersaries. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, GOD vsually chooseth those that bee naturally simple, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore are they termed doues, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74. 19. <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2. 14. sheepe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the godly are but fewe, weake, and making conscience to tye themselues onely to lawfull meanes. The vse is, first, to reproue the Popish error of commending men for their pompous worldly wisedome: also the Iewes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, and politiques, that condemne the meane estate of Christs people and looke onely to the worldly meanes that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do admire. Secondly, to teach vs to look for both subtile, craftie, &amp; open violent enemies, if we will serue God aright.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [without cause]</hi> The wicked are moued by the <note place="margin">3</note> malice of their owne hearts, to persecute the godly, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any cause giuen by them, to moue them thereunto, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 11. 17. The reason is, because, first, the godly are fewer, weaker, simpler, and withdraw themselues from them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, nothing can be iust cause to make one bitter against another but sinne, which the wicked hate not. Thirdly, God in his prouidence hath appoynted it to be so, to shewe his righteousnes in deliuering his, and ouerthrowing the other. The vse is to teach vs, to take patiently the wrongs offered vs by the wicked, seeing they hate vs not for our sinnes, but for the best things in vs, assuring our selues that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God will take our cause into his owne hand.</p>

The reason is, because, first, they beare a deadly hatred to the trueth and professors thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the sting of their euill conscience, that maketh them alwayes feare they shall not preuaile, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 16. 17.

Secondly, that wee may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre, though all meanes be against vs. Thirdly, to giue all praise for the Churches deliuerance vnto God alone, seeing he doth so miraculously worke for it.</p>

The reason is, because, first, Sathan and the wicked doe continually pursue them with deadly hatred, seeking to destroy them. Secondly, God scourgeth euery sonne that he receiueth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to conforme them to Christ their head, to make them out of loue with this life, and to inflame their thirst after that which is to come. The vse is, to reproue all prophane and fearefull men that mislike them that suffer, or dare not suffer for the trueth, thinking them best that suffer least. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs to prepare ourselues to suffer extremities whilest we be here, seeing our lot is to suffer for Christ, if we rightly beleeue in his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [I sayd]</hi> The godly oppressed with miseries, are often brought both to doubt &amp; to despaire for the time, <note place="margin">2</note>

The reason is, because, first, they iudge according to their present feeling. Secondly, mans infirmitie is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prone to infidelitie. Thirdly, God in his wisdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth the feeling of his grace for a time, to let them see themselues, and to make them seeke to him the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly. Fourthly, to make them more thankfull for his grace when they feele it, and more carefull to continue in it. The vse is to teach vs, first, that we are most miserable by nature, if God leaue vs to our selues. Secondly, to looke for heauy temptations in the time of afflictions. Thirdly, not to cast off all hope of recouering, though we seeme to be in a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate condition, but carefullie to vse the meanes thereof, as first, the meditation of our former feeling: secondly, prayer:

The reason is, because, first, their faith can neuer bee quayled, seeing it is that which ouercommeth the world, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, they rest vpon Gods trueth, that fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, and power that ruleth all things.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that their profession was but temporarie when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles doe quaile.

The reason is, because, first, GOD will shewe his anger against sinne in this life, euen vpon his owne seruants. Secondly, that by afflictions they might bee weaned from the delight in this worlde, and made in loue with heauen. The vse is, to teach vs, first, to reprooue them that iudge according to the outward estate of anie, what fauour they are in with the Lord. Secondly, to teach vs, not to promise our selues any worldly successe, but to looke alwayes for the contrarie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [sigh and crye]</hi> The prayer of the godly ought to come from the heart, and to be with greatest feruency that <note place="margin">2</note> may be. The reason is, because, first, God will not be dallied withall, but looketh to the inward affection. Secondly, wee must groane vnder the burthen of that we would bee rid of, and long for that we desire, before God will heare vs. The vse is, first, to reproue the lip-labour of the Papists, and of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant prophane people that thinke, prayer standeth in an ordinarie saying of certen words.

Secondly, to teach vs to renounce (in respect of looking to bee saued by them) all our owne works, esteeming them (as they are) as a filthy cloute in the sight of God, <hi>Isay</hi> 64. 6. and to relie vpon the obedience of Iesus Christ alone, for our saluation, hoping to bee iustified freely by fayth, without the workes of the lawe, <hi>Roman.</hi> 3. 28.</p>

The vse is, to teach vs, that there is no suer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for vs, neither in this life, nor in the time to come, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fauour and loue of GOD, which wee must labour to attaine vnto aboue all things.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [golde darkened]</hi> There is nothing so glorious <note place="margin">1</note> in this life, but it will be made vile when Gods angrie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is vpon it, for the sinnes of men. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, nothing hath excellencie in it, but at his appoyntment and pleasure. The vse is, first, to reproue them that thinke they may flourish, though they neuer meddle with religion, which teacheth the way to attain the fauour of God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to teach vs, so carefull as we are to enioy the things of this life in their kind, to our comfort, to be so diligent to growe in the feare of God, &amp; auoyding of sin, which displeaseth him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [stones of holinesse are scattered]</hi> When GOD giueth power into the handes of the wicked ouer his people, <note place="margin">2</note> they make hauocke of those things that bee most pretious. The reason is, because, first, the power of GOD, which none can resist, is then with them to the same purpose. Secondly, the hatred of the wicked against the godly, reacheth euen to all those things that they haue any vse of. The vse is, to teach vs, to be humbled, whensoeuer it falleth out so with vs, seeing it cannot be but vpon Gods displeasure for our sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [scattered]</hi> Those things that are most pretious in the eyes of the godly, are reiected as worth nothing by <note place="margin">3</note>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:19537:91"/>
the wicked. The reason is, because, first, they are of a contrary disposition; the one louing goodnesse, and the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it; and the other hating whatsoeuer is not euill, or tending thereunto. Secondly, all matters of religion are meere foolishnesse to a naturall man, because they are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually discerned, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. The vse is, to teach vs, to learne to discerne of men whether they bee religiously disposed or no, by their loue or dislike of the meanes that tend to the right worship and seruice of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. The greatest <note place="margin">1</note> reputation that man can attaine vnto in this life, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine estate, and easily taken away, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 12. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, there is no certaintie in any thing vnder the Sunne, <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, God setteth vp, and putteth downe at his pleasure, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, he that vseth his prosperous estate best, deserueth continually to haue it taken from him. The vse is, to teach vs, not to admire the glorious estate of man that is in honour, seeing it is most fickle, nor to set our hearts vpon any thing we enioy in this world, but to vse the things thereof, as if wee vsed them not, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [noble]</hi> The hebrew word signifieth pretious, <note place="margin">2</note> or of especiall estimation; teaching this doctrine. Those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath aduaunced in authoritie aboue others, are to bee reuerenced and honoured aboue others. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, they doe represent the person of God himselfe; for which cause they are called Gods, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they haue that power and authoritie, which should worke
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19537:92"/>
a reuerent feare and awe of them in the hearts of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The vse is, first, to reproue them that do contemne those that are in authoritie, because of their meane priuate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, or faults as they be men, seeing they are to be regarded according to the person they sustaine, and not their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. Secondly, to teach vs, for conscience sake to giue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obedience vnto our gouernours, as vnto the Lord himselfe, whose person they doe represent vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [comparable]</hi> It is a worthie thing in great men, to be adorned with good qualities, so farre exceeding others <note place="margin">3</note> as their calling is aboue them. The reason is, because, first, they shall bee the more able to carrie themselues aright in their place. Secondly, they shall procure the greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto their place thereby. The vse is, to teach those that haue it in their power to choose Magistrates, to looke that they make choyse of those that are best qualified; according to the counsell of <hi>Iethro, Exod.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to teach all those that either looke for authoritie, or are in it, to labour to bee adorned with those qualities that may best sit them, and make them able to discharge the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [how are they &amp;c.]</hi> It is merueilous in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of flesh and bloud, to see a man of highest estimation, <note place="margin">4</note> come to be of the basest accompt. The reason is, because, we still dreame of a greater certaintie to be in the things of this life, then indeed is: so thought the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie. The vse is, to teach vs, neuer to put our confidence in the greatest of the sonnes of men, seeing they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made so vnable to helpe vs, as they cannot helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [earthen pitchers]</hi> When God giueth his people into the hand of the destroyers, the pretious and the vile are <note place="margin">5</note> all of one reckoning with them. The reason is, because, first, God setteth them on worke, who regardeth not the outward appearance of men, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, they seeke to satisfie their reuenging minde, especially vpon the greatest. The vse is, to teach vs, neuer to promise our selues freedome from Gods rods, for any outward priuiledge; but onely for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19537:92"/>
the mercie of God in Christ Iesus, which we must especiallie labour to haue our affiance in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Euen the Seales] i.</hi> The verie Sea-dogges: for albeit the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 3.</note> hebrew word doe signifie generally al monsters, whether on land or water; yet here it must needes be vnderstood of this kind of beast, seeing no kinde of earthly creature that cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth hath any paps <hi>[giue the breast, they giue their yong one: sucke] i.</hi> they haue a willingnesse and a place conuenient to feede their young <hi>[the daughter of my people is like the owle in the desert] i.</hi> but the mothers are so depriued of place to feede their infants, &amp; the children so persecuted of all hands, that the whole people is howled at as the owle is among the other birds in the wildernesse <hi>[for the cruell] i.</hi> by reason of the bloudie enemie that persecuteth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> generally out of the whole verse. Gods people are now and then depriued of those outward meanes of their <note place="margin">1</note> comfort, which none other of his creatures doe want. The reason is, because, first, the Lord doth thereby declare his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of sinne, that punisheth it so seuerely in his owne deare children. Secondly, they may more cleerely see that they are vnworthie the least of his blessings, and so may the more thoroughly bee humbled. The vse is, not to thinke the outward miseries that may befall vs, signes of Gods casting vs off; but meanes that he seeth meete to drawe vs neerer vnto him and therefore to profite by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [like the owle]</hi> The godly are often made a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <note place="margin">2</note> stock, &amp; a wonderment vnto men, as the owle is to the other birds, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. The reason is, because, the course of godlinesse is most strange and foolish in their eyes. The vse is, to teach vs, not to forsake any duetie of godlinesse, for the wonderment of men, lest wee proue our selues to bee of the number of those that refuse the crosse of Christ, and so are not worthie of him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine [the desert]</hi> As all birds, though hating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">3</note> doe wonder at the owle; so all the wicked, being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies amongst themselues, doe set their seuerall powers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19537:93"/>
the godly: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chapt.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [by the cruell]</hi> It is the crueltie of the wicked that causeth the godly to fall into many grieuous distresses. <note place="margin">4</note> The reason is, because, first, they are the rods and instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Gods anger. Secondly, they beare an vnappeaseable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against the godly. Thirdly, they are of greatest power and strength in this life, seeing they are directed by the God of this world. The vse is, to teach vs, so to see and confesse Gods hand to be the chiefe in all our troubles, as wee looke diligently into the crueltie of the instruments, that wee may learne to take heed of them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [suckling]</hi> When God meaneth to punish his people thoroughly for their sinnes, they shall see a braunch <note place="margin">1</note> of his rod reach vnto all that belong vnto them, yea to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infants, the fruite of their bodie. The reason is, because, the disobedience, which causeth that punishment, doth ofter shewe it selfe in the abuse thereof. The vse is, to teach vs, so carefull as we are to see our children prosper and doe well, to be so diligent to take heed that we doe no way set our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon them, nor any other way make wantons of them; but in all things to acknowledge them Gods good blessings bestowed vpon vs, which we must imploy to his glorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [cleaueth &amp;c]</hi> There is sufficient cause &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in all the infants of Gods people, why he should in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <note place="margin">2</note> destroy them: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [none diuideth]</hi> God often leaueth his people <note place="margin">3</note>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:19537:93"/>
destitute of all meanes to helpe them: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [aske bread, none &amp;c.]</hi> Gods people may come <note place="margin">4</note> to this case in this life, to begge necessary food, and yet haue none to giue it them, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 16. 17 The reason is, because, neither life, health, nor any thing that belongeth thereunto are the markes of Gods fauour, seeing he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them vpon the iust and the vniust. The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to promise our selues any worldly blessings euer the more, because we feare the Lord. Secondly, not to account pouertie, in it selfe, a note of vnhappinesse, seeing they whom God hath loued most dearely haue fallen into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[They that did feede delicately] i.</hi> such as haue been most daintie toothed, and fared deliciously <hi>[are desolated] i.</hi> are left <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 5.</note> destitute of friends, and succour <hi>[in the streetes] i.</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view, where all might see them <hi>[they that were nourished in scarlet] i.</hi> those that were vsed to be wrapped in the finest garments, and cloathed in the most costly attyre <hi>[doe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the dunghils] i.</hi> are glad to stretch their bodies vpon the filthiest places, to seeke rest and case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> generally out of the whole verse. It is often the <note place="margin">1</note> lot of Gods people, to spend the former part of their life in much worldly pleasure, and the latter in great miserie. The reason is, because, first, many haue their share in the world, till they be called to the knowledge of Christ, which is often at the ninth or last houre. Secondly, God seeth it meet to let many of his children haue experience of good and euill, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> 2. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, it is the nature of our corruptions to leade vs to abuse prosperitie, which God will punish in his children in this life. The vse is, to teach vs to take heede that wee abuse not the one, nor despaire in the other; but in all things to seeke to glorifie the Lord; so did <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [feede delicately, are desolated]</hi> Many are most delicately brought vp, that afterward come to great want <note place="margin">2</note> and extremitie. The reason is, because, first, their parents make fondlings of them, and doe not vse them to any lawfull trauaile in their youth, and so they proue vnfit for any in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19537:94"/>
their age. Secondly, God will punish both the folly of the parents, and the vanitie of the children, for the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thirdly, disordered education increaseth the number and height of sinne, which must needes pull in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for sinne after it. The vse is, first, to reproue that fond and irreligious affection in pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that are so daintie of their children, as they may neither be broken from their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, nor set to do any thing more then pleaseth themselues. Secondly, to teach vs, of what wealth soeuer we bee, to bring vp our children vnto hardnesse, and in some good calling; not knowing what may befall them when we are gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [feede &amp;c.]</hi> In a generall calamitie, they are most subiect to ruine that in time of prosperitie are freest <note place="margin">3</note> from it by their aboundance of worldly things. The reason is, because, first, they are likest to haue committed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sinnes in the abuse of Gods blessings. Secondly, they haue least exercised themselues in the wayes to escape dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; perswading themselues to escape if any doe. Thirdly, the riches of the wealthiest are the things that spoylers set their eyes most vpon: for which they will be most extreame with the owners thereof. The vse is, to teach vs, neuer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise our selues freedome for any worldly priuiledge; but truly to feare and worship the Lord, which is the only shield in all dangers, and stay in all distresses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[And the punishment of the daughter of my people] i.</hi> the plagues which for their sinne are layd vpon my brethren &amp; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 6.</note> countrimen: for the word here translated punishment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifieth sinne, but is also vsed for the punishment which sinne deserueth, &amp; so is the next word often: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Chapt. 3. 39. [is greater] i.</hi> euery way more heauie <hi>[then the punishment of Sodome] i.</hi> then that which GOD did lay vpon the filthie citie <hi>Sodome, Gen. 19. [which being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, as in a moment the armies remained not in her] i.</hi> for it was quickly begun to be punished, &amp; quickly destroyed; so as there was no cause for any power to continue the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vexing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> generally out of the whole verse. The godly do <note place="margin">1</note>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:19537:94"/>
vsually sustaine more grieuous punishments in this life, then any other people whatsoeuer: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap. 1. vers 12. Doct.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [punishment]</hi> Man neuer sustaineth any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">2</note> in this life, but such as he iustly deserueth by his owne sinnes. The reason is, because, first, sinne is the cause of all punishments. Secondly, the righteous Iudge of the world cannot but doe all things righteously, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 29. The vse is, first, to reprooue them that impute the cause of one mans plagues to another mans offences, <hi>Ezech 18. 20. &amp;c.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs, in all those afflictions that are vpon vs, to acknowledge our owne sinnes to deserue the same, and to learne thereby to amend them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [which being &amp;c.]</hi> That is the greatest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">3</note> which man can suffer in this life, which is of longest continuance, though it bee not the seuerest in it selfe. The reason is, because, first, a short punishment, though heauier, doth not kill the heart so much as that which is of longer continuance, though lighter. Secondly, Sathan can worke many things in time, which of the sudden he cannot. Thirdly, the consideration of the length of time, giueth matter of strong temptations to despaire or reuolt from the trueth. The vse is, first, to knowe the malice and skill of those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to bee great, that vexe Gods people with easier and lingering torments. Secondly, to teach vs, when we fall into such a kinde of affliction, to pray earnestly, and watch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ouer our selues: for it is harder to stand constant in such times, then in the daies of hottest persecutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Her Nazarites] i.</hi> those of her people that had separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Uers.</hi> 7.</note> themselues to a more strickt and pure course of seruing God then the rest, <hi>Numb. 6. &amp;c. [were purer then the snow] i.</hi> of a cleere complexion without mixture <hi>[they were whiter then milke] i.</hi> they were faire, and without spots <hi>[they were redder in body then the Carbuncle] i.</hi> they were so pure and white, as yet a most comely ruddinesse appeared in them <hi>[their polishing was as the Saphire] i.</hi> The whole constitution and disposition of their bodies, was most decent, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19537:95"/>
to behold: for all these seuerall allegories are hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall comparisons, expressing the good blessing of God that appeared in their bodies, as did in the face of the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1 15. notwithstanding their abstinence and spare diet, when Gods fauour shewed it selfe among his people, whereof they were the most strickt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> generally out of the whole verse. When a mans waies please the Lord, very meane things doe maintaine him <note place="margin">1</note> in this life, in as good case, as can be desired. The reason is, because, it is not the quantitie, nor qualitie of any thing in this world, that sustaineth mans life, but the blessing of God vpon that wee enioy; which is especially vpon those that rightly feare him. The vse is, to teach vs, not to repose our affiance in the multitude of riches, nor to think our strength to stand in the large measure of food (though these be Gods good blessings to be receiued with thanks giuing) but onely in the grace and blessing of the Almightie, that giueth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite vnto man by these things, or denieth it at his pleasure.</p>

Secondly, our dulnesse is not els sufficiently affected, or our knowledge informed aright.

[fruits of the earth]</hi> Man can haue no increase <note place="margin">3</note> of the earth, nor benefit by it, without the Lord see it meete, and giue a blessing thereunto. The reason is, because, the earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof, <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 1. who maketh it barren or fruitfull at his pleasure.

The reason is, because, first, nature is so corrupt, that it can doe no good thing of it selfe. Secondly, GOD is the onely dooer of all good things, and he alone enableth what instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he will to performe the same, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. The vse is, first, to reproue them that thinke GOD can be serued in acceptable manner by our meere naturall things, as they vse to speake. Secondly, to teach vs not to rest vpon any thing that is in our selues, be it neuer so glorious, but to seeke to God alone for grace to doe whatsoeuer we desire should be accepted in his sight.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19537:96"/>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 2. 4. The reason is, because, naturally life is the dearest vnto vs, to the preseruation and good whereof all things are vsed by mankinde. The vse is, first, to reprooue them, as being farre from the course of nature, that for some griefe conceiued doe goe about to kill them selues, and so to take away that life, which in nature should be deare vnto them. Secondly, to teach vs, so to make all things serue for the maintenance of this life, as that wee still craue the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lord therein, else shall we make an Idol of life, and commit many sinnes to preserue it.</p>

Wherein the <note place="margin">1</note> expressing of the same thing by so many kindes of seuerall speeches, teacheth vs this doctrine. Though Gods punishing hand be heauie vpon vs, yet are we hardly brought to a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough acknowledgment of our sinnes that deserue the same. The reason is, because, first, wee are most blind to discerne our owne corruptions. Secondly, we are naturally addicted to blame others rather then our selues, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The vse is, to teach vs, whensoeuer we are in any affliction, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour our owne hearts to confesse the cause thereof to be our owne sinnes, and to learne to amend them.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19537:97"/>
first, we measure Gods infinite displeasure by our owne fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and capacitie. Secondly, we are so intentiue vpon that we feele, as we regard not with due consideration any other torment. The vse is, first, to let vs see our naturall corruption, that teacheth vs to iudge of all things by our present feeling. Secondly, to teach vs, if we will with patience beare our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent trouble, to consider duely of that which wee might yet suffer aboue this, if God should deale with vs after our owne deseruings.</p>

The reason is, because, first, he would not haue his people to rest vpon any worldly or outward strength. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he might more cleerly be seene to be the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer of his seruants. The vse is, first, to reproue them, as not being rooted in the trueth, who fall away in the time of trouble. Secondly, to teach vs neuer to despaire whatsoeuer calamitie wee fall into, seeing GOD bringeth his people as low as may be, and yet restoreth them againe.</p>

The reason is, because, first, they iudge onely according to naturall reason. Secondly, he will shewe his wonderfull power in all things, especially in the guiding of his Church. The vse is, to teach vs, not to regard
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19537:97"/>
the iudgement of naturall men, but to looke vnto the Lord, and to magnifie his wisedome in his wonderfull waies.</p>

The reason is, because, first, one people cannot fortifie themselues so strongly, but they may be assailed by others as strong as they. Secondly, they are alwaies strongest whom the Lord doth assist. The vse is, to teach vs, neuer to thinke our selues safe, be our walles so strong as may bee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord bee with vs: and therefore to seeke especially to be protected vnder his wings; so shal no aduersaries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile against vs.</p>

When the <note place="margin">1</note> teachers of the people are wicked, it is a signe that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number of the whole people is growne farre from the right way. The reason is, because, first, very shame keepeth teachers from many sinnes, vntill they bee growne into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome among the people. Secondly, such teachers are vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sent of God among a people, as a speciall punishment for their grieuous sinnes against the Lord: see <hi>Chapt.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.

The reason is, because, first, it was none otherwise tyed vnto <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Secondly, els should God be bound to retaine often a denne of theeues in his fauour. The vse is, first, to reproue the dotage of the Papists, that imagine grace to be tyed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the successors of <hi>Peter</hi> there, (who yet shall neuer proue that euer he was there) though they can neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince it by the likelihood of doctrine that <hi>Peter</hi> taught, nor life that <hi>Peter</hi> led; but are euidently most contrary to him in both.

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, first, that is the highest of sinne which God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth alwaies to punish. Secondly, God did still deale so with the Israelites, who were a patterne of the visible Church for euer. The vse is, to teach vs, first, that it is a hainous sinne to goe about the shedding of the bloud of brethren. Secondly, that that Church is in a daungerous case, whose gouernours persecute those that reproue and stand against their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

Secondly, to teach vs to pray to God, &amp; vse all good meanes that we may haue such a Ministerie, as may both teach vs the waies of godlinesse, and goe before vs in the practise of the same.</p>

Secondly, where there is no knowledge, there is no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of sinne; for conscience is nothing els, but the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Gods will, whereunto the heart doth consent. The vse is, first, to reproue the Papists that make ignorance the mother of deuotion; and carnall people that make no care to attaine to the knowledge of God. Secondly, to teach vs, so carefull as wee are to approue our selues truely to feare

Secondly, we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally proane to followe the ill presidents one of another.

                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall desire of the godly is, that the Lord would weigh their estate. The reason is, because, first, they know him to bee a righteous Iudge, euer dealing fauourably with his people. Secondly, their consciences doe tell them, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are grieuous sinners agaynst the Lord, yet the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies abuse them for the trueth sake. The vse is, to teach vs, in all our distresses to repent vnfaynedly for our sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, so may wee with good consciences come vnto him with our complaints in our miseries.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bringeth his people to so low an ebbe in the things of this life, as he neither leaueth them possessions, nor houses wherein to shroud themselues. The reason is, because, first, the things of this life are no part of that promise which he hath made peculiarly to them. Secondly, he will let them see that they haue no cause to put confidence in worldly things. The vse is, to teach vs, first, neuer to promise our selues any assurance of the things of this life. Secondly, to learne when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Lord taketh them from vs, to make lesse account of them, and to repose our affiance more wholly in him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. It is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishment of God, and much to be lamented, when God maketh many children fatherlesse, &amp; wiues widdowes in any Nation. The reason is, because, first, a speciall strength of the whole common wealth is taken away, when houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are cut off. Secondly, it is a meane to fill the Church with all disorders, when fathers of families that should rule euery one his houshold, be taken away. The vse is, to teach vs, whensoeuer we see God to deale so with our countrie or our selues in particular, to acknowledge it his heauie hand vpon vs for our sinnes, and to learne amendment by it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. Gods people
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19537:104"/>
are often constrained to buy the benefite and vse of that which is their owne. The reason is, because, first, God will make hereby the world more hard vnto them, that they may learne to looke vnto him the more carefully. Secondly, that the wicked, when God giueth them power ouer the godly, may shewe the crueltie of their disposition more manifestly. The vse is, to teach vs, to take it patiently, as the lot that God hath appoynted vs, when such extremities doe fall vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Those vpon our neckes, persecute vs] i.</hi> those that sit ouer <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Doctrine. [vpon our neckes]</hi> In that they were stiffe-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and refused to beare the Lords yoke, and thereupon are <note place="margin">1</note> giuen ouer to beare this heauie condition, we learne this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. When Gods people doe begin to refuse his yoke which is light and easie, he will lay a more grieuous burthen vpon them. The reason is, because, first, he will let them see by experience, that to serue him is the sweetest life. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he loueth them, and therefore doth correct them with the rods of men. The vse is, to teach vs, in all our afflictions to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the heauie hand of God to be most iustly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked against vs by our owne sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [not suffered vs to rest]</hi> The wicked are neuer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but doe still continue their hatred against the godly: <note place="margin">2</note> for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 14 <hi>doct.</hi> 6.</p>

                  <hi>Doctrine. [we haue giuen]</hi> It is lawfull for our necessarie helpe in the things of this life, to vse the assistance of those <note place="margin">1</note> that be our enemies. The reason is, because, first, the matters of this life are giuen of God to the iust and vniust, to be vsed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19537:105"/>
of all the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> for the reliefe of euery particular. Secondly, the godly are the proper owners of all things in the world, &amp; to seeke them when they need them, of whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God maketh the treasurers thereof. The vse is, first, to reproue them that thinke it not lawfull to buy and sell with, or to bee any way beholden vnto the wicked. Secondly, to teach vs, to vse them when other meanes are denied vs, lest we tempt God in despising the meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [to bee satisfied with &amp;c.]</hi> Gods people may <note place="margin">2</note> come to that want in this life, as to begge their bodily food: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>doct.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. When diuers generations continue in one sinne, the Lord vseth to punish the latter more seuerely then the former. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, the sonne should feare to doe the like, when hee seeth his fathers sinne, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 14. els is his sinne more heynous. Secondly, the longer Gods patience is abused, the greater heape of vengeance is deserued. The vse is, to teach vs, not to stand vpon this; we will doe as our forefathers haue done: for if we sinne as they did, we must be punished more seuerely then they were.</p>
               <p>

euery abiect, and base fellow vseth vs at his pleasure <hi>[none rescueth vs from their hands] i.</hi> though euery man doe vs wrong, and vile fellowes abuse vs, yet no body hath any care to helpe vs, or to doe vs any iustice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine [seruants, &amp;c.]</hi> When the wicked that are in <note place="margin">1</note> authoritie doe set themselues to vexe the godly, euery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and vile fellow will be ready to adde to their miseries. The reason is, because, first, all the wicked are of one dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, whether they bee high or lowe. Secondly, vngodly ones will flatter the rulers, and bee ready to doe that which will like them, especially if they be euill. The vse is, first, to teach magistrates to take heede what they doe, seeing the people be ready to follow them in all euill, for which (as well as their owne) they shall answere at the day of account. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to teach vs, when rulers set themselues against vs for wel-doing, to looke for the enmitie of their seruants, and of the multitude also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [none rescueth]</hi> God often layeth great miseries vpon his people, and denieth them al meanes of deliuerance: <note place="margin">2</note> for the reason and, vse hereof, see <hi>chapt.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>doctr.</hi> 3.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. The godly do often get ncessarie foode, with the greatest danger and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie that can be. The reason is, because, first, the worlde, and all the fauourers thereof are against them. Secondly, God would make them thoroughly wearie of this worlde. The vse is, to teach vs, not to wonder, or be amazed, when euery worldly thing goeth against vs, but to looke for it, as our share allotted vs in this life.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generallie out of the whole verse. The afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods people doe often worke a great alteration in their bodies. The reason is, because, first, they are exceeding vehement. Secondly, God will often haue them seene (as it were) in their countenance, for the example of others. The vse is, to teach vs, to looke for afflictions from the Lord, both vpon our bodies and soules; and when we see them vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to profite by them, as the good childe doth, when he seeth his brother beaten.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. There is no acte so filthy, or odious, which the wicked will not do, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish their owne desires. The reason is, because, first, God giueth them ouer to worke al wickednesse with greedinesse. Secondly, Sathan ruleth them, who is shamelesse himselfe, and so maketh he all those that are wholly guided by him. The vse is, to shew vs, vnto what horrible condition man commeth, when God leaueth him vnto himselfe. Secondly, to teach vs, not to trust such as we see giuen ouer vnto sinne, no not in those things that shame and ciuil honesty forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to abuse themselues in.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19537:106"/>
more then another. The reason is, because, first, hee that is no accepter of persons doth set them on worke. Secondly, they are generally sinful in great measure before such a rod commeth vpon them. Thirdly, the wicked seeke to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their desires vpon all, ouer whom God giueth them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The vse is, first, to reproue their vanitie that flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their sinnes, thinking they shall not be punished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other sinners, because they are great ones, rich, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Secondly, to teach vs, of what condition soeuer wee be, to preuent the Lords punishing hand by repentance, or els we shall be sure to feele it extreamely, when our sinnes are at their height.</p>

When the wicked doe tyrannize ouer the godly, they seeke to serue their owne turnes with them, with greater crueltie then they doe with the bruit beasts. The reason is, because, they beare a hatred vnto them; so as, euen their mercies are cruell. The vse is, to teach vs, to pray vnto God, that hee would neuer giue vs ouer into their handes, or if hee doe, to giue vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall strength and patience, seeing they vse to deale so cruelly.</p>

The vse is, to teach vs, first, that it is better to haue tyrants gouerne vs, then to bee voyd of all gouernement.

Thirdly, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all lawful magistrates to be the special ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, appoynted for our good, and therefore to yeeld obedience, and reuerence thereunto for conscience sake.</p>

Secondly, they haue no safetie, but haue cause euery one to feare another, &amp; to stand vpon his owne guard, as though he were in the midst of his enemies.

Secondly, neither bodie nor mind can continue able and apt to their dueties without some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, but it is neuer lawful to be idle. The vse is, first, to reproue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are so Stoical, as they think no recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be allowed by the word of God. Secondly, to teachvs, that it is lawful for vs to vse those exercises that may recreate either our bodie wearied with trauaile, or our mindes oppressed with studies, meditations, cares of this life, or troubles: so that these cautions be alwayes obeserued, first, no parte of Gods worship may be abused in it, and therefore swearing, lottes, &amp;c. must not be there. Secondly, the hinderance of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors

Gods people are sometimes in such case, as they haue no cause of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being on euery side beset with crosses and calamities. The reason is, because, first, God will let them see the desert of their sinues. Secondly, the Lord will bring them to a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough mislike of this world, and a longing after heauen. The vse is, to teach vs, first, not to condemne any, or to thinke our selues to bee forsaken of God, because of the multitude and greatnesse of afflictions. Secondly, to learne by afflictions to set our affections more feruently vpon heauen and heauenly things.</p>

vs <hi>[our eyes are darkned] i.</hi> our senses are made dull, as vsually they are with griefe and sorrowe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [for this &amp;c.]</hi> The godly when they are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly touched are more grieued for their sinnes, then for <note place="margin">1</note> all the plagues that the Lord laieth vpon them in this life. The reason is, because, first, sinne in it selfe separateth betwixt God and man, which no kind of afflictions can doe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sinne is the cause of afflictions, without which no sorrowe could come vnto vs. The vse is, to teach vs, to labour with our selues alwaies to be more displeased with our selues for our offences, then for those punishments which they bring vpon vs in this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [because of these things]</hi> The sirength of mans <note place="margin">2</note> bodie is more wasted with sorrow and griefe then with any toyle that can befall it in this life. The reason is, because, griefe riseth from the heart, the fountaine of strength, and sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into euery part of the bodie. The vse is, to shewe the cause why many are ouerwhelmed in some troubles, which (and greater also) some are not moued withal; euen because the one laieth them, as grieuous things, to the heart; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther casteth them, as trifles behind his heeles. Secondly, to teach vs, so to sorrowe when afflictions are vpon vs, as yet we neuer exceed the meane, lest wee make our selues vnable to performe the dueties of our callings, and so increase our sins by that meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Because of mount Sion, which is desolate] i.</hi> This especially grieueth my heart, that the place where Gods seruice was <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [because of mount Sion]</hi> The desolation of the Church of God, is the greatest griefe that can be fall Gods <note place="margin">1</note> people in this life. The reason is, because, first, it bringeth dishonour to God, which is more to be grieued at then the losse of life it selfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, they delight more in the prosperitie thereof, then in their other

greatest ioye, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 137. 6. The vse is, to teach vs, to labour with our selues that we neuer think we haue attained to any tolerable measure of religion, vntill Gods glorie be the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thing vnto vs of all other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [foxes]</hi> The troubles of Gods Church be at the <note place="margin">2</note> height of her afflictions, when they that hate her, and spoyle her, haue power ouer her. The reason is, because, first, no part of Gods honour can be aduaunced for them. Secondly, euery true member of the Church is vexed by them. The vse is, to teach vs (as this people did) when such a condition befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Church of God, to mourne for it, bearing patiently our shares in the miseries of it, and praying heartily to God for the amendment of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Thou O Lord remainest for euer] i.</hi> howsoeuer there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes a chaunge and alteration in this world, and that in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 19.</note> thy Church; yet thou abidest the same for euer <hi>[thy seate to generation and generation] i.</hi> the throne, on which thou sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test (for hee speaketh after the manner of men) to rule all things is firme, so as thy Church depending vpon the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thy power and promise, cannot but continue, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer seuerall generations be punished and cut off for their sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. The Lord hath from the beginning, and will to the ende, and after all generations, rule the world, and all that dwell therein. The reason is, because, all power is of him, and is to bee referred vnto him. The vse is, to teach vs, that howsoeuer wee for our sinnes doe vanish away, yet Gods Church shall remaine, though flouds of afflictions seeme to drowne euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof; seeing it is founded vpon his promise that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, and his power which is able to do all things. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the same vse thereof, is expressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 24. to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Why hast thou forgotten vs for euer] i.</hi> O Lord seeing we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 20.</note> are thy people, and thou our God, why is thy heauie hand so vpon vs, as though thou hadst no care of vs, &amp; did forget vs?
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19537:109"/>
                  <hi>[why hast thou left vs to the length of daies] i.</hi> why doest thou so carie thy selfe towards vs, as if thou hadst forsaken vs for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [why &amp;c.]</hi> When the godly are most pinched with afflictions, then are their prayers most feruent vnto the Lord. The reason is, because, first, afflictions driue away drowsinesse and securitie. Secondly, the present vexation that troubles doe bring, doth make vs pray as earnestly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as we are desirous to be rid of them. The vse is, to teach vs, to knowe that howsoeuer no affliction is for the time ioyous, but grieuous; yet they are profitable to all that are rightly exercised in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Restore vs O Lord to thee, that wee may be returned] i.</hi> O <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 21.</note> Lord, it is thou alone that must bring vs into our former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of peace and felicitie, if euer we shall be brought vnto it: for he speaketh not here of the worke of repentance, but of their outward flourishing estate, such as they had vnder <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon [renew our daies as of old] i.</hi> let it please thee to alter our estate from this miserie wherein it is, to that happinesse that it hath been in, in former times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. It is in the <note place="margin">1</note> hand of God alone to alter and dispose of the outward estate of all men in this life. The reason is, because all power ouer al things is in his hand alone. The vse is, first, to reproue them that ascribe any thing (when they prosper) vnto their owne power or wisedome. Secondly, to teach vs to seeke vnto God alone for successe vnto our trauailes, whether wee labour for the good of the bodie, or the soule, and to acknowledge his hand that giueth both prosperitie and aduersitie therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine. [as of old]</hi> The experience of Gods former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, <note place="margin">2</note> is a notable prouocation to cause vs still to trust in him, and to call vpon him in all our necessities: for the reason and vse hereof, see <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 56. <hi>doct.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[For shouldest thou altogether contemne vs] i.</hi> Lord how <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Uers.</hi> 22.</note> can it agree with thy promise and former mercies, now to make no reckoning of vs <hi>[shouldest thou be exceedingly angry</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:19537:109"/>
                  <hi>with vs] i.</hi> canst thou shewe thy wrath against vs aboue the strength thou hast giuen vs to beare it, and so consume vs which are thine inheritance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Generally out of the whole verse. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods loue to his people, and mercifull disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to doe them good, is an assurance vnto the godly in their afflictions, that the end shall be ioyful. The reason is, because, first, they know he hath euer shewed pitie to his people, and deliuered them out of all their distresses. Secondly, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God will doe so with them; seeing, neither his arme is shortned, nor his kindnesse any way abated, there being no chaunge in him. The vse is, to teach vs, in all our troubles not to measure the euent of them by our owne sinnes, or our power to escape them (for then shall wee bee confounded in our selues) but by the due meditation of Gods power and mercie, which he hath promised to imploy for euer to the good of his Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. who will be true of his word, though all men be lyars, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
