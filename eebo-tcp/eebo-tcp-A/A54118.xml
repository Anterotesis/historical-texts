         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſhould employ your Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Deter, Puniſh and grievouſly Afflict
Men for Anſwering the Convictions of
their Conſciences, and Acting according
to the beſt of their Underſtandings. Methinks you ſhould not be
oblivious of your own Condition in the <hi>Loyns</hi> of your Anceſtors,
who, you think, with great Reaſon &amp; Juſtice ſtrenuouſly advocated
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60046:3"/>
the Cauſe of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> Bulls and the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition; how did they <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> all Force on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or Puniſhment for <hi>Non-Conformity?</hi> Their own many and
large Apologies, and particularly, their Demands at the <hi>Diets</hi> of
<hi>Norimberg</hi> and <hi>Spira,</hi> are pregnant Proofs in the Caſe: and your
Practice doth not leſſen the Weight of their Reaſons; on the
contrary, it aggravates your Unkindneſs, let me ſay, Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (and ſuch you glory to be thought) got their Name
by proteſting againſt Impoſition; and will you turn Impoſers?
They condemned it; and will you practiſe it? They thought
it a Mark peculiar to the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and can you repute it the Care of
a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtracy? I mean, that Perſons muſt not live under
your Government, unleſs they receive your Mark in their <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
or <hi>Right-hand?</hi> which in plainer Terms is, to ſubmit their
Conſciences to your Edicts, <hi>and to ask your Leave, What Religion
they ſhould be of.</hi> Remember, that <hi>Faith is the Gift of God;</hi> and,
that <hi>What is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> Nothing can be more Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then to compel Men to believe againſt their Belief, or to
trouble them for practiſing what they believe, when it thwarts
not the Moral Law of God.</p>
            <p>You doubtleſs take your ſelves to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and would eſteem
it no little Injury to be otherwiſe repreſented; yet what more <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi>
then to uſe External Force, to ſway the Conſciences of
Men about the Exerciſe of Religious Worſhip?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CHRIST Jeſus,</hi> the Lord and Author of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion,
cenſur'd his own Diſciples, that would have had Fire from Heaven
to deſtroy thoſe that conform'd not to what their bleſſed Maſter
taught: Are you ſurer of your Religion? Are you better <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>
Or, have you more <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Authority, then they that were the
choſen Witneſſes of Jeſus? However remember, they <hi>call'd</hi> but
for Fire from Heaven; and can you <hi>kindle</hi> Fire on Earth to devour
them? <hi>Them,</hi> I ſay, that are of your own People, meerly for their
Religious Diſſent from you? Doubtleſs, if that was then thought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60046:3"/>
no fit Argument to induce Men to Conformity by him that was
wiſer then <hi>Solomon,</hi> it reflects greatly upon your Modeſty and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that you ſhould find out new Wayes, or rather old exploded
ones to effect ſo ill a Deſign. Beſides, you do not ſay, you know all
you ought to know, or that there is nothing further to be revealed;
have a Care therefore, that you perſecute not Angels, by being
harſh to that which you call Strange: Think not ill, much leſs
ſpeak, and leaſt of all act that which is ſo againſt what you do not
perfectly underſtand. I am well perſwaded, that thoſe you inflict
ſuch ſevere Penalties upon, mean well in what they believe (to be
ſure much better then you think they do, or elſe you are extremely
to blame) and that the Reaſon of their preſent Diſtance from you, is
not to introduce or inſinuate Dangerous or Exotick Opinions; but
to live a Life of more Holineſs, Purity and Self-Denial, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
They do not think that you walk up to your own Principles;
and have Reaſon to believe that the Power of Godlineſs is much
loſt among you; and having long lain under a Decay and Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Soul for Want of true ſpiritual Nouriſhment, they have now
betaken themſelves to that Heavenly <hi>Gift</hi> &amp; <hi>Grace</hi> of God in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for Divine Satisfaction, even that Holy <hi>Anointing</hi> that is able
to teach them all things neceſſary for them to know, as the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Apoſtle ſpeaks; and they find the Joys of the Holy Ghoſt in ſo
doing: And I am perſwaded, they are not leſs Peaceable, Sober,
Juſt and Neighbourly then formerly, and altogether as conſiſtent
with the Proſperity of Civil Society; and I am ſure, it is both
found and confeſt among us here by ſome Men of <hi>Quality, Learning</hi>
and <hi>Virtue.</hi> Further, be pleaſed to conſider with your ſelves, that
you juſtifie the ancient Perſecutions of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
whoſe Superiors thought as ill of them, as you do of theſe
Men; nay, you ſhow the <hi>Papiſts</hi> what to do in their Dominions to
your own Brethren. Do as you would be done by: if you would
have Liberty, give it; you know that God's Witneſs in your
Hearts dictates this to you as an Immutable Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60046:4"/>
Could you give Faith, it were more excuſable for you to puniſh
ſuch as ſhould reſiſt; but ſince that is impoſſible, the other is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
for 'tis to afflict Men for not being what they can't be,
unleſs they turn <hi>Hypocrites:</hi> That is the higheſt pitch your coercive
Power can arrive at; for never did it convert or preſerve one Soul
to God; inſtead thereof, it offers Violence upon Conſcience, and
puts a Man either upon the Denyal of his Faith and Reaſon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſtroyed for acting according to them: But what greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
can there be, then what lyeth between the <hi>Intellect</hi> of
Man, and <hi>Priſons, Fines</hi> and <hi>Baniſhments?</hi> They inform no Man's
Judgment, reſolve no Doubts, convince no Underſtanding: The
Power of Perſwaſion is not to be found in any ſuch Barbarous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no more then the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> This Courſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
the Bodies and <note n="*" place="margin">And <hi>Property,</hi> which they repute themſelves Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of, is hereby loſt.</note> Eſtates of Men, inſtead
of ſaving their Souls: Were they in the Wrong,
it would become you to uſe God's Weapon, his
Sword of the Spirit, that ſaveth the Creature, and
ſlayeth the Evil in him; This Courſe tends to
Heart-Burnings and Deſtruction; I am ſure it is no Goſpel Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you for the ſake of that Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that ſuffer'd
ſo patiently for his own <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo ſharply prohibited making
other men to <hi>Suffer</hi> for theirs, that you would have a Care, now you
exerciſe Power over mens Conſciences. My Friends, <hi>Conſcience</hi> is
God's Throne in Man, and the <hi>Power</hi> of it, his Prerogative: 'Tis
to uſurp his Authority, and boldly aſcend his Throne to ſit Lords
over it. Were their Converſation Scandalous, and Deſtructive
to the Good of your State, you were to be held excuſable; But
verely, no man of Mercy and Conſcience, can defend your Practice
upon poor Men ſo peaceable and Inoffenſive. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> will riſe up
in Judgment againſt you, if you perſevere in this courſe. Do not
you help to fill the Catalogue of <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> in much Love I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you; but as becomes <hi>Chriſtian</hi> men &amp; true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> leave
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60046:4"/>
men to their particular Perſwaſions of Affairs relative of the other
World, which have no ill Aſpect on the Affairs of this; but Vice
hath an evil Conſequence as to both: Therefore puniſh <hi>Vice,</hi> and
affect <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and bend not your Civil Power to
Torment Religious Diſſenters; but to retrive good Life, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
loſt amidſt the great Pretences that are made to <hi>Religion.</hi>
Doubtleſs, <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> was both ordained of God, and elected by
Men, to be a <hi>Terror to Evil-doers, and not to them that do well,</hi> though
of different Judgments. You oppugn the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Infallibility</hi> to herſelf, and yet your own Practice maketh you
guilty of the ſame Preſumption, or worſe: For, either you do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
that Severity upon an Infallible Knowledge, or you do not;
if you do, you take that to your ſelves, your Principles deny to any
<hi>Church</hi> whatever, which is a Contradiction; if you do not, you
puniſh People for not conforming to what you your ſelves deny
any Certainty about: And how do you know but you compel them
to that which is falſe, as well as that which is true? Verely, this
<hi>Dilemma</hi> is not eaſily avoided, as well as that this inhuman Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
will ſtain your Profeſſion, infame your Government, and
bring a Blot upon your Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Remember that they are Men as well as your ſelves, born free,
and have equal Plea to Natural and Civil common Priviledges
with your ſelves: The different Perſwaſion of their Conſciences
about Things relating to another Life, can no wayes render them
unfit for this; it neither Unmans nor Uncivilizes them. They have
the ſame Right to their Liberty and Property as ever, having by
no Practice of theirs in the leaſt forfeited any of thoſe human Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
the Great Charters of Nature and Scripture have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon them: And the <hi>Opulency</hi> of your Neighbours, and <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity</hi>
of their Affairs, prove to you that <hi>Indulgence</hi> is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with <hi>Policy;</hi> howbeit, you have now tryed the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of
their Procedure by what you have already inflicted, and they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained;
Let the Time paſt ſuffice, and make them not Sacrifices
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60046:5"/>
for their conſcientious <hi>Conſtancy.</hi> If they are in the Wrong, 'tis
more then they know: Will you perſecute Men for being what
they muſt be, if they will be true to themſelves? this were great
Violence; rather Commiſerate, then thus violently Compel them.
I beſeech you, ſeek ſome cheaper Way to accommodate your
ſelves, then by their Deſtruction, who are ſo very remote from
ſeeking yours. <hi>Oh! the Day will come, wherein one Act of Tenderneſs
about Matters of Conſcience, ſhall find a better Reward, then all the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by which Men uſe to propagate their Perſwaſions in the World;</hi> and
there is great Reaſon for it, ſince the one flows from the <hi>Saviour,</hi>
the other, from the <hi>Deſtroyer of Men.</hi> In fine, <hi>Let your Moderation be
known unto all Men, for the Lord is at hnad, whoſe Reward it with him;
and he will recompence every</hi> Man, Family, State, Kingdom and
Empire, <hi>according to</hi> the Nature of <hi>their Works, committed in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Body;</hi> at whoſe Bar it ſhall never be laid to your Charge, that
out of Fear of taking God's Office out of his Hands, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
to tender Conſciences, you admitted Men of differing
Judgments to dwell quietly among you; truly, you cannot be
too tender in this Point.</p>
            <p>Imitate the <hi>God</hi> of Nature and Grace, by being propitious to
all; <hi>his Sun ſhineth on all, his Rain falls on all, he gives Life and Being
to all; his Grace viſits all, and in Times of Ignorance he winketh:</hi> And
though ſuch you may repute ours, I hope you cannot think you
wink at it, who make ſuch broad Tokens of your Diſpleaſure.
Oh! how forbearing and merciful is he towards you? Have you
ſo lately eſcaped the Wrath of Enemies, and can you already thus
ſharply treat your Friends? Had he enter'd into Judgment with
