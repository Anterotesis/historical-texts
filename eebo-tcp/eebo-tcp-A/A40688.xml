            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is as naturall for malicious men to backbite, as for dogs to bite, or serpents to sting; see this in <hi>Ziba,</hi> who rais'd a false report on his master <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> and accused him to <hi>David</hi> (when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Jerusalem) of no lesse then high Treason, as if in <hi>Davids</hi> absence he affected the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96910:3"/>
Kingdom for himself: Well was <hi>Ziba</hi> studied in the Art of slandering, to charge home, and draw his arrow to the head; for in haynous accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the wound is cured, the very scarre will kill, and though the innocence of the party accused may chance to cleare the main debt, yet the arrerages of the suspition will be enough to undoe him: But I wonder not at <hi>Ziba's</hi> accusing <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> I wonder at <hi>Davids</hi> believing <hi>Ziba,</hi> at the first information, of a single witnes, and him a servant against his master, without further proof, as hearing both parties, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to censure and fine <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> with the losse of his lands, was a piece of unjust justice, wherein <hi>David</hi> cannot be excused, much lesse defended. All that can be said for him is this, That not <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Davids</hi> distractions passed this sentence, so that being in feare and fright, and flight, it can scarce be accounted his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Act: once <hi>he said in his hast, All men are lyars,</hi> and now being on the spurre in his speed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was a Traitor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But it pleased Gods providence that in this chapter the tide was turned, and <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Jerusalem, where <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, was admitted to speak in his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and makes a plain and pithy narration of the matter: Innocence hath so clear a complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that she needs no painting, and a good cause consisting in matter of fact, when it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told, is sufficiently pleaded: He shews how
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96910:3"/>
that <hi>violenta detentio</hi> withheld him from atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on <hi>David,</hi> being no lack of his loyalty, but the lamenesse of his legs, which might and should have been helpt, had not <hi>Ziba</hi> hindred it on purpose, in refusing to saddle his Asse; And thus having wrong'd his master at home, he then traduced him abroad, transferring his own guile, to make it become the others guiltinesse: Soon did <hi>David</hi> perceive his errour, and to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends did order, That the lands should be held in Copartnership betwixt them; <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> have one moiety, and <hi>Ziba</hi> the other; <hi>Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said it, Thou and</hi> Ziba <hi>divide the lands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This did not satisfie <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> not because it was too little, but because it was too much; Hee now needs nothing, seeing his Soveraign is returned in safety: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desires that <hi>Ziba</hi> may have All, according to <hi>Davids</hi> former appointment; <hi>Yea, let him take All.</hi> This he did partly perchance to assert the Honour of <hi>David:</hi> It should never be said, that <hi>David</hi> said any thing, and it was not done; what grants hee made, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> would make good, though with the losse of his lands: It beares no proportion to the greatnesse of Princes, nor stands with the statelinesse of States, to say and unsay, doe and undoe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and disorder againe, whose first resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are presumed to be grounded on so good reason, they shall need no revocation. But
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96910:4"/>
chiefly he did it to shew the Hyperbole of his happinesse, and Transcendency of his joy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Davids</hi> safe return; joy which sweld up him in full measure, <hi>pressed down, shaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over.</hi> Yet lest the least drop of so precious a liquor as this was (being the spirits of loyalty distill'd) should be spilt on the ground, let us gather it up with our best atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and poure it in our hearts to practise it, as it flowes from the Text, <hi>Yea, let him take All, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The words contain a large Grant, and a just consideration moving thereunto; The large Grant, <hi>let him Take All</hi>: wherein observe the Granter, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>: The Grantee, <hi>Ziba:</hi> and the thing Granted, All. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) house and lands and rents, and profits, and emoluments, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, &amp; hereditaments, with the appendants and the appurtenances thereunto belonging. What the warinesse of modern men deviseth in many words, and all twisted together (few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold in this litigious age, wherein a span of land cannot be conveyed in lesse then a span of parchment,) see All these words summ'd up in this one word <hi>All</hi> in my Text, <hi>let him take All.</hi> Secondly, Here is the consideration of the Granter, which consisteth not in any mony paid, or service perform'd by the Grantee, but onely in respect of a generall good, which God had bestowed on <hi>David,</hi> and in him on all Israel, <hi>Forasmuch as my Lord the King is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96910:4"/>
come in Peace to his owne House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In prosecuting which parts, I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that my discourse might have been open and champion to proceed in an even and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued style, but my Text is incumbred with so many difficulties, that my Sermon must rise and fall into hills and dales of Objections and Answers, which Answers, as so many fruitfull vallies, shall afford us plentifull store of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable observations.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Object.</hi> The first hill which we are to climbe is an objection, if not within the walls, yet surely in the suburbs of my Text. Why? (may some say) me thinks <hi>David</hi> doth <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth</hi> justice but by halfes; For when his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence so plainly appeared, the slanderer should have been soundly punished: <hi>Thou and Ziba di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the land</hi>: He should rather have divided <hi>Ziba's</hi> head from his shoulders; Or of all the land, leave him onely one Tree, wherein hee should be justly executed, as a land-mark to forewarne all deceitfull servants how they tread on so unwarrantable wayes. What hope was there he would hereafter prove faithfull to his Prince, that was false to his master? Yea, this was contrary to the fundamentall lawes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> family, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.5. <hi>Who so privily slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his neighbour him will I cut off:</hi> Whereas <hi>Ziba</hi> here was so far from being cut off, that he was both freely forgiven, &amp; fairly rewarded, for the malicious disservice he had done his master.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96910:5"/>7. <hi>Resp.</hi> I answer, we must consider that <hi>Ziba</hi> was a considerable man in his tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and probably might make a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on the people: Besides, great was his experience, being an old Courtier of <hi>Sauls,</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the allyance to him, and dependance on him, having fifteen sonnes and twenty servants, (All now officiously attending on King <hi>David</hi> at his return, as it is in the seventeenth verse of this chapter.) Greatest of all was his will and skill to doe mischef, and therefore no wonder if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was unwilling to offend him. Secondly, consider <hi>David</hi> was at this time in the <hi>Non-age,</hi> (not to say Infancy) of his new-recovered King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wary Physitians will not give strong purges to little children, and <hi>David</hi> thought it no wisdome at this time, on these Terms, as matters stood with him, to be severe in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; but rather by all endeerments to tye and oblige the affections of his people the faster unto him. We may see this in the matter of <hi>Shimei,</hi> which immediately concerned <hi>David</hi> himselfe; Yea when by <hi>Abishai</hi> he was urged and prest to punish him, <hi>Shall not</hi> Shimei <hi>be put to death for this, because he hath cursed the Lords annointed?</hi> Yet <hi>Davids</hi> policy was so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his revenge, that he not onely flatly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the motion, but also sharply reproved the mover, <hi>What have I to doe with you yee sonnes of</hi> Zerviah, <hi>that yee should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96910:5"/>
day in Israel? for doe I not know that I am this day King over Israel?</hi> He would not have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits run bloud on the day of his new Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor would he have the first page in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition of his Soveraignty written in red letters, but rather sought <hi>(by all acts of grace)</hi> to gaine the good will of his Subjects. Hence wee observe,</p>
            <p n="8">8. Magistrates sometimes are faine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what they cannot conveniently punish for the present. Thus sometimes Chirurgions leave their ulcers unlaunch't, either because they are not ripe, or because perchance they have not all their necessary instruments about them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if Statists perceive, that from the present removing of an inconvenience, a greater mischief will inevitably follow, 'twere madnesse to undo a state for the present, for feare it will be undone hereafter. Perchance the wisdome of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may suffer in the censures of such, who fathome mysteries of state by their owne shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low capacities, for seeming to suffer Sectaries and Schismaticks to share and divide in Gods service with the <hi>Mephibosheths,</hi> the quiet and peaceable children of our Church: And indeed such Sectaries take a great share to themselves, having taken away all the Common Prayer out of most places, and under pretence to abolish superstition, have almost banish't decency out of Gods Church: But no doubt the Sages of our State want not will, but wait a time when with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96910:6"/>
more conveniencie, and lesse disturbance (though slowly, surely) they will restraine such turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spirits with <hi>David</hi> in my Text, who was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contented, then well pleased, to passe by <hi>Ziba</hi> for the present.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Object.</hi> Yea, but (may some say) this speech of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> cannot be allowed either in piety or policie: For if he speak true, then he was a foole; and if he spake false, then he was a flatterer. If he spake true, then he was a foole; for what wise man would at once give away all that he hath. Charity may impart her branches, but she must not part with her root: The wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our grand Charter hath provided, That no offender (though for an hainous fault) should be so heavily amerced, but alwaies <hi>salvo suo sibi contenemento</hi>; What favour is afforded to male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, Charity surely should give to its selfe, as not thereby to prejudice and impaire her owne livelihood: I commend the well bounded and well grounded bounty of <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19.8. <hi>Behold, Lord, halfe of my goods I give to the poore</hi>: But with <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> to give All his goods, and that not to the poore, but to a couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cheating servant, was an action of madnesse. How would he doe hereafter to subsist? Did he expect hereafter to be miraculously fed with Manna dropt into his mouth? Or in his old age would he turne Court almes-man, and live on the bounty of others? And grant he could shift for himselfe, yet what should <hi>Micah</hi> his son doe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96910:6"/>
and his future posterity? If he spake false, then he was a flatterer; and said it onely to sooth <hi>David,</hi> when he meant no such matter: But Court-holy-water never quenched any thirsty soule. Flatterers are the worst of tame beasts, which tickle Princes even to their utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Resp.</hi> I answer, He was neither foole nor flatterer, but an affectionate Subject, and at the present, in a mighty passion of gladnesse: But first we must know, that it behoved <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth</hi> to doe something extraordinary; and in his expressions to exceed the size and standard of common language; were it onely to unstain his credit from the suspition of disloyalty <hi>Ziba</hi> had cast upon him. Secondly, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was confident and well assured, that whatsoever <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did for the present, yet hereafter, when sufficiently informed of <hi>Mephibosheths</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, hee would make not onely competent, but plentifull provision for him. But lastly and chiefly we must know, that these words of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth</hi> were spoken in a great passion of joy, and passionate speeches must alwayes sue in Chauncery, and plead to have the equity of a candide and charitable construction allowed them: Let us not therefore be over-rigid, in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining his words when we knew his meaning, that he was affected with an unmanageable joy at <hi>Davids</hi> safe return: Rather hence let us learn.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Speeches spoken in passion must not be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96910:7"/>
strercht so farre as they may be strain'd, but have a favourable interpretation; for such is the very nature of passion, that it can scarce doe any thing but it must over-doe. Seest thou then the soule of a man shaking with feare, or soaring with joy, or burning in anger, or drowning in griefe, meet his words with a charitable acception of them, and defalke the extravagancies of his expressions: <hi>The wringing of the nose bringeth forth bloud</hi> saith wise <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30.33. And he who shall presse and wrack and torture spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches spoken in passion, may make a bloudy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction thereof; besides, beyond, against the intent of him that spake it: But let us content our selves, that we know their meaning, and not prosecute, (much lesse persecute) their words too farre, as here in my Text, wee know the mind of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was to shew, That hee was soundly, sincerely, and from the ground, of his heart glad, when he said, <hi>Yea, let him take All, forasmuch as, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Come we now to the consideration of the Grant, <hi>Forasmuch as my Lord the King is come in peace unto his own house.</hi> Behold in the words a confluence of many joyes together. First, <hi>The King</hi>; there is matter of gladnesse for all Subjects in generall. Secondly, <hi>My Lord the King, Mephibosheth</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> servant in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; or rather his extraordinary Favorite, and this made his joy to be greater. Thirdly, <hi>Is come againe,</hi> is come backe, is returned, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96910:7"/>
therefore more welcome after long wanting: The interposing of the night renders the ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the sunne more desired: Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence after some absence more precious. Fourthly, <hi>To his own house.</hi> Why? were not all the houses in Israel <hi>Davids</hi> houses? Are not Kings alwaies at home, whilst in their kingdom? True, all the houses in Israel were <hi>Davids</hi> own, not by his private use, but Paramount Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over them, whereas his Palace in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was peculiarly his owne, by his particular possession thereof, and proper residence therein. Fifthly and lastly, <hi>Come in Peace</hi>; in Peace, which is the substance of all earthly blessings, and the shadow of heavenly happinesse.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Obj.</hi> Yea, but may some say, <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> doth not measure out <hi>Davids</hi> happinesse to the best advantage, nor doth he give the true Emphasis to his honour, for <hi>David</hi> returned with victory. Had hee not gotten a glorious conquest under the conduct of <hi>Ioab,</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of <hi>Ephraim</hi> over all his enemies? 20000. slaine by the sword, more devoured with the wood, the rest routed, their Captain kill'd, and and all with a losse so little on <hi>Davids</hi> side, that none at all is mentioned; But <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> takes no notice of <hi>Davids</hi> Trophies and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, but either out of envy, or ignorance, or both, concealing his conquests, huddles all up under the name of Peace, <hi>Forasmuch as my Lord the King is come to his own house in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96910:8"/>14. I answer, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> therfore suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth victory, &amp; mentioneth Peace only, because victories are not valuable in themselves, but in order and rendencie, as they conduce to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Peace. Excellently doth the Apostle argue the distance and dignitie of men above women, from the end and intent of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Neither was the man crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the woman, but the woman for the man:</hi> so Peace was never made for victory, but victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Peace; as all Meanes, even by Indentures drawne by nature, are bound Apprentices to serve the End their master. Let not therefore the maid grow so proud as to strive for equipage, much lesse for priority with her Mistresse, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth the work for Peace, and therefore Peace alone is mentioned by <hi>Mephibosheth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>Resp.</hi> Secondly, I answer, If <hi>Davids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests had atchieved against the <hi>Edomites, Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> or <hi>Amorites,</hi> or <hi>Moabites,</hi> or <hi>Midianites,</hi> or <hi>Syrians,</hi> or <hi>Sidonians,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi> or any forraine foe, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> no doubt would have made mention thereof to the purpose: But <hi>David</hi> was thus unhappy in his very happinesse, That this victory was gotten over his own Subjects. The ribs of <hi>Iacob</hi> did grate, one against the other, and in that civill-uncivill warre many worthy men lost their lives unworthily. Whose lives there prodigally spent, had they been thriftily expended in a forraine designe, had been sufficient to have purchased
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96910:8"/>
               <hi>David</hi> another Kingdome: Say not that such as were slain were none of <hi>Davids</hi> Subjects, but Traytors and Rebels, which did oppose their Prince and resist their Soveraigne. For here we must know that they were <hi>Davids</hi> Subjects, first <hi>de jure,</hi> they ought to have been his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and a joynt, though out of joynt, is a joynt still, though dislocated out of its proper place. Secondly, some of them were <hi>Davids</hi> Subjects <hi>de facto, Two hundred men went out of Ierusalem to Hebron</hi> (chapt. 15.11.) <hi>in their simplicity, and they knew not anything,</hi> onely their innocence was practised upon by the policie of <hi>Absolom.</hi> Thirdly and lastly, they were all presum'd his Subjects <hi>de futuro,</hi> when their eyes were opened, and they saw their owne errours, they would either returne of themselves, or be easily redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their former obedience: Wisely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> wave the mention of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which very word would have been a sad remembrancer to call to <hi>Davids</hi> mind the losse of his Subjects; and rather folds up all under the notion of Peace, as a cover (if lesse gaudy, surely more pleasing) <hi>Forasmuch as my Lord the King is come in peace to his owne house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. Pious Princes can take no delight in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories over their owne Subjects. For when they cast up their Audits, they shall find themselves losers in their very gaining. Nor can they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to have <hi>wonne the day,</hi> which at the best is but a twilight, being benighted with a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96910:9"/>
mixture of much sorrow and sadnesse. For Kings being the Parents of their Country, must needs grieve at the destruction of their children. Who knowes the love of a Parent, but a Parent? Maidens are incompetent Judges of Mothers affections. How doth the affectionate Father when hee beats his child, first feele the blowes struck through himselfe? I dare boldly say, that in that unhappy <hi>Aceldama,</hi> wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Soveraigne was present, <hi>A sword did pierce through his owne heart,</hi> in the same sense as it is said of the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 2.35. For though (thankes be to God) divine providence did <hi>cover his head in the day of battell,</hi> as it were miraculously commanding the bullets, which flew about, and respected no persons, <hi>not to touch his Anointed</hi>; yet notwithstanding his soule was shot through with griefe to behold a field spread with his Subjects corpses, that scarce any passage, but either through rivelets of bloud, or over bridges of bodies. And had he got as great a victory as <hi>David</hi> got in the forrest of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> yet surely hee would have preferred Peace farre before it. Well did <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> know <hi>Davids</hi> dyet, who to please his pallate, makes mention onely of Peace, and suppresseth victory, <hi>Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as my Lord the King is come to his owne house in peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. But the maine of Doctrine is this, All loyall Subjects ought to be glad when their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne is returned in peace. The sweetest mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96910:9"/>
of this Doctrine is in the close thereof, <hi>in peace</hi>; for nothing is more wofull then warre. The Lacedemonians were wont to make their servants drunke, and then to shew them to their children, that they then beholding their frantick fits and Apish behaviour, once seeing might ever shun that beastly vice. Our sins have made this land, which formerly was our faithfull servant, drunk with bloud: I hope our children, seeing the miserable fruits and effects thereof, will grow so wise and wary by their fathers follies, as for ever to take heed how they ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in such a civill warre againe. But why doe I compare warre to drunkennesse? which farre better may be resembled to the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, seeing all those symptomes that appeared in the possessed man, <hi>Mark</hi> 19. shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too evidently in all places where warre comes: <hi>And wheresoever he catcheth him, he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, and he fometh and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away.—And oft times it hath cast him into the fire, and oft times into the water to destroy him.</hi> Wheresoever war seizeth on City, Castle, Town, or Village he teareth it, making both brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the houses with batteries and fractions in mens hearts with divisions, till the place pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, having all the marrow and moisture of the wealth thereof wasted and consumed, oft times casting it into the fire, burning beautifull buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to ashes, and oft times into the water, drowning fruitfull medowes with wilfull inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96910:10"/>
Yea, if these times long continue, one of these two mischiefes will inevitably come to passe: Either (which is most probable) both sides being so equally poysed, will doe as the twelve Combatants <hi>in the field of strong men,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.16. <hi>thrust their swords in each other, and so fall downe both together</hi>; or if one party prove victorious, it will purchase the conquest at so deare a price as the destruction of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which will be done before. And what is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.22. of the siege of Jerusalem, is as true of our miserable times, <hi>And except those dayes were shortened, there should no flesh be saved:</hi> Would to God I could as truly adde the words that follow, <hi>But for the Elects sake those dayes shall be shortened.</hi> However in my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine there remaines an eternall truth, that all loyall Subjects ought to be glad when their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne returneth in peace.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Yea may some say, <hi>David</hi> deserved to be welcomed indeed, and at his return to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with all possible expressions of gladnesse, for he brought true religion along with him, and setled Gods service in the purity and precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof. But now adayes all cry to have Peace, to have Peace, and care not to have truth together with it. Yea there be many silly <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheths</hi> in our dayes that so adore Peace, that to attain it, they care not what they give away to the malignant <hi>Ziba's</hi> of our Kingdom. These say, <hi>Yea, let them take All,</hi> lawes, and liberties,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96910:10"/>
and priviledges, and proprieties, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Religion, and the Gospell, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and God himselfe. So be it that the Lord our King may come to his house in Peace. But let us have peace and truth together, both or neither; for if Peace offer to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we will doe with it, as <hi>Ezechiah</hi> did with the brazen <hi>Serpent,</hi> even break it to pieces, and stamp it to powder, as the dangerous Idoll of ignorant people.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I answer, God forbid, God forbid wee should have peace, and not truth with it; but to speak plainly, I would to God men did talk lesse of truth and love it more, have it seldomer in their mouthes, and oftner, yea alwayes in their heads and hearts, to believe and practice it. Know then that the word <hi>truth</hi> is subject to much <hi>Homonymie,</hi> and is taken in severall sences according to the opinions, or rather humours of those that use it. Aske the Anabaptist what is truth, and he will tell you, Truth is the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that the dominion over the creatures is founded in grace; and that wicked men, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they mean all such whom they shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to account and call so) neither use the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures right, nor have any right to use them, but may justly be dispossessed of them. It is truth that all goods should bee common, that there should be no civill Magistrate, that there ought to be no warres but what they make themselves, for which they pretend inspiration; that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96910:11"/>
ought not to bee baptized till they could give a reason of their faith, and that such as have been formerly, must be rebaptized Againe. Ask the Separatists what is Truth, and they will tell you, that the further from all ceremonies (though ancient and decent) the nearer to God, that it is against the liberty of a Christian to be press'd to the forme of a set prayer, who ought only to be Voluntaries, and follow the dictate of the spirit, that the Ministers made in our Church are Antichristian, with many more. Ask the Schismaticks of these times what is Truth, and they will bring in abundance of their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which I spare at this time to recite; the rather, because when the wheel of their fancie is turned about, another spoak may chance to be verticall, being so fickle in their Tenents, that what they account truth now, will perchance not be counted truth by them seven years hence.</p>
            <p n="20">20. To come close to the answer, I say, that some of their pretended truths are flat falsities, and others meer fooleries: as it easily to prove in time and place convenient. Secondly, Grant some of them be truths, yet are they not of that importance and concernment, as to deserve to imbroyle a Kingdome in blood to bring them in. <hi>David</hi> longed for the waters of the well of Bethlehem, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.17. <hi>but when it was brought him,</hi> hee checkt his owne vanitie, <hi>and would not drink it, because it was the blood of men that went in jeopardy of their lives.</hi> But with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96910:11"/>
what heart as men, or conscience as Christians, can Sectaries seek to introduce their devices with such violence unto the Church, when they know full well that it will cost blood before it be setled, and if it e're be done, <hi>non erit tanti,</hi> it will not quit cost, being in themselves slight, matters of mean consequence. Thirdly, Grant them not onely true, but important, if they be so desirous to have them introduced, the way most agreeable to Christian proceedings, is to have them fairely debated, freely disputed, fully decided, firmely determined by a still voyce, and not that their new Gospell should be given as the Law, with thundering and lightning of Cannon, fire and sword. Fourthly, Bee it affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for a certain truth, that formerly we had in our Churches all truths necessary to salvation. Of such as deny this, I ask <hi>Iosephs</hi> question to his Brethren, <hi>Is your father well, the old man, is he yet alive?</hi> So how fares the soules of their Sires, and the Ghosts of their Grand-fathers? are they yet alive? do they still survive in blisse, in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse? Oh no, they are dead, dead in soule, dead in body, dead temporally, dead eternally, dead and damned, if so be wee had not all truth necessary to salvation before this time. Yea, let these that cry most for the want of truth, shew one rotten kernell in the whole Pomegranet, one false Article in all 39. Let them shew where our Church is deficient in a necessary truth. But these men know wherein their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96910:12"/>
strength lyeth, and they had rather creep into <hi>houses, and lead away captive silly women laden with infirmities,</hi> then to meddle with men, and enter the lists to combate with the learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church.</p>
            <p n="21">21. But it is further objected, <hi>David</hi> brought home a true Peace with him, which long lasted firm, (the showre of <hi>Ziba's</hi> rebellion being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward quickly blown over.) But we have cause to suspect our Peace will not be a true Peace; and an open wound is better then a palliate cure. Would you have us put off our Armour to bee killd in our clothes? and bee surprized with warre on a sudden, when it will be past our policie to prevent, or power to resist it.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Answer, There must at last be a mutuall confiding on both sides, so that they must count the honesty of others their onely hostages. This the sooner it be done, the easier it is done. For who can conceive, that when both sides have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more wrongs they will sooner forgive, or when they have offered more wrongs be sooner forgiven. For our Kings part, let us demand of his mony what Christ ask'd of <hi>Caesars</hi> coyne; <hi>Whose image is this? Charls's</hi>? and what is the superscription? RELIGIO PROTESTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUM, LEGES ANGLIAE, LIBERTATES PARLIAMENTI, and he hath caused them to be cast both in silver and gold, in pieces of severall sizes and proportions; as if thereby to shew that he intends to make good his promise
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96910:12"/>
both to poore and rich, great and small, and we are bound to believe him. Nor lesse faire are the professions of the Parlament on the other side, &amp; no doubt but as really they intend them. But these matters belong not to us to meddle with, and as for all other politick objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Peace, they pertain not to the Pulpit to answer. All that wee desire to see, is the King re-married to the State; and we doubt not but as the Bridegroome on the one side will bee carefull to have his portion paid, <hi>His Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>; So the Brides friends entrusted for her, will be sure to see her joynter setled, —<hi>the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23. Come wee now briefly to apply our Text to the time. And wee begin first with <hi>the King,</hi> as this day doth direct us, and truly he may bee called so emphatically, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. We may observe in our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.7. that he spake nothing in the praise of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> whilst the Disciples of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> were in his presence, lest perchance he might have incurred the suspition of flattery, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Master before the servants: but the <hi>Text</hi> saith, <hi>as they departed Iesus began, &amp;c.</hi> to speak largely in <hi>Iohns</hi> commendation. Seeing now the servants of our Soveraign are generally gone hence to wait on their Lord, we may now boldly, without danger to make them puft up with pride, or our selves suspected for flattery, speak that in praise of their Master, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96910:13"/>
it selfe can not deny. Look above him, to his God, how is he pious? Look beneath to his Subjects, how is he pitifull? Look about him, how is hee constant to his wife, carefull for his children? Look neare him, how is hee good to his servants? Look farre from him, how is he just to forraigne Princes. We may see in our cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Kings that we shall scarce find any, but besides the common jnfirmities attending on mankind, were branded with some remarkable eye-sores. WILLIAM, a Conquerour, but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. RUFUS, resolute, but sacrilegious. HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY the first, learned, but unnaturall to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, STEVEN. stout, but an usurper. HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY the second, wise, but wanton. RICHARD the first, undaunted, but undutifull to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. <hi>Iohn,</hi> politique, but a great dissembler. HENRY the third, of great devotion, but of small depth. EDWARD the second, beautifull, but deboist. RICHARD the second, well na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, but ill manner'd. HENRY the fourth, fortunate, but having a false title. HENRY the fifth, a victorious King, but formerly a rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Prince. HENRY the sixth, Saint-like, but very simple. EDWARD the fourth, fortunate, but perjur'd: to proceed no further. But let malice it self stain our Soveraign with any notorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall fault For to wish him wholly without fault, were in effect to wish him dead. Besides this, consider him as a King, &amp; what favours hath he bestowed on his Subjects, and then, that his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96910:13"/>
curtesies might not unravell or fret out, hath bound them with a strong border, and a rich fringe, a Triennial Parliament. <hi>When God brought again the captivity of Sion, then were wee like unto them that dreame, Psal.</hi> 126. The Jewes would not believe their own happinesse, it was so great, so sudden. But when wee consider so many favours conferred upon us by our King in so few yeares, Ship-mony condemned, Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies removed, Starre-chamber it self censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, High-commission levelled, other Courts regulated, offensive Canons declined, burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ceremonies to tender consciences profer'd to bee abolished, Trienniall Parliaments setled, and the present indefinitely prolonged, we have cause to suspect with our selves, are we awake? Doe we not dream? Doe I speak? Doe you heare? Is it light? Doe wee not deceive our selves with fond fancies? or are not these Boones too big to beg? too great to be granted? such as our Fathers never durst desire, nor grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers hope to receive. O no, it is so, it is sure, it is certaine we are awake, we doe not dream; if any thing be asleep, it is our ingratitude; which is so drowsie to returne deserved thanks to God and the King for these great favours: And so much for the first, <hi>the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. Next to the King, comes <hi>my Lord the King,</hi> and this peculiarly concerns the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and such <hi>Mephibosheths</hi> as eat bread at his table, who under God owe their being to his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96910:14"/>
bounty, and whose states are not only made, but created by Him. These indeed of all other are bound most to rejoyce at their Soveraigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, being obliged thereunto by a threefold tye; Loyalty to a Soveraigne, duty to a Master, and gratitude to a Benefactour: except (as some fondly hold, that a letter seal'd with three seales may lawfully bee opened) any conceive that a threefold engagement may the easiest be decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Next, we insist on <hi>his own house,</hi> wherein this City is particularly pointed at. For if Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be the Jerusalem of our <hi>David,</hi> then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Westminster is his Sion, where he hath his constant habitation. Here is the principall Palace of his residence, the proper seat of his great Councell, the usuall receipt of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, the common Courts of Justice, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chaire of his Enthroning, the Royall ashes of his Ancestours, the fruitfull Nursery of his Children. You therefore the inhabitants of this City have most reason to rejoyce.</p>
            <p n="26">26. But alas! what have I done that I should not? or rather what have I to do that I cannot, having invited many guests now to a feast, and having no meat to set before you? I have called Courtiers and Citizens to rejoyce, and still one thing is wanting, and that a main materiall one, the founder of all the rest, the King is not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Peace. Thus the Sunne is slipt out of our Firmament, and the Diamond dropt out of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96910:14"/>
ring of my Text. I pretended and promised to make an application thereof to the time, and must I now be like the foolish Builder in the Gospel, begin and cannot finish? <hi>Own house,</hi> that is the bottom of the Text, but this stands empty. <hi>My Lord the King,</hi> and that is the top of the Text; but he is farre off: and the words which are the side-walls to joyne them together, <hi>Hee is come home in Peace.</hi> These alas cannot be erected: In this case there is but one remedy to help us, and that prescribed by our Saviour himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</hi>

            <p n="27">27. Let us pray faithfully, pray fervently, pray constantly, pray continually. Let Preacher and People joyne their praiers together, that God would be pleased to build up the walls, and make up the breach in the application, that what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be told, may be foretold for a truth; and that our Text may be verified of <hi>Charles</hi> in Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as by <hi>David</hi> in History. Excellently Saint <hi>Austin</hi> adviseth, that men should not be curious to enquire how <hi>originall sin</hi> came into them, but carefull to seek how to get it out. By the same si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude (though reversed) let us not be curious to know what made our King (who next to God I count our <hi>originall good</hi>) to leave this City, or whether offences given or taken mov'd him to his departure; but let us bend our brains, &amp; improve our best endeavours to bring him safely and speedily backe againe. How often herein have

our pregnant hopes miscarried, even when they were to be delivered? Just as a man in a storme swimming through the sea to the shore, till the oares of his faint armes begin to faile him, is now come to catch land, when an unmercifull wave beats him as far backe in an instant, as hee can recover in an hour. Just so when our hopes of a happy peace have bin ready to arrive, some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious unexpected obstacle hath started up, &amp; hath set our hopes <hi>ten degrees backwards, as the shadow of the Sun-diall of Ahaz.</hi> But let us not hereat be disheartened, but with blind <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> the more we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by unhappy accidents to hold our peace, let us cry the louder in our praiers. The rather, because our King is already partly come, come in his offer to come, come in his tender to treat, come in his proffer of peace: And this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day being the beginning of the Treaty, I may say he set his first step forward; God guide his feet, and speed his pace. Oh let us thriftily hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the least mite of hopes that it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and date our day from the first peeping of the morning starre, before the Sunne be risen. In a word, desist from sinning, persist in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then it may come to passe that this our Use may once be antidated, and this daies Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sent as a Harbinger before hand to provide a lodging in your hearts for your joy against the time, that <hi>my Lord our King shall returne to his owne house in peace.</hi>
