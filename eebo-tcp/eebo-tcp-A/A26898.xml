            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE great usefulness of History needs not many words to
prove it, seeing natural inclination it self is so much for it,
and reason and experience tell men, that they cannot spare it,
as to Natural, Civil, or Religious use. God himself hath highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it to us, by writing the Sacred Scriptures so much Historically;
yea and making some of it part of the necessary Articles of our Creed.
Children that yet understand not the Doctrinal part of the Bible, do
quickly take delight in the Historical part; which prepareth them for
the rest. Ignorant and ungodly persons that have no true sense of
Sacred Doctrine, can yet understand and with lesse aversness and
weariness read the history. Melancholy and sad persons who can
hardly bear long Doctrinal studies, are often eased and recreated
with useful History.</p>
            <p>Man is a part of the Vniverse, and every man is a part of the
world of mankind, and therefore thinketh the case of the whole to be
much of his concerne. And were not narrow selfishnes much of our
Pravity, we should take the universal and publick good, and Gods
Love to it and Pleasedness and Glory in it, to be much more our end,
and the object of our desire and delight, than any personal felicity of
our own; It is a Monster of inhumanity in the Doctrine of the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,
Spinosa, Hobbes,</hi> and their bruitish followers, that they set
up Individual self interest as a mans chiefest end and object of
rational Love and desire; and own no Good, but that which Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
is Good to me, that is, either my personal <hi>life and pleasure</hi> as
the end, or other things as a means thereto: Though <hi>Grace</hi> only saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure this base inhumane maladie, yet <hi>common reason</hi> beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against it, and only sense, and <hi>reason</hi> captivated by sense do pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
it. Put not the question to a reasonable man, though wicked,
<hi>what he can do or doth:</hi> But <hi>what in reason he should do,</hi> and
he cannot deny but that he should think of a more excellent person at the
<hi>Indies,</hi> that never will do anything for him, as more amiable than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb facs="tcp:60852:3"/>
much more many thousands such; And as <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi>
are all one, so that which is <hi>best,</hi> should be <hi>loved best:</hi> And
he that would not die to save his Country is worse than sober Heathens
were. And he that would not rather be annihilated than all or halfe
the world should be annihilated, is so basely selfish, that I should sooner
believe that analogical Reason ruleth some bruites, than that true
Reason determineth this mans choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spinosa</hi> taketh the <hi>Knowledge of our Union with Universal
nature</hi> (which he calleth God) to be mans perfection and his chief good,
in comparison of which sensual <hi>Pleasure, Riches and Honour</hi> are
but troubles further then they are a meanes hereto: And if he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known God, as the Creator and Governour and end of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Vniverse which he took to be God, and had joyned <hi>[holy
Uniteing Joyful Love to the Universe, and specially to the
Heavenly Society, and above them all to God himself]</hi> unto this
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> and extended it to the perpetuity of an Immortal state, he
had been happily in the right, which missing, he became a pernicious
seducer of himself and others.</p>
            <p>But thus nature and Grace do loudly tell us, that <hi>each part</hi> should
be greatly concerned for the <hi>whole,</hi> and therefore every one should
desire to know as much of the <hi>whole,</hi> as he is capable, and as tendeth
to his duty and delight. And how small a parcel of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi>
or <hi>Actions</hi> are present or in our daies? How little knoweth he
that knoweth no more than he hath lived to see? What Religion can
he have who knoweth not the History of Creation, Redemption or the
giving of the Holy Ghost, or the planting and propagating the
Church, and also what will be when this life is ended?</p>
            <p>But it is not all History that is needful or useful to us: There are
many things done which we are not concerned to be acquainted with.
But the History of the <hi>Church,</hi> of the propagation of the <hi>Christian
faith,</hi> and <hi>what the Doctrine was</hi> that was then received, and how
it was practised, promoted and defended, and how it was corrupted
invaded and persecuted, is of so great use to posterity, that next
to the Scripture and the illumination of Gods Spirit, I remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more needful to be known.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Philip Nerius</hi> set up his Oratorian exercises at <hi>Rome,</hi> as
to win the people, they found it necessary to use large affectionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate
prayers and expositions and Serm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, so the next thing found
necessary was, to bestow constantly one exercise in opening Church-Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:60852:3"/>
to the people. And this did both entice their attentions by delight,
and also by fitting reports more to the Papal interest than to the truth,
did greatly bewitch them into a confident beliefe, that the Papal sect
was all the true Church, and all other Christians were but sectaries and
branches broken off and withered, and therefore to be burned here and
hereafter (abusing <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>And I have oft thought that the right use of such an Historical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
in an ordinary congregation would be of great use to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
vulgar and unlearned zealous sort of Christians: For I find that
for want of the knowledge of Church-History, and how things have
gone before us in all former times, many errours and sins are kept up
that else would more easily be forsaken. To instance in some few.</p>
            <p>I. As it was the craft of <hi>Baronius</hi> (who performed that exercise
in <hi>Nerius</hi> his Conventicles at <hi>Rome,)</hi> to write afterward his Church-History
in Latin so voluminously, that few but the Clergie byassed by interest
would read it, and so the Clergy might be the credited reporters of all
to the vulgar; so to this day, the Papist-Priests contrive to be the
Masters and reporters of Church-History as well as of unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and to keep the Laity so far ignorant of it, that when they tell
men confident stories for their advantage, few or none may be able to
contradict them, and so their report must passe as undenyed truth. And
thus false History is made the chief foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Thus they will face you down that you are ignorant or impudent,
1. If you question whether <hi>Peter</hi> was a true Bishop at <hi>Rome,</hi> (yea
or ever there, which <hi>Nilus</hi> hath shewed to be somewhat uncertain) 2.
Or that he setled the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop as his successour in a supremacy
over all the Christian world, 3. Or that the Popes Primacie was over
all the Churches on earth, which indeed was but (as <hi>Canterburie</hi> is in
England,) in one <hi>Roman Empire</hi> only. 4. They will perswade you
that this Primacie was setled by Christ or his Apostles, which was done
only by Councils and Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> 5. They would make you
believe that this was from the Apostles daies, which began long after,
6. They would perswade you that all the Christian world submitted to
it, even <hi>Abassia,</hi> and all the extra-imperial Churches, which is no such
matter, 7. Yea, that before <hi>Luther</hi> none contradicted the Papal power
and claime, but all the Christian world were Papists. By many such
lies they deceive thousands of the ignorant: And when they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
men to dispute, by word or writing, their last refuge is to bring them
<pb facs="tcp:60852:4"/>
into a wood of History, that there they may either win the game or end the
chase: And if a Minister of Christ be not armed here, to confute their
historical forgeries, they will take it for a victory and triumph, which
made me write my last book against <hi>Johnson</hi> (or <hi>Terret)</hi> to shew Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically
the Antiquity of our Church, and the novelty of theirs (which
I could wish young Ministers unacquainted with Church-History would
peruse.)</p>
            <p>But if our people were truely acquainted how things have gone in the
Church from the beginning, it would be one of the most effectual, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives
against Popery, when now the falsifications are become its strength.
I have oft thought that it had been greater policy in the Papists, if they
could, to have burnt all Church-History, but specially of the Councils,
that the credit might have depended on their bare word: For verily
once reading of <hi>Crab, Binnius, Surius,</hi> or <hi>Nicolinus</hi> would turn against
them any stomack, that is not confirmed in their own disease. But they
have overdone <hi>Baronius,</hi> and now made so great and costly a load of
the Councils, as that the deficiency of money, time, wit and patient
industry, shall save the most, even of the Priesthood from the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the truth: And such Epitomes as <hi>Caranza's</hi> leave out most of
the culpable part: and yet even such they can hardly tolerate.</p>
            <p>II. The more moderate <hi>French</hi> Papists who magnifie Councils aboue
Popes, would make us believe, that though Popes are fallible and may mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
yet General Councils, have been the universal Church-representative,
which have a Legislative and Iudicial Vniversal power, and that our
concord must be by centring in their decrees; and all are Schismaticks at
least, that take not their Faith and Religion upon their trust: But if
men knew that there never was a General Council of all the Christian
Churches but only of the Empire, and how wofully they have miscarried,
it would do much to save them from all such temptations.</p>
            <p>III. The overvaluers of Church grandure, and wealth, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of the corrupt sort of Diocesane Prelacy, Patriarks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> write
books and tell the ignorant confident stories, how such a Prelacy hath
been in the Church ever since the dayes of the Apostles, and that all the
Churches on earth consented to it: But if the people were acquainted with
Church. History they would know, that the primitive fixed Episcopacy was
Parochial, or <hi>every Church associated for personal present Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
had a Bishop, Presbytery and Deacons of their own:</hi> (unfixed
Itinerant General Pastors, indefinitely taking care of many Churches): And
that it was the Bishops striving who should be greatest, and turning single
<pb facs="tcp:60852:4"/>
Churches into an Association of many Churches, and to be but Chappels
or parts of the Diocesan Church (that their power and wealth might
be enlarged with their Territories) and the turning of Arbitrating Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
into the Common Indicatures, which must govern all Christians,
and such like, which poysoned the Church, and turned the species of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches, Episcopacy, Presbytery and Discipline, quite into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing. And to speak freely, it was the many blind volumes and
confident clamours of some men, that rail at us, as denying an Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which the universal Church hath always agreed in, which drew me to
write this abridgement of the Church History of Bishops, Councils and
Popes.</p>
            <p>IV. And those that make the Ignorant believe that seditious disobedient
Presbyters have in all Ages been the dividers of the Church, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
the means of Vnity, concord and suppression of such Schismaticks
and Hereticks, could never thus deceive the people, were but so much
Church-History commonly known, as I have here collected. Read Church-History
and believe that if you can.</p>
            <p>V. And many that take up any new opinion or dotage which is but
newly broached among them, would have been saved from it, if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but known how that same opinion or the like, was long ago taken up by
Hereticks, and exploded by the faitbful Pastors and people of the Church.</p>
            <p>VI. And the sectaries who rashly seperate from some Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of some <hi>forms, opinions or ceremonies,</hi> which almost all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
on earth have used, in the former purer ages, and still use, would
be more cautelous and fearful in examining their grounds, and would
hardly venture to seperate from any Church for that, which on the same
reason would move them to separate from almost all Christians in the
whole world; if not Vnchurch the Church of Christ: And ancient
errours and crimes would affright us from imitating them.</p>
            <p>VII. And those that make <hi>new</hi> ambiguous words or unnecessary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
to become necessary to Church Communion, and hereticate all that
differ from them, or persecute them at least, would be more frightened
from such pernicious courses, if they well knew what have been the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of them heretofore.</p>
            <p>VIII. And it is not unuseful to Princes and Magistrates to see what
hath corrupted and disturbed the Churches in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmer times: and what
cause they have to keep the secular power from the Clergies hands, and to
value those that for knowledge and piety are meet for their proper guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
office, and use of the Church Keys: but not to corrupt them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb facs="tcp:60852:5"/>
of worldly wealth and power, nor to permit them by striving, who
shall seem GREATEST, WISEST and BEST, to become
the incendiaries of the Church and world, and the persecutors of the
best that cannot serve their worldliness and pride.</p>
            <p>The Reader must Note, 1. That though much of the History be taken
from others, the Councils are named and numbred according to <hi>Binnius</hi>
and <hi>Crabbe:</hi> 2. And that because so much evil is necessarily recited, I
thought it needful in the beginning and end to annex a defence of the
Pastors and their office and work, lest any should be tempted to think
hardly of Religion and the Church for mens abuses. 3. And if <hi>Micre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Gutlerbeth, Phili Pareus, Funcius, Carion, Melancthon, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotzer,
Scultetus, Pezelius, Helvicus,</hi> or any other that I have seen, had
answered the ends which I here intend, I should have gladly saved my self
this labour and have refer'd the reader to them.</p>
            <p>The Councils are now published voluminously, and many young students
want money and time to read them at large. To such this abridgement
may not be unuseful; especially to men that have mistaken the case of the
great heresies and hereticators, and would know what Prelacy and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
have done to the concord or discord of the Churches. The Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the State of <hi>Alexandria</hi> recited in the beginning as a Letter from
a friend, was from <hi>Mr. Clerkson</hi> a Learned and worthy Minister (though
silenced) now in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord pardon and heal our common faultiness, and give better
Teachers to his Churches when we are dead and gone, who will take
warning by all our errours and miscarriages, especially to escape a wordly
spirit, pride, Church-tyranny and schism, and serving the world, the flesh
and the Devil, by pretence of Authority from Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>VVhat History is Credible, and what not.</head>
            <p>AS the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>Believe not every spirit;</hi> I may say, Believe not
all Reports, or History. It was not only <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets, in whose
mouths Satan was a <hi>lying spirit:</hi> As <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceiving</hi> is his work in the
world, for the destroying of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and of <hi>Souls,</hi> even when he turneth
himself into an Angel of Light; so is it the work of his Ministers, when
they seem to be Ministers of Righteousness; when it is oft said <hi>(Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)</hi>
and <hi>[Let no man deceive you with vain words;]</hi> it is more necessary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
and hardlier followed, than most men understand. As <hi>Truth</hi> is Gods
means to work the will to <hi>holy love,</hi> and lead us in a <hi>holy life,</hi> so <hi>Lying</hi> is the
Devils means to oppose them: and of all Lyars, none are more pernicious
than <hi>lying Historians,</hi> and <hi>lying Preachers.</hi> It is a sad <hi>perplexity</hi> to the world,
that when men <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> even the more confident and plausible Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
and Reports, they know not whether they are true or false; and if
they believe that to be true which is not, the effect is worse than this <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.</hi>
I will tell you what I take to be credible, and what not.</p>
            <p>I. It is presupposed that a man must believe his senses, if sound, about
their proper objects: Papists that tell us that all mens senses are deceived,
when they seem to perceive <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the Sacrament, do but tell us
that no man then is to be believed, and therefore not they themselves.</p>
            <p>II. The History of the Gospel is certainly credible, because it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by multitudes of uncontrouled Miracles wrought by Christ, and by
his Apostles, and multitudes of Christians; as the Doctrine it self beareth
the Image and Superscription of God.</p>
            <p>III. The Prophets that had Divine Inspiration and Vision, had that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which gave themselves a certainty, though not to others.</p>
            <p>IV. When History delivereth a matter of fact and sense, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent of all men that knew it, though of contrary minds, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and interests, it giveth us a certainty which may be called Natural;
because Nature hath nothing in it that could cause such a Conspiracy in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
That it is so credible as to be a <hi>Natural certainty,</hi> that there is such a
place as <hi>Rome, Paris, Ierusalem;</hi> that the Statutes of the Land are not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
while all Contenders plead them against each other, and hold by
them their Estates and Lives: And so that there was such a Person as Jesus
Christ, and that the Scriptures were written by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. When the History of any person and action is proved by continued or
visible effects: as that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> conquered <hi>England,</hi> while so
many of the effects of that Conquest in our Laws and Customs are still visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And that the <hi>Welsh</hi> were the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> driven by the <hi>Saxons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Wales,</hi> while their Language, Habitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shew it: And so that
Christ instituted Baptism, and Church-Communion, and the Apostles se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<pb facs="tcp:60852:6"/>
the Lords Day for holy worship, when the Christian World hath
used all these publickly in all places ever since, and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them: And
so that Temples were built for holy worship, and endowed, when we still
see and possess them.</p>
            <p>VI. That History is credible which consentingly speaketh against the
known interest of the Author; for mans corrupt nature is apte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to false
boasting, than to false Confessions of Sin; against a Confessor there needs
no Witnesses: And this is much of the credibility of the harsher part of
the Church-History which I here recite: What I say of the miscarriages of
Bishops and Councils, is mostly in their own words, and what I say against
Popes, is but the recital of what is said by the greatest Defenders or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
of Popes: I give you no Reports against the pride, contentions and
corruptions of Patriarchs and Prelates, out of the supposed Hereticks, or
Protestants; I give you not a word out of <hi>Lut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er</hi> (who <hi>de Conciliis)</hi> hath
very much; and especially speaketh much like as I here do of <hi>Cyril</hi> and
<hi>Nestorius;</hi> nor out of <hi>Illyricus</hi> his <hi>Catalogus Testium Veritatis,</hi> nor out of
the <hi>Magdeburgenses, Osiander, Sleidan, Carion, Melancthon, Mornay</hi>'s <hi>Mystery of
Iniquity,</hi> no nor out of the Collections of <hi>Goldastus, Marquardus, Freherus,
Ruberus, Pistorius, &amp;c.</hi> But the substance of the common History is taken
out of the commonly received Church-Historians <hi>(Eusebius, Socrates, Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,
Cassiodorus, Theodorite, Ruffinus, Evagrius, Nazianzen, Hierom, Victor,
Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ephorus, Liberatus, Nicetas,</hi> and such others; and the sum of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Popes is out of <hi>Baronius, Anastasius,</hi> but most out of <hi>Binnius,</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi>
and <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (a Pope,) <hi>Petavius,</hi> and such other as are the
greatest Papal Zealots: When these speak <hi>for their Cause,</hi> I leave you to
just <hi>suspition;</hi> but when they speak <hi>against it,</hi> by way of confession or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
they are not to be suspected.</p>
            <p>VII. The next degree of credibility dependeth on the Veracity or credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fitness of the Reporter; some men are much more credible than others:
For instance.</p>
            <p>1. One that was <hi>upon the place,</hi> and <hi>saw</hi> what was done, or lived near,
where he had full information, is <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> more credible than
one that followeth uncertain reports, or hear-say.</p>
            <p>2. A wise man is much more credible than a proud self-conceited Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Fool.</p>
            <p>3. One that hath made a matter his long and hard study, is <hi>(caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus)</hi>
more to be believed in that matter, than many ignorant men.</p>
            <p>4. One that is impartial, a lover of peace, and not ingaged by faction or
interest to one side against the other, is <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> much more credible
than a factious interested man.</p>
            <p>5. A sober, calm, considerate man, that will stay and try before he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is more credible than a passionate or hasty judger.</p>
            <p>6. A man of manifest honesty, conscience, and the fear of God, is much
more to be believed than a worldly, wicked, bloody, unconscionable
man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60852:6"/>
7. <hi>Caeteris Paribus</hi> many agreed honest impartial men are more to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
than one, or a few odd and singular persons, who have no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
than the rest to know the truth.</p>
            <p>8. The young and unexperienced owe some eoverence to the judgment
of their <hi>Seniors,</hi> as more credible by age and experience than their own.</p>
            <p>9. Accordingly Children to their Parents, and Scholars to their Masters
and Tutors owe such belief as is answerable to their difference, and the use
of their learning of them.</p>
            <p>By this you may see on the contrary who is not worthy of belief.</p>
            <p>I. One that pretendeth Inspiration, Vision, Revelation, and giveth the
hearer no sufficient proof of it.</p>
            <p>II. One that pretendeth to tell you things beyond his reach; as many
Philosophers do about the mysteries of Nature, spiritual and corporeal, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
or mixt bodies, above and below, of which the Books of many are
full, and malignant men, that take on them to tell you other <hi>mens hearts,</hi>
without just proof, that they are hypocrites, and intend that which they
never did, or meant ill, when they said or did well; and when false Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
will tell you with what (unproved) ill purposes or deceits, persons a
thousand miles off, and perhaps a thousand years past, whom they never
knew, did say and do all that is reported of them.</p>
            <p>III. When there are but <hi>few reporters</hi> of things pretended to be <hi>known
publickly</hi> in the world, especially when more <hi>credible persons</hi> contradict
them.</p>
            <p>IV. When the person is deeply ingaged in a Party, and carrying on all for
the interest of his Party, doth give you but his word, or the report of his
own Party for what he saith; so that you may perceive that interest byasseth
him to partiality.</p>
            <p>V. When the Historian sheweth a malignant spirit, that extenuateth or
denieth all the good that was in his Adversaries, and fasteneth on them as
much <hi>Odium</hi> as he can without just proof, and justifieth all the reproach
that is used against them.</p>
            <p>VI. When the Historian liveth so far off from the place and time, that
he is no competent reporter, having all his notice but by the fame of his
own Faction, as uncapable as himself.</p>
            <p>VII. When the sober moderate men of his own party contradict him,
and speak well of the persons whom he reproacheth.</p>
            <p>VIII. When the reporter is manifestly a proud, worldly, wicked, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
man, especially of a bloody hurtful disposition: For as Gods three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Influence, or the <hi>Vnderstanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> is but one, so the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
doth usually vitiate together the <hi>Vnderstanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> and he
that is from the beginning an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and a <hi>Murderer,</hi> is also a <hi>Lyar:</hi>
Though a <hi>wicked, malignant,</hi> and <hi>cruel man,</hi> may yet have an opinionative faith
and knowledge, and preach the truth, when it is for his carnal interest; yet
when his malice and interest tempteth him against it, there is no trusting his
word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60852:7"/>
IX. When an ignorant proud man thinketh that he must be believed
meerly for the reverence and authority of his place.</p>
            <p>X. When the reporter liveth in a time and place where carnal interest
hath got the major Vote for falshood, and it passeth commonly for truth,
especially where Tyranny, Civil or Ecclesiastical, silenceth the truth in
Press, Pulpit, and Discourse, that it dare not be spoken; by which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
have not only made their own writings and reports incredible, but by
their <hi>Indices Expurgatorios,</hi> and base corrupting of ancient Writers, have
weakned our certainty of much of the old History and Fathers.</p>
            <p>XI. When the reporter is a weak and silly man, that hath not wit to sift
out the truth.</p>
            <p>XII. When he is passionately rash, and of hasty judgment, and hath not
patience to stay and suspend his judgment till he hear all.</p>
            <p>XIII. When it is a Novice or raw Student, that hath not had time, helps
and experience to know what he pretends to know, and yet contradicteth
wiser men of more advantage and experience.</p>
            <p>XIV. When present experience telleth us, that the party that he writeth
against as unlearned or wicked, are men of Eminent Learning, and the
fear of God; and that the party that he magnifieth as such, are contrary;
by such marks incredible History may be discerned.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But how can we know mens wisdome, and piety, and honesty, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
when we never knew the men? Ans.</hi> Though hypocrites may much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
truth and goodness, its hard so to do it, but the contrary which
ruleth in them will break out, as a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ink will get through narrow passages:
and though truth and honesty may be much clouded, they have, like light,
a self-revealing power.</p>
            <p>To give you some instances; as among Physitians <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi>
and <hi>Celsus</hi> of old; and of late <hi>Montanus, Crato Fernelius, Platerus, Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and such others, do speak with that self-evidencing honesty, and many
<hi>Paracelsians</hi> with that palpable vanity, that one of them will constrain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and the other unbelief, even in them that never heard what they were:
So among Historians, <hi>Eusebius,</hi> though counted an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi>
and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> though called <hi>Novatians,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Liberatus,</hi> and some
others, do write so as to constrain belief of things which were within their
notice, and with honest impartiality: Among the Papists, what clear foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of understanding, honesty, and impartiality, and so of truth, is there
in <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and much in <hi>Commines, Guicciardine,</hi> Father <hi>Paulus Servita</hi>
Hist. of <hi>Trent</hi> Council, and divers others: Though Doctor <hi>Iames</hi> bid us
keep <hi>Crab,</hi> because the later Councils are corrupt, and all of them must be
taken with due Antidotes, yet because most of the matter is fetcht from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Acts and Records, they are more credible than most single History;
<hi>Acosta</hi> speaketh impartially of the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and <hi>Godignus</hi> of the <hi>Abassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Matth. Paris</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Pope, and so of some others: Of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
some do but recite recorded testimonies, or publick acts, and the
very writings themselves of the times they speak of, when others do but
<pb facs="tcp:60852:7"/>
tell you stories on their bare word: <hi>Goldastus, Ruberus, Freherus,</hi> and <hi>Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
do but give us Collections of the writings of those former Ages, and
nothing of their own: So doth Mr. <hi>Rushworth</hi> now in his three Volumes of
Collections; and Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> hath partly done so, and writeth moderately;
Mr. <hi>Gilbert Burnet</hi> thus writeth the History of the Reformation, laying not
the credit on his word, but on his Evidences; and <hi>Cambden</hi> impartially
thus writeth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in his <hi>Brittania: Vsher</hi> hath done the
like, <hi>de succes. Eccles.</hi> of the <hi>Waldenses;</hi> and in his <hi>de Primordiis Eccl. Brit.</hi>
of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> not <hi>saying,</hi> but <hi>proving</hi> by Records, and old Evidences,
what he delivereth, besides the advantage of his known extraordinary
learning, honesty, and impartiality; so doth <hi>Fox</hi> for the most part in his
<hi>Martyrology</hi> give you but the publick Record, or proved Histories (though
<hi>Cope</hi> call him lyar) <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Bucholtzer</hi> were men of such known sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
as constraineth credit to their reports.</p>
            <p>On the other side, who can believe such palpable Railers as <hi>Tympius, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus,
Genebrard,</hi> and many such, that lye contrary to <hi>certain evidence?</hi> such
as make the Vulgar believe, that <hi>Luther</hi> learnt his Religion of the Devil, and
was killed by him; that <hi>Oecolanpadius</hi> was kill'd by the Devil; that
<hi>Bucer</hi> had his guts pull'd out, and cast about by the Devil; that <hi>Calvin</hi> was
a stigmatized <hi>Sodomite</hi> and Sensualist; that <hi>Beza</hi> died a Papist (who lived
long after to write a Confutation) and abundance such. <hi>Melchior Adam</hi>
gathereth his History of Lives from the Pens of those that most intimately
knew the persons, what able, holy, laborious, and excellent servants of
God were <hi>Calvin, Beza, Daneus, Knox,</hi> and many such, as described by <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and in the judgment of those that were their most knowing obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
But what vile rebellious wretches were they in the judgment of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Heylin,</hi> and such as he? what excellent persons did God use for the
beyond-sea Reformation? even as in <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Holland; Iewel, Bilson,</hi> and
other Bishops, defend that which <hi>Heylin</hi> describeth as the most odious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions:
He maketh the <hi>Geneva</hi> Presbyterians to do that against their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
which Dr. <hi>Pet. Moulin</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> sheweth
was done before, while they were Papists. Some things in <hi>Heylins</hi> History
of the Reformation, and the Presbyterians, I believe, which he bringeth
Records for; but upon his own word I can scarce believe any thing that he
saith, so palpably partial is he, and of so malicious and bloody a strain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
excellent persons as odious intollerable Rogues, and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
even of the <hi>Lutherans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as too bad, but that in <hi>France, Belgia, Fries<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

most odious Rebellions, Murders, and horrid Sacriledge; and ours in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

Bishops as <hi>Grindall, Abbot,</hi> and <hi>Vsher,</hi> and such excellent Divines as

sight, that in my own acquaintance, I have found that sort of men, whom
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> and such other reproach as Presbyterians and Puritans, to be the
most serious, conscionable, practical, sober, and charitable Christians that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I knew, yea verily the knowledge of them hath been a great help to
the stedfastness of my Faith in Christ: Had I known no Christians but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
worldly, and formal men, who excel not Heathens in any thing but O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
it would have tempted me to doubt whether Christ were the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Souls, as I should think meanly of the Physitian that doth no
cures: But when I see holy mortified persons, living in the love of God
and man, I see that Faith is not a dead fancy: And when I have lived in
intimate familiarity with such, from my Childhood, to the sixty fifth year
of my age, and known their integrity, notwithstanding their infirmities;
and then read such Histories as represent them as the most odious, flagitious
persons, I see it is not for nothing that some men are called <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Two Crimes I have long ago heard the Rabble charge on those whom they
called <hi>Puritans, Lying</hi> and <hi>Covetousnes;</hi> whereas near two thousand Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are cast out, and suffer, which they could mostly escape, if they durst
but lye; and if I ask money for the Poor (of what party soever) I can
sooner get a Pound from those called <hi>Puritans,</hi> than a Shilling from others
far richer than they. Can I take any men to be other than malignant lyars
who would make men believe that such men as <hi>Hildersham, Dod, Rogers,
Ball, Paul Bagne, Ames, Bradshaw, &amp;c.</hi> were Rogues and seditious Rebels, or
that revile such as <hi>Vsher, Hall, Davenant, &amp;c.?</hi> Reader, believe not a word
of any of the revilings or odious characters and stories, which any aspiring
worldly factious Clergy man writeth of such as are his Adversaries: lying
is their too common language; yea, if they do but once set themselves
eagerly to seek Preferment, I will never trust them, or take their words:
It hath been so of old, the same man that was a Saint to his Acquaintance,
hath been described as wicked, or a Devil by others: How bad were <hi>Origen</hi>
and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to <hi>Theophilus, Alexand.</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius?</hi> And how bad was
<hi>Theophilus</hi> to the Historians that write his actions? How excellent a person
was <hi>Cyril Alex.</hi> to the Council of <hi>Colcedon,</hi> and how bad a man was he to
<hi>Theodoret, Isidore, Pleus. &amp;c. Ignatius Const.</hi> was a Saint to <hi>Nicetas,</hi> and many
others, and to <hi>Photius</hi> he was an <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>wicked limb of the Devil:
Photius</hi> was a <hi>holy man</hi> to his Party, and a <hi>wicked wretch</hi> to <hi>Nicetas,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Yea, see the credit of worldly Prelates; the same Bishops one year
cry down <hi>Ignatius</hi> as a <hi>wicked man,</hi> and call <hi>Photius</hi> a <hi>holy person,</hi> and the
next year, or shortly after, cry down <hi>Photius</hi> for a <hi>Rogue,</hi> and cry up <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi>
yea, and upon the next turn cry up <hi>holy Photius</hi> whom they had ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized:
These doings were familiar with carnal Prelates.</p>
            <p>But as Gods Spirit in his servants is so suited to the Doctrine of the
same Spirit, that they relish it where they find it; so their piety and honesty
is such a self-evidencing thing, that pious and honest-men that knew them,
cannot believe their lying slanderers.</p>

the Parliaments complaints of Popery, Arminianism, and Arbitrary Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities;
and after saith (Hist. Presb. p. 465. 470.) <hi>The truth is, that as
the</hi> English <hi>generally were not willing to receive that yoak; so neither did the
Houses really intend to impose it on them, though for a while to hold fair quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the</hi> Scots, <hi>they seemed forward in it. This appears by their Declaration

            </p>
            <p>To this I say, I have no acquaintance with any <hi>Scots</hi> Minister, nor ever
had in my life, except with Bishop <hi>Sharp</hi> that was murdered, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops (and two or three that live here in <hi>London)</hi> therefore what
they are I know not, save by Fame: But though I have heard that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
asperst, as too much inclin'd to Fornication, I never before heard the
<pb facs="tcp:60852:9"/>
Religious part and Ministers so accused: Either it is <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>false;</hi> if <hi>false,</hi>
shame be to the <hi>reporters;</hi> if <hi>true,</hi> what doth it concern us here, or any
that are innocent, any further than to abhor it, and lament it, and to be
thankful to God that it is another sort of men that are called <hi>Puritans</hi> in
<hi>England;</hi> and that in all <hi>my acquaintance with them these 56 years (which
hath been with very many in many Countries) I remember not that ever I heard of
one</hi> Puritan, <hi>man or woman, save one, accused or suspected of fornication;</hi> and
that one yet living, though openly penitent, hath lived disowned and
shamed to this day; but I have heard of multitudes that revile them, that
make a jest and common practice of it: Try whether you can make the
Inhabitants of this City believe, that the Nonconformists or Puritans are
fornicators, drunkards, or perjured, and that their accusers and haters are
innocent men that hate them for such Crimes! But its possible that you
may make men of other Countries or Ages believe it, and believe that we
wear Horns, and have Cloven Feet, and what you will; but I fear not all
your art or advantages on those that are acquainted with both sides: But
the misery is, that faction ingageth men to associate only with their party
where they hear reproaches of the unknown dissenters, from whom they
so estrange themselves, that the Neighbours near them are as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to them, save by lying same, as if they lived an hundred miles from
them. I remember Mr. <hi>Cressey</hi> once wrote to me, that <hi>he turned from the
Protestant Religion to the Roman, because there was among us no spiritual Books
of Devotion for Soul Elevations, and affectionate Contemplation:</hi> And I told
him it was Gods just Judgment on him, that lived so strange to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
because they are called <hi>Puritans,</hi> and to their Writings, which Shops
and Libraries abound with; had he read Bishop <hi>Halls,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenhams,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Ri. Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Io. Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hildershams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boltons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Downhams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Reyners,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sibbes, &amp;c.</hi> yea or no better than my own
<hi>(the Saints Rest, the Life of Faith, the Divine Life, the Christian Directory, &amp;c.)</hi>
or had he read the Lives of Divines called Puritans (or but such as two
young men (published partly by my self) <hi>Ioseph Allen,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Ianeway)</hi>
he would never have gone from the Protestants to the Papists, because
of our formality and want of an affectionate spiritual sort of devotion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
knowing what excess of formality is among the Papists, and how
much it is of the Clergies accusation of the Puritans, that they are for
too little form, and too much pretence of spiritual devotion.</p>
            <p>But if any called Religious, or Puritans, or Presbyterians be vicious, I
know no men that so heartily desire their punishment and ejection, as those
that are called by the same names: I thank God that these twenty years,
while neither <hi>Wit, Will,</hi> nor <hi>Power</hi> hath been wanting against them, I have
scarce heard of two men (if one) that have been judged and proved guilty
of any such immorality, of all the ejected silenced Ministers in this Land:
I would I could say so of their Adversaries.</p>
            <p>II. And now I must speak to the Accusers speeches of my self; I thank
you Sir that you feigned no worse against me; if I am an <hi>Haeresiarcha,</hi> why
<pb facs="tcp:60852:9"/>
would not you vouchsafe to name that Heresie which I have owned: I have
given you large Field-room, in near 80 Books; and few men can so write,
as that a willing man may not find some words which he is able to call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie:
A little learning, wit, or honesty, will serve for such an hereticating
presumption. 2. I never heard that <hi>Arminius</hi> was called an <hi>Arminian,</hi> nor

knack of making Names, you best know your ends, and best know how to
fit them to it. 3. But seriously, do you not know my Judgment? will not
about 80 Books inform you? how then can I help it? 4. No, but you know
not what Party I am of, nor what to call me; I am sorrier for you in this
than for my self; if you know not, I will tell you, I am a CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN,
a MEER CHRISTIAN, of no other Religion; and the
Church that I am of is the Christian Church, and hath been visible where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Christian Religion and Church hath been visible: But must you
know what Sect or Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y I am of? I am against all Sects and dividing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
But if any will call <hi>Meer Christians</hi> by the name of a <hi>Party,</hi> because
they take up with <hi>meer Christianity, Creed,</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> and will not be of
any dividing or contentious Sect, I am of that Party which is so against
Parties: If the Name CHRISTIAN be not enough, call me a CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOLICK
CHRISTIAN; not as that word signifieth an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticating
majority of Bishops, but as it signifieth one that hath no Religion,
but that which by Christ and the Apostles was left to the Catholick Church,
or the Body of Jesus Christ on Earth.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, I am sorry that you are not content with meer Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to be a Member of the Catholick Church, and hold the Communion
of Saints, but that you must needs also be of a Sect, and have some other
Name: And how shall I know that your Sect is better than another?
Were not the Papists Sectaries and Schismaticks, damning most of Christs
Body on Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for not being subject to their Pope, I should not be so much
against them. I find promises of Salvation in Scriptures to Believers, that
is, Christians as such (if such sincerely,) but none of the salvation of men
as <hi>Papists, Diocesans, Grecians, Nestorians, Eutychians, &amp;c.</hi> I would say also
<hi>[nor as Protestants]</hi> did I not take the Religion called <hi>Protestant</hi> (a Name
which I am not fond of) to be nothing but <hi>simple Christianity,</hi> with oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Popery, and other such corruption. And now you know your
own designs, your tongue is your own, and who can controul you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you will call us; but I, and such others, call our selves MEER
CHRISTIANS, or CATHOLICK CHRISTIANS, against
all Sects and Sectarian names, and haters both of true <hi>Heresie, Schisme,</hi> and
<hi>proud, unrighteous, hereticating</hi> and <hi>Anathematizing.</hi> Psal. 4. <hi>O ye sons of men,
how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and
seek after lying? But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for
himself:</hi> Psal. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaseth; for the
faithful fail from among the children of men: They speak vanity every one with

I will add, that if to be serious in the belief of the Christian Faith, and

               <head type="sub">Of the sacred Ministry, Episcopacy and Councils, necessary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions:
and of the Design of this Book.</head>
               <p>§. 1. GOD that could have enlightned the Earth without the
Sun and Stars, could immediately alone have taught his
Church, and communicated knowledge to mankind: But
as he is the most communicative good, he was pleased
not only to make his Creatures receptive of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,
but also to give them the use and honour of being efficient sub-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants
under him, and causes of good to themselves and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And as his <hi>Power</hi> gave <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> his <hi>Wisdom</hi> gave <hi>Order</hi> and
<hi>Harmony,</hi> and his <hi>Love</hi> gave <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Perfection, felicity</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> as
he is the creating and conserving Cause of Nature; and this in much ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
as he was the free disposer of his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so in the Kingdom of
Grace he doth by the Spirit of <hi>Life, Light,</hi> and <hi>Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. Quicken and
strengthen the dead and weak souls, and awaken the slumbering and sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
2. Illuminate the dark with Faith and Knowledge; and 3. Sanctifie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60852:24"/>
the malignant Enemies of holiness, by the power of his communicated
love, making them friends and joyful lovers: This Spirit first filled the
Humane Nature of Christ our Head; who first communicated it to some
chosen persons in an eminent manner and degree, as Nature maketh the
heart and brain and other principal parts to be <hi>organical,</hi> in <hi>making, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,</hi>
and <hi>governing</hi> the rest. To these he gave an eminence of Power
to work Miracles, of Wisdom to propagate the Word of life, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
by Preaching and Writing promulgate and record his sacred Gospel,
and of <hi>holy love</hi> to kindle the like by zealous holiness in the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
To these <hi>organical persons</hi> he committed the Oeconomy of being
the <hi>witnesses</hi> of his <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> his resurrection and ascension, and
of recording them in writing, of planting his first Churches, and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth of their testimony by many Miracles, promising them his
Spirit to perform all that he committed to their trust, and to bring all to
their remembrance, and to lead them into all truth, and to communicate
instrumentally his Spirit to others, the sanctifying gifts by blessing their
Doctrine, and the miraculous gifts by their imposition of hands.</p>
               <p>§. 2. By these principal Ministers the first Church was planted at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
(fitliest called the Mother-Church) and after by those that were
sent thence many Churches were gathered in many Kingdoms of the
world, darkness being not able to resist the light. The Apostles and
Evangelists and Prophets delivered to them the Oracles of God, <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to observe all things that Christ had commanded them,</hi> and practically
teaching them the <hi>true Worship of God, ordering their Assemblies,</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining</hi>
them such Officers for sacred Ministration as Christ would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the end of the world, and shewing the Churches <hi>the way</hi> by
which they <hi>must be continued,</hi> and describing all the work of the Office ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them by Christ.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The Apostles were not the Authors of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or of any <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
part</hi> of the Christian Religion, but the <hi>Receivers</hi> of it from <hi>Christ,</hi>
and <hi>Preachers</hi> of it to the <hi>world:</hi> Christ is the <hi>Author and finisher,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter
of our faith. But they had besides the power of <hi>infallible remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
knowing</hi> and <hi>delivering</hi> it, a double power about matters of <hi>Order</hi>
in the <hi>Church:</hi> 1. By the special gift of the Spirit's inspiration, to <hi>found
and stablish such Orders</hi> as were to continue to the end, and none that
came after them might change, they being the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> in them. 2. Temporarily, <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> to make convenient muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Constitutions, in matters left by the great Legislator to humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to be determined according to his general regulating Laws. In
this <hi>last</hi> the Apostles have Successors; but not in the <hi>former:</hi> No other
have their <hi>Gift,</hi> and therefore not their <hi>Authority:</hi> No men can be
said to have an Office that giveth them Right to exercise abilities which
they never had nor shall have.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Christ summed up all the Law in LOVE to God and Man, and
the works of Love; and all the Gospel in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60852:24"/>
them kindled and exercised by the Spirit which he giveth them; even by
the Belief and Trust of his Merits, Sacrifice, Intercession and Promises,
and the <hi>prospect</hi> of the future Glory promised, fortifying us to all holy
duties of obedience, and diligent seeking what he hath promised, and to
patient bearing of the Cross, conquering the inordinate love of the
world and flesh and present life, and improving all our present sufferings,
and preparing for his coming again, and for our change and entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Masters joy.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Christ summed up the Essentials of Christianity in the Baptismal
Covenant, in which we give up our selves in Faith, Hope, and consenting
Love, to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, our Creator, Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Sanctifier, and in which God receiveth us in the Correlations as
his own. And all that are truly thus baptized are Christened, and are to
be esteemed and loved as Christians, and to be received into Christian
Communion in all Christian Churches where they come, until by apostasie
or impenitency in certain disobedience to the Laws of Christ, in points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Christian Communion, they forfeit that priviledge. Nor are
men to deprive them of the great benefit thus given them by Christ, on
pretence of any <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>holiness,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> to amend Christs terms, and
make the Church Doors narrower, or tie men to themselves for worldly
ends. Yet must the Pastors still difference the weaker Christians from the
stronger, and labour to edifie the weak, but not to cast them out of the
Church.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The sacred Ministry is subordinate to Christ in his <hi>Teaching, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,</hi>
and <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, and thus essentiated by Christs own institution,
which man hath no power to change: Therefore under Christ they must
teach the Church by sacred Doctrine, guide them by that and sacred Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
called <hi>The power of the Keys</hi> (that is of judging who is fit to
enter by Baptism, to continue, to partake of the Communion, to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
or cast out) and to lead them in the publick Worship of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding
in Prayer and speaking for them, and administring to them the
Sacraments or holy Seals of the Covenant of God.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The first part of the Ministers O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ice is about the <hi>unbelieving world,</hi>
to convert them to the Faith of Christ; and the second perfective part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Churches.</hi> Nor must it be thought that the first is done by them
as meer private men.</p>
               <p>§. 8. As Satan fell by <hi>pride,</hi> and overthrew man by tempting him to
<hi>pride (to become as Gods in Knowledge)</hi> so Christ himself was to conquer
the Prince of <hi>pride</hi> by <hi>humility,</hi> and by the <hi>Cross,</hi> by a life of <hi>suffering; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned</hi>
by the blind and obstinate world, <hi>making himself of no reputation,
despising the shame</hi> of suffering as a Malefactor (a Traitor and Blasphemer:)
And the <hi>bearing of the Cross</hi> was a principal part of his Precepts and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his Disciples, without which they could not be his Followers.
And by Humility they were to follow the Captain of their Salvation, in

               <p>§. 9. Accordingly Christ taught his chief Disciples, that if they were
not so <hi>converted</hi> as <hi>to become as little children, they could not enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 18. 3. His School receiveth not masterly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,

               <p>And when they were disputing and seeking which <hi>of them should be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi>
he earnestly rebuked all such thoughts, setting a <hi>little child</hi> before
them, telling them that the Princes of the Earth <hi>exercise authority,</hi> and are

them that it was not a <hi>worldly grandeur,</hi> nor <hi>forcing power</hi> by the Sword
(which belongeth to Civil Magistrates) which was to be exercised by the
Pastors of the Church: But that he that would be the Chiefest, must be
most excellent in Merit, and most serviceable to all, and get his honour
and do his work by <hi>meriting</hi> the respect and love of Volunteers. The
<hi>Sword</hi> is the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who are also Christs Ministers; (for all Power
is given him, and he is Head over all things to the Church.) But they are
eminently the Ministers of his <hi>Power;</hi> but the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> are most
eminently Ministers of his <hi>Paternal and saving love and wisdom.</hi> And by
<hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to do their work. The Word preached and applied gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and particularly (by the Keys) is their Weapon or Arms, and not
the <hi>Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> therefore knew what they said, when they seemed dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Hereticks to the worldly Clergie that destroyed them, when they
placed their Cause in these four Articles: 1. <hi>To have the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Bread and Wine. 2. To have free leave for true Ministers to preach the
word of God</hi> (without unjust silencing of proud worldly men that cannot
stand before the truth.) 3. <hi>To have Temporal Dominion</hi> (or Government
by the Sword, and power over mens Bodies and Estates) <hi>taken from the
Clergie. 4. To have gross sin suppressed by the lawful Magistrate by the
Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. Had it been necessary to the Churches Union against <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
for Christians to know that <hi>Peter</hi> or some one of his Apostles must
be his Vicar-General, and Head of his Church to whom all must obey,
who can believe that Christ would not only have silenced so necessary a
point, but also at a time when he was desired or called to decide it, have
only spoken so much against it, to take down all such Expectations. Yea
we never read that <hi>Peter</hi> exercised any Authority or Jurisdictions over any
other of the Apostles, nor more than other Apostles did; much less
that ever he chose a Bishop to be Lord of the Church, as his Successor.
Nay he himself seemeth to fore-see this mischief, and therefore saith,
1. <hi>Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and a Witness of the Sufferings of Christ, and also a Partaker of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60852:25"/>
Glory that shall be revealed.</hi> (These are his Dignities.) <hi>Feed the Flock of
God which is among you,</hi> (not out of your reach and hearing in a vast Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)
<hi>taking the oversight, not by constraint, but willingly</hi> (and on willing
men) <hi>not for filthy lucre, but of a ready wind; neither as being Lords over
Gods Heritage, but being Examples to the Flock; and when the chief Shepherd
shall appear, ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. Nothing is more certain than that the Church for above 300 years
had no power of the Sword, that is, forcibly to meddle with and hurt
mens Bodies or Estates, (except what the Apostles had by miracle): And
to this day no <hi>Protestants,</hi> and not most <hi>Papists</hi> claim any such Power as of
Divine Institution, but only plead that the Secular Powers are bound by
the Sword to destroy such as are judged <hi>Hereticks</hi> by the Bishops, and to
punish such as contemn the censures of the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 12. He that would see more for the Power of Princes vindicated
from the Clergies Claim and Usurpation, may find much in many old Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
written for the Emperours against the Pope, collected by <hi>Goldastus
de Monarch.</hi> and in <hi>Will. Barclay,</hi> but much better in Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
and in Bishop <hi>Andrew</hi>'s <hi>Tortura Torti,</hi> and in Bishop <hi>Buckridge
Roffensis</hi> of the Power of Kings, and much in <hi>Spalatensis de Repub.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. The <hi>Vniversality of Christians</hi> is the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> of which
Christ is the only <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Soveraign;</hi> but it is the duty of these to worship
God in solemn Assemblies, and to live in a holy Conversation together;
and to join in striving against sin, and to help each other in the way to
life; therefore Societies united for these ends are called, <hi>Particular
Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. When the Apostles had converted a competent number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
they gather'd them into such Assemblies, and as a Politick Society,
set over them such Ministers of Christ, as are afore described, to be their
Guides.</p>
               <p>§. 15. <hi>These Officers are in Scripture called sometime</hi> Elders, <hi>and
sometimes</hi> Bishops, <hi>to whom</hi> Deacons <hi>were added to serve them and the
Church subordinately. Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>hath well described their Office in
in his</hi> Annotat. <hi>which was</hi> to preach constantly in publick, and private, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
both Sacraments, to pray and praise God with the People, to Catechize,
to visit and pray with the sick, to comfort troubled Souls, to admonish the unruly,
to reject the impenitent, to restore the penitent, to take care of the poor, <hi>and in a
word,</hi> of all the Flock.</p>
               <p>§. 16. The Apostles set usually more than one of these Elders or Bishops
in every Church, not as if one might not rule the Flook where no more
was necessary, but according to their needs, that the work might not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for want of Ministers.</p>
               <p>§. 17. They planted their Churches usually in Cities, because Christians
comparatively to the rest were few (as Sects are among us) and no where
else usually enough for a Society, and because the Neighbour-scattered
Villages might best come to the Cities near them; not but that it was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60852:26"/>
lawful to plant Churches in the Country, where there were enough to
constitute them, and sometimes they did so, as by <hi>Clemens Roman. ad Corinth</hi>
by History appeareth.</p>
               <p>§. 18. <hi>Grotius</hi> thinketh that one City at first had divers Churches and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and that they were gathered after the manner of the Synagogues; and
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinketh that for some time there were two Churches and
Bishops in many Cities, one of Jews and one of Gentiles; and that in
<hi>Rome Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had two Churches, whom <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
till they were united in <hi>Clemens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 19. There is great evidence of History that a particular Church of
the Apostles setling was essentially only <q>[a Company of Christians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and People associated for <hi>personal holy communion</hi> and mutual help
in holy Doctrine, Worship, Conversation, and Order.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it never consisted of so few or so many, or so distant as to be
uncapable of such <hi>personal help and Communion:</hi> But was ever distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as from accidental Meetings, so from the Communion of many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
or distant Christians, which was held but by Delegates, Synods of
Pastors or Letters, and not by personal help, in presence.</p>
               <p>Not that all these must needs always meet in the same place: but that
usually they did so, or at due times at least, and were no more nor more
distant than could so meet: Sometimes Persecution hindred them; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Room might be too small: Even Independent Churches among
us sometimes meet in divers places: and one Parish hath divers Chappels
for the aged and weak that are unfit for travel.</p>
               <p>§. 20. <hi>Scotus</hi> began the opinion (as <hi>Davenport, Fr. a Santa Clara</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth)
and <hi>Dion Petavius</hi> improved it, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath largely
asserted it, that the Apostles at first planted a single Bishop in each
Church, with one or more Deacons, and that he had power in time to
ordain Elders of a different Order, Species, or Office, and that the word
Elder and Bishop and Pastor in Scripture never signifie these subject El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but the Bishops only, and, saith he, there is no evidence that there
were any of the subject sort of Presbyters in Scripture-times: Which
concession is very kindly accepted by the Presbyterians; but they call for
proof that ever these Bishops were authorised to make a new Species of
Presbyters which were never made in Scripture-times? and indeed
they vehemently deny it, and may well despair of such a proof.</p>
               <p>§. 21. But for my part I believe the foundation unproved (that then
there was but one Elder in a Church) and think many Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fully prove the contrary. But I join with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in Scripture-times there was no particular Church that had more
stated meetings for publick Communion than one: For if there was so
long but one Elder, there could be but one such Assembly at once; for
they had no such Assemblies which were not guided by a Presbyter or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
in Doctrine, Worship, Sacraments and Discipline: And they used
to have the Eucharist every Lords day at least, and often much more. And
one man can be at once but in one place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60852:26"/>
§. 22. I have elsewhere fully proved, that the ancient Churches that
had Bishops were no bigger than our Parishes (and few a quarter so big
as the greatest of them) and consisted of no more than might have such
present personal Communion as is before described; the proofs are too
large to be here recited. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is the plainest, who saith, that this was
the note of a Churches Unity, that <hi>[To every Church there was one Altar,
and one Bishop, with his Fellow Presbyters and Deacons:]</hi> And elsewhere
chargeth the Bishop to take account of his Flock whether they all come to
Church, even Servant-men and Maids.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> before him intimateth the like, mentioning even Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Bishops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>'s Description of the Christian Assemblies plainly proveth
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Description of them and many other passages in him prove
it more fully. He professeth that they took not the Lord's Supper save
only <hi>from the hand of the Bishop (Antistitis manu)</hi> who could give it but to
one Assembly at once.</p>
               <p>Many Canons also fully shew it (elsewhere cited) some appoint all the
people to joyn with the Bishop on the great Festivals of the year, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
300 years after Christ.</p>
               <p>The Custom also of choosing Bishops sheweth it, where all the people
met and chose him: Yea in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time the Exercise of Discipline prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, when even in such great Churches as <hi>Carthage</hi> it was done in the
presence of the people, and with their consent.</p>
               <p>§. 23. The only Churches in the World, that for about 200 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ, if not more, had more than one ordinary Assembly, for
Church-Communion, though but like our Parish Chappels, were <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> as far as I can learn in any History: For that at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for
all the numbers had no more stated Members than oft met in one place
(excepting occasional absents). And I find no reason to believe that ever
these two (the chief Cities of the Empire,) had so long more than some
<hi>London</hi> Parishes (which have above sixty thousand souls as is supposed) no
nor near (if half) so many. And because elsewhere I have only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these two Cities, I will yet add somewhat to shew, that even there the
case was not as many now imagine.</p>
               <p>§. 24. <hi>Cornelius</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Fabius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> (in <hi>Euseb. Hist. l. &amp;
c. 43. alias 42.)</hi> saith that <q>in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were 46 Presbyters,
7 Deacons, and of other Officers 94. that is, 42 Acolites, 52 Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists
and Readers, with Porters, Widows, and impotent persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
1050 souls, who are all relieved by the grace and goodness of
Almighty God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> This is the chief testimony in the third Age to
prove that this one Church had more than could either meet in one place,
or hold personal Communion.</p>
               <p>§. 25. <hi>But let it be considered, 1. That partly for the honour of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
persons, and partly that all the Church might in season have the help
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60852:27"/>
of all mens gifts, they were so far in the ancient Churches from having
so few as Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>and</hi> Petavius <hi>imagine, that they multiplied Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and dignified, and so employed a great part of the Church that
had useful gifts: Insomuch that a most credible Witness shortly after,
even</hi> Gregory Nazianzen, <hi>saith,</hi> Orat. 1. Pag. 45. <hi>that by the intrusion
of men for dignity and maintenance,</hi> 
                  <q>The Church-Rulers were almost
more than the Subjects.</q> 
                  <hi>The words are</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. Of
others I am ashamed, who when they are no better than others, (and
I wish they were not much worse) thrust themselves upon the most holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
as we say, with unwashen hands and prophane minds, and before
they are worthy to approach to holy things, ambitiously enter the Vestry it
self <hi>(or Chancell)</hi> and press and thrust themselves about the holy Table,
as if they judged this Order not to be an example of Virtue, but an occasion
and help of getting maintenance, and not to be an Office lyable to give Account,
but a Command in which they may be free from Censure: Who being misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>(or pitiful persons)</hi> as to Piety, and unhappy as to Splendour, <hi>that is,
low in the World and Parts)</hi> do now in number almost exceed those whom
they are over <hi>(or are to govern). [This would make one suspect that
there were then many Ruling Elders that preach'd not; but it's plain
they had an Office about the Sacraments.]</hi> Therefore this Evil increasing
and getting strength with time, it seems to me that they will have none under
them to rule, <hi>(or guide)</hi> but that all will turn Teachers and will Prophesie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<hi>(as was promised by God)</hi> of being all taught of God: So that of old
the History and Parable said, <hi>Saul</hi> also is among the Prophets. For there
neither now is nor ever was so great plenty of any other thing as there is now
of these frequent Shames and Criminals; for other things, as they have their
flourishing time, have also their decay. And though to repress their impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
be a work above my strength, yet certainly to hate it and be ashamed is
not the least part of Piety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Judge by this, what numbers of Officers of Clergy-men then the Church
had.</p>
               <p>§. 26. Next for the <hi>Poor,</hi> consider their proportions in and by other
Churches; <hi>Chrysost. in Matth. Edit Savil. p.</hi> 421. supposeth the Poor of
the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> (whence he came) to have been about the <hi>tenth part</hi>
and dividing the City into three Ranks, he accounts a tenth part rich,
and a tenth part poor, and the rest of a middle Estate between both.
Now in <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s time the Church was so high, being owned by the
greatest Emperours as we may well suppose almost all or most of the rich
came in: Whereas at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Cornelius</hi> it being under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and cruel persecution, we may well conclude, that most of the
rich stood out, and they might say with <hi>Paul,</hi> not many Great, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Noble are called; few rich men comparatively receiving the Gospel,
it's most likely that the poor were then far more than a tenth part, if not
the greater part of the Church. But suppose them a tenth part, which is
not probable, the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then would be but 10500 Souls,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60852:27"/>
which is about the fifth part or sixth as big as <hi>Martins</hi> Parish, and about
a quarter as big as <hi>Stepney</hi> Parish, and about a third or fourth part as big
as <hi>Giles Cripplegate</hi> Parish, and not half so big as <hi>Giles</hi> in the <hi>Fields</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parishes. Moreover <hi>Chrysostome, Hom.</hi> 11. in <hi>Act. p.</hi> 674. computes
the poor at <hi>Constantinople</hi> to be about half as many as all the other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and this in the most flourishing City and Age: And by this measure
they would yet fall further short.</p>
               <p>It may be you will say, that these were not the poorest of all that were
kept by the Church: But it's known that ever since the times of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Community, the Churches relieved all the needy according to the
several degrees of their wants; and these were such as were in want,
though not equally, and they are such poor as were distinguished not only
from the Rich, but also from the middle sort; and such as the Church took
care to relieve.</p>
               <p>§. 27. And as for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the greatest City of the Empire next
<hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, <hi>de bello Iud. l. 5. c. ult.</hi> it is certain that in the third
Century the Christians had more Meeting Places for Divine Worship
than one, and in the fourth Century had many: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> nameth
divers, <hi>Haeres. 69. p. 728. Arius</hi> having one wherein he preached, had that
advantage to propogate his Heresie. But all know that the building of
Temples began after Emperours were Christians, and the fair Churches
which, <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, they had in <hi>Dioclesians</hi> time (till he destroyed them)
were but like our Tabernacles or private Churches, and grew to Number
and Ornament but a little before, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> intimateth. It was a good
while before there were two Churches, even in <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Indeed, it
is noted, as a singularity, that they had <hi>two Churches:</hi> But they mistake,
that apply that to <hi>two Meeting Places,</hi> which is spoken of two Societies,
because in <hi>Meletius</hi> time they had two Bishops.</p>
               <p>§. 28. <hi>But yet let us see how big the Christian Church was in this great
City, even when it had many Chapels; even in</hi> Athanasius <hi>time, in the
fourth Century,</hi> Tom. 1. Ed. Commel. p. 531. <hi>in his Apology to</hi> Constant. <hi>you
may find (in words too large to be all transcribed) that he being accused
for assembling the People in the Great Church, maketh this part of his
Defence,</hi> 
                  <q>[The confluence of the People at the <hi>Easter</hi> Solemnity was so great,
that if they had met in several Assemblies <hi>(or by parties)</hi> the other Churches were
so narrow or small that they would have been in danger of suffering by the Crowd;
nor would the universal Harmony and Concord of the People have been so visible
and efficacious if they had met in Parcels; Therefore he concludeth it better for
the whole Multitude to meet in that great Church, <hi>(being a place large enough
to receive them altogether)</hi> and to have a concurrence of the People all with one
Voice <hi>(in Symphony:)</hi> For if according to Christ's promise where two shall agree
of any thing it shall be done for them—how prevalent will be the One-voice of so
numerous a People assembled together, and saying, Amen, to God? Who therefore
would not admire? Who would not count it a happiness to see so great a People
met together in one place? And how did the People rejoyce to see one another,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60852:28"/>
whereas formerly they assembled in several places.]</q> 
                  <hi>Thus plainly</hi> Athanasius.</p>
               <p>I do not hence gather that every Man, Woman, and Child was present:
In our Parish Churches that hold the Assembly, some are there, and usually
some stay at home and come by turns: But it seemeth hence plain that even
in <hi>Alexandria</hi> the Christians were no more than that the main Body of
them at great Solemnities could meet and hear in one Assembly. Which
in many of our Parishes they cannot do.</p>
               <p>§. 29. Add to this, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells them that his Predecessor <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
did as much as he had done, on such occasions assembling their whole
Multitude in one Church before it was dedicated, <hi>pag.</hi> 532.</p>
               <p>§. 30. I add a further Argument from the City it self, as offered me also
while I was writing this, by a learned Friend in his own Words.</p>
               <p>This City was, by <hi>Strabo</hi>'s description of it, like a Souldiers Coat, whose length
at either side was almost thirty furlongs, its breadth at either end seven or eight
Furlongs, <hi>Geogr. li. 17. p.</hi> 546. So the whole compass will be less than ten Miles.
A third or fourth part of this was taken up with publick Buildings, Temples, and
Royal Palaces, <hi>ibid.</hi> Thus is two miles and a half, or three and a quarter taken
up. I take this to be that Region of the City which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
(where he tells us was the famous Library of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus)</hi> and speaks
of it in his time as destitute of Inhabitants, de ponder, &amp; mensi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r. <hi>n. 9. p.</hi> 166.
A great part of the City was assigned to the <hi>Jews.</hi> So <hi>Strabo</hi> indefinitely, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
quotes him, <hi>Antiqu. Jud. l. 14. c.</hi> 12. Others tell us more puncutally
that their share was two of the five Divisions (Vshers <hi>Annals Lat. p. 859.)</hi>
Though many of them had their habitations in the other Divisions, yet they had
two fifth parts intire to themselves: And this is I suppose the <gap reason="foreign">

and their proportion half of the five or four miles remaining. Let the rest be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
between the Orthodox, and the <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Novatians,</hi> and other sorts.
And if we be just, a large part will fall to the share of Hereticks and Sectaries.

part of those that professed Christianity, <hi>Sozom. Hist. li. 1. c.</hi> 14. And if we
may judg of the Followers by the Leaders, no less than half: For whereas there
were nineteen Presbyters and Deacons in that Church <hi>(Theodor. Hist. li. 4.

and seven of their Deacons as appears by <hi>Eutychius,</hi> here and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
elsewhere) six Presbyters with <hi>Arius,</hi> and five Deacons fell off from the Catholicks,
<hi>Sozom. Hist. li. 1. c.</hi> 14. But let the <hi>Arians</hi> be much fewer, yet will not the
proportion of the Catholick Bishops part in this City be more than that of a small
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60852:28"/>
Town, one of eight or twelve Furlongs in compass. And so the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
on this account will be no more than might well meet for Worship in one

               <p>If the Reader will peruse <hi>Epiphanius</hi> History of the Fraction between

               </p>
               <p>Thus you see the difference of a just computation, and the hasty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of men, that judg of Places and Persons as they are in their misled
imaginations, and not as they were indeed and truth. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to me layeth so much on the number of the Officers and Poor before
mentioned, as if it proved undoubtedly a Diocesane Church, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
ariseth from an erroneous comparing their Cities and times with
ours, and their Presbyters with our Parish-Priests and Curats.</p>
               <p>And when all's done a grand Patriarchal Church is not the measure of
a Diocesane, or of every Bishops Church: their Presbyters had other
work than our Curates have: They met in the same Assembly with the
Bishop, and sate in a Semicircle on each side him, and were as a Colledge
of Governours to rule one Church, and that only by the Word (applyed
by the Keys) and not by the Sword, till <hi>Cyril</hi> first usurped it, for which
by Historians he is noted. If our times tempt you to marvel how so many
Officers or Clerks were maintained by so few People, Church-History
affordeth you matter enough to resolve your doubt.</p>
               <p>§. 31. But if these two great Cities had indeed had yet more Altars and
Churches, <hi>Orbis major est Vrbe,</hi> saith <hi>Hierome:</hi> Two singular Cities may

<hi>and One Bishop with his Presbyters and Deacons.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence came it to be the note of a Schism, to set up <hi>Altare contra
Altare</hi> because one Bishop and Church had but one Altar. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (no
injudicious nor Factions man) saw this, and asserteth it from the plain
words of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 32. How the case came to be altered it is easie to know: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was well or ill done, is all the controversie, or the chief.</p>
               <p>I confess there want not some that think that the Apostles had their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
assigned Provinces, and that they left them to twelve Successours, and
this is the foundation of Patriarchal or Provincial Churches, with such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Dreams: 1. We doubt not but that the Apostles wisely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
their Labours: But we believe not that they divided the
Countreys into their several Dioceses, or Provinces: nor that two of
them <hi>(e. g Iohn</hi> and <hi>Paul, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Iames</hi> and other Apostles) might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60852:29"/>
not and did not do the work of an Apostle in the same Country and City.
Much less do we believe that one of them <hi>(e. g. Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Apostle or not I contend not) was a Bishop over the Apostles
when they resided there.</p>
               <p>2. Nor do we believe that they left any such divided Provinces to their
Successors: If they had, it's strange that we had not twelve or thirteen
Patriarchal or Provincial Churches hence noted. Which were they, and
how came they so soon to be forgotten and unknown? And why had we
first but three Patriarchs, and one of those <hi>(Alexandria)</hi> accounting from
no Apostle, but from S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the other two reckoning from one and
the same Apostle, save that <hi>Rome</hi> reckoned from two at once, <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> when as one City must (say they) have but one Bishop?</p>
               <p>§. 33. The case is known; that, 1. When Christians so multiplyed,
that one Assembly would not serve, but they became enough for many,
the Bishops greatness and wealth increasing with the People, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
them all under their own Government, and so took them all to be
their Chapels, setling divers Altars but not divers Bishops in one Church.
2. And herewith their work also, by degrees, was much changed; and
they that at first were most employed in Guiding the whole Church in
Gods publick worship, and exercised present discipline before them,
and were the sole usual Preachers to them all, (the rest of the Elders
Preaching but when the Bishop could not, or bid them,) did after become
distant Judges, and their Government, by degrees, degenerated to a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of Civil Magistracy. 3. And then they set up the old exploded
question, which of them should be the chief or greatest: And then
they that had the greatest Cities being the richest and greatest Bishops
in interest, because of the greatness and riches of their Flocks, they got
the Church Government to be distributed, much like the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
within that Empire; And where the Civil Magistrate had most
and largest command, they gave the Ecclesiastical Bishop the like: And
so they set up the Bishops of the three chief Cities as Patriarchs, <hi>Rome</hi>
being the first, because it was the great Imperial Seat, as the <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
Council giveth the true reason. Afterwards <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
being added, they turned them into five: And <hi>Carthage</hi> and other places,
not called Patriarchal Seats, had exempt peculiar Jurisdictions with a
power near to Patriarchs. And the rest of the Bishops strove much for
precedency, and got as large Territories as they could, and as numerous
Flocks and many Parishes, though still the name <hi>Paroeciae</hi> was used for
the whole Episcopal Church when it was turned into a Diocess.</p>
               <p>§. 34. I conceive that this Change of <hi>One Altar</hi> into a <hi>Diocesane
Church</hi> of <hi>many Altars</hi> and <hi>Parishes</hi> was not well done, but is the thing
that hath confounded the Christian World, and that they ought to have
increased the number of Churches as the number of Christians did increase,
as the Bees swarm into another Hive. My Reasons are, 1. Christ and
the Holy Ghost in the Apostles having setled a <hi>Church Species</hi> and Order
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60852:29"/>
(like that of the Synagogues, and not like that of the Temple,) no man
ought to have changed that Form: Because they can prove no power to
do it: and because it accuseth the Institution of Christ and the Holy
Ghost of insufficiency or errour, which must so soon be altered by them.
Perfective addition, as an Infant groweth up to Manhood, we deny not.
But who gave them power to abrogate the very <hi>Specices</hi> of the first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Churches? That the <hi>Species</hi> is altered, is certainly proved by the
different uses and <hi>Termini</hi> of the Relation. For a Church of the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
was a <hi>Society joyned for personal Communion in Doctrine, Worship,
and holy living:</hi> But a Diocess consisting of many score or hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
that never see or know or come near one another, are uncapable
of any such present personal Communion, and have none but Mental,
and by Officers or Delegates.</p>
               <p>2. By this means, all the Parish-Churches being turned into Chapels
and un-Churched, are all robbed of their Right; seeing each one ought to
have a Bishop and Presbyters, and the benefit of that Office and Order, which
is now denied them, and many hundred such Parishes turned into Chapels
have no Bishop to themselves but one among them all to the Diocess.</p>
               <p>3. Because by this means true Discipline is become impossible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable;
by the distance and multitude of the people, and the distance
and paucity of Bishops: What Christ commandeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. being as
impossible to be done in many hundred Parishes, by one Bishop and his
Consistory, as the Discipline of so many hundred Schools by one School-master
(though each School have an Usher) or the care of many hundred
Hospitals by one Physician, perhaps at twenty, or forty, or eighty, or an
hundred miles distance.</p>
               <p>4. Because it altereth the antient Office of a Bishop and of a Presbyter,
and setteth new ones in the stead: As a Bishop was the Bishop of one
Church, so a Presbyter was his Assistant, <hi>Ejusdem Ordinis, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church,</hi> who now is turned into a meer Usher, or <hi>Worshipping-Teacher,</hi>
or <hi>Chaplain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Because it certainly divideth the Churches: For Christians would
unite in a <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> and the <hi>exercise of true Discipline,</hi> that will
never unite in a <hi>humane Policy</hi> which abrogateth the Divine, and certainly
destroyeth commanded necessary Discipline.</p>
               <p>§. 35. The very work also of the Bishop, and so the Office came thus
to be changed: Christ having appointed no other Church Governours (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Magistrates) but such (as Philosophers in their Schools) who were
appointed to set up Holy Societies for Divine Doctrine, Worship, and
Holy Living, and to Guide them accordingly, by Teaching, Worship, and
Government by the Word, forbidding them the Sword or Force, they are
said to have the <hi>Keys of the Church</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> because as
Grace is Glory in the seed, the Church is Heaven in the seed, and the Pastors
were the Administrators of Sacraments and Church-priviledges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judges who were fit for them, who should be Baptized, who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60852:30"/>
should Communicate, and in what rank, and who should be denied these,
admonished or excluded, and who should, as far as belongeth to others,
be judged meet or unmeet for Heaven: And so the Christian Societies
were to be kept clean, and not to be like the polluted World of Infidels.
And the Pastors had no other power to use; but were to judge only those
within, and leave them without to Gods own judgment, and to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
who was not to punish any one for not being in or of the Church, or
for departing from it, which is a grievous punishment it self.</p>
               <p>But Magistrates being then Heathens, the Christians were hard put to
it for the decision of their quarrels: For the love of the world and selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were but imperfectly cured in them. They went to Law before
Heathen Judges with each other; and this became a snare and a scandal
to them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore childeth them for not ending differences by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Arbitrators among themselves, as if there were none among them wise
enough to Arbitrate. Hereupon the Churches taking none to be wiser or
trustier than their Pastors, made them their Arbitrators, and it became a
censurable scandal for any to accuse a Church-member to a Magistrate, and
to have Suits at Law. By this means, the Bishop becoming a Stated Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator,
thereby became the Governour of the Christians, but with his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
and not alone. But because Bishops had no power of the sword,
to touch mens bodies or estates, but only to suspend them from Church-Communion,
and Excommunicate them, or impose penitential Confessions
on them, therefore they fitted their Canons (which were the Bishops A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements)
to this Governing use, to keep Christians under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
from the Magistrates. And so they made Canons, that a Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
or Adulterer should be so long or so long suspended, and a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
so long, and so of the rest.</p>
               <p>§. 36. And when <hi>Constantine</hi> turned Christian, he had many reasons to
confirm this Arbitrating Canonical power to the Christian Bishops by the
Civil Sanction. 1. Because he found them in possession of it as contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by mutual consent; and what could a Christian Prince do less than grant
that to the Christians which they chose and had. 2. Because the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and honour of the Teachers and Pastors he thought tended to the
honour of their Religion, and the success of their Doctrine upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
with whom they dwelled. Grandure and Power much prevail with
carnal minds. 3. Because he had but few Magistrates at first that were
Christians, and none that so well knew the affairs of Christians as their
own chosen Bishops. And he feared lest the power of Heathen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
over the Christians might injure and oppress them. 4. He design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to draw the Heathens to Christianity by the honouring of Christians
above them. 5. And withal his interest lay most in their strength; For
they were the fastest part of his Souldiers and Subjects, that for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and their own Interrest, rejoyced to advance and defend him to the
utmost, (when he lost many of the Pagans) and they were not of the spirit
of the old Pretorian Souldiers, that set up and pulled down Emperours
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60852:30"/>
at their pleasure. Had <hi>Constantine</hi> faln, the Christians had much faln with
him, and had the Christians been weakned he had been weakened: They
were become his strength. And he fore saw not the evils that afterwards
would follow. Some must govern, and there were then no wiser nor better men
than the Bishops and Pastors of the Churches. And their interest in the
Christian people (that chose them) was greatest: As now all differing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Christians among us (Papists, Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists)
would desire nothing as more conducing to their ends, than that
the King would put the greatest Power (especially of Religion) into the
hands of those Teachers whom they esteem and follow; even so was it
with the Christians in the days of <hi>Constantine:</hi> And hereupon Laws were
made, that none should compel Christians to answer in any Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
saving before their own Bishops, and so Bishops were made almost
the sole Governours of the Christians.</p>
               <p>§. 37. By this means it is no wonder if multitudes of wicked men flock'd
into the Church and defiled and dishonoured it: For the Murderer that was
to be hanged if he were no Christian, was but to be kept from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if he were a Christian, and do some confessing penance; which was
little to hanging or other death; And so proportionably of other Crimes.
Bad Christians by this device were multiplyed. The Emperour also being
a Christian, worldly men are mostly of the Religion of the Prince or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
powers.</p>
               <p>§. 38. And no man that can gather an effect from an effectual cause
could doubt, if neither <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> or any Historian had told it him, but
that proud and worldly men would strive then to be Bishops, and use all
possible diligence to obtain so great preferment: Who of them is it that
would not have Command and Honour and Wealth, if he can get it?
While the great invitation to the sacred Ministry was the winning and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Souls, those that most valued Souls, desired it (yet desired it to be
kept from such Poverty and Persecution as exposed them to hinderance
and contempt). But when Riches, Reputation and Dominion were the
Baits, who knoweth not what sort of Appetites would be the keenest?
Christ telleth us, how hardly Rich men are good and come to Heaven.
Therefore when Bishops must be all Great and Rich, either Christ must be
deceived, or it must be as hard for them to be honest Christians as for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Camel to go through the Needles eye. And thus, <hi>Venenum funditur in
Ecclesiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 39. The World being thus brought into the Church without the cure
of the worldly mind, and the Guides being so strongly tempted to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worst, no wonder if the Worldly Spirit now too much rule the Church,
and if those that are yet of the same Spirit, approve, plead, and strive for
what they love and despise the business of the Cross, and Christian Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Simplicity to this day: And if Bishops have done much of their
work accordingly, ever since <hi>Constantine</hi> (and much before) it hath been
the Devils Work to carry on his War against Christ and Piety, under
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60852:31"/>
Christ's own name, and the pretence of Piety, as an Angel of Light and
Righteousness and Unity, and to set up Pastors over the Church of Christ,
that hate the Doctrine and Life, and Cross of Christ, that by pleading for
Godliness and Concord, may be the effectual Enemies of both, and may
fight against Christ in his own Livery, under his Colours, and with his
own Arms. <hi>Whose God is their Belly, who glory in their shame, who mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, being Enemies to the Cross of Christ:</hi> The History of whom you
will find in the following part of this Treatise.</p>
               <p>§. 40. But here I must above all remember the Reader, that he is not
for this Corruption of the Clergy, and Government of the Church, to
think that the Church here ceased to be a true Church, or that the Ministry
was lost, or that it became unlawful to hold Communion with any such
Churches; much less to think hardly of Christianity it self, as if it were
no better than false Religions, because so many of its Pastors were so bad.
None of God's Counsels were frustrate by mans sin: None of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to his Church have failed. For all this Christ is the Saviour of the
World, the Prince of Righteousness and Peace, that came to destroy the
Works of the Devil, and to save his people from their Sins; and all that
are given him of the Father shall come to him, and he will cast none of
them out, nor shall any take them out of his hands?</p>
               <p>§. 41. I. Let it be still remembred, that as the Chronicles of Kingdoms
mention only the publick Actions of Princes and great Men, but name not
the poor and private sort, so also our Church-History of Councils and
publick things, say little of godly private Christians, but of Patriarchs
and great Prelates, who yet are themselves but a very small part of the
Christian World.</p>
               <p>II. Note also that every Bishop had many Presbyters; whose work was
not to strive for superiority, nor trouble the world in Councils (where
usually they came not) and so had not a quarter of the temptations that the
Bishops had: And though we find mention sometimes of the Presbyters
also that were naught, yet the number so reproved and proved bad, is
not proportionable to the number of Prelates compared among themselves,
that miscarried in Councils. The Presbyters that staid at home and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their work in private with the Flock, and came not on the Stage
in publick affairs, kept up the substance and practice of Religion.</p>
               <p>III. And the private Christians had yet less temptation, and were not so
overwhelmed with worldly things, nor carryed away by pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and covetousness, as the ruling party were.</p>
               <p>IV. And the Monks, and other retired Christians, that saw the Prelates
sin and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ares, (though many of them had their failings too, yet) no doubt
kept up much serious piety, and a holy life.</p>
               <p>V. And no doubt but very many of the Bishops themselves were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
holy faithful men, that grieved for the miscarriages of the rest. Though
such excellent persons as <hi>Gregory Neocesareae, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory
Nyssen, Basil, Chrysostome, Augustine, Hillary, Prosper, Fulgentius, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60852:31"/>
were not very common, no doubt but there were many that wrote not
Books, nor came so much into the notice of the world, but avoided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
and factious Stirs, that quietly and honestly conducted the Flocks
in the ways of piety, love, and justice. And some of them (as S. <hi>Martin</hi>)
separated from the Councils and Communion of the prevailing turbulent
sort of the Prelates, to signifie their disowning of their sins.</p>
               <p>VI. And oft times, when the Prelates were at the worst, God raised up
some very Godly Princes, that maintained Religion more than the Clergy,
and were an honour to it when the Bishops dishonoured it.</p>
               <p>VII. And it is not to be contemned, that much piety was kept up among
great numbers of Christians, whom (for some mistake) the rest reviled and
condemned as Schismaticks or Hereticks. Little know we how many holy
souls were among those that are in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Catalogue. Of the <hi>Audians</hi>
and some others he seemeth to confess as much himself. The <hi>Novatians</hi>
were tolerated in almost all the Empire, and had their Churches and Bishops,
having the testimony of the Orthodox that they were usually of sound
faith and upright lives, and stricter than other Christians were. And God
pardoneth the infirmity of a small mistake in judgment, when men are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
addicted to his service. Now and then a cruel Prelate did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
them, but so did not the gentler sort (as <hi>Atticus, Proclus, &amp;c.</hi> at
<hi>Constantinople, &amp;c.)</hi> nor the Emperours themselves, save when so insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
               <p>VIII. And though the Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire kept up this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of Patriarchs, Metropolitans, and rich Prelates, that after over-top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Kings, it was not so in other parts of the Christian world, but the
Clergy lived more humbly and quietly. The <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>Columban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyters <hi>Finan, Aidan,</hi> &amp;c. ordained Bishops in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
they were commonly humble, holy men, like themselves.
And both <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> so much misliked the <hi>Romane</hi>-grandure and way,
that when <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk came in, they would not subject themselves
to the Pope, or any Foreign Prelates, nor so much as eat and drink with
the Missionaries. And the like we may say of some other <hi>Extra-imperial</hi>
Churches. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves not only while <hi>Arian Goths</hi> (of
whom see the testimony of <hi>Salvian,</hi> to the shame of the Orthodox) but
after <hi>Recaredus</hi> days, for many ages, lived in great quietness, while <hi>Italy,
France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were employed in Hereticating, Cursing, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating,

that those <hi>Eastern</hi> Christians, called by the Papists, <hi>Nestorians, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,

(though too ignorantly and superstitiously, yet) in great austerity of
life.</p>
               <p>IX. In all ages since Prelacy swelled to the corruption of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and annoyance of the Peace of Kings and Kingdoms, there have been
still a great number of pious lamenters of the Corruptions of the Church,
that have groaned and prayed for reformation: Insomuch, that Dr. <hi>Field</hi>
maintaineth, that even in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there have been still consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
numbers of Doctors, that owned truth and piety, and misliked
the Papal usurpations and errours. The <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> (exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
numerous) said, they had continued from the Apostles, and so from
the days of <hi>Sylvester</hi> (or <hi>Constantine)</hi> had dissented from the <hi>Roman</hi> pride,
and corruptions. And God hath made the Protestant Churches since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
as his Vineyard, where truth and piety have prospered, though
Satan hath been still at work, and here also had too much success.</p>
               <p>X. And it must be remembred, that God hath made use of many proud
and turbulent men, to propogate and defend the truth of the Gospel:
And their Gifts have served for the good of the sincere. As the husk or
chaff and straw is useful to the Corn; so many worldly Prelates and
Priests have been learned Expositors and useful Preachers, and taught
others the way to life, which they would not go in themselves. Besides
that, their very Papal power and grandure, which hath corrupted the
Church, hath yet been a check to some, that would have assaulted it by
force; and as a hedge of thornes about it. Worldly interest engageth
Pope, Patriarchs, and Prelates, to stand up for the Christian Religion,
because they gain by it (as <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> is said to have odiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.)</p>
               <p>§. 42. And the old Fathers, till <hi>Constantines</hi> time, did most of them think
that the last thousand years would be a time of fuller glory to the Church;
as many yet think, though I confess my self unskilful in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</p>
               <p>But I make no doubt, but though this earth be so far de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erted by God,
the Glorious Kingdom which we shall shortly see, with the new Heaven
and Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, will fully confute all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
temptations to think hardly of God or the Redeemer, because of the
present corruptions and dissentions of this lower world.</p>
               <p>§. 43. We may conjecture at former times by our own: We see
now, that among the most Reformed Churches, too often the most world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part are uppermost, and perhaps are the persecuters of the rest, and
though they may be the smaller part, it's they that make the noise, are
the noted part that carry the name, and that Histories write of. A few
men got into places of power, seem to be all the Church, or Nation, by
the prevalency of their actions, which few dare contradict: They may
give Laws; They may have the power of Press and Pulpit, so that
nothing shall be published but what they will; They may call themselves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60852:32"/>
the Church, and call all that obey them not Schismaticks and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and strangers may believe therefore, that it is but some few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
fellows that are against them, when yet the far greatest
part may utterly dissent and abhor their pride. I have lived to see such
an Assembly of Ministers, where three or four leading men were so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
as to form a Confession of Faith in the name of the whole party,
which had that in it which particular members did disown. And when
about a controverted Article, <hi>One man</hi> hath charged me deeply, for que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
the words of the <hi>Church,</hi> others that were at the forming of that
Article, have laid it all on that same man, as by his impetuousness putting
in that Article, the rest being loth to strive much against him, and so it
was he himself that was the <hi>Church,</hi> whose authority he so much urged, at
least the effectual signifying part. We cannot judge what is commonest by
what is uppermost, or in greatest power. In divers Parishes now, where
the Minister is conformable, perhaps ten parts of the people do dislike it;
and sometimes you may see but three or four persons with him at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayers;
And yet all know, that Dissenters are talkt of as a few
singular Fanaticks. I compare not the Causes, but conclude, that so also for
the <hi>Numbers,</hi> humble Godly persons might be very numerous, though only the
actions of worldly Prelates do take up most of the History of the Church.</p>
               <p>Yea, I believe, that among the Papists themselves, five to one of the
people, were they free from danger, would declare their dislike of a great
part of the actions and Doctrines of their Prelates, and that the greatest
part that are named Papists, are not such throughly and at the heart.</p>
               <p>When the Rulers, Scribes, and Pharisees were against Christ, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
him and the truth, the common people so much adhered to him,
that the persecutors durst not seize on him openly by force, but were fain
to use a Traytor, to apprehend him in the night, and in a solitary place, lest
they should be stoned by the people, who said, Never man spake as this
man speaketh.</p>
               <p>§. 44. Let us not therefore turn Church-History into a temptation, nor
think basely of the Church, or Christianity, or Christ, because of Papal and
Prelatical pride and tyranny. God can make use of a surly porter to keep
his doors; yea, a mastiff-dog may be a keeper of the house; and his
Corn hath grown in every Age, not only with straw and chaffe, but with
some tares: And yet he hath gathered, and will gather, all his chosen.</p>
               <p>§. 45. Nor is the Ministry it self to be therefore dishonoured: For as
at this day, while a few turbulent Prelates persecute good men, and much
of the Ministry is in too many Countries lamentably corrupted, yet is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
piety, and honesty kept up by the Ministry, and never was well kept
up without it: For the Faithful Ministers labour still, and their very suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
further the Gospel, and what they may not do publickly they do pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</p>
               <p>Yea, their very Writings shew, that still there are such as God doth
qualifie to do his work, even among the Papists, he that readeth the pious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60852:33"/>
Writings of such men as <hi>Gerson,</hi> and <hi>Gerhardus Zutphaniensis,</hi> and <hi>Thaule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Thomas a Kempis, Ferus,</hi> and many such others, will see that Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was still illuminating and sanctifying souls. And he that readeth such
Lives as <hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> persecuted by the Bishop as an ambitious Hypocrite,
for setting up more serious Exercises of Religion than had been ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
used among the Formalists, (to say nothing of such privater men as
M. <hi>de Ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> and many others) will see that it is not all Church-tyranny and
corruption, though very heinous, that will prove that Christ hath not a
Holy Generation whom he will save.</p>
               <p>§. 46. Yea among the very corrupted sort of the Clergy, many that
are overcome with temptations in that point, and take usurpation and
tyranny, and worldly pomp and violence for Order, Government, and
the interest of the Church, have yet much good in other respects: Even
among the Cardinals there have been such men as <hi>Charles Boromaus, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius
(Nerius</hi>'s companion) <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others, that would Preach
and practise the common Doctrines of serious piety: Yea, among the
Jesuits there have been divers that have Preacht, Written, and lived very
strictly; much more among their Fryars: and such Bishops as <hi>Sales:</hi> And
though their times and corruptions blemished their piety, I dare not
think they nullified it.</p>
               <p>§. 47. And it sheweth the excellency of the Sacred Office, 1. That
Christ did first make it as the noble Organical part of his Church, to form
the rest. 2. That he endued the first Officers with the most noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
gifts of his spirit. 3. That he founded and built his Church by
them at first. 4. Yea, that he himself preached the Gospel, and is called
The Minister of the Circumcision, the chief Shepherd, and the Bishop of
our Souls. 5. That he hath used them to enlarge, confirm, preserve, and
edefie his Church to this day. 6. That he maketh the best of them to be
the best of men. 7. That he putteth into the hearts of all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
a special love and honour of them. 8. That he useth even the worser
sort to do good, while they do hurt; especially some of them. 9. That
Satan striveth so hard to corrupt them and get them on his side. 10. That
Religion ordinarily dyeth away, or decayeth, when they fail and prove
unable and unfaithful. 11. That Christ commandeth men so much to hear,
receive and obey them, and hath committed his Word and Keys to them,
as his Stewards. 12. And hath promised them a special reward for their
faithfulness: and commanded all to pray for them and their preservation
and success. And the nature of the things tells us, that as knowledge in
lower things is not propagated to mankind, but by Teachers (man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not born wise;) so much less is heavenly wisdom. And therefore it
is; that God is so regardful of the due qualification of Ministers, that they
be not blind guides, nor novices, nor proud, nor careless sluggards,
nor self-seeking worldlings, but skilful in the word of truth, and lovers
of God and the souls of men, and zealous, and diligent, unwearied, and
patient in their holy work. And when they prove bad, he maketh them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60852:33"/>
most contemptible and punisheth them more than other men the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the best making them the worst.</p>
               <p>§. 48. Therefore let us make a right use of the pride and corruption of
the Clergy, to desire and pray for better, and to avoid our selves the Sin
which is so bad in them, and to labour after that rooted Wisdome and
Holiness in our selves that we may stand, though our Teachers fall before
us. Let every man prove his own Work, and so he shall have rejoicing
in himself, and not in others only, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. But let us not hence question
the Gospel, or dishonour the Church and Ministry; no not any further
separate from the Faulty than they separate from Christ, or than God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
us, and necessity requireth: As we must not despise the needful
helps of our Salvation, nor equal dumb or wicked men with the able
faithful Ministers of Christ, on pretence of honouring the Office; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must we deny the good that is in any, nor despise the Office for the
Persons Faults.</p>
               <p>§. 49. Especially let us take heed that we fall not into that pernicious
Snare that hath entangled the <hi>Quakers</hi> and other Schismaticks of these
times, who on pretence of the faults of the Ministers, set against the best
with greatest fury, because the best do most resist them, and that revile
them with false and railing language, the same that Drunkards and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
use, yea worse than the prophanest of the Vulgar; even because
they take Tythes and necessary Maintenance, charging them with odious
covetousness, calling them Hirelings, deceivers, and what not. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
this Spirit is not of God, that is so contrary to his Word, his Grace,
and his Interest in the World. What would become of the Church and
Gospel, if this malignant Spirit should prevail to extirpate even the best
of all the Ministry? Would the Devil and the Churches Enemies desire
any more? The very same Men that the Prelates have silenced (near
2000) in <hi>England</hi> these fifteen or sixteen years together, are they that the
<hi>Quakers</hi> most virulently before reviled, and most furiously opposed.</p>
               <p>§. 50. Nor will the Clergies corruption allow either unqualified or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
uncalled Men to thrust themselves into the Sacred Office, as if they were
the Men that can do better, and must mend all that is amiss. Such have
been tryed in Licentious Times, and proved, some of them, to do more
hurt than the very Drunkards, or the ignorant sort of Ministers, that did
but read the holy Scriptures. Pride is too often the reprehender of other
Mens Faults and Imperfections, and would make other Mens Names but
a stepping-stone to their own aspiring Folly: As many that have cryed
out against bad Popes and Prelates, that they might get into the places, have
been as bad themselves when they have their Will: No wonder if it be
so with the proud revilers of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>§. 51. There is need therefore of much Wisdome and holy care, that
we here avoid the two extreams; that we grow not indifferent who are
our Pastors, nor contract the Guilt of Church-corruption, but mourn for
the reproach of the solemn Assemblies, and do our best for true and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60852:34"/>
Reformation, that the Gospel fail not, and Souls be not quietly left to
Satan, nor the Church grow like the Infidel World; and yet that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
invade nor dishonour the sacred Office, nor needlesly open the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Persons, nor do any thing that may hinder their just endeavours
and success; we must speak evil of no man either falsly or unnecessarily.</p>
               <p>§. 52. I thought all this premonition necessary that you make not an ill
use of the following History, and become not guilty of diabolism or false
accusing of the Brethren, or dishonouring the Church: And that as God hath
in Scripture recorded the Sins of the ungodly, and the effects of Pride and
of malignity, and Christ hath foretold us that Wolves shall enter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Flock, and by their Fruits (of devouring, and pricking as
Thorns and Thistles) we shall know them, and the Apostles prophecied
of them; I take it to be my duty to give you an Abstract of the History
of Papal and aspiring Prelacy, usurping, and schismatical, and tyrannical
Councils, as knowing of how great use it is to all to know the true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Church, both as to good and evil.</p>
               <p>§. 53. Yea Bishops and Councils must not be worse thought of than
they deserve, no more than Presbyters, because of such abuses as I recite;
The best things are abused, even Preaching, Writing, Scripture, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it self, and yet are not to be rejected or dishonoured. There is an
Episcopacy whose very Constitution is a Crime, and there is another sort
which seemeth to me a thing convenient, lawful, and indifferent, and there
is a sort which I cannot deny to be of Divine Right.</p>
               <p>§. 54. That which I take to be it self a Crime, is such as is aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which in its very constitution over-throweth the Office, Church, and
Discipline, which Christ by himself and his Spirit, in his Apostles, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted:
such I take to be that Diocesane kind which hath only one Bishop
over many score or hundred fixed Parochial Assemblies; by which,
1. Parishes are made by them <hi>no Churches,</hi> as having no Ruling Pastors that
have the Power of Judging whom to Baptize, or admit to Communion or
refuse, but only are Chapels, having preaching Gurates. 2. All the first
Order of Bishops in single Churches are deposed, as if the Bishop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
should have put down a 1000 Bishops about him, and made himself
the sole Bishop of their Churches. 3. The Office of Presbyters is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into semi-Presbyters. 4. Discipline is made impossible, as it is for
one General without inferiour Captains to Rule an Army: But of this
before.</p>
               <p>§. 55. Much more doth this become unlawful, 1. when deposing all the
Presbyters from Government by the Keyes of Discipline, they put the same
Keyes, even the Power of dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etive Excommunication and Absolution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of Laymen, called Chancellours, and set up Courts liker to
the Civil than Ecclesiastical. 2. And when they oblige the Magistrate
to execute their Decrees by the Sword, be they just or unjust, and to lay
Men in Goals and ruine them, meerly because they are Excommunicated
by Bishops, or Chancellours, or Officials, or such others, and are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60852:34"/>
And when they threaten Princes and Magistrates with Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
(if not Deposition) if they do but Communicate with those that
the Bishop hath Excommunicated. 3. Or when they arrogate the power
of the Sword themselves, as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith <hi>Cyril</hi> did: Or without necessity
joyn in one person the Office of Priesthood and Magistracy, when one is
more than they can perform aright.</p>
               <p>§. 56. And it becometh much worse by the tyrannical abuse, when (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unable and unwilling to exercise true Discipline on so many hundred
Parishes) they have multitudes of Atheists, Infidels, gross ignorants, and
wicked livers in Church-Communion, yea, compel all in the Parishes to
Communicate on pain of Imprisonment and ruine, and turn their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
cruelly against godly persons, that dare not obey them in all their
Formalities, Ceremonies, and Impositions, for fear of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing against God.
And when conniving at ignorant ungodly Priests that do but obey them,
they silence and ruine the most faithful able Teachers, that obey not all
their imposing Canons, and swear not, and subscribe not what they bid
them.</p>
               <p>§. 57. Undoubtedly Satan hath found it his most successful way, to
fight against Christ in Christs own name, and to set up Ministers as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ, to speak indirectly against the Doctrine, Servants, and
interest of Christ, and as Ministers of Light and righteousness, and to
fight against Church-Government, Order, Discipline, and Unity, by the
pretences of Church Government, Order, Discipline, and Unity: and to
cry down Schism to promote Schism, and to depress Believers by crying up
Faith, and Orthodoxness, and crying down Heresie and Errour: Yea, to
plead God's Name and Word against himself, and to set up Sin, by accusing
Truth and Duty as Sin.</p>
               <p>§. 58. II. That which I take for Lawful Indifferent Episcopacy is such
as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, was introduced for the avoiding of divisions, though it
was not from the beginning: When among many Elders in every single
Church, one of most wisdom and gravity is made their President, yea,
without whom no Ordinations or great matters shall be done. The
Churches began this so early, and received it so universally, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any considerable dissent or opposition, even before Emperours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Christians, that I dare not be one that shall set against it, or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
such Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>§. 59. Yea, if where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t men are wanting to make Magistrates, the
King shall make Bishops Magistrates, and joyn two Offices together,
laying no more work on them than will consist with their Ecclesiastick work,
though this will have inconveniencies, I shall not be one that shall disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
such, or disobey them.</p>
               <p>§. 60. III. The Episcopacy, which I dare not say is not of Gods insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
(besides that each Pastor is <hi>Episcopus Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gis,)</hi> is that which succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Apostles in the Ordinary part of Church-Government, while some
Senior Pastors have a supervising care of many Churches, (as the Visiters
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60852:35"/>
had in <hi>Scotland,)</hi> and are so far <hi>Episcopi Episcoporum,</hi> and Arch-bishops,
having no constraining power of the Sword, but a power to admonish and
instruct the Pastors, and to regulate Ordinations, Synods, and all great
and common circumstances that belong to Churches. For if Christ set
up one Form of Government in which some Pastors had so extensive work
and power, (as <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and Evangelists as well as Apostles had) we
must not change it without proof, that Christ himself would have it
changed.</p>
               <p>§. 61. But if men on this pretence will do as <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
one Apostle to be the Governour of all the rest, and that they have
now that Authority of that Apostle, and will make an Universal Monarch
to rule at the Antipodes, and over all the World, or will set up Patriarchs,
Primates, Metr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>politans and Arch-bishops, with power to tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Brethren, and cast them out, and on pretence of Order, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the Civil Government, to master Princes, or captivate the Churches
to their pride and worldly interests, this will be the worst and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
tyranny.</p>
               <p>§. 62. And as it is not all Episcopacy, so it is not all Councils that I
design this History to dishonour. No doubt but Christ would have his
Church to be as far One, as their natural political and gracious capacities
will allow: And to do all his work in as much love, peace, and concord
as they can: And to that end, both seasonable Councils, and Letters, and
Delegates for Concord and Communication, are means which nature it self
directeth them to, as it doth direct Princes to hold Parliaments and Dyets.
In the multitude of Councellours there is safety: Even frequent converse

which no distant defences would so satisfyingly confute. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many we may hear that which of few we should not hear. How
good and pleasant is it for Brethren to dwel together in Unity? And the
Concord of Christians greatly honoureth their holy profession, as discord
becometh a scandal to the world. But all this, and the measures and sort
of Unity and Concord which we may expect, and the true way to attain
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have fuller opened in a Treatise entitled, <hi>The true and only t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Concord of all Christian Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 63. When Christians had no Princes or Magistrates on their side,
they had no sufficient means of keeping up Unity and Concord for mutual
help and strength, without meetings of Pastors to carry on their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
work by consent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But their meetings were only with those that
had nearness or neighbourhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And they did not put men to travel to
Synods out of other Princes Dominions, or from Foreign Lands, much
less did they call any General Councils out of all the Christian Churches in
the world. But those that were capable of Communion by proximity,
and of helping one another, were thought enough to meet for such
ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60852:35"/>
§. 64. And indeed neither nature nor Scripture obligeth us to turn
such occasional helps into the forms of a State-policy, and to make a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of friendly consultations. And therefore though where it may
be done without fear of degenerating into tyranny, known times of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Synods or meetings of Pastors for Concord are best, (as once a month
in lesser meetings, and once a quarter in greater,) yet where there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of such degeneracy, it is better to hold them but <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
at various seasons and places.</p>
               <p>§. 65. The lesser Synods and correspondency of Pastors before there
were Christian Magistrates were managed much more humbly and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
than the great ones afterward: Because that men and their interest
and motives differed. And even of later times, there have been few Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
called General, that have been managed so blamelesly, or made so
many profitable Canons, as many Provincial or smaller Synods did. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Toletane</hi> Councils, and many others in <hi>Spain, England,</hi> and other
Countries have laboured well to promote piety and peace: As did the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi>
Synods, and many others of old. And such as these have been ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Church. And the Greater Councils, though more turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
have many of them done great good, against Heresie and Vice; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the first at <hi>Nice:</hi> And nothing in this Book is intended to cloud their
worth and glory, or to extenuate any good which they have done: But I
am thankful to God that gave his Church so many worthy Pastors, and
made so much use as he did of many Synods for the Churches purity and
peace.</p>
               <p>§. 66. But the true reason of this Collection, and why I have besides
good products, made so much mention of the errours and mischiefs that
many Councils have been guilty of, are these following.</p>
               <p>1. The carnal and aspiring part of the Clergy, do very ordinarily, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the equivocal names of Bishops, confound the Primitive Episcopacy
with the Diocesane tyranny before described: And they make the ignorant
believe, that all that is said in Church-Writers for Episcopacy, is said for
<hi>their Diocesane Species:</hi> And while they put down an hundred or a thousand
Bishops and Churches of the Primitive Species, they make men believe that
it is they that are for the old Episcopacy, and we that are against it, and
that it is we and not they that are against the Church: while we are submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to them as Arch-bishops, if they would but leave Parishes to be Churches
(or Great Towns formerly called Cities at least) and make the Discipline
of all Churches but a possible practicable thing.</p>
               <p>§. 67. II. And to promote their ends, as these men are for the largest
Diocesses and turning a thousand Churches into one only, so they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
for violent Administration; ruling by constraint, and either usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the power of the sword themselves, or perswading and urging the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to punish all that obey not their needless impositions, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or threatning (at least) the Magistrates that will not be their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
And making themselves the Church snuffers, (or made without
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60852:36"/>
the Churches consent) their Office is exercised in putting out the Lights,
sometimes hundreds of faithful Ministers being silenced by their means in
a little time. And they take the sword of Discipline or power of the Keys
as the Church used it 300 years to be vain, unless prisons or mulcts enforce
it. And to escape the Primitive poverty, they overthrow the Primitive
Church, Form, and Discipline, and tell men, All this is for the Churches
honour and peace.</p>
               <p>§. 68. Yea all that like not their arrogances and grandure, they render
odious as <hi>Aerian</hi> Hereticks or Schismaticks, provoking men to hate and
revile them, and Magistrates to destroy them, as intolerable. And by
making their own numerous Canons and Inventions necessary to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Church-Communion, they will leave no place for true unity and
peace, but tear the Churches in pieces by the racks and engines of their
brains and wills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 69. III. Yea worse than all this, there are some besides the</hi> French
<hi>Papists, who tell the world,</hi> That the Vniversal Church on Earth is one visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
political body, having a visible Head or Supreme vicarious Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Christ, even a Collective Supreme, that hath universal Legislative, Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Executive power. And they make this <hi>Summa Potestas Constitutive</hi> of
the Church Vniversal, and say that this is Christs body out of which none have
his Spirit nor are Church-members, and that there is no Vnity or Concord but in
obeying this supreme visible power; And that this is in General Councils and in
the intervals in a <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> Successors of the Apostles, <hi>(I know not
who or where, unless it be all the Bishops as scattered over the earth)</hi> and
that they rule <hi>per literas formatas: (as others say,</hi> It is the Pope and <hi>Roman</hi>
Clergy or Cardinals.)</p>
               <p>§. 70. And when our Christianity, Salvation, Union and Communion,
yea, our Lives, Liberties and mutual forbearances, and Love, is laid upon
this very form of Church-policy and Prelacy, and Christ is supposed to
have such a Church as is not in the World, even constituted with a Visible
Vicarious Collective Soveraign, that must make Laws for the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World, it's time to do our best to save men from this deceit.</p>
               <p>§. 71. I must confess, If I believed that the Whole Church had any
Head or Soveraign under Christ, I should rather take it to be the Pope
than any one, finding no other regardable Competitor. He is uncapable
of ruling at the Antipodes and all the Earth; but a General Council is
much more uncapable, and so are the feigned College of Pastors or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
(none knoweth who.)</p>
               <p>§. 72. IV. And a blind zeal against errour, called <hi>Heresie,</hi> doth cry
down the necessary Love and toleration of many tolerable Christians;
And some cry, down with them, and away with them that erre more them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and by their measures would leave but few Christians endured by
one another in the World: Thus do they teach us to understand <hi>Solomon,</hi>
Eccl. 7. 16. <hi>Be not righteous and wise overmuch:</hi> so much are these men for
<hi>Vnity,</hi> that they will leave no place for much Unity on earth. As if none
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60852:36"/>
should be tolerated but men of one Stature, Complexion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 73. Briefly, they do as one that would set up a <hi>Family Government,</hi>
made up of many hundred or thousand families dissolved and turned into
one, and ruled supremely by a Council of the Heads of such enlarged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and then tell us, that this is not to alter the old Species of Families,
but to make them greater that were before too small: Keep but the same
name, and a City is but a Family still. And when they have done, they
would have none endured, but cast out, imprisoned or banished, as sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
that are for any smaller Family than a City, (or any lesser School
than an University:) And these City Governours must in one Convention
rule all the Kingdom, and in a greater all the World.</p>
               <p>§. 74. I shall therefore first tell you, what errour must not be tolerated,
and then by an Epitome of Church-History, Bishops and Councils and
Popes, shew the ignorant so much of the Matter of Fact, as may tell them
who have been the Cause of Church-corruptions, Heresies, Schisms and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and how: And whether such Diocesane Prelacy and grandure be
the Cure, or ever was. And, if God will, in a Second Volume shall
prove the sinfulness and novelty of that sort of Prelacy, and answer
the chief that have defended it.</p>

               <p>§. 1. <hi>THe Apostle</hi> Iames <hi>saith, ch.</hi> 5. 19, 20. Brethren, if any one of
you do erre from the truth, and one convert him, Let him know
that he that converteth a sinner from the errour of his way, doth
savea soul from death, and hide a multitude of sins. <hi>By which it
is implyed, that</hi> Errour <hi>tendeth unto</hi> Death: <hi>But what</hi> Errour is it?<hi>Is it
all?</hi> Who then can be saved? It is of great use to know, what Errours
are mortal, and what not.</p>
               <p>§. 2. There are errours that are <hi>no sins,</hi> and errours that are <hi>sins.</hi>
Those which are not voluntary either in themselves, or in their antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
causes, are no sins: Those which are not voluntary either by the act
or by the omission of the will, are no sins. Those which are unavoidable
through a necessity which is not moral but natural, are no sin: As if Infants,
Idiots, Mad-men, erre in matters of which they are uncapable: Or if any
erre for want of any revelation of the truth. As if the Papists did rightly
charge those with errours whom they burnt for denying Transubstantiation,
yet it could be no <hi>sinful errour,</hi> because it is necessary and unavoidable. For
the first discerning principle is sense: And if we are deceived while we
judge that to be <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> which all the sound senses of all men in
the World perceive as such, we have no remedy. For whether sense be
fallible or infallible, it is certain that we have no other faculties and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
to perceive immediately sensible things by. I can see by nothing but
my eyes, nor hear any other way than by my ears. If they say, that we must
believe that all mens senses are deceived when God telleth us so? I answer,
If we do not presuppose that by sense we must perceive things sensible, it
is in vain to talk of Gods telling us any thing, or of any of his Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or faith therein: For I know not but by sense, that there is a <hi>Bible,</hi> or
a <hi>Man,</hi> or a <hi>Voice</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> to be believed. And as <hi>humanity</hi> is presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Christianity,</hi> so is sense and reason to faith and the objects according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And to say, that all mens sound senses about their due placed objects
are fallible, is but to say, that no certainty can be had.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Of those errours that <hi>are sins;</hi> it is not all that are effectively mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
or damning sins: Else no man could be saved. There is no man that hath
not a multitude of errours, that hath any actual use of reason.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Errours are of three sorts. 1. Errours of <hi>Iudgment</hi> (to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60852:37"/>
of sense and imagination.) 2. <hi>Of Will; 3. Of Life,</hi> or practice. The
<hi>Iudgment</hi> is to <hi>Guide</hi> the <hi>Will;</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> is to command our <hi>practice.</hi>
Therefore those errours are least dangerous that least corrupt the <hi>Will</hi> and
<hi>practice,</hi> and those most dangerous that most corrupt them. But every
errour contrary to any useful truth is bad, as it is a corruption of the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
tending to corrupt the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. 1. No errour is effectively damning which turneth not the Heart
or Will in a predominant degree from the Love of God to the Love of the
Creature, from the Love of Heaven and Holiness to the prevalent Love of
Earth, and sinful pleasure, riches or honour therein; from things Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to things Carnal: For God hath prepared unconceivable glory for them
that Love him: The Kingdom of God consisteth not in meats and drinks,
but in righteousness, peace and joy in the holy Ghost: And he that in these
things serveth Christ, doth please God, and is acceptable to (good) men,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>§. 6. 2. I think no errour is effectively damning which a man doth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
desire to be delivered from at any rate, and when he that hath it
doth faithfully endeavour to come to the knowledge of the truth, in the
use of such means as God vouchsafeth him: He that searcheth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with a Love to truth, and sincerely prayeth for Gods illumination,
and sincerely practiceth what he already knoweth, and is willing to hear
what any man can say to his Further information, God will hide nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his salvation from such a man. For this is a work of such dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Grace, as shall not be received in vain.</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>Obj.</hi> But may not one that believeth not in God, or Christ, or the Life
to come, say all this, that he desireth and endeavoureth to know the truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. These things are so <hi>Great,</hi> so <hi>Evident,</hi> and so <hi>Necessary,</hi> that they
cannot be unknown to one that hath the Gospel, who hath the foresaid sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
desires and endeavours. And as for them that have not the Gospel, I
have spoken to their case before. 2. God that giveth so much grace doth
thereby signifie his willingness to give more.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>Obj.</hi> This intimateh that Grace is given according to Merits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Not the first Grace: But to him that hath (and improveth it) shall
be given, and from him that hath not (such improvement) shall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
even that which he hath. 2. No Grace or Glory is given according to
<hi>Merits</hi> in point of Commutative Justice, as <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> as if it did profit
God. But to him that asketh it shall be given. We must have a Beggers
Merit: Begging and thankful accepting; And yet that also is of antecedent
Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 9. On the contrary, 1. All errour is damning which excludeth the life
of <hi>faith, hope, love</hi> and <hi>sincere obedience:</hi> For these are of necessity to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
without holiness none shall see God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. The wisdom from
above is first pure, and then peaceable, and must be shewn out of a good
conversation by works with meekness of wisdom, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 13, 17. He that
Loveth not God, Heaven, and Holiness, with a predominant Love,' doth
damnably erre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60852:38"/>
§. 10. Secondly, Therefore all errour of judgment which <hi>effectively
excludeth the belief</hi> of any of the <hi>Essentials of Godliness,</hi> or of <hi>Christianity</hi>
where the Gospel is, is damning errour: Because a Mans <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>
can be no better than his <hi>belief</hi> or <hi>judgment</hi> is. No man can love that God
that he believeth not to be amiable, nor obey him whom he believeth not
to be his Governour; nor seeks for a happiness which he believeth not;
And it is in the face of Christ, a Redeemer, and Saviour of lost Sinners,
that Gods amiableness suitably appeareth unto man: And it is by his
Word and holy Spirit that Christ reneweth Souls.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And an ungodly carnal worldly man (though he be a learned
Preacher of the Truth) is damnably erroneous, and hath really the sum of
manifold Heresies: 1. He erreth about the greatest and most necessary
things: He taketh God to be less amiable than the Creature, and Heaven
than Earth, and Holiness than the Pleasure of Sin. 2. His errour is
practical and not only notional: 3. It excludeth the contrary truth, and
is predominant; so that what contrary truth he acknowledgeth, he doth
not soundly, practically, and prevailingly believe.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Were it not besides my present purpose I might manifest that
every carnal ungodly man among us, 1. Doth not truly believe any one
Article of the Creed with a serious practical belief; 2. Nor doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Baptismal Covenant; 3. Nor sincerely desire and put up one
Petition of the Lords Prayer, rightly understood; 4. Nor sincerely obey
one of the Ten Commandements; 5. Nor can sincerely receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper; Nor, 6. Is a sincere Member of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, nor can sincerely hold Communion with the Saints: He
is an Hypocrite and damnably erroneous, even while he seemeth to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
and pleadeth for the Truth, and cryeth out against Heresies and
Errours; which he may easily and ordinarily do.</p>
               <p>§. 13. It hath still been one of Satans effectual Snares to deceive and
damn ungodly men by, to hide their own practical errour and wickedness
from their Consciences, by seeming to be <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and crying down Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Heresies in others: But alas, how unfit persons are they for
such Work? And how dreadfully do they condemn themselves? It is a
pitiful thing to hear a man that is false to the very essence of his Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Vow, to revile and prosecute a poor <hi>Anabaptist</hi> (though errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous)
for holding that Baptism should be delayed till years of discretion
that it may be the better kept: Or to hear a man that obeyeth not God
himself, but his fleshly Lust, to cry out against every Dissenter, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
soever, for <hi>not obeying the Church</hi> in some questionable points:
or to hear a man that sticketh not at any wickedness that maketh for his
worldly ends or pleasure, to cry out against those that in fear of Perjury
or Lying or other sinning against God, dare not take some Oath, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
Profession, or Covenant which is imposed: As these notorious
Hypocrites who live quite contrary to the Christian Religion which they
profess, do use to call those Hypocrites that labour in all things to please
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60852:38"/>
God, if they do but mislike any thing in their Lives. So also while they
are drowned in damnable Errour, they cry out against Errour in those
that practically hold all the Essentials of Christianity, and are certainly
in the way of Life, if they do differ in any thing from them, or are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of any thing which they know. He that never puts up a sincere Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God for his Grace, nay, that would not have it, to make him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and deprive him of his sinful pleasure, will yet call others <hi>erroneous</hi> and
Schismaticks, if they pray not by his Book, or in all his Circumstances;
while his Heart and Family are prayerless, and God's Name ofter heard
in Oaths and Curses than in Prayer.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Because <hi>bare opinion</hi> may consist with worldliness and <hi>fleshly lusts,</hi>
therefore it hath long been the trick of the ungodly to seem zealous for
the true <hi>Church,</hi> and for <hi>right opinions,</hi> and to over do here to quiet their
Consciences in Sin: And it hath been a Snare to many conscionable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to tempt them to suspect and dislike the Truth, because ungodly Men
thus stand for it; and to think it must be some bad thing which wicked
men seem so zealous for: when as they do it but for a cover for their Sin,
as Hypocrites and Oppressors use <hi>long Prayers,</hi> which would not serve
their turn if there were not some good in it.</p>
               <p>§. 15. And yet Errour is such a blinding thing, that it's very usual even
for grosly erroneous men, to cry out most fiercely against Errour: For
they know not themselves, and they are proud and self conceited, and oft
by malignity apt to suspect and condemn others. What did the Jews per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the Christians for? For supposed Heresie and Errour: What did
the Heathens cast them to wild Beasts and Torments for? For supposed
Impiety and Errour: because they would not erre in their Idolatry
as they did. What hath disquieted and torn in pieces the Christian
World, but erroneous and worldly Popes, Patriarcks, and Prelates
inordinate out-crys against supposed Errours? For what have they silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
hundreds and thousands of faithful Ministers of Christ? for Errour.
For what have they racked, tormented, burnt to ashes, and slain by the
Sword so many thousand, and hundred thousands? O, it was for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or Errour. And are not these men perfectly free from Errour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that have so great a zeal against it? No, so grosly erroneous are
they, that they deny credit to all mens Senses, and know not Bread and
Wine when they see, and touch, and taste it; and would have all those
destroyed that will not deny belief to sense as well as they: So erroneous
are they, that they pretend a mortal man to be the Church Governour of
all the Earth; so erroneous, that they think God well Worshipped by
praying in words not understood; and dare deny half the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper to the People, which they confess that he instituted, and
all the Church did use; so erroneous, that they think the flames of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
will help them the better to love that God that doth torment them.
How foul and many are their Errours that kill, and burn, and damn others
as erroneous? But S. <hi>Iames</hi> hath told us, <hi>Iam. 3. That the Wisdom is not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60852:39"/>
from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devillish, which hath an envious stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
zeal; and that if it work not by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eakness of wisdom, and be not pure,
peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality and hypocrisie, sowing the fruit of righteousness in peace, by peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making,
but hath bitter contention, it is not of God, but bringeth confusion and
every evil work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 16. The <hi>Arians</hi> were cruel Persecutors, on pretence of zeal against
Errour, as they accounted it: They banished godly Pastors; they killed
them, they cut out the Preachers Tongues; they reproached them. The
Emperours <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Constantius</hi> were more fierce than the <hi>Arian Goths</hi>
themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macedonius</hi> that denyed the Deity of the Holy Ghost, was a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to Orthodoxness, and a great decryer and persecuter of others, as
erroneous and Hereticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nestorius</hi> (though somewhat worse judged of by <hi>Cyril</hi> than he deserved)
was justly condemned, were it but for his heat and fierceness against
others: He fell presently upon the <hi>Novatians</hi> and other Parties, and began
with this overdoing zeal at his entrance, <hi>O Emperour, give me a Church
without Heresie, and I will give-thee Victory over the Persians:</hi> that is, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all these dissenting Parties and God will prosper thee: And very
quickly was he deposed, condemned, and at last banished even to misery
and death as an Heretick (whether justly or no I shall say more anon.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eutychians</hi> were as great Zealots against Errour and Heresie as any
of the rest: They took <hi>Cyril</hi> for their Captain whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Isydore
Pelusiota</hi> that knew him, describe as heynously proud and turbulent, and
<hi>Socrates</hi> as the first Bishop that himself used the Sword. <hi>Dioscorus</hi> raged
at the second Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> against dissenters, and all in Zeal against
<hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie. But what dreadful work his <hi>Eutychian</hi> Party and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
made, I have elsewhere shewed: And all as against Heresie.</p>

               <p>It was zeal against <hi>Origens</hi> Heresie and Errour which set <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and

that he reciteth other Mens Errours: I have given a Catalogue of them
elsewhere. Besides the inconsiderable Errours which he calleth Heresies.</p>
               <p>It was zeal against the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie which made <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
the Schism between two Bishops at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and after become the
Head of a separating Party, because he would not receive the returning
<hi>Arians</hi> into Communion as others did.</p>
               <p>And it was zeal against Heresie that made others for this account him
a Heretick, and call his Followers <hi>Luciferians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was zeal against Errour which made both the <hi>Novatians</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi>

run into Errour, and keep up their Parties as more pure from the

                  <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> describeth <hi>Ithacius</hi> as a man that cared not what he said
or did, and the rest of the Synod of Bishops about him as unfit to be
communicated with; that would bring Christianity it self into reproach by
their furious opposition to Hereticks: And who would have thought but
these Bishops had been very good men themselves, that were so zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> as to procure the Death of some, and the Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, and bring <hi>Martin</hi> himself, and other strict abstemious
people into the suspicion of <hi>Priscillianism?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a zeal for Christ, and against supposed Errour, which raised the
doleful contention about the corruptibility of Christ's Body; one Party
calling the others <hi>Phantasiasticks,</hi> and the other calling them <hi>Corrupticolae;</hi>
into which Errour the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> himself did lapse and become
a zealous Heretick, as the Orthodox Party called him.</p>

               <p>§. 19. I. Before these there were many Provincial Councils called
to decide the Controversie of the time of <hi>Easter;</hi> and as that at <hi>Rome,</hi> in
<hi>Palestine, Pontius,</hi> and one in <hi>France</hi> went one way; so that of <hi>Asia,</hi>
under <hi>Polycrates Ephes.</hi> went another way, professing to stick therein to
the Gospel, and the Tradition of their Fathers: For which <hi>Victor</hi> would
needs excommunicate them, which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sharply reprehendeth. Its
worth the noting, That as the wrong party pleaded Tradition, so the right
party pleaded Reason and Scripture, as you may see in <hi>Beda</hi>'s Fragment
of the <hi>Palestine</hi> Council, <hi>sub Theoph. Caesar. Bin T. 1. p.</hi> 132. And that the
main argument used was the Divine Benediction of the Lords day: which
they may note, that question the ancient observation of that day.</p>
               <p>§. 20. II. The next Council recorded <hi>(Bin. p. 135.)</hi> is one at <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60852:40"/>
under <hi>Agrippinus,</hi> which decreed the re-baptizing of those that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by Hereticks: For which they are commonly now condemned.</p>
               <p>§. 21. And <hi>Binnius</hi> noteth that they had this from their Countryman
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> whose zeal against Hereticks was so hot, that he would have
nothing, no not Baptism, common with them; so <hi>Baron. an. 217. n, 1, 2,
3. &amp; an. 258. n.</hi> 19, 20. Yet is this man now numbred with Hereticks.</p>
               <p>§. 22. III. The <hi>Concilium Labesitanum</hi> is the next in order, where one
<hi>Privatus</hi> was condemned for an Heretick (mentioned by <hi>Cyprian, Epist. 55.)</hi>
But, saith <hi>Binnius,</hi> what his Heresie was is not known nor mentioned.</p>
               <p>§. 23. IV. Next we have an <hi>Arabian</hi> Council, in which the Errour of
the <hi>Souls Mortality</hi> (allowing it only to rise again with the Body at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection)
was excellently oppugned and expugned by <hi>Origen;</hi> but it was
by that <hi>Origen</hi> who himself is called a blasphemous Heretick.</p>
               <p>§. 24. V. The next mentioned Council <hi>(Bin. p. 158.)</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the restoring of the Lapsed upon <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s motion. A business that
made no small dissention, while <hi>Lucianus</hi> and some others made the Church-door
too wide, and <hi>Novatus,</hi> and <hi>Novatianus</hi> made it too narrow, and
<hi>Cyprian</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy went a middle way: bitter and grievous were
the Censures of each other, and long and sad the Schisms that did ensue,
the rigour of the <hi>Novatians</hi> being increased by their Offence at other mens
sinful latitude and tepidity.</p>
               <p>§. 25. By the way it is worth the considering by some <hi>Papists,</hi> who
make both a Bishop Essential to a Church, and a Pope to the Church-Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
and deny Church-Government to Presbyters, that this Council
is said to be called by the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy (the Presbyters and Deacons)
when the Church had been a year or two without a Bishop (through the
sharp persecution of <hi>Decius</hi> upon <hi>Fabian</hi>'s Death). And it is to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Clergy (Presbyters and Deacons) that <hi>Cyprian</hi> at this time wrote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his Epistles, as they wrote to him; insomuch that <hi>Binnius</hi> stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to say, <hi>that in this interregnum the</hi> Roman <hi>Clergy had the care or
charge of the Vniversal Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaer.</hi> How far their Government, even of Bishops (whom they Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in this Council) was Canonical or valid?</p>
               <p>§. 26. VI. After this there was another Council at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and two at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and one in <hi>Italy,</hi> and another at <hi>Carthage,</hi> about the same Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
where it was determined that the Lapsed should be received to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and after a sufficient space of Penance, should communicate,
but not sooner: And that the Bishops that lapsed should be uncapable of
Episcopacy and communicate only with the Laity upon their penance:
Yet <hi>Cyprian</hi> in time of a renewed Persecution thought meet to relax this,
and take in the Penitent presently, lest they should be discouraged under
Suffering. But <hi>Foelicissimus</hi> one of his Deacons made himself the Head of
a <hi>Faction,</hi> by taking men in by his own Authority too soon, and <hi>Novatus</hi>
and <hi>Novatian,</hi> as is said, being against their taking into Communion at
all, the Councils excommunicated them all as Schismaticks. Where note,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60852:41"/>
that <hi>Novatus</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Priest, that went to <hi>Rome</hi> and got <hi>Novatian</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Bishop, did not deny them Pardon of Sin with God, but only
Church-Communion. 2. Nor did he deny this to other great Sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
but only to those that lapsed to Idolatry or denying Christ. But
the <hi>Novatians</hi> long after extended it to other heynous Crimes, as upon
supposed parity of Reason.</p>
               <p>§. 27. VII. Next this we have <hi>Cyprians African</hi> Council in which (after
the censuring of some that reproached a Pastor) they condemn a Dead
Man called <hi>Victor,</hi> because by his Will he left one <hi>Faustinus</hi> a Presbyter
the Guardian of his Sons, which the Canons had forbidden, because no
Ministers of God should be called from their sacred Work to meddle with
Secular things: Therefore they Decree that <hi>Victors</hi> Name shall not be
mentioned among the Dead in Deprecation, nor any Oblation made for
his Rest. <hi>(Non est quod pro dormitione ejus apud vos fiat oblatio, aut deprecatio
aliqua nomine ejus in Ecelesiâ frequentetur.)</hi> The case of the Clergy is much
altered since then; And whether the penalty had more of Piety, as to
the end, or Errour in the rigor, and the matter (as if it were a Punishment
to the Dead, not to be offered for, or prayed for) I leave to further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
<hi>Cypr. li. 1. Epist.</hi> 66.</p>
               <p>§. 28. VIII. The next Council we meet with is <hi>Concil. Iconiense an.</hi> 258.
where the Bishops of <hi>Cappadocia, Cilicia, Galatia,</hi> and other Oriental Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
at <hi>Iconium</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> Decreed that the Baptisms of Hereticks, their
Ordinations, Imposition of Hands, and other sacred Actions were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.
For which, saith <hi>Baronius an. 258. n.</hi> 14, 15, 16. Pope <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phen</hi> Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
all these Oriental Bishops, and Reprobated the Council, and
would not receive or hear their Legates: Of which <hi>Firmilianus Caesar. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pad.</hi>
writeth to <hi>Cyprian</hi> against him.</p>
               <p>§. 29. IX. At the same time, <hi>Euseb. lib. 7. c.</hi> 6. tells us, there was also
a Synod at <hi>Synadis,</hi> yea, divers in other places, that all decreed the same
thing, for rebaptizing those that were baptized by Hereticks; and that
this had been the Bishops opinion of so long time before, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> durst
not condemn it. <hi>Vid. Baron. Anno 258. n.</hi> 17. But it is now commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>§. 30. X. If they had confined their opinion of rebaptizing to such He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
as are strictly so called, that renounce any essential Article of the
Faith, they might have made the Controversie hard; But as Hereticating
increased, so their own difficulties increased. And now the <hi>Novatians</hi> were
pronounced Hereticks, it grew a hard question, whether all that the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians</hi>
had baptized must be rebaptized. And for this an <hi>African</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<hi>Anno</hi> 258. concluded affirmatively: Because all that are baptized are
baptized into the Church: But Hereticks are not in the Church, and so
baptize not into the Church: therefore such must be rebaptized. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
and many very Godly Bishops consented in this errour.</p>
               <p>§. 31. XI. To try this business further, <hi>Cyprian</hi> gathered another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of above 70 Bishops out of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rick</hi> and <hi>Numidia,</hi> and all were desired to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60852:41"/>
declare what was the Tradition of their Fathers; And they all agreed that
according to Scripture, and Tradition, the Baptism of Hereticks was a
Nullity, and it was no rebaptization to baptize such as they baptized: (see
here what strength is in the Papists argument of Tradition in such cases.)
But this Council and their Doctrine Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> condemned: But they
never the more altered their judgments, not believing his Infallibity or
power to judge between them in such matters of Faith.</p>
               <p>In this Council is set down every Bishops Reason of his Judgment.</p>
               <p>§. 32. XII. When Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> had condemned these Bishops, <hi>Cyprian</hi>
calleth yet a greater Council of 87 Bishops, who confirmed the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and rejected the Popes opinion and his arrogancies, that would make
himself to be a Bishop of Bishops, and by tyrannical terrour and abuse of
Excommunication, force others to his opinion. And with the <hi>Africans</hi> in
this judgment joyned <hi>Firmilian,</hi> with 70 <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops, and saith <hi>Binnius,
Dionysius Alexandrinus</hi> also.</p>
               <p>§. 33. But I must here tell the Reader, that I mention not these instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to breed ill thoughts in him of these <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Numidian</hi> Bishops:
For as far as I can discern by their Writings and by History, they were the
Godliest, Faithful, Peaceable company of Bishops that were found in any
part of the World since the Apostles times: <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s style and the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of all just History which concerneth him, as well as his Martyrdome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
him to be a Saint indeed. <hi>(Nazianzen</hi> declareth the strange occasion
of his Conversion; <hi>viz.</hi> That he loved or lusted after a Christian Virgin,
and when he could not obtain his will, being given to Magick, he agreed
with the Devil to procure his desire; but when he saw that the Devil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself unable to do it, and so that he was too weak for Christ, he
forsook the Devil and turned Christian:) The Papists <hi>(Binnius, Baronius,
&amp;c.)</hi> conjecture that <hi>Cyprian</hi> before his death reformed this Errour, but
their conjecture meerly tells us what they wish, without any reason,
but that he dyed a Martyr and his Successours honoured him. As
if none might so die and be honoured that had any errour, which
no man living is without. 2. And this may be said to excuse their errour.
1. That the strictest men oftner erre on the stricter side against sin, than
the complying Carnal Clergy. 2. That they thought it the safer way to
baptize such again, (on the same reason as we do in case of uncertain bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
with a <hi>si non baptizatus es, baptizo te;)</hi> not knowing why there should
be any danger in the mistake: Much like as in <hi>England</hi> now, the Bishops are
for the re-Ordaining of all such as were Ordained by others that were not
Diocesanes, and yet do not call it re-Ordaining. 3. That in those times of
Heathenisme and persecution, the Christians had no way to maintain their

4. And the ambiguity of the word <hi>[Heresie]</hi> was not the least occasion of
their errour. The <hi>Nicene</hi> Council afterward rebaptized such as those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks

Baptized, who corrupted the substance of baptisme it self, but not
others. And Christians at first had more wit and charity than to call every
errour a Heresie, (else there had been none but Hereticks:) such as denyed
some essential point of faith or practice, and drew a party to maintain it,
were called Hereticks in the former times; but afterward every Schism or
Party that gathered by themselves, and set up <hi>altare contra altare</hi> upon the
smallest difference, was called a Heresie. And so the same name applyed
to another thing, deceived them. The Bishops were men of eminent piety
and worth.</p>

The Bishops partly excused, partly confessed it, and asked pardon;

his own Sisters Sons: who told him that he should not think to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

and beginning to evince it, bid him not provoke him to tell the rest:
Whereupon <hi>Secundus</hi> his Nephew told his Unkle, You see that he is ready to

               <p>§. 40. XIX. <hi>Anno</hi> 306. A Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> of about 70 Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Schism of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> contending who should have the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of <hi>Carthage:</hi> One party had chosen <hi>Caecilianus</hi> to succeed <hi>Mensurius;</hi>
The other party accusing him as being a Traditor, and Ordained by <hi>Foelix</hi>
a Traditor, and had forbidden bringing food to the Martyrs in prison,
they ordained one <hi>Majorinus</hi> Bishop in his stead: <hi>Caecilianus</hi> had the
countenance of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and stood it out, and kept the place:
Hereupon the Church being divided, the division run through all <hi>Africk,</hi>
and <hi>Numidia,</hi> while the accusing party renounced Communion with <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus;</hi>
so that for many years after (two hundred at least) they did with
plausible pretence claim the title of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> though they were after
called <hi>Donatists</hi> (from <hi>Donatus</hi> a very good Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> heretofore,
whom they praised, and not from <hi>Donatus à Casis nigris,</hi> as some think.)
<hi>Secundus Tigisitanus</hi> Primate of <hi>Numidia,</hi> furthers the breach, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of <hi>Majorinus</hi> fixed it. Thus the doleful Tragedy of the <hi>Donatists</hi>
began by Bishops divided about a <hi>Carthage</hi>

               <p>§. 41. XX. <hi>Anno</hi> 308. Another Council was held at <hi>Carthage,</hi> where no
less than 270 <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops, for moderation, agreed to Communicate
with penitent Traditors, without rebaptizing them, and so did for 40
years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60852:43"/>
§. 42. XXI. <hi>Anno</hi> 313. The Schism continuing, the <hi>Donatists</hi> cleaving
to <hi>Majorinus,</hi> appealed against <hi>Caecilianus</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> (now Emperour.)
He first appointeth three <hi>French</hi> Bishops to judge the Cause, but after 19
Bishops (called a <hi>Roman</hi> Council) met at <hi>Rome</hi> to hear both Parties: where
<hi>Melchiades</hi> and the rest acquitted <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and condemned <hi>Donatus à
Casis nigris</hi> (a promoter of the <hi>Donatists</hi> Cause) as guilty of Schism. But
the <hi>Donatists</hi> accusing <hi>Melchiades</hi> also as a Traditor, the Schism was never
the more ended: A motion was made that both the Bishops should remove
<hi>(Caecilianus</hi> and <hi>Majorinus)</hi> to end the Schisme; But the <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops
were so very many in number, that they thought they were to be
called the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Caecilianists</hi> the Schismaticks, and therefore would
not so agree. Thus Bishops about Bishopricks set all the Country on a
flame.</p>
               <p>§. 43. XXII. Next <hi>Constantine</hi> would hear the Cause of these contending
Bishops at a Council at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> (before 200 Bishops at least) where
<hi>Caecilianus</hi> was again acquitted, and the <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops cast, by the witness
of their Scribe <hi>Ingentius,</hi> who (being racked) confessed that he was hired
to give false witness in the Case. Several good Canons were here made for
Church-Order.</p>
               <p>§. 44. I have heard many Popish Persons liken the Separatists among us
to the <hi>Donatists:</hi> But so unlike them are they, That, 1. The said Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists
are against all Episcopacy, but the <hi>Donatists</hi> were Bishops, and
contended for the highest Places of Prelacy. 2. The Separatists are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
a Minor Part departing from the Major Part. But the <hi>Donatists</hi>
were the Major Part of the Bishops casting out the Minor Part as Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.
The Truth is, in those times the Bishops being usually in contention
and Church-Wars among themselves, (especially when <hi>Constantine</hi> had
given them peace and prosperity,) the strife was, Who should get the
better, and have their will: 1. Sometime the strife was about Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who was in the right, and to be called Orthodox, and who was to
be accounted the Heretick. 2. The other part quarrel who should be
the Bishop, or who should have the highest places. 3. And the next quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
was whose side should carry it in setting up any Bishops, or in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deposing them, and who should have their Heads or Friends
brought in. And the way to get the better, was, 1. At the first, by the
majority of the peoples Votes in chusing Bishops, and of the Bishops in
deposing them. 2. But after, most went in chusing and deposing by the
majority of the Bishops Votes in the greater Seats, (the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
still required,) at least if a Council did interpose. 3. And at last, it
went by the favour or displeasure of the Court; either the Emperour,
or the Empress, or some great Officers. The <hi>African</hi> Bishops it seems
were far the greatest number against <hi>Caecilian,</hi> (when 270 met at one
Council, and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

19,</hi> and that at <hi>Ancyra</hi> 18 Bishops.) Therefore the Bishops thought
that majority of number gave them right to the Title of Catholick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that those Dissenter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> must be called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as was too usual. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they lived in the Country where many Councils under <hi>Agrippinus</hi> and
<hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And no General Council had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against them, for there had been none.</note> and <hi>Firmilian,</hi> had voted that <hi>Hereticks</hi> were not of the Church, and
those that they had baptized, were to be rebaptized; they thought that
they did but keep up this Tradition; and so they said that they were all
the Church of <hi>Africa,</hi> and that the <hi>Cecilians</hi> were <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Separatists</hi>
from the Church, and that all that they baptized were to be rebaptized,
as was formerly held. So that indeed the <hi>Donatists</hi> did but as the <hi>Papists,</hi>
and their worldly Clergy still have done, who take the advantage
of a <hi>Majority</hi> to call themselves the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Catholiks,</hi> and to call the
Dissenters <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> save that they added <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.
And when it was for their advantage they communicated 40 years
with Traditors; but when the power of the Court and the Bish. of <hi>Rome</hi> bore
them down, they kept up their party by pretended strictness, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the others as a Sect, and as Heretical and persecuters of the Church. So
that it was the Multitudes and Councils of the Prelates that set up <hi>Donatism.</hi>

of 13 Bishops that had been before most at <hi>Ancyra</hi> met at <hi>Neocesarea;</hi> but the
small number did better work than many greater Councils did, making
some good Canons against Adultery and Fornication; Though the <hi>7th Can.</hi>
that forbids Priests to dine at the second Marriages of any, because such
must repent, be of doubtful sense and truth: The first <hi>Can.</hi> is against
Priests marrying and Fornication. The last, that the number of Deacons

<hi>Arius</hi> and that the rest adhered to them, especially as holding that Christ

was hence laid, that thou <hi>Alexander</hi> didst ask questions of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters

of a Question <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idst enquire, what every one of them thought? And
thou <hi>Arius</hi> didst inconsiderately blurt out that which thou hadst not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought of, or if thou hadst thought of it, thou oughtest to have
past by in silence: Whence discord was stir'd up among you, and the
meeting hindered which is wont to be made in the Church, and the
most holy people distracted into several parts, is divided from the
compagination of the whole body of the Church. Therefore both of
you, forgiving one another, approve of that which your fellow-servant
doth not without cause exhort you to: And what is that? That to
such Questions you neither Ask, nor Answer, if asked: For such Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
as no Law or Ecclesiastick Canon doth necessarily prescribe, but
the vain strife of dissolute idleness doth propose, though they may serve
to exercise acuteness of wit, yet we ought to contemn them in the inner
thought of the mind, and neither rashly to bring them out into the
publick Assemblies of the People, nor unadvisedly to trust them to the
Ears of the Vulgar. For how few are they that can accurately enough
perceive the force of things so weighty, and so involved in obscurity?
But if there be some one that is confident that he can easily do and reach
this, yet I pray you, how small a part of the multitude is it, that he
can make to understand him? Or who is there, that in the curious search
of such Questions, is not in danger of a fall?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The rest is well worth the Reading, as to the common case of Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Controversies, though it seems that <hi>Constantine</hi> made too light of the
<hi>Arian</hi> errour. But I dare not be so injurious to <hi>Eusebius</hi> as to question
whether he faithfully recited the Epistle, when <hi>Binnius</hi> himself backs his
doubt with a <hi>dicere non auderem:</hi> And if we give away the credit of that
one Historian, it will leave much of Church-History under doubt, that now
goeth for certain: Perhaps <hi>Peters</hi> being ever at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

was.) And Can. 56. The Presbyters were not to go into the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Bishop, but with him. (For then every Church had a Bishop, though

saith <hi>Crab,</hi> under <hi>Sylvester,</hi> which hath 7 Canons: The last saith, That no
Bishop shall Ordain any, but <hi>with all the Church united.</hi> But whether this
was before or after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, is uncertain.</p>
               <p>And another he mentioneth under <hi>Sylvester</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Binnius</hi> hath,
where <hi>Constantine</hi> baptized of <hi>Sylvester</hi> was present and 284 Bishops. (Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be true or a fiction is uncertain.) But if true, it was a very humble
Council: For they all professed only patience, renounced giving their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all, but only heard what <hi>Sylvester</hi> would say, professing none fit
to judge but he. But they all with Presbyters and Deacons subscribed what
he said (if true.) What he said I do not well understand, supposing much
of it to be scarce sense: I am sure it is far from <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Latine. 139 Bishops
came, <hi>ex Vrbe Româ vel non longè ab illâ, Out of the City of Rome, or not far
from it:</hi> (How big were their Diocesses?) Here, Cap. 2. three men are curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
(anathematized:) One was a Bishop, <hi>Victorinus,</hi> that <hi>being ignorant of
the course of the Moon,</hi> contradicted the right time of <hi>Easter.</hi> It's well the
<hi>Makers</hi> and <hi>Approvers</hi> of our Imposed <hi>English</hi> Liturgy fell not under <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester</hi>'s
severity, who have (alas, mistakingly) told us, that <hi>[Easter-day,
on which the rest depend, is always the first Sunday after the first full Moon, which
happens next after the one and twentieth day of</hi> March: <hi>And if the full Moon
happen on a Sunday,</hi> Easter-<hi>day is the Sunday after.]</hi> This is one of the things
that about 2000 Ministers are silenced, for not <hi>Declaring Assent,</hi> Consent
and Approbation of; yea to the <hi>use of it,</hi> and so to keep <hi>Easter</hi> at a wrong
time. But how <hi>Sylvester</hi> came to have power to say all, and to banish men,
and <hi>Constantine</hi> sit by and say nothing, I know not: <hi>Dedit eis anathema &amp;
damnavit eos extra urbes suas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cap. 3. He Decreed, that</hi> no Presbyter shall accuse a Bishop, no Deacon a
Presbyter, &amp;c. <hi>and no Layman,</hi> any of them: And that no Prelate shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
but in 72 Testimonies, nor the chief Prelate be judged of any one, because
it is written, The Disciple is not above his Master. And no Presbyter shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
but in 44 Testimonies; no Cardinal Deacon but in 36, &amp;c. <hi>And what
may they not then do or be?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The 12. Cap. is,</hi> Nemo det poenitentiam, nisi quadraginta annorum petenti:
Let no man give repentance <hi>(or penance)</hi> but to one that seeketh forty years.</p>

the other 57?) 45 Priests, and 5 Deacons, and <hi>the two following, and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
<hi>and his Mother</hi> Helena. O brave Pope and Clergy! O patient

               <head type="sub">The Council of Nice, and some following it.</head>
               <p>§. 1. XXX. WE come now to the first General Council: General
only as to the <hi>Roman World</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> as the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Subscriptions prove, and not as to the
<hi>Whole World,</hi> as the Papists with notorious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
affirm: which I have elsewhere fully proved. This Council was
called, as is probably gathered, <hi>Anno</hi> 325<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the <hi>20th</hi> year of <hi>Constantine</hi>
(though others assign other years.) That they were congregate about the
<hi>Arian</hi> Heresie and the Eastern Controversie is commonly known: As also
what wisdom and diligence <hi>Constantine</hi> used to keep the Bishops in peace:
Who presently brought in their Libels of accusations against each other;
which he took and burnt without reading them, earnestly exhorting them
to peace, and by his presence and prudent speech repressing their heats
and contentions; whereby the Synod was brought to a happy end as to
both the controverted Causes: And <hi>Eusebius Nicomed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Arius</hi> were
brought to counterfeit repentance and consent to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; which
<hi>Constantine</hi> perceiving, being set upon the healing of the divided Bishops
and Churches, he commanded that <hi>Arius</hi> should (as reformed) be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to Communion; which <hi>Athanasius</hi> refusing caused much calamity after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Because the Case of the <hi>Meletians</hi> is brought in by this Council, I
think it useful (for our warning in these times) to recite the sum of their
story out of <hi>Epiphanius, p. 717, &amp;c. Haer.</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meletius</hi> (saith he) was a Bishop in <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bais</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> of sincere Faith
even to the death. In <hi>Diocletians</hi> Persecution, <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and he, were the chief of the Bishops that were laid in Prison, as designed
to Martyrdom; while they were there long together with many fellow-prisoners,
many called to Tryal before them were put to death, and many
for fear subscribed to Idolatry, or denyed Christ: And when they had done,
professed repentance and craved peace of the Church: As it had been in
<hi>Novatus</hi> his Schismes, so it fell out here; Peter Bishop of <hi>Alexan.</hi> was for
peace and pardon; <hi>Meletius</hi> and most of the other suffering prisoners
were against it, and said, If they may thus revolt to save themselves, and
be presently pardoned, it will tempt others to revolt: <hi>Peter</hi> seeing his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
was rejected, rashly took his Cloak and hang'd it like a Curtain
over the midst of the prison-room, and said, <hi>Those that are for me, come
to me on this side, and those that are for</hi> Meletius <hi>go on that side to him:</hi>
Whereupon far most of the Bishops, Priests, Monks, and people that
were in prison went to <hi>Meletius,</hi> and but few to <hi>Peter.</hi> (A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than that of the <hi>English</hi> Fugitives at <hi>Frankford.)</hi> This unhappy word and
hour began the misery, among good men, expecting death: From that
hour they keep all their meetings separate. Shortly after <hi>Peter</hi> was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred,
and <hi>Meletius</hi> was judged to the Mines: As he went thither through
the Country, he every where made new Bishops and gathered new Churches,
so that there were <hi>two in the several Cities:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> Those old ones that followed
<hi>Peter</hi> called their Meeting, <hi>The Catholick Church;</hi> The other called theirs,
<hi>The Martyrs Church:</hi> But yet they held a Unity of Faith. Even the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that laboured in the Mines divided,<note place="margin">☞</note> and did not pray together. At
last <hi>Meletius</hi> and the rest were restored unto peace, and at <hi>Alexandria, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
and he lived in familiarity, and <hi>Meletius</hi> was he that detected <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and brought him to <hi>Alexander</hi> to be tryed. But when <hi>Meletius</hi> was
dead,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> grew impatient at the private separate Meetings of his
followers, and troubled them, and vexed them, and began to use violence
against them, and would not have them depart from his Church: They
refused still, and this bred stirs and Tumults. <hi>Alexander</hi> persecuting them,
and following them yet more sharply, they sent some men, eminent for
piety and parts, to the Emperours Court, to Petition for Liberty for their
private Meetings, without impediment. Of these <hi>Paphnutius</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> their
Bishop, and <hi>Callinitus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Pellusium</hi> were chief: who when they came
to Court, being named <hi>Meletians,</hi> the Courtiers rejected them and drove
them away, and they could not get access to the Emperour. On this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
being put to wait long at <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> they fell into
acquaintance with <hi>Euschius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the Head of the <hi>Arians,</hi>
who pretending repentance was become great with the Emperour, who was
all for the Clergies peace and concord. To <hi>Eusebius</hi> they open all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
He craftily took the advantage of their suffering and long waiting,
and promised his help, on condition they would but Communicate with
<hi>Arius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> who seigned repentance. The temptation over came them, and they
yield; They that had gathered separate Churches, because they would not
Communicate with the repenting Lapsed (to Idolatry;) yet yielded to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with <hi>Arius,</hi> that they might be delivered from the persecution of
a Godly Bishop, and keep their Meetings. They are brought to <hi>Constantine,</hi>
who being all for peace, though against Schism, grants them the freedom
of their Meetings; And thus joyning with the <hi>Arians</hi> for the liberty of
their Assemblies, this became the greatest support to the <hi>Arians,</hi> without
which (saith <hi>Epiphanius)</hi> they could not have stood. (So much doth Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
tyranny or severity cross its own ends, and destroy the concord which
they think by such tearing means to force; And so hard is it for men that
could suffer Martyrdome from Heathens, innocently to bear the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Brethren, and so greatly doth it tempt them to use unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
means for their preservation: Just as if the Non-conformists at this
time should seek, by the favour of the Papists, to be delivered from the
silencing and destroying Prelates, upon condition of a common liberty:
The Cases are not much unlike.) <hi>Neque enim</hi> (saith <hi>Epiphanius) consistere</hi>

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> being dead, and <hi>Athanasius</hi> shortly succeeding him, he could
not bear the <hi>Meletian</hi> Churches in his City: And after fair means he used
foul: And going himself to look after such Meetings, with his Retinue,
one of his Deacons in the <hi>Meletian</hi> Meetings broke a certain Vessel, which
occasioned some chiding and fighting, which occasioned Accusations of
the <hi>Meletians,</hi> and Calumniations of the <hi>Arians</hi> against <hi>Athanasius</hi> as a
Man of Violence and Tyranny; which <hi>Constantine</hi> abhorring in a Bishop,

(having granted the <hi>Meletians</hi> liberty for their Meetings, which

and judge innocent</hi> Athanasius? <hi>Were not thou and I in Prison together in time
of Persecution, and when I lost an Eye for the Truth, thou camest out unmaimed?
And how came that to pass, if thou didst not promise some wicked deed or other to
the Persecutors, or do some? Eusebius</hi> hearing this, suddenly rose and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
the Council, saying, <hi>If you dare carry it thus here, your Adversaries
Accusations are to be believed: For if you play the Tyrants here, you do it much
more in your own Country.</hi> Hereupon two <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops <hi>Vrsalius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi>
are sent into <hi>Egypt</hi> to enquire after the Truth of the Matter, who coming
back with Calumnies against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> he fled from the Council by
Night to the Court to the Emperour to give him information; who taking
<hi>Athanasius</hi> for false and Tyrannical would not believe him, but upon Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the Council, and upon the provocation of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who
told him God would judge him for believing his Accusers, banished him,
where he remained (in <hi>Italy)</hi> twelve or thirteen years, even till after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantins</hi>
Death. And when <hi>Constans</hi> had compelled his Brother <hi>Constantius</hi>
to restore him, he was again banished; For <hi>George</hi> that had been made
Bishop by the <hi>Arians</hi> (and by <hi>Constantius)</hi> was killed by the Heathen People
in <hi>Iulians</hi> time, and his Corps burnt, and the Ashes scattered into the
Wind, which increased the suspicion of Tyranny against <hi>Athanasius:</hi> But
in <hi>Iovians</hi> Reign he was again restored; And after his Death, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with Infamies again: And when <hi>Athanasius</hi> was Dead, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Valens</hi> set <hi>Lucius</hi> over them, who afflicted the People that had
followed <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> whom they had chosen for their Bishop,
and by Banishment, Death and Torments, made them know what Church-Tyranny
was indeed.</p>
               <p>Thus far <hi>Epiphanius</hi> giveth us the History of the <hi>Meletian</hi> Schism, and
the effects of good Bishops impatience with Dissenters.</p>

§. 3. But I must not conceal from the Reader that <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Dion.
Petavius</hi> say, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is deceived in all this History, and maketh
the case of the <hi>Meletians</hi> better than it was; and that some <hi>Meletian</hi> knave
beguiled him: But, 1. They give us no proof of any such knaves beguiling
him at all: 2. And he that was so apt to <hi>over-do</hi> in suspecting and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
Heresies, (as in <hi>Origen</hi>'s and <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s Case,) was not likely to
make the Case here so much better than it was: 3. And how much nearer
was <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in time and place, than <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Petavius?</hi> and how
easie was it then for him to have true notice of such publick things? 4. And
if they make <hi>Epiphanius</hi> so fallacious in such a story as this, so near him,
what a shake doth it give to the Credit of his copious History of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Heresies, which he had less opportunity to know: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Credit of much of Church-History? Yet I confess, that the man
seemeth not to be very accurate in his Disputes, nor all his Narratives;
But rather by far to be suspected of making things worse than they were,
than better. And I believe that some passages in this History are mistaken
by him (as that the <hi>Meletians</hi> joyned with the <hi>Arians</hi> before the death of
<hi>Alexander:)</hi> but that maketh their Case the better. <hi>Petavius</hi> saith also, <hi>p. 286.
Animad. in Epiph. Multum in Historiâ</hi> Meletii <hi>lapsum esse suprà vidimus;
Largiùs in</hi> Arianae <hi>Haeresis descriptione peccavit vir alioqui diligentissimus.</hi> And
in his instance of the time of <hi>Arius</hi> death it's undeniable. But if in such
famous Histories, we must read him with such suspicion and allowance,
how much more in the many little ones that were more obscure?</p>
               <p>§. 4. As to the <hi>Arians</hi> Heresie, the two Epistles of <hi>Arius</hi> recorded by
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> tell us much of the truth of his mistake: And the <hi>Arians</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by him are at large recorded and answered. He that denyeth the
Deity of Christ, denyeth his Essence: And he that denyeth his Essence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
Christ, and is no Christian. But the <hi>Samosatenians,</hi> the <hi>Photinians,</hi>
and our late <hi>Socinians,</hi> are far more perniciously Heretical than the <hi>Arians.</hi>
For the <hi>Arians</hi> maintained, that <hi>Tres sunt hypostases, Pater, Filius &amp; Spiritus
Sanctus;</hi> and that God did <hi>ante sempiterna tempora unigenitum filium gignere,
per quem &amp; saecula &amp; reliqua procreavit omnia; viz, subsistentem illum suapte
voluntate condidisse, ejusmodi ut neque converti neque mutari possit, perfectam
Dei creaturam, sed non tanquam rerum creatarum aliquam; foetum itidem, sed
non tanquam unum è caeteris.</hi> They thought that before God made the rest of
the creatures, he made one super-angelical perfect Spirit, by which he
made all the rest, and that this is Christ; and that he received no other
soul but a body only at his Incarnation, and this super-angelical spirit was
his soul. This was the dangerous heresie of <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Dion. Petavius</hi> truly telleth us, that his great advantage was,
that many of the Fathers of that Church had spoken in such kind of words
before him, the Controversie being not then well considered: <hi>p. 285. ad

And in his Books, <hi>De Trinit.</hi> he at large citeth the very words of him and
many other Fathers. But he here giveth them this gentle excuse, <hi>Sed ab

that they were saved, without going so far as to say, they <hi>were
without all fault.</hi> For Christianity is the same thing before such Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and after: And it's hard to think how he can be a Christian, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
Christs Essence: But God is merciful, and requireth not knowledge
alike in all, that have not equal means of knowledge. Which charity
must be extended to others as well as to these Fathers. Yet the same <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
cannot endure <hi>Camerarius,</hi> for saying, that <hi>Athanasius,</hi> though a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Champion of the truth, did <hi>sometime indulge his own desires, and mix some
ill with sacred things:</hi> But if he were not at all to be blamed, <hi>Constantine</hi> was
much the more to be blamed for banishing him; And why should not his
honour be of some regard? The truth is, the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Bishops and
People were long more violent and troublesome than others, as not only
<hi>Socrates,</hi> but many other Historians note: And as it was noted with disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> &amp;c. so it can hardly be believed
by them that read the History throughout, that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi>
wanted not something of the humble patience, meekness, and healing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and skill that their Case required: For who is perfect? And how
apt are great Bishops to be too violent against Dissenters, instead of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for never any one did so great mischief to the Church. The badness of
it, was the honour of the</hi> Niccne <hi>Council that suppressed it, as far as in
them lay. But alas, the Remedy seemed quickly conquered by the Disease:
As</hi> Constantine <hi>had work enough to keep Peace among the Bishops in the
Council, by his presence and reproofs; so when the</hi> Arians <hi>profess'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
his peaceableness caused him too far to indulge them; by which
some of them got such interest in his Court, as proved the following Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Church. And it is the sadder to think on, that the two great
Emperours,</hi> Constantius <hi>and</hi> Valens, <hi>that were deceived by them, and drawn
into violent Persecution, are noted to be otherwise none of the worst men.</hi>

               <p>§. 6. As to the other part of the Councils work, the fixing of <hi>Easter</hi>-day,
had not the Bishops been sinfully fierce about it, against each other,
it had never been taken for a Heresie to mistake the time, nor had it been
a work so necessary and great to determine it: seeing as <hi>Socrates, Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
&amp;c. tell us, many Churches differed in this, and matters as great as
this, without condemning or separating from each other: And the <hi>Asians</hi>
erred by the Motive of Tradition, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had long before censured
the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop for his violence in condemning them. And many good
Christians even after the Councils determination, durst not forsake their
old Tradition, nor obey them: Among whom, how long our <hi>Britains</hi>
and the <hi>Scots</hi> stood out, <hi>Beda</hi> telleth us. And though the <hi>Audians,</hi> that
also disobeyed, were called Hereticks, I would all Adversaries to Hereticks
were no worse men.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And because these <hi>Audians</hi> rose about that time, I think it worth
the labour to add the sum of their History out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that the
World may better perceive what spirit the Hereticating Prelates were
then of, and how some called Hereticks were made such, or defamed as
such, and who they were that did divide the Churches and break their
peace.</p>

their Founder arose in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> famous for his integrity of life,
and ardent zeal of Divine Faith. Who oft seeing things ill carried in
the Churches, feared not to their faces to reprove and admonish the Bishops
and Priests, and say, These things should not be so done: You should
not thus Administer: As a Lover of Truth, he used to do such things as
these, which are familiar with men of exquisite honesty, who through
their excellent study of Godliness, use this great liberty of Speech: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he saw things ill carried in the Churches, he sometimes spake
his thoughts, and could not forbear blaming them. As if he saw any of
the Clergy over covetous of Money, be it Bishop or Priest, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them: or if any abounded in luxury and pleasures; or if they
corrupted any part of the Doctrine or Discipline of the Church, he
would not bear with them, but blame them. Which was troublesome to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60852:48"/>
men of a dissolute life: And therefore he underwent the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies,
being exagitated by the hatred and malicious words of them all.
But he being thus tossed about, and beaten and reproached, did bear it
all with an equal mind; and thus long continued in the Communion of
the Church; Till some that were more vehemently offended with him for
these Causes, cast him out: But yet he patiently bore all this, but being
more earnestly intent for the promoting of the Truth, he still studied not
to be drawn away from the Conjunction and Society of the Catholick
Church. But when he and his friends were still beaten, and suffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
usage, groaning under these evils, he took Counsel of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of these calamities and contumelies: And so he separated himself
from the Church, and many falling away with him, a new Divorce was
hereby made. For he did not in any thing depart from the <hi>right faith,</hi>
but he with his partakers held in all things sincere Religion. Though in
one small matter they are too stiff. About the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost they judg excellently, and as the Catholick Church, and swerve not
a jot: and the rest of the order of their Lives is truly most excellent
and admirable; so that not only He himself, but even the Bishops, Priests,
and all the rest of them, live by the labour of their hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed they had a conceit that the Body did partake of the Image of God,
and they thought that to please <hi>Constantine,</hi> the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council had altered
the Custom and Tradition of the Church about <hi>Easter:</hi> But these were not
the causes of their departure from the Church, but the <hi>violence of dissolut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Infidels: But, alas, the remnant of corruption in the best will somewhat
corrupt their conversations. It is a sad note of <hi>Epiphanius, ib.</hi> p. 816. <q>[I

               <p>§. 24. XXXVIII. Another Council at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Iulius</hi> undid what this

               <p>§. 25. XXXIX. <hi>Athanasius</hi> being sent back when <hi>Gregory</hi> was put in his
place, the City being ready to be in an uproar, <hi>Athanasius</hi> retired to <hi>Rome</hi>
(or hid himself) foreseeing it; till fire and blood had proclaimed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
of this Episcopal strife. And Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> called another Council
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to answer the Letters of the Oriental Synod, which charged him
with usurpation and despised him.</p>
               <p>§. 26. XL. <hi>Anno</hi> 344. Another Council was held at <hi>Antioch,</hi> by those
called <hi>Arians</hi> by some, Reconcilers by others, and Orthodox and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
by themselves; in which they renounce <hi>Arius</hi> and his sayings,
but yet leave out the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [of one substance.] This they did
in a new-made Creed; fitted purposely, as they said, to reconcile; as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to deceive: To which end four had been made before, and not
availed.</p>
               <p>§. 27. XLI. A Council at <hi>Milan</hi> examined this Creed, and rejected
it, for leaving out <hi>[of the same substance]</hi> and because the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed
was sufficient.</p>
               <p>§. 28. XLII. The next is called an Universal Council, of 376 Bishops
at <hi>Sardica,</hi> which cleared <hi>Athanasius, Marcellus,</hi> and others. And yet
<hi>Augustine,</hi> and many others, reject this Council. It hath divers good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,

Bishops once took notice that those words were in the Council of
<hi>Sardica;</hi> the Papists answer, 1. That the <hi>Africans</hi> knew not of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
Canons, but had lost them, (though <hi>Gratus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> was
one.) 2. And that the Popes took the Canons of <hi>Sardica</hi> to be but Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations

give no such answer?)</p>
               <p>Bishops are here condemned that remove to any other Church; and
they that are above three days non-resident; and especially they that go
<hi>ad Comitatum,</hi> to the Palaces of Princes or great Prelates; but if they
have just business they are ordered to send it by a Deacon.</p>
               <p>§. 29. XLIII. The Oriental Bishops departing from <hi>Sardica</hi> came to
<hi>Philippopolis,</hi> and gathered a Council by themselves, and condemned those
whom the other had absolved, and others for Communicating with them.<note place="margin">☞</note>
Yet they renounced <hi>Arius,</hi> but also cast out the word [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Persons excommunicated by them were <hi>Athanasius, Osius, Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
Protogenes, Asclepas, Gaudentius, Maximinus, Paulus Const.</hi> and Pope
<hi>Iulius.</hi> They write a circular Epistle, specially sent to <hi>Donatus Carthag.</hi>
in which they so vehemently speak for peace and piety, and lay such
Crimes to the charge of <hi>Athanasius, Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish
the Reader, and confound his judgment, whom to believe. Cruel
Persecution, bloudy Murders, Profaneness, burning a Church, and such
like they charge on <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and say that they offered the Western
Bishops of <hi>Sardica</hi> to send five of their Bishops with six of theirs to the
place where these things were done, and if they prove not true they yield
to be condemned. On <hi>Marcellus</hi> they charge written Heresie (which <hi>Basil,
Chrysostom,</hi> and others believed.) On <hi>Paulus Const.</hi> they charge that he
was guilty of flames and Wars, and that he caused Priests to be drag'd
naked into the Market-place, with the Body of Christ tyed about their
necks; and that before a concourse of people he caused the consecrated
Virgins to be stript naked in the open Streets, unto horrid shame. And
for such Reasons they require all good Christians to abhor their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Thus the Reader is called to grief and shame to hear Bishops
thus odiously reviling each other, and tempting Infidels to take them
all for wicked and utterly unpeaceable men.</p>
               <p>§. 30. XLIV. <hi>An.</hi> 348 or 349. was a Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> (called the
first:) It was gathered against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> whose Bishops pretended to
be the only Catholicks; and their Circumcellions being violent Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
taking from the rich that they thought had wronged any, and
righting the injured, and unjustly doing justice; and resisting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Constans</hi> his Officers, so that they were fain by Souldiers to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them, and cast out <hi>Donatus Carth.</hi> and by gifts reconciled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that followed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60852:51"/>
Many good Canons for Church Order were made by this and most of
the <hi>African</hi> Councils, no Bishops being faithfuller than they. Several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in their Canons shew that their numerous Bishops had Churches of no
more people than our larger Parishes. And Can. 12. of this Council or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
that where the Bishops by Contract divide their several People, one
take not from the other.</p>
               <p>§. 31. XLV. <hi>Anno</hi> 350. A Council at <hi>Milan</hi> received the repentance of
<hi>Vrsatius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> that had accused <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and gave them Letters of
reconciliation.</p>
               <p>§. 32. XLVI. <hi>Constans</hi> constrained <hi>Constantius</hi> to recall <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but
was himself murdered by <hi>Magnentius</hi> before he came thither: But at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
a Council was held in the way, which judged his reception, and wrote
to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to that end.</p>
               <p>§. 33. XLVII. Among the friends of <hi>Athanasius, Euphratas</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Collen</hi> was one, that was sent on a Message into the <hi>East;</hi> where <hi>Stephen</hi> an
<hi>Arian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ant.</hi> got a Whore to go in to him: When she saw an old

and the Popes Legate forced to subscribe it, with other Bishops, and some
banished that refused it.</p>
               <p>§. 37. LI. Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> desired a <hi>General Council,</hi> which the Emperour

Athanasius</hi> his Condemnation <hi>(Vrsatius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> revolting, and again

Council.</p>
               <p>§. 38. LII. The <hi>Semi-Arians</hi> pretending to Universal Concord, thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
by the Emperour and a General Council, <hi>Hilary Pictav.</hi> (a Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Citizen made Bishop) drew some Orthodox Bishops of <hi>France</hi> to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

to one Communion, was present himself; There were above 300 Bishops
out of the <hi>West,</hi> besides all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops: The confusion was so
great, that men knew not who were or were not Hereticks. <hi>Photinus</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Godhead of Christ, the Bishops called <hi>Arian,</hi> desired this Council
to accuse and condemn him, as they did: They drew up two or three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions

and no ancient Scriptural or Symbolical word, was the Cause of all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of the Bishops, and were that left out, all would be healed. This
Council called <hi>Arian,</hi> passed 27 Anathema's against the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians:</hi>
Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> subscribed to it and approved it, as the forcited
words of his Epistle in <hi>Hilary</hi> shew. (And yet many Papists call it a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
Council:) Old <hi>Osius,</hi> that presided at <hi>Nice,</hi> was forced by stripes, to
subscribe to it, and to the condemnation of <hi>Athanasius. [That the Son was in

and that instead of bringing all the Bishops to Concord and one Communion,
the very <hi>Arians,</hi> and the <hi>Semi-Arians,</hi> divided and subdivided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
did summon another General Council at <hi>Nicomedia:</hi> But the City
suddenly perishing, he called the <hi>Western</hi> part to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and the <hi>Eastern</hi>
to <hi>Scleucia,</hi> taking them yet but as one Council. Above 400 Bishops met
at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> who were to determine first Doctrinal and then Personal
Controversies, and then send ten Legates of each part to the Emperor, with
the results: The most were Orthodox, but the <hi>Arian</hi> Legates were better
speakers, and prevailed; so that the Emperour delayed them because of
an Expedition that he had in hand against the Barbarians; In the mean time
some Assembled at <hi>Nice,</hi> and drew up Another Confession: And when
the Legates returned to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Party of Bishops, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
countenance, so far prevailed, as that almost all the Orthodox
subscribed to them. <hi>(Gaudentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ariminum</hi> was murdered by the
Souldiers.) <hi>Binnius</hi> and some others, would have this Council at <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
to be two; the first Orthodox, the second <hi>Arian: Bellarmine</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
called it but one: which was Orthodox in the beginning, but for fear
and complyance fell off at the last.</p>
               <p>§. 42. LV. Whether the Council at <hi>Seleucia</hi> shall be taken for one of it
self, or but for part of that at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> though far distant, I leave to
the Reader. But here the Heterodox Bishops carried all, but so as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
among themselves; One party called <hi>Acacians</hi> were for forbearing the
word <hi>[substance.]</hi> The <hi>Semiarians</hi> condemned both them and the <hi>Arians,</hi>
and were for <hi>[Like substances.]</hi> They excommunicated and deposed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Arians,</hi> who appealed to the Emperour, and craved yet another Synod.
So that the further he went for concord, the further he was from
it, the Bishops dividing and subdividing more and more; and the
Emperours and Bishops, by diversity of Judgment, and by Heresie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
now to the Church what Heathen Persecutors had been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> tells us, that one thing that drew many to subscribe to the
<hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Semiarian</hi> Creeds, was a certain liberty of their own Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Interpretations, which was granted the Orthodox to draw them
in. [Subscribe in your own sence. <hi>q. d.]</hi> And so conditional subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
quieted their Consciences, and when the <hi>Arians</hi> thought they
had the Victory,<note place="margin">☜</note> and had made the rest <hi>Conformists,</hi> it proved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
for they did not in sence and with approbation subscribe.</p>

But though the Filth of the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie justifie all just care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to keep it out, the multitudes of new Creeds, then made by one and

               <p>But having been long in this Citation of <hi>Hilary,</hi> I return to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of what followed these Councils and Creeds aforesaid.</p>
               <p>§. 43. LVI. In the mean time <hi>Constantius</hi> calleth a Council of 50 Bishops
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where <hi>Aetius</hi> was condemned, and a ninth Creed since
the <hi>Nicene</hi> formed, which excluded both the word <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>hypostasis</hi>
or <hi>subsistence.</hi> The <hi>Semi-Arians</hi> detesting this, condemned and banished
the Authors. But another Form sent from <hi>Ariminum</hi> was preferred, and
imposed to be subscribed on all the Bishops of East and West.</p>
               <p>§. 44. LVII. <hi>An. 360. Meletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> being put in by the
<hi>Acacians</hi> proved Orthodox contrary to their expectation: And being
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60852:54"/>
preaching for the Trinity his Archdeacon stopt his Mouth, and he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Fingers, holding forth <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Three:</hi> And for this was ejected,
contrary to some former Covenants. Wherefore they were fain to call
a Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> to justifie his ejection. Here they made yet another
Creed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the worst of all before it.</p>

Here besides the receiving of those that unwillingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to the
<hi>Arians,</hi> divers new Controversies are judged. 1. <hi>Eunemius, Macedonius,</hi>
and the <hi>Semiarians</hi> denyed the Godhead of the Holy Ghost, which was
here asserted. 2. <hi>Apollinaris</hi> thought that Christ took but a Body at his
Incarnation, his Divine Nature being instead of a Soul, which was here
condemned. 3. The Orthodox <hi>Greek:</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> could not agree by
what name to distinguish the Trinity: The <hi>Greeks</hi> said there were <hi>three
hypostases,</hi> which the <hi>Latines</hi> rejected, as signifying three <hi>substances: Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
himself could not away with the word <hi>Hypostasis.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi> used
the word <hi>[Person.]</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> rejected that as signifying no <hi>real distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
(and are the Schoolmen for a real distinction yet?) For they
thought <hi>Persona</hi> signified but the <hi>relation</hi> of one in Authority or Office.
And thus while as <hi>Ierome</hi> said, <hi>Tota Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

inter hypostasin &amp; usiam ignorabat (Ep.</hi> 57.) and the sense of the word
<hi>[Person]</hi> was not well determined, the danger was so great of further
dissention among the Orthodox Bishops themselves, that as <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi>
saith <hi>(de laud. Athanas.) The matter came to that pass, that there was present
danger, that together with these syllables the ends of the World</hi> (East and West)
<hi>should have been torn from each other, and broken into parts.</hi> But the Synod
agreed that the Greek <hi>hypostasis</hi> and the Latine <hi>Persona</hi> should henceforth
be taken as of the same signification. (But what that signification is, it was
not so easie to tell.) Yet (saith <hi>Binnius) Augustine de Trinit. l. 5. c.</hi> 8, 9.
and the <hi>Latines</hi> afterwards, were displeased with this reconciliation, and
<hi>Hierome</hi> himself, who yet obtain'd of <hi>Damasus, Ep.</hi> 57. that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
being but of a Controversie <hi>de nomine,</hi> might be admitted.</p>

the <hi>Arians,</hi> and other Hereticks.</p>
               <p>§ 48. LXI. A Council also was called at <hi>Antioch</hi> on this occasion.
The <hi>Semiarians</hi> petitioned <hi>Iovianus</hi> that the <hi>Acacians,</hi> as Hereticks, might
be put out, and they put in their places: The Emperour gave them no
other Answer, but that <hi>he hated contention, but would love and honour those
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60852:54"/>
that were for concord:</hi> They feeling his pulse, got <hi>Meletius</hi> to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they seemed very sound, and twenty seven <hi>Arian</hi>
Bishops without any stop subscribed the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed: So basely did these

who received him upon his professed resolution for Peace, which he would

               <p>§. 53. LXVI. The Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> (unhappily taken in to <hi>Valentinian)</hi>

Wife, was baptized by <hi>Eudoxius Constant.</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop; who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
him to promote the <hi>Arian</hi> Cause; which he did with a blind
religious zeal, persecuting not only the Orthodox and <hi>Novatians,</hi> but
also the <hi>Semiarians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians.</hi> And a Council of Bishops in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
rejected <hi>[Consubstantial,]</hi> and restored the <hi>Antiochian</hi> and <hi>Seleucian</hi>
Creed as the best.</p>

the <hi>Semiarian</hi> Bishop to consent, but prevailed not.</p>
               <p>§. 55. LXVIII. Two Councils were held at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Damasus;</hi> one

with himself: For when <hi>Damasus</hi> was chosen, the people were
divided, and <hi>Damasus</hi> his Party being the more valiant Warriors, they
fought it out in the Church, and left one day an hundred thirty seven
dead Bodies behind them, to shew that they had no Communion with
them. And because <hi>Sisinius</hi> and his Party still kept Conventicles, he
was banished, and many with him, and now again condemned.</p>

<hi>Arian, Euzoius:</hi> They ended the Schism, by agreeing that <hi>Meletius</hi> and

should succeed him; the Presbyters being sworn not to accept it while
one of them lived. But <hi>Meletius</hi> dying first, <hi>Flavianus</hi> a Presbyter was
said to break his Oath, and was chosen in his stead, while <hi>Paulinus</hi> (an

               <p>§. 1. THe reason why the <hi>West</hi> with <hi>Rome</hi> was freer from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Heresie than the <hi>East,</hi> was not, as the Papists say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> that his Faith might not fail,
but because the Emperours of the <hi>West</hi> were Orthodox,
while those in the <hi>East</hi> were <hi>Arians:</hi> And the Bishops much followed the
Emperours Will. That this last was the Cause, is notorious in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
That Christs foresaid promise was not the Cause, is certain. Because
whatever promise Christ maketh, he fulfilleth: But he hath not kept all
the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> from failing in their Faith: Therefore he never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
so to do. The <hi>minor</hi> is certain by History: To pass by <hi>Marcellinus</hi>

wicked men whom Councils deposed as Infidels, or Hereticks, Simoniacks,

and <hi>Genebrard</hi> stigmatize as Apostatical, and not Apostolical, (50 to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
had not this promise fulfilled: Nor <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> if <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
judged truly, that he was damned: For it was not <hi>a dead faith,</hi> but a <hi>saving
faith,</hi> which Christ promised <hi>Peter</hi> should not fail; such a saith as had the
promise of life; <hi>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: Whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life: a faith that worketh by
love:</hi> Else <hi>Peter</hi> might have been a wicked man, and damned, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this Prayer of Christ, and Promise. If the faith of <hi>Constantine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
&amp; junior, Constans, Valentinian, Theodosius, Honorius, Gratian, &amp;c.</hi>
had failed, the General Councils at <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Ariminum,</hi> tell us, how

in the <hi>East:</hi> At <hi>Antioch</hi> he vexed those that would not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with <hi>Euzoius</hi> the allowed <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop: At <hi>Cyzicum Eunomius</hi> was
put in <hi>Eleusius</hi> place; but his followers built them a separate Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Walls. <hi>(Socrat. lib. 4. c.</hi> 6, 7.) He Persecuted the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and
exiled <hi>Agelius</hi> their Bishop at <hi>Const.</hi> He banished <hi>Eustathius Antioch.</hi> and
<hi>Evagrius,</hi> chosen by the Orthodox Bishop of <hi>Const.</hi> against <hi>Demophilus</hi> the

in a Ship there set on fire, and were both burnt and drowned together.
<hi>(Socr. l. 4. c.</hi> 13.) In all the <hi>East</hi> he deposed, abused, murdered many that
would not for sake the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. He set his Officers to suppress their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60852:56"/>
Conventicles. At <hi>Alexandria</hi> he imprisoned <hi>Peter</hi> that succeeded <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
and banished his Presbyters, and set up <hi>Lucius</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop. He
persecuted the Monks of the Wilderness of <hi>Egypt (Nitria</hi> and <hi>Scitis)</hi> and
destroyed their Houses: Banished <hi>Macarius</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Macarius</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
their Leaders. He persecuted <hi>Basil</hi> at <hi>Caesarea:</hi> He went in person
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> to disturb and scatter the Conventicles of the Orthodox; And
when he had banished one of their Bishops <hi>(Meletius,</hi> enduring <hi>Paulinus)</hi>
the Presbyters kept the Meeting: when he drove them away, a Deacon
kept it up: At last <hi>Themistius,</hi> a Philosopher, made an Oration before
him, bidding him not marvel that the Christians had such differences, for
they were nothing to those of the Philosophers, who were of three hundred
different Opinions; and that God would be honoured even under diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Opinions: This somewhat asswaged him; and shortly after in the <hi>50th</hi>
year of his age, he was slain.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Gratian</hi> (and <hi>Valentinian junior)</hi> coming to the Empire, Liberty
of Conscience and Restoration was given to all Sects, except the <hi>Eunomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Photinians,</hi> and <hi>Manichees (Socrat. l. 5. c.</hi> 2.) He took <hi>Theodosius</hi> into
the Empire with him: And so the Orthodox Party got up again: and the
<hi>Arians</hi> after this went every where down, save among the <hi>Goths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. LXXI. <hi>Theodosius</hi> called a General Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
where the chief things done, were, 1. the setting up of <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene</hi>
as Bishop, 2. The condemning of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> 3. The giving of
the second Patriarchate to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> because it was the Imperial Seat;
putting under him the Diocesses of <hi>Pontu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Heraclea</hi> and <hi>Asia:</hi> 4. The
putting down of <hi>Nazianzene</hi> again, and putting <hi>Nectarius</hi> in his stead. 5. The
setling <hi>Flavianus</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. Some would perswade us that it was two Councils and not one that
did these things: But the question is but <hi>de nomine.</hi> In the beginning they
dispatch'd part of their work; and before they departed <hi>Meletius</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Antioch</hi> dying, the Bishops returned to Council, and more <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Bishops came and did the rest.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The Case of <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> was thus: A Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> in the
reign of <hi>Arianisme,</hi> sent him, with three more able speakers to go
visit the Churches, and draw them from <hi>Arianisme.</hi> He came to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and an <hi>Arian</hi> being in possession, he got into a little empty Church,
and there so long Preached, till he had recovered much of the City from
<hi>Arianisme.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Peter,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> signified by Letters, that
he would have him be Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> (against the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop:)
The Orthodox Party chose him: One <hi>Maximus,</hi> that of a Philosopher
turned Christian, and insinuated into <hi>Gregories</hi> familiarity; by money first,
and threats after, gets <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops, to
make him Bishop of <hi>Constant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> supposing <hi>Gregory</hi> not yet lawfully settled:
<hi>Meletius Antioch:</hi> being at <hi>Const.</hi> Ordaineth <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop. The Council,
when Convened, Confirm him, and cast out <hi>Maximus</hi> (that never had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:)
<hi>Theodosius</hi> owneth <hi>Gregory,</hi> and putteth out the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60852:56"/>
possesseth him of the Great Church. The <hi>Antiochian</hi> Controversie falling
in at the death of <hi>Meletius, Gregory</hi> was against <hi>Flavian;</hi> The <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Bishops being for him, set against <hi>Gregory,</hi> and resolved to cast him out
and choose another: He seeing their resolution, and offended at their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
carriage in the Council, resigneth to the Emperour, and departeth:
some make it, as if his resignation was unconstrained; but his own words
shew, that he did it but to prevent the deposition which they resolved on: Else
he durst not have deserted his Flock that lamented his departure. In his
place they chose <hi>Nectarius</hi> a Pretor, that was no Christian, <hi>in foro Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi>
as being not yet baptized; and so was indeed uncapable, and the choice
null: But the man was honest; And <hi>Nicephorus</hi> saith, that they put down
his name in a Paper with others, leaving it to the Emperour to chuse one
of them, and that he chose <hi>Nectarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. The description of this Council, and the good Bishops of his
time, by <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> in his Poems and his Orations, is very doleful; How
implacably factious and contentious they were, how fierce and violent,
leaping and carrying themselves in the Council like mad-men. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
the People as contentious, but yet <hi>endued with the love of God,</hi>
though <hi>their zeal wanted</hi> knowledg: <hi>Page 528. Orat.</hi> 32. <q>The Courtiers,
he saith, whether true to the Emperour he knew not, but for the most
part perfidious to God: And the Bishops as sitting on adverse thrones
and feeding adverse opposite Flocks, drawn by them into factions, like
the clefts that earth-quakes make, and the pestilent diseases that
infect all about, and distracting and dividing all the World, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               </q>
               <p>Are not these lamentable descriptions of the Bishops of those happy
times, and excellent Councils: Even in the days of good <hi>Theodosius;</hi> when
the Church recovered from under <hi>Arianisme,</hi> and came newly out of the
fire of Persecution? The truth is, All times have had some few such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
persons as <hi>Nazianzene, Basil, Chrysostome, &amp;c.</hi> But they have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
been born down by the violent stream of a more ignorant, selfish,
worldly sort of men.</p>
               <p>All this here cited out of <hi>Gregory,</hi> is much less than he saith in his last
Oration, <hi>De Episcopis,</hi> Vol. 2. too large and sharp to be now recited:
Therefore I leave it to the perusal of the Learned Reader.</p>
               <p>One Papist saith to me, that it was the <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bishops that
<hi>Gregory</hi> meant: But the whole tenor of his writing speaketh the contrary;
and that he spake of this first Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> one of the four
which is equalled to the four Evangelists: And in his <hi>59th</hi> Epist. to <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Page</hi> 816. he saith, <hi>Si eos inveneritis non ob fidei doctrinam, sed ob pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatas
simultates inter se distractos &amp; divulsos, quod quidem ipse observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>But some may say that passion moved him to the satyrical exaggerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his own received injuries: But, 1. He speaketh not of this Council
only, but of others also: 2. He acknowledged, that till the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
came, he had the Council Vote for his place. 3. His spirit and all
his endeavours were for peace, and not to make things worse than they
were; And for peace he quit his Seat. 4. And in his Epistles to the
Civil Magistrates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e afterwards wrote earnestly to them to keep the Bishops
at the next Council in peace, lest they should make Religion a contempt
and scandal. So that few men could worse be charged with abusive invectives
than this Pious, Learned, peaceable Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60852:57"/>
§. 8. In his <hi>55th</hi> Epist. to <hi>Procopius, page</hi> 814. refusing to come to their
Council, he saith, <q>If I must write the very truth, I am of the mind to fly
from (or avoid) every Meeting of Bishops: For I never saw a joyful and
happy end of any Council; nor any that gave not more addition and
increase to evils, than depulsion (or reformation:) For pertinacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and the lusts of Domination (or Lording,) (Think me not
(saith he) grievous and troublesome for writing this,) are such, as no
words can express: And a man that will (there) be a Judg of others, shall
sooner contract dishonesty himself, than repress the dishonesty of others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They that say he speaketh only of Heretical Councils defie the light, and
will be believed by none that know the History.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Case of <hi>Antioch,</hi> briefly, was this: <hi>Meletius</hi> was a good
man, but of a healing disposition, made Bishop by the <hi>Arians</hi> mistaking
him, and put out by them when they knew him, yet he held Communion
with repenting <hi>Arians. Euzoius</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> was put into his place, and he
kept Conventicles. The grand Controversie of all the foregoing Ages,
was about Communion with the Lapsed, that yielded to Idolatry, or Heresie:
some over zealous were too proud of their own sufferings, and were very
rigid against receiving such Penitents, saying they were Time servers, and
receiving them would encourage others to save themselves in suffering,
and then repent. Others were too wide in receiving them upon unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
professions of Repentance: The Wisest went a middle way. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Antiochians</hi> separated from <hi>Meletius,</hi> because the <hi>Arians</hi> chose him, and
he received penitent <hi>Arians:</hi> And <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellensis</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> going to settle the Peace at <hi>Antioch, Eusebius</hi> disliked
their opposition to <hi>Meletius,</hi> and left them. <hi>Lucifer</hi> a good Man, but rigid
and hot against the <hi>Arians,</hi> said that <hi>Meletius</hi> could be no Bishop, and
ordained them <hi>Paulinus</hi> (and so there were three as is aforementioned.) The
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> who would have a singer in all, encouraged <hi>Lucifer; Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
was a man of extraordinary goodness: but yet the Canon nullified the
Ordination of a Bishop into a fore possessed Seat; And when half cleaved
to <hi>Meletius,</hi> and half to <hi>Paulinus</hi> (both very good Men,) a Synod (as is
aforesaid) ended the difference, by tolerating both till the death of one,
and then making him sole Bishop: The <hi>Presbyters</hi> (it's said) were sworn
to this. <hi>Meletius</hi> dyeth first; yet <hi>Flavianus</hi> a Presbyter that had stuck
to them in <hi>Valens</hi> Persecution, is chosen Bishop by the <hi>Meletians,</hi> who
will not joyn with <hi>Paulinus</hi> as a Schismatick. The Pope owneth
<hi>Paulinus:</hi> The Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> own <hi>Meletius</hi> first, and <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
after: <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> and others were against <hi>Flavianus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they said he came in by Perjury, having sworn not to accept it:
Some say he did not Swear. <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> that Ordained <hi>Paulinus,</hi>
forsook the Party called the Catholick Church, and gathered separated
Churches, and became the Head of a Schism, called since <hi>Luciferian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>
meerly because the Churches received the confessing returning
<hi>Arians</hi> to Communion, and he owned <hi>Elavianus.</hi> And thus even good
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60852:58"/>
Bishops could not agree, nor scape the imputation of Heresie.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Baronius <hi>and</hi> Binnius <hi>after him, say,</hi> Nazianzenus hunc discordiam

               <p>§. 11. This Council added to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed some words about the
Holy Ghost. The advancement of the <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Bishop by this
Synod with the reasons of it, bred such a jealousie in the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as hath broken the Churches of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> which are unhealed to
this day.</p>
               <p>§. 12. LXXII. Two Bishops, <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Secundianus,</hi> complained to
<hi>Gratian,</hi> that they were unjustly judged <hi>Arians,</hi> and desired a Council to
try them. <hi>Ambrose</hi> perswaded him not to trouble all the World for two
Men. A Council of 32 Bishops is called for them at <hi>Aquileia.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to be accountable to so few, and are condemned.</p>
               <p>§. 13. LXXIII. <hi>An.</hi> 381. Twelve Bishops met at <hi>Caesaraugusta</hi> against
the <hi>Priscillianists:</hi> These Men had divers other Councils in those times.
<hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> were the Leaders. The whole Story you may find in
<hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Martin, &amp;c.</hi> The sum is this: <hi>Priscillianus,</hi>
a rich Man, of much Wit and learning, was infected with the Heresie
of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> and <hi>Manichees.</hi> Many followed him; his party was much
in Fasting and Reading: The Bishops in Council excommunicated them.
Yet they kept up. The Bishops in Council sought to the Emperour <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
to suppress them by the Sword: A while they prevailed: But the
<hi>Priscillianists</hi> quickly learned that way, and got a great Courtier to be
their Friend, and <hi>Gratian</hi> restored them. <hi>Gratian</hi> being killed, when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi>
was chosen Emperour by his Army, the Bishops go to <hi>Maximus</hi> for
help: The <hi>Arians</hi> having got Head against <hi>Ambrose</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> and these
Sectaries troubling the Churches in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy, Maximus</hi> (a
Man highly commended for Piety by most Writers, saw that being forced
by his Army to accept the Empire, he was a Usurper) being once engaged,
thought the defence of the Orthodox would strengthen him: So he forced
<hi>Valentinian</hi> by Threats to forbear wronging <hi>Ambrose;</hi> And to please the
Bishops he put <hi>Priscillian</hi> to death, and banished some of his Followers.
<hi>Martin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tome</hi> (being a Man of small learning, but of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and austerity of Life, living like a Hermite in the poorest Garb and
Cabbin, lying on the Ground, faring hard, praying much, and working
more Miracles, if <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> his Schollar and Acquaintance may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
than we read of any since the Apostles, even than <hi>Gregory Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus)</hi>
did abhor drawing the Sword against Hereticks, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60852:58"/>
the Bishops and Emperour but in vain: The prosecution was so
managed by the Bishops, that in the Countreys, those that did but Fast
and Read much were brought under the suspicion of <hi>Priscillianism,</hi> and
reproached: This common injury to Piety from the Bishops grieved <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
yet more, so that he renounced the Communion of the Bishops and
their Synods: whereupon they defamed him to the Emperour and People,
as an unlearned Man, a Schismatick, suspected of favouring <hi>Priscillianism!</hi>
But <hi>Martins</hi> holiness and Miracles magnified him with the Religious sort.
At last a great <hi>Priscillianist</hi> being sentenced to death, <hi>Martin</hi> travelled
to the Emperour <hi>Maximus</hi> to beg his Life. <hi>Maximus</hi> told him, he would
grant his desire if he would but once communicate with the Bishops: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
preferring Mercy before sacrifice, yielded, and did once communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with them. But professed that in his way home, an Angel corrected
him and threatned him if he did so any more: and that from that time
his gift of Miracles was diminished: and so he never communicated
with them more to the Death: <hi>Sulpitius</hi> his Narrative puts the Reader
to a great difficulty, either to believe so many and great Miracles as he
reports, or not to believe so learned, pious, and credible an Historian,
who professeth to say nothing but what he either saw himself or had from
the Mouth of <hi>Martin,</hi> or those that saw them, and who speaketh his own
knowledg of his eximious Piety. He speaketh hardly of the Bishops, not
only as complying with an Usurper, but that <hi>Ithacius</hi> in particular of his
knowledge, was one that much cared not what he said or did The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
would have denied that the death of <hi>Priscillian</hi> was by their means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Is it not strange that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should Canonize <hi>Martin</hi> for a
Saint, believing his great Miracles, and yet themselves go an hundred
times further against the blood of Dissenters, than the Bishops did whom
Saint <hi>Martin</hi> therefore opposed and separated from to the death?</p>
               <p>The Churches in <hi>Spain,</hi> and elsewhere, were disturbed and scattered or
endangered by Souldiers to please these Bishops, not (as some forge) that
<hi>Maximus</hi> did persecute the Christians for the Prey: For most Writers

his Usurpation, though he said, the Souldiers in <hi>Britain</hi> forced him
to it.</p>

met at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Here <hi>Damasus</hi> owned <hi>Paulinus</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as the

               <p>Is it not strange that Papists blush not to recite such a History with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
which expresseth a testimony from Heaven against far less

sheweth such a Divine justification for separation from the Bishops and

               <p>§. 20. LXXIX. The two Bishops continuing at <hi>Antioch, Evagrius</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>Paulinus,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> owning him, and the <hi>East Flavianus,</hi> a Council

being all good Christians, should live in loving Communion.
(O that others had been as wise, in not believing those Prelates that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the World that it is so pernicious a thing for two Churches and
Bishops to be in one City, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are said to be at <hi>Rome!)</hi> And
they referred the Case to <hi>Theophilus Alex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 21. But this Council condemned a new Heresie (Hereticating was in
fashion;) <hi>viz.</hi> of one Bishop <hi>Bonosus,</hi> denying <hi>Mary</hi> to have continued a
Virgin to the death. And they condemned Re-baptizing and Re-ordaining,
and the Translation of Bishops.</p>
               <p>§. 22. LXXX. Next comes a Provincial Council (or two) at <hi>Arles,</hi>
which doth but repeat some former Canons.</p>
               <p>§. 23. LXXXI. Next we have a strange thing, a Heresie raised by one
that was no Bishop: But the best is, it was but a very little Heresie: <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60852:59"/>
is the describer of it, who writing against the Author, <hi>Iovinian</hi> a
<hi>Milan</hi> Monk, no doubt according to his sharpness, makes the worst of it:
At the worst it containeth all these: 1. <hi>That Virgins, Widows and Marryed
Women, being all baptized</hi> (or washed) <hi>in Christ, and not differing in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
works, are of equal merits.</hi> 2. That those that <hi>plenâ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

difference of merit between <hi>abstaining from meat, and receiving it with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
4. That there's one Reward in Heaven for all that keep their baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
vow. Siricius</hi> catching <hi>Iovinian</hi> hid at <hi>Rome,</hi> sends him to <hi>Milan,</hi> where
a Council Hereticateth him.</p>
               <p>§. 24. LXXXII. It's strange that <hi>Binnius</hi> vouchsafeth next to add out
of <hi>Socrates, l. 5. c.</hi> 20. (when he Hereticateth him also) a Council of the
<hi>Novatians; Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> are called <hi>Novatians,</hi> by the Papists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they rail not at them so valiantly as the Hereticators do; And it
may be they will call me one, if I say that I better like this Councils Canon,
than burning men for such a Heresie. They decree that as from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
the different time of keeping <hi>Easter</hi> was not taken for sufficient cause
for Christians to renounce Communion with each other, so it should be
esteemed still, and it should be so far left indifferent, that they live in love
and Communion that are herein of different minds.<note place="margin">☜</note> And I would say, as
lowd as I can speak, <hi>If all the proud, contentious, ambitious, hereticating part
of the Bishops had been of this Christian mind, O what sin, what scandal and
shame, what cruelties, confusions and miseries had the Christian world escaped!</hi>
But yet men will scorn to be so far <hi>Novatians,</hi> in despight of Scripture,
reason, humanity and experience, whatever sin or misery follow: (As I
said before) in <hi>England</hi> the Convocation and Parliaments oversight hath
determined of a false rule to know <hi>Easter</hi>-day, and silenceth Ministers for
not Assenting, Consenting to it, and approving the Use of it, even the
Use which consisteth in keeping <hi>Easter</hi> at a wrong time, which makes us
Hereticks.</p>
               <p>§. 25. LXXXIII. <hi>An.</hi> 393. A great Council was called at <hi>Hippo,</hi> where
<hi>Austin,</hi> yet a Presbyter was there. Good men will do well: Here was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but pious and honest, for reformation of Discipline and Manners;
And most of the <hi>African</hi> Councils were the best in all the world. Their
Bishopricks were but like our Parishes, and they strove not who should be
greatest, or domineer.</p>

               <p>§. 28. LXXXVI. <hi>An.</hi> 394. A Council of <hi>Donatists</hi> was held at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernae,</hi>
about a schism between two men set up for Bishops against each
other.</p>
               <p>§. 29. LXXXVII. At <hi>Bagai</hi> another Council was called by the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
for the same Cause, where <hi>Primianus Carthag.</hi> having 310. Bishops,
condemned <hi>Maximianus</hi> his Competitor, absent. Note here, 1. How
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60852:60"/>
great a number the <hi>Donatists</hi> were, and on what pretence (as over-voting
them) they called others Hereticks and Schismaticks. 2. How small Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
then were, the number tells us.</p>
               <p>§. 30. LXXXVIII. A Synod was held at <hi>Taurinum</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> where a
difference was decided between the Bishops of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Vienne,</hi> striving
which should be greatest: And he was judged to be the greatest, whose seat
was proved to be the <hi>Metropolitan:</hi> And a case of Communicating with one
<hi>Foelix</hi> a Partner of <hi>Ithacius</hi> and the bloody Bishops was debated.</p>
               <p>§. 31. LXXXIX. Another <hi>Carthage</hi> Council called the second, which
<hi>Binnius</hi> saith, was the last, is placed next; which decreed several Church
Orders, some of which shew, that a Bishops Diocess had then but <hi>unum</hi>
altare;<note place="margin">☞</note> As when reconciliation of Penitents, (as well as Chrisme, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
Virgins) was to be done by the Bishop only, except in great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
And when Christians were multiplyed, they that desired a Bishop
in a place, that had none before, might have one. And the prohibition
<hi>erigendi aliud altare,</hi> &amp;c. was repeated.</p>
               <p>§. 32. XC. Another <hi>Carthage</hi> Council called the third, hath many good
Orders: One is Can. 26. <q>That the Bishop of the first Seat, shall not be
called the Chief Priest (or Bishop) or any such thing, but only the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of the first Seat. To avoid all ambitious designs of superiority:</q>
Whence <hi>Binnius</hi> elsewhere noteth, that <hi>Carthage</hi> had not an Archbishop.
No doubt they had a sense of the sin and misery, that came by the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
and other ambitious strifes.</p>
               <p>§. 33. XCI. Another <hi>Carthage</hi> Council hath the like Canons, adding
to this aforesaid, as <hi>Gratian</hi> citeth it, <hi>[Vniversalis autem nec etiam</hi> Romanus
<hi>Pontifex appelletur.]</hi> To which <hi>Binnius</hi> hath no better an answer than,
1. That it is only swelling titles, and not the superiour power that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
2. That the <hi>Africans</hi> had no power to make Laws for <hi>Rome;</hi> But,
1. Sure the Name is Lawful, if the Power be Lawful. 2. They that could
make no Laws for <hi>Rome,</hi> might declare their Judgment of Gods Laws, and
that <hi>Rome</hi> might make no Laws for them. This Council also forbiddeth
going beyond Sea with Appeals.</p>
               <p>§. 34 XCII. The next <hi>Carthage</hi> Council hath 104 Canons for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
most very good. Divers Canons lay so much on the Bishop, as
plainly shew each Bishop had but One Altar. <hi>Can.</hi> 14. <q>That the Bishops
Cottage be not far from the Church:<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 15. That the Bishop have but
vile or cheap houshold stuff, and a poor table and diet; and seek his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
or dignity by his faith and desert of life. 16. The Bishop must
not read the Gentiles Books; 19. Nor contend for transitory things,
though provoked. 20. Nor take on him the care of Family (or common)
business, but only be vacant to the Word and Prayer. 23. The Bishop
shall hear no Cause but in the presence of his Presbyters; else it shall be
void that is sentenced without them, unless confirmed by their presence.
28. The unjust condemnation of Bishops is void. 30. And judgments
against the absent. 35. The Bishop to sit higher than the Presbyters at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60852:60"/>
Church and their Meetings, but at home know that they are his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues.
51. A Clerk how Learned soever in Gods Word, must get his
living by a trade. 52. That is, by a trade or husbandry, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
to his Office. 53. All Clerks that are able to work, should learn
both trades and Letters. 55. The Bishop must not admit an accuser of
the brethren to Communion; Nor to enter into the Clergy, though he
amend. Many against Clergy-men that are flatterers, betrayers, foul-tongued,
quarrellers, at discord, scurrilous, of filthy jeasts, that swear
by creatures, that sing at feasts, of former scandal, &amp;c. 83. The poor
and the aged of the Church to be honoured before the rest. 88. He that

Church-assembly, let him be Excommunicate. 98. A Lay-man must not
teach when the Clergy are present, unless they bid him. 100. A woman
must not baptize.</q>

               <p>§. 35. XCIII. <hi>An.</hi> 398. Another Council was at <hi>Carthage</hi> of 73. Bishops
for Discipline.</p>
               <p>§. 36. XCIV. <hi>An. 399. Theophilus</hi> held a Synod at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> against
a dead man, <hi>Origen.</hi> The occasion <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binnius</hi> thus deliver: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi>
a Woman of greatest Nobility in <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> Pesecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hid five thousand Monks, and a while susteined them, and when
they were banished, with great zeal, followed them to maintain them out
of her substance (or estate:) When they were restored from banishment,
she built for her self a Monastery at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in which, besides fifty Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
that dwelt with her, she entertained and maintained holy Foreign
Bishops, Monks, and Virgins, twenty seven years: Whereby it happened
that both she and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> were by <hi>Didymus Alexandrinus,</hi> (a man blind,
but of great learning and fame, too great an admirer of <hi>Origen</hi>'s works) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
(as their accusers said) in <hi>Origen</hi>'s errours, and received and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged
his Book, called <hi>Periarchon:</hi> After 25 years absence in <hi>Egypt</hi> and
<hi>Palestine,</hi> returning to <hi>Rome</hi> with great fame of Holiness, and bringing with
them a piece of the Cross, they with fraud bring to <hi>Rome Origen</hi>'s <hi>Periar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon,</hi>
(that is, Translated and Corrected by <hi>Ruffinus.)</hi> Another Woman,
<hi>Marcella,</hi> accuseth them of <hi>Origen</hi>'s errours, which they deny, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Communicatory Letters from Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> forsake <hi>Rome,</hi> (where such
Merits and Holiness would not procure an aged Lady a quiet habitation,
without being Hereticated, because she highly valued <hi>Origen</hi>'s Works, which
had divers errours; and who hath not?) Hereupon <hi>Pamachius,</hi> and <hi>Ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
write to <hi>Hierome</hi> to publish <hi>Origen</hi>'s <hi>Periarchon</hi> entire, and detect his
errours; which he did, shewing that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had mended some, and left
others unmended: This occasioned stirs against <hi>Hierome,</hi> and a Council
call'd at <hi>Alexandria, an.</hi> 399. where <hi>Origen</hi> is condemned. <hi>Theophilus</hi> by
his Legates expells <hi>Origen</hi>'s followers out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Palestine:</hi> Being
expelled they go to <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and complain of <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
as persecuting them that were innocent Catholicks, and desired his help:
He undertaketh to reconcile them to <hi>Theophilus: Epiphanius</hi> followeth them
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60852:61"/>
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and requireth <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to Excommunicate them and
Expel them; <hi>Chrysostome</hi> durst not do it, against people professing truth
and piety, without a Synod: Whereupon <hi>Epiphanius</hi> irregularly accuseth
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and publickly inveyeth against him in his own Church; of the
process of which, more anon.</p>
               <p>§. 37. For the better understanding of these matters, I will insert some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> because he is a most credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Historian, and saith, they were things done in his own days. <hi>Theophilus</hi>
was noted for a Lordly Prelate; <hi>Isidore Pelusiota</hi> saith more: When <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
was to be Ordained Bishop of <hi>Constantinople, Theophilus</hi> refused to
Ordain him, because he would have preferred to it, one <hi>Isidore,</hi> a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
of his own; But <hi>Eutropius,</hi> a Courtier, having got Articles against
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> shewed them to him, and bid him choose, whether he would Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> Bishop, or stand at the Bar and answer those crimes: <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
was so afraid at this, that he presently Consecrated <hi>Chrysostome:
Socr. l. 6. c.</hi> 2. But presently after began busily to devise how he might work
him mischief, which he practised privately by Word, and by his Letters
into foreign Countries: But was vexed that his malicious practices had
not better success, for he thought to bring in this <hi>Isidore (cap. 5.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 38. One of the Articles against <hi>Theophilus</hi> was this: When <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
was going to fight against <hi>Maximus</hi> the Tyrant, <hi>Theophilus</hi> sent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
by this <hi>Isidore</hi> to the Emperour, with two Letters, charging him to
give the presents and one of the Letters to him that should have the upper-hand.
<hi>Isidore</hi> got him to <hi>Rome,</hi> to hearken after the Victory: But his Reader
that kept him company, stole away his Letters: Whereupon <hi>Isidore</hi> in a
fright took his heels presently to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 39. Another thing to be fore-known to this story is in <hi>Socrat. l. 6. c.</hi> 7.
The schisme of the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> now rose from <hi>Egypt:</hi> some of the
more unlearned thought that God had a body and the shape of a man, but
<hi>Theophilus</hi> (and the Judicious) condemned them, and inveighed against
them, proving that God had not a body. The Religious of <hi>Egypt</hi> hearing
this, flocking in blind zeal to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> condemned <hi>Theophil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> for a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man, and sought to take away his life: <hi>Theophilus</hi> very pensive, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
how to save his life: He came to them courteously, and said, <hi>When I
fasten mine eyes on you, methinks I see the face of God.</hi> These words allayed
the heat of the Monks; who said, <hi>If that be true that thou sayest, that the
face of God is like ours, then curse the Works of</hi> Origen <hi>which deny it: If thou
deny this, be sure thou shalt receive at our hands the punishment due to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and open enemies of God:</hi> O brave disputing! Were these mortified
Monks? <hi>Theophilus</hi> told them, he would do what they would, for he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Books of <hi>Origen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which ripened the mischief was, that the Religious Houses of
<hi>Egypt</hi> having four brothers, excellent men, for their overseers, <hi>Theophilus</hi> was
restless till he got them away to him; one of them, <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> he made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
others living with him perceived <hi>that he was set upon heaping and hoarding
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60852:61"/>
money, and that all his labour tended to gathering,</hi> [Dr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> translating
this, puts in the Margin, <hi>This Bishop hath more fellows in the World.</hi> And
noting how <hi>Theophilus</hi> to revenge himself persecuted his own Opinions,
saith, <hi>This is a sin against the Holy Ghost.]</hi> would dwell with him no longer,
but returned to their Wilderness. <hi>Theophilus</hi> prone to anger and revenge,
endeavoured by all means to work them mischief; And the way he took
was to accuse them to the Monks, for saying to him, that God <hi>had not a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
nor <hi>humane shape:</hi> And he himself was of the same Opinion, yet to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of his Enemies, he stuck not to oppugn it; and sent to the Monks, not
to obey <hi>Dioscorus</hi> or his Brethren, for they held that God had <hi>no body,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Scripture saith, that he hath <hi>eyes, ears, hands and feet, as men have;</hi> which
with <hi>Origen</hi> they deny: By this treachery he set them all together by the

so it turned to bickering among the Monks, yea, to a deadly
battel: And <hi>Theophilus</hi> went with Armed men and helped the <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So you see, if <hi>Socrates</hi> say true, how wickedly this Sainted Patriarch
lived, and how he came so much engaged against the <hi>Origenists,</hi> whose er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
doubtless were worthy blame: but many good persons who honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Origen</hi> for his great worth, and owned not his errours, were called <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigenists,</hi>
because they honoured him: And that which was erroncous in him,
was consistent with far greater Learning, Piety, and Honesty, than <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Isidore Pelus.</hi> and others thought there was in <hi>Theophilus:</hi> Either <hi>credible
Socrates,</hi> and others were gross Lyars, or this Patriarch and Saint was a
downright knave, or acted like one.</p>

He was a studious holy Monk of a House, near <hi>Antioch:</hi> After <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarius</hi>
death he was chosen Bishop for his meer piety and worth: He was
a man of great piety and honesty and an excellent tongue, and as good a
life, but bred in a Cell and not to Courtship, knew not how to slatter
Courtiers and Court-Prelates: He was naturally sharp and cholerick, and
his conscience told him, that a Bishop must not be a dawber, nor flatter
the greatest wicked men: (For Bishops in that Age were the Preachers,)
not having a thousand Congregations to preach to.) He saw even the
Clergy addicted to their appetites: and he kept a Table for them, but
eating with great temperance he always eat alone; He rebuked the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Court, and particularly of the Empress, who conceived a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hatred against him: And the Custome of the Court was, for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
much to influence both Emperour and Courtiers, and then what Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
soever was too precise for them and bold with their sins, to get a
pack of the Worldly Clergy presently to meet together and depose him:
(For Synods of Bishops (not the Pope) had then the power.) They would
not be seen in it themselves, but a Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> should call a
Synod, and do it presently. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> was a man of no Courtship to
take off their edges; but the worse Courtiers, Bishops, and Priests were,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60852:62"/>
the worse he spake of them; And all the honest plain people believed and
loved him; but the rich and great Prelates abhorred him. His own Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
hated him, because he would reform them: Those that would not amend,
he Excommunicated: Which they could not bear: so that one of his Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
<hi>Serapion,</hi> openly said to him, <hi>O Bishop, thou shalt never be able to rule
all these as thou wouldst, unless thou make them all tast of one whip.</hi> Every one
was his Enemy who was his own, and was engaged by guilt against his
Discipline and Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The Guilty hated him: His Hearers loved him: Swift-Writers took his
Sermons, which tell us what he was to this day: And it was honesty and
policy in <hi>Innocent</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to own him, who had worth to add to
the reputation of his defendants. Among other of his accusations, one
was, that <hi>Eutropius</hi> an Eunuch, Chamberlain to the Emperour, procured
a Law against Delinquents taking the Church for a Sanctuary. And short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after being to be beheaded, for a crime against the Emperour, he took
the Church for a Sanctuary himself; And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> from the Pulpit
Preached a Sermon against him, while he lay prostrate at the Altar. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he resisted <hi>Gainas</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> who turned Traytor and was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Another cause of <hi>Chrysostome's</hi> disturbance was, that one <hi>Severianus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Gabale</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> came into <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and Preached for Money,
and drew away the hearts of the People, while <hi>Chrysostome</hi> was about choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Bishop for <hi>Ephesus: Serapion</hi> a turbulent Deacon quarrelled with the
<hi>Syrian</hi> Bishop, and would not reverence him: The Bishop said, <hi>If</hi> Serapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>die a Christian, Chirst was not Incarnate. Serapion</hi> tells <hi>Chrysostome</hi> the
last words without the first: <hi>Chrysostome</hi> forbids <hi>Severianus</hi> the City: The
Empress taketh his part, and importuneth <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to be reconciled to
<hi>Severianus.</hi> But the Core remained, <hi>Socrat. l. 6. c.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>§. 41. <hi>Socrat. c.</hi> 11. Shortly after <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (the Collector of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies)
came from <hi>Cyprus</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there irregularly in <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes</hi>
Diocess played the Bishop, ordained a Deacon, and called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Bishops that were accidentally in the City, and required them to
Condemn the Books of <hi>Origen;</hi> which some did, and some refused, saith
<hi>Socrates, cap.</hi> 12. <q>Obscure men, odd Fellows, such as have no Pith or
Substance in them, to the end they may become famous, go about most
commonly to purchase to themselves Glory and Renown by dispraising
such men as far excel them in rare and singular Virtues.</q> 
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> bore
patiently <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s fault and invited him to take a Lodging at his
House. He answered him, <q>I will neither Lodg with thee, nor Pray
with thee, unless thou banish <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and his Brethren out of the City,
and subscribe with thy own Hand the Condemnation of the Works of
<hi>Origen:</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> answered, that such things are not to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deliberation and good advice. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in <hi>Chrysostome's</hi> Church at
the Sacrament, stands forth and Condemns <hi>Origen,</hi> and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth
<hi>Dioscorus</hi> a Bishop, and reproveth <hi>Chrysostome</hi> as taking their part.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60852:62"/>
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sent word by <hi>Serapion</hi> to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> that he did violate the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
1. In making Ministers in his Diocess; 2. In administring the
Communion without his Licence, and yet refusing to do it when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
it. Wherefore he bid him take heed lest he set the People in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar,
for if ought came amiss, he had his remedy in his Hands. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
hearing this, went away in fear, and took Ship for <hi>Cyprus:</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
goeth (saith <hi>Socrates, cap.</hi> 13.) that as he went he said of <hi>Iohn, I hope
thou shalt never dye a Bishop:</hi> And that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> answer'd him, <hi>I hope thou
shalt never come alive into thy Countrey.</hi> And it so fell out: For <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
dyed at Sea by the way; and <hi>Chysostome</hi> dyed deposed and banished.</p>
               <p>§. 42. The Empress <hi>Eudoxia</hi> was said to set <hi>Epiphanius</hi> on work. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
being hot, made a Sermon of the faults of Women; which was interpreted
to be against the Empress. She irritated the Emperour against him; and
got <hi>Theophilus</hi> to call a Council against him, at <hi>Quercus</hi> near <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
and <hi>Constant.</hi> Thither came <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>verianus,</hi> and many Bishops that <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
had deposed, and many that were his Enemies for his strictness; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
time-servers that knew the will of the Empress, if not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
When they summoned him to appear before them, He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that by the Canon there must be more Patriarchs, and he appealed
to a General Council, yet not denying to answer any where, if they
would put out his Enemies from being his Judges, and that in his own
Patriarchate. But they sentenced him deposed, for not appearing: The
People were presently in an uproar, and would not let him be taken out
of the Church: The Emperour commanded his banishment: To avoid
Tumult, the third day he yielded himself to the Souldiers to be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
The people hereupon were all in an uproar, and it pleased God
that there was an Earthquake that night: Whereupon the Emperour sent
after him to intreat him to return. When he came back he would not
have officiated, till his Cause was heard by equal Judges, but the People
constrained him to Pray and Preach; which was after made the matter
of his Accusation. <hi>Theophilus</hi> was hated as the cause of all, and <hi>Severianus</hi>
as the second. After this <hi>Theophilus</hi> turned his Accusation upon <hi>Heraclides,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> put in by <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> They condemned him unheard,
in his absence: <hi>Chrysostome</hi> said that should not be: The <hi>Alexandrians</hi>
said, <hi>It was just;</hi> They went hereupon together by the Ears, and some
were wounded and some were killed, and <hi>Theophilus</hi> glad to fly home to
<hi>Alexandria;</hi> but was hated by the People.</p>
               <p>§. 43. After this a Silver Image of the Empress was set up in the Street,
and Plays and Shows about it, which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> perhaps too sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached:
This provoked the Empress to call another Council; which
deposed <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> for seizing upon his place before a Council restored
him: He ceased his Office: The Emperor banished him: His People in
passion set the Church on Fire, which burnt down the Senatours Court;
for which grievous sufferings befell them. Upon this they forsook the
Church and the new Bishop <hi>(Arsacius,</hi> an old useless man) and gathered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60852:63"/>
by themselves,<note place="margin">☞</note> and were long called <hi>Ioannites</hi> from his Name,
and taken for Schismaticks: But they never returned till the Name and
Bones of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> were restored to Honour.</p>
               <p>§. 44. The <hi>Novatians</hi> quarrelled with <hi>Chrysostome</hi> as too loose in his
Doctrine and too strict in his Life, because he said in a Sermon, If you
Sin an hundred times, the Church Doors shall be open to you, if you repent.
And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> angry with <hi>Sisinnius</hi> the <hi>Novatian</hi> Bishop, told him, There
should not be two Bishops in one City, and threatned to silence him from
Preaching: He told him that he would be beholden to him then for saving
him his labour. But <hi>Chrysostome</hi> answered him, <hi>Nay, if it be a labour, go
on.</hi>

their true Copies of the Councils: None of them have any such Canon: The
Fathers write to the Pope to take better heed what he affirmeth for the time
to come, and to forbear such pride and usurpation: alledging that by the
Canons all strifes were to be ended by their neighbour Bishops and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</p>

(as <hi>Harding)</hi> that the <hi>Africans</hi> continued long, (some say almost 100 years)
in Schism: And an Epistle under the name of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the second to
<hi>Eulalius</hi> saith the same: Others wiser (as <hi>Binnius)</hi> see that to lose <hi>Augustines</hi>
authority and have him and all the <hi>African</hi> Bishops (the best of the World)
against the Papal power, would be to heavy a burden for them: Therefore
they say, that the <hi>Africans</hi> were no Schismaticks, that the Canon not found
was in the Council of <hi>Sardica;</hi> and that That went for the Council of <hi>Nice:</hi>
That the <hi>Africans</hi> did not deny the Popes power of judging them, but only
of sending Souldiers and doing it violently by force, and such other shifts,
which the express words of the <hi>African</hi> Council and Letters plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute:

partly would not Communicate with the rest, each side saying, that theirs
was the True Bishop, and the other an Usurper and Schismatick. But <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
was for <hi>Caelestine.</hi> In his time another <hi>Carthage</hi> Council made up their
Canons 105. Among which are: 6. <hi>That no Bishop be called the chief Bishop. 33.
To deal gentlier with the</hi> Donatists. 36. <hi>To send to them for peace. 53. That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

               </p>
               <p>§. 63. It fell out well for <hi>Austin</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that by the means

               <p>§. 1. THe Church at <hi>Constantinople</hi> growing to be the greatest, by
the presence of the Court (which was the spring or poise of
most of the Bishops courses, and indeed did rule,) it became
the envy and jealousie, especially or the two great Patriarchs,
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria. Alexandria</hi> being under the same Emperour had more
to do with <hi>Const.</hi> and made the greater Stirs; For when the Empire was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<hi>Rome</hi> being under an Orthodox Emperour, had little trouble at
home, and little opportunity for domination in the <hi>East:</hi> Yet keeping up
the pretence of the prime Patriarchate, and the <hi>Caput Mundi Romani,</hi> the
Pope watch'd his opportunity to lay in his claim, aud to keep under the
stronger side, and while they did the work in the <hi>East</hi> against one another,
he sent now and then a Letter or a Legate, to tell them that he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
still: And indeed the hope of help from the <hi>Western</hi> Emperour by the
countenance of the Pope, made the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches still vexed with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and Persecutions and Divisions, to seek oft to <hi>Rome</hi> and be glad of their
approbation, to strengthen them against their adversaries.</p>
               <p>§. 2. When <hi>Arsacius</hi> was dead, <hi>Atticus</hi> succeeded him at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
a wise and pious healing man, who greatly thereby advanced that Church
and all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches: He dealt gently with the <hi>Novatians</hi> and lived
in peace with them. He encouraged Hereticks by kindness to return to the
Communion of the Church. At <hi>Synada in Phygia Pac.</hi> was a Church of
<hi>Macedonians: Theodosius</hi> Bishop of the Orthodox Persecuted them with great
severity: And when he found that the Magistrates of the place had not
power to do as much as he expected, he got him to <hi>Constantinople</hi> for greater
power:<note place="margin">☞</note> while he was there <hi>Agapetus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bishop turned Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,

When <hi>Theodosius</hi> came home with power to persecute him, he found him in
his place, and the people shut the doors against <hi>Theodosius:</hi> Whereupon
he went back to <hi>Const.</hi> and made his complaint to <hi>Atticus</hi> how he was used.
<hi>Atticus</hi> knew that it fell out for the best, for the concord of the Church, and
he gave <hi>Theodosius</hi> good words, and perswaded him only to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Cyril</hi> at that time succeeded his Unkle <hi>Theophilus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in place and in unquiet domination, taking more upon him than <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
had done, even the Government of temporal affairs: He presently shut
up the <hi>Novatian</hi> Churches in <hi>Alex.</hi>

falling out with the Christians, murdered many of them. <hi>Cyril</hi> executed some,
and banished them all. <hi>Orestes</hi> the Governour took this ill: Fifty Monks
of Mount <hi>Nitria</hi> come to take <hi>Cyril</hi>'s part, and assault the Governour, and
wound him in the head with a stone: The people rise and put the Monks
to flight, but take him that did the Fact, and he is tormented and put to
death: <hi>Cyril</hi> pronounced the Monk a Martyr, but the people would not
believe him one.<note place="margin">Socr. c. 15.</note> At that time there was a Woman, <hi>Hypatia,</hi> so famous
for learning, that she excelled in all Philosophy, and taught in the Schools
(which <hi>Plotinus</hi> continued:) so that she had Scholars out of many Countries,
and was oft with Princes, and Rulers, and for her modesty and gravity
was much esteemed. <hi>Orestes</hi> the Governour oft talking with her, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
said, It was long of her that he was not reconciled to <hi>Cyril:</hi> They laid
hold of her; drew her into a Church, stript her stark naked; rase the skin,
and tare the flesh off her body with sharp shells till she dyed: they quarter
her body and burn them to ashes: which turned to the great dishonour of
<hi>Cyril.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. All this while the followers of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> remained Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
and Separatists at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and were called <hi>Ioannites,</hi> and kept
in Conventicles of their own. <hi>Atticus</hi> knew that love was the way to win
them, and he purposing to take that way, writeth to <hi>Cyril Alex.</hi> that the

were gone and had separate meetings without the Walls; Priests and
Bishops separating from one another were like to destroy the Church, and
that if he consented not to restore the name of dead <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would do it without him, and he was loath that Church administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

did vehemently oppose it (How did he obey <hi>Rome</hi> then, when the Pope had
Excommunicated <hi>Chrysotom</hi>'s persecutors?) And first he pleaded, that
the Schismaticks were but few (as if their own Bishop knew not better than
he;) and that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> being ejected dyed a Lay-man, and was not to
be numbered with the Clergy, that <hi>Atticus</hi> had the Magistrates on his side,
that would bring them in by force <hi>(Reader, there is nothing new under the sun:
the things that have been are.)</hi> And a little time would reduce most of them
to the Church (though they increased;) That by favouring the Schismaticks
he would lose the obedient (Conformists,) and would get nothing by pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such disobedient men, but strengthen them; That the Conformists (or
obedient) were the far more considerable part, even the Bishops and

                     </gap>ticus,</hi> That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Canons was more to be observed than the pleasing of such
Schismaticks, and that violating the Canons would do far more hurt than
pleasing such men would do good; And that such men will never be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by reasons, nor judge truly of themselves: And he likened the restoring
of <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s Name, to the putting in the name of the Traytor <hi>Iudas</hi>
with <hi>Matthias.</hi> He added, That if ignorant wilful fellows will forsake
the Church, what loss is it? And therefore that a few mens talk must not draw
<hi>Atticas</hi> to pluck up the Church Sanctions. And as for <hi>Alexander Antioch.</hi>
who perswaded him to it, He was a bold-faced man that had deceived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
but this disease must not thus prevail, but be cured. Thus <hi>Cyril</hi> to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus:</hi>
How oft have I heard just such language? Reader, How hard is it to
know what History to believe, when it comes to the characterizing of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries?
How little is a domineering Prelates accusation of such men as
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> to be credited? And how ordinary is it with such, to call their
betters, not what they are, but what they would have them thought, if not
what they are themselves?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Atticus</hi> was wiser than to take this Counsel; but obeyed the Wisdom
which is from above, which is first pure and then peaceable, gentle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And God had so much mercy on <hi>Constant.</hi> as to defeat the evil Counsel of
<hi>Cyril,</hi> and turn it into foolishness: For <hi>Atticus</hi> restored the name of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
and used the Nonconformists kindly, and they came into the unity
of the Church: And when <hi>Proclus,</hi> after him, fetch'd home his bones with
honour, the breach was healed.</p>
               <p>§. 5. No credible History telleth us, that either <hi>Theophilus</hi> or <hi>Cyril</hi> did
repent of this; (Though the Papists say, that the Pope Excommunicated
<hi>Theophilus</hi> for it; yet they are now honoured, because the Pope did own
the Cause against <hi>Nestorius.) Theodoret</hi>'s Epistle to <hi>Ioh. Antioch.</hi> upon the
death of <hi>Cyril,</hi> taking his death for the Churches deliverance from a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
enemy of Peace, intimates, that he repented not: But (God only
knoweth:) <hi>Nicephorus</hi> out of <hi>Nicetas</hi> the Philosopher, tells us a report, that
after all this, before he dyed, a dream did cure him; <hi>viz. That he saw</hi>
Chrysostome <hi>drive him out of his own house, having a Divine company with him;
and that the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>intreated for him, &amp;c.</hi> And that upon this <hi>Cyril</hi>
changed his mind and admired <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and repented of his imprudence
and wrath, and hereupon called another Provincial Synod to honour him,
and restore his name. <hi>(O ductile Synods!</hi> And O <hi>unhappy Churches,</hi> whose

the <hi>Arians</hi> by going to pull down their Church, and they set it on
Fire themselves to the hazard of the City. So that he was presently called
a <hi>Firebrand.</hi> He vexed the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and raised stirs in many places, but
the Emperour curbed him. <hi>Antony</hi> Bishop of <hi>Germa</hi> vexing the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
they killed him: whereupon they were put out of their Churches in many
Cities.</p>
               <p>§. 9. At last his own ruine came as followeth. <hi>Nestorius</hi> defended his

of God;</hi> This set all the City in a division, disputing of they well knew not
what, and suspecting him of denying the Godhead of Christ: But he was
of no such Opinion, but being eloquent and self-conceited read little of
the Ancients Writings, nor was very learned; and thought to avoid all
extreams herein, and so would not call <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> nor the
<hi>Mother of Man,</hi> but the <hi>Mother of Christ who was God and Man.</hi>

Prince, weary of this Stir, called a General Council at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and gave
<hi>Cyril</hi> order to preside, (the Papists pretend that he was Pope <hi>Caelestine</hi>'s
Legate, who indeed joyned with him by his Letters, when he saw how
things went.) Both <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Nestorius</hi> desired the Council (Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Some Bishops going with him, they met by themselves. <hi>Cyril</hi> summoneth
him: He refuseth to come till <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> came. They examine

Those that were with</hi> John <hi>heard it friendly, and approved it: The other clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

&amp;c.</hi> This was his Description of the carriage of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
               <p>Both Parties sent several Bishops, as their Delegates, to <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
The Emperour would not permit them to come nearer than <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
(which is as <hi>Southwark</hi> to <hi>London.)</hi> While they wait there, <hi>Theodorite,</hi> one
of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Party against <hi>Cyril,</hi> wrote back, that the Court was against <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius,</hi>
but most of the People were for them. It's said that <hi>Pulcheria,</hi>
the Emperours Sister, was much against him. At last Pope <hi>Caelestine's</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
came to the Council and took <hi>Cyril's</hi> Part. The Emperour saw how
great the breach would be, if <hi>Cyril</hi> were deposed, and he revoked the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of him and <hi>Memnon,</hi> but not of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and wrote a threatning
Letter to <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to charge them to agree and joyn in Communion,
and not divide the Churches, or else what he would do to them both. These
terrible words cured them both of Heresie: They presently consulted, and
sent each other their Confessions,<note place="margin">☜</note> and found (good men) that they were
of one mind and did not know it. And so having their will upon <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and his adherents, the rest united. But so, that <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Theodorite</hi>
took <hi>Cyril</hi> for a Firebrand to the last.</p>
               <p>§. 11. <hi>Nestorius</hi> being deposed retired quietly to his Monastery by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and lived there in honour four years, but then was banished and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in distress: (some Fable that he was eaten with Worms.)</p>
               <p>§. 12. The event of this Council was, that a Party of the Orientals
adhered to <hi>Nestorius,</hi> took <hi>Cyril</hi> and this Council for Hereticks, and to
this day continue a numerous Party of Christians, called Hereticks by the
<hi>Pontificians,</hi> because they are not for them: And the <hi>Eutychians</hi> on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
accused their Adversaries the Orthodox to be <hi>Nestorians,</hi> and the
Churches were inflamed by the dissention through many Ages following.</p>
               <p>§. 13. And what was really the Controversie between them? Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<hi>Nestorius</hi> as asserting two persons in Christ as well as two natures,
which he still denyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Others accuse <hi>Cyril</hi> as denying two Natures: But
his words about this were many, but he affirmed two Natures before the
Union, (and so did the <hi>Eutychians)</hi> but one after: <hi>David Derodon</hi> a most
learned <hi>Frenchman</hi> hath written a Treatise <hi>De Supposite,</hi> in which he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
laboureth to prove that <hi>Nestorius</hi> was Orthodox, holding two
Natures in one Person, and that <hi>Cyril</hi> and his Council were Hereticks,
holding one Nature only after Union, and that he was a true <hi>Eutychian,</hi> and
<hi>Dioscorus</hi> did but follow him, and that the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned
<hi>Nestorius</hi> and stablished his Doctrine, and extolled <hi>Cyril</hi> and condemned
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60852:68"/>
his Doctrine.<note place="margin">☞</note> But for my part I make no doubt that, <hi>de re, they were both
fully of one mind, and differed only about the aptitude of a phrase:</hi> Whether
it were an apt Speech to call <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Parent of God,</hi> and <hi>to say that God
was two moneths old, God hungred, God dyed and rose, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Nestorius</hi>
denyed, and <hi>Cyril</hi> and the Council with him affirmed. And what hath
the World suffered by this Word Warr. But which was in the right.</p>
               <p>We commonly say that <hi>forma denominat, &amp; locutio formalis est maximè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria.</hi>
And so <hi>Nestorius</hi> spake most properly: But Use is the Master of
Speech, which tyeth us not always to that strictness, and so <hi>Cyril</hi> well
interpreted spake well: especially if the contrary side should intrude a
duality of Persons, by their denying the Phrase: While <hi>Nestorius</hi> accuseth
<hi>Cyril</hi> as if he spake <hi>de abstracto,</hi> he wrongeth him: while <hi>Cyril</hi> accuseth
<hi>Nestorius</hi> as if he spake <hi>de concreto,</hi> he wronged him: They both meant
that <hi>Mary</hi> was the Mother of <hi>Christ who was God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and of the <hi>Vnion of</hi>
the Natures, but not the Mother of <hi>Christ as God,</hi> or of the Deity. So
that one speaking <hi>de concreto,</hi> and the other <hi>de abstracto,</hi> one <hi>materially</hi> and
the other <hi>formally,</hi> in the heat of Contention they hereticated each other
and kindled a flame not quenched to this day, about a word while both
were of one mind.</p>

past doubt that Learned Bishops were rare: When <hi>Nectarius</hi> must be the

for asserting only a union <hi>secundùm personam,</hi> and not <hi>secundùm natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>
4. That <hi>Cyril</hi> (as <hi>Dioseorus)</hi> declares what union he meaneth, not

               <p>§. 1. CXXIII. <hi>CYril</hi> had by many words so carried the business at
<hi>Ephesus</hi> against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and himself so often said,
that after the <hi>Vnion,</hi> the <hi>Natures were one,</hi> that his
Admirers took that for a certain truth: But when
that quarrel was over, Truth was truth still, and the Orthodox would not
fly from it, for fear of being called <hi>Nestorians;</hi> for they disclaimed <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
but disowned the Doctrine of <hi>One nature. Eutyches</hi> an <hi>Archimandrite,</hi>
and <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> Successour to <hi>Cyril,</hi> belived that they did but tread in his
steps, and hold to the <hi>Ephes.</hi> Council. But that would not now serve, when
the Scene was changed.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Reader, It is useful to thee, to know truly the state of this Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Controversie, which had more dividing and direful effects than the
former. The <hi>Eutychians</hi> say, that <hi>Christ before their Vnion by incarnation had
two natures,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> that is, considered mentally, as not united; but <hi>after the union
had but one nature.</hi> They took up this as against <hi>Nestorianisme.</hi> The truth
is, Though they still go for desperate Hereticks, I verily believe that all
the quarrel was but about ambiguous words: some of them understood the
word <hi>[Nature]</hi> in the same sense as their Adversaries took the word <hi>[Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis]</hi>
or <hi>[Person.]</hi> And (it's sad that it should be true, but) most of
them confounded <hi>[Vnity undistinguished]</hi> and <hi>[Vniting undivided.]</hi> The <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi>
thought, How can that be called <hi>Vnity</hi> which maketh not <hi>one of two?</hi>
And no doubt the <hi>Natures are One; But One what?</hi> Not <hi>One Nature, but
One Person;</hi> Yet (to bring off <hi>Cyril)</hi> it may be said that even the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are One,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Division</hi> or <hi>Separation,</hi> but not <hi>One</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to <hi>distinction.</hi> He that had but distinguished these two clearly to
them, and explained the word <hi>[Nature]</hi> clearly, had better ended all the
Controversie than it was ended. It's plain that <hi>Cyril</hi> and the <hi>Eutychians</hi>
allowed <hi>mental distinction,</hi> though not that the Mind should suppose them
<hi>divided:</hi> And it's certain that the Orthodox meant no more.</p>
               <p>§. 3. He that readeth but Philosophers, Schoolmen, and late Writers,
(such as <hi>Fortun. Licetus de natura, &amp;c.)</hi> will see how little they are agreed
about the meaning of the word <hi>[Nature,]</hi> and how unable to procure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in the conception. They that say it is <hi>principium motus &amp; Quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
are contradicoted, as confounding divers <hi>Principia:</hi> and as confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Active Natures,</hi> and <hi>Passive,</hi> the <hi>Active</hi> only being <hi>Principium Motus,</hi>
and the <hi>Passive, Principium quietis.</hi> And on such accounts the <hi>Eutychians</hi>
pleaded for <hi>One Nature;</hi> because in Christ incarnate they supposed that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60852:72"/>
the Divine Nature was the <hi>Principium primum motus,</hi> and that all Christs
actions were done by it, and that the humane soul, being moved by the
Divinity, was but <hi>Principium subordinatum,</hi> which they thought was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
called <hi>Principium,</hi> (As most Philosophers say, that <hi>Forma generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
is improperly called <hi>forma hominis,</hi> because <hi>one thing</hi> hath but <hi>one form;</hi>
so they thought that <hi>one person</hi> had but one proper <hi>Principium motus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. Alas how few Bishops then could distinguish as <hi>Derodon</hi> doth,
and our common Metaphysicks, between, 1. <hi>Individuum, 2. Prima sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,
3. Natura, 4. Suppositum, 5. Persona,</hi> 6. and have distinguished,
a right <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>hypostasis,</hi> or <hi>subsistence, &amp;c.</hi> and defined all these. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
saith <hi>Derodon de suppos.</hi> p. 5. is taken in nine senses; But the <hi>sense</hi> was
not <hi>here agreed on,</hi> before they <hi>disputed of the matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even about the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> it is disputed, whether he consist not of
<hi>many natures?</hi> Whether every Element (Earth, Water, Air, Fire) retain
not its several <hi>Nature</hi> in the Body, or whether the Soul be Mans only
<hi>Nature,</hi> and whether as intellectual, and sensitive and vegetative, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in one of these? And is it not pity that such questions should be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about the person of Christ by self-conceited Bishops, and made neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation, and the world set on fire, and divided by them? Is this
good usage of the Faith of Christ, the Souls of Men, and the Church of
God.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But to the History: At a Council of <hi>Constantinop.</hi> under <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nvs,
Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dorileum</hi> accused <hi>Eutyches,</hi> for affirming Heretically
as aforesaid, (that <hi>after the Vnion Christ had but one Nature.) Eutiches</hi> is
sent for: He refuseth to come out of his Monastery; After many Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Then craveth of the Emperour the presence of Magistrates, that he
be not calumniated by the Bishops. He is condemned, but recanteth
not.</p>
               <p>§. 6. A meeting of Bishops at <hi>Tyre</hi> cleared <hi>Ibas Edess.</hi> from the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> made by four Excommunicate Priests, two of
them perjured; and reconciled him to such Priests for Peace sake.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Another meeting of Bishops at <hi>Berythum,</hi> cleared <hi>Ibas</hi> from a
renewed accusation of <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> being said to have spoken evil of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.</hi>
An Epistle of his to <hi>Maris</hi> a Bishop, was accused, which the Council
at <hi>Calcedon</hi> after absolved, and the next General Council condemned.</p>
               <p>§. 8. CXXIV. Another Council is called at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by the means
of some Courtiers, in favour to <hi>Eutiches,</hi> where, upon the testimony of
some Bishops, that <hi>Flavianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> condemned him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
before the Synod did it, and that the Records were altered, all was
nullified that at the last Synod was done against him.</p>

and <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. <hi>Dioscorus</hi> thinking the same, that <hi>Eutiches</hi>

against, carried matters in this Synod as violently as <hi>Cyril</hi> had done in the
former. The Bishops perceiving the Emperours, the Courtiers, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus</hi>
mind, could not resist the stronger side. The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
commanded by the Emperour to be present. He sent his Legates; with
his Judgment in Writing of the Cause. The Emperour for bad those to
be Speakers that had before judged <hi>Eutyches.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Legates excepted
that <hi>Dioscorus</hi> presided: (It seemeth the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire and Church, then
believed not that the Popes precedency was <hi>jure divino.) Dioscorus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
that the Council was not called to decide any matter of Faith, but
to judge of the proceedings of <hi>Flavianus</hi> against <hi>Eutyches.</hi> The Acts of
the <hi>Constant.</hi> Synod (after the Emperours Letters) being read, <hi>Eutyches</hi>
is absolved: <hi>Domnus,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch, Iuvenal,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the rest, subscribed the absolution, (which
after they said they did for fear, when another Emperour changed the
Scene.) This being done, the Acts of the former <hi>Ephes.</hi> Council were
read, and all Excommunicate that did not approve them. (So that this
Council of <hi>Eutychians</hi> thought verily the former was of their mind.) Four
Bishops, <hi>Flavianus, Eusebius, Doryl, Ibas Edes.</hi> and <hi>Theodoret Cyri,</hi> are
condemned and deposed: All the Bishops subscribed except the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates;
so that, saith <hi>Bimius, In hoc tam horrendo Episcoporum suffragio, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
navilula Petri incolumis emergens salvatur,</hi> p. 1017. Judge by this, First,
Whether Councils may erre, Secondly, Whether they are the just Judges
or Keepers of Tradition, Thirdly, Whether all the World always believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Popes Infallibility, or Governing power over them, when all that
Council voted contrary to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flavianus</hi> here offering his appeal, was beaten and abused, and dyed
of the hurt, (as was said in <hi>Concil. Calced.</hi> and by <hi>Liberatus.)</hi> But this was
no quenching, but a kindling of the fire of Episcopal Contentions: <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
missed of his end.</p>

               <p>§. 12. CXXVIII. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour being dead, <hi>Martian</hi> was
against the <hi>Eutychians: Anatolius</hi> at a Synod at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> maketh an

               <p>§. 14. CXXX. Now cometh the great Council at <hi>Calcedon,</hi> under the
new Emperour <hi>Martian,</hi> where all is changed for a time; Yet <hi>Pulcheria</hi>
who marryed him and made him Emperour, and whose power then was
great, was the same that before had been against <hi>Nestorius</hi> in her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60852:73"/>
reign: Never was it truer than in the Case of General Councils, that
the Multitude of Physicians, exasperateth the Disease, and killeth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
The word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] the <hi>[one nature after union]</hi> the words <hi>[one
will</hi> and <hi>one opperation]</hi> had never done half so much mischief in the Church,
if the erroneous had been confuted by neglect, and Councils had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated,
enraged, and engaged them, and set all the World on taking
one side or another. One skilfull healing man that could have explicated
ambiguous terms, and perswaded men to Love and Peace, till they had
understood themselves and one another, had more befriended Truth, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Church, than all the Hereticating Councils did.</p>
               <p>§. 15. If what <hi>Socrates</hi> writeth of <hi>Theodosius junior</hi> be true, (as we
know no reason to doubt) God owned his Moderation by Miracles, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his favouring the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> more than he did any ways of
violence. <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, <hi>l. 7. c.</hi> 41, 42. that <hi>Theodosius</hi> was the <hi>mildest
man in the World, for which cause God subdued his enemies to him without slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and bloodshed;</hi> as his Victory over <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Barbarians shew: Of
which he saith, First, Their Captain <hi>Rugas</hi> was kill'd with a thunder-bolt;
Secondly, A Plague killed the greatest part of his Soldiers; Thirdly,
Fire from Heaven consumed many that remained. And <hi>Proclus</hi> the Bishop
being a man of great Peace and Moderation, hurting and persecuting
none, was confirmed by these providences in his lenity, being of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
mind, and perswading the Emperour to fetch home the bones of
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> with honour, wholly ended the Nonconformity and Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Ioanites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 16. Before <hi>Theodosius</hi> dyed, <hi>Leo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> set <hi>Placidia</hi> and
<hi>Eudoxia,</hi> to write to him against <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> and for the cause of <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
Yea, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> himself. <hi>Theodosius</hi> wrote to <hi>Valentinian</hi> (and
the like to the Women,) <q>That they departed not from the Faith and
Tradition of their Fathers, that at the Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> second
things were carried with much liberty and truth, and the unworthy
were removed and the worthy put into their places, and it was the
troublers of the Church that were deposed, and <hi>Flavianus</hi> was the
Prince of the Contentions, and that now they lived in Concord and
Peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. The Council at <hi>Calcedon</hi> was called, <hi>an. 451. Dioscorus</hi> is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for his <hi>Ephesine</hi> General Council, and for his violence, and defence of
<hi>Eutiches,</hi> and the death of <hi>Flavianus.</hi> He alledgeth the Emperours Order
to him <hi>[Authoritatem &amp; Primatum tuae praebemus beatitudini,</hi> (If the Popes
Universal Rule be essential to the Church, then the pious and excellent
Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and the General Council that consented, were none
of them Christians that knew it, but went against it.) <hi>Eos qui per addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
aliquod, aut imminutionem conati sunt dicere, praeter quae sunt exposita
de fide Catholica à sanctis Patribus qui in Nicaea, &amp; post modum qui in</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>congregati sunt, nullam omnino fiduciam in sancto Synodo habere patimur,
sed &amp; sub vestro judicio esse volunus.]</hi> Here <hi>Binnius</hi> accuseth the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60852:73"/>
as <hi>giving that which he had not but by usurpation, and this through
ignorance of the Ecclesiastical Canons.</hi> But were all the Bishops ignorant of
it also? Or was so good an Emperour bred up and cherished in ignorance
of such a point pretended by the Papists to be necessary to the Being of a
Church, and to salvation; The Bishops of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Seleucia</hi> also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
of the same power by the Emperour's Grant. <hi>Dioscorus</hi> answered
<hi>that All the Synod consented and subscibed as well as he, and</hi> Juvenal Hieros.
<hi>and</hi> Thalassius Seleuc.</p>
               <p>The Bishops answered, that they did it against their wills, being under
fear; Condemnation and Banishment was threatned; Souldiers were
there with Clubs and Swords: Therefore the Oriental Bishops cryed out
to cast out <hi>Dioscorus. Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (who had been <hi>Dioscorus</hi>
chief Agent there) cryed out, <hi>that fear constrained them:</hi> The Lay-Judges
and Senate asked, <hi>who forced them? Stephen</hi> said <hi>Elpidius</hi> and <hi>Eulogius,</hi>
and many Souldiers threatned him. They asked, <hi>Did</hi> Dioscorus <hi>use vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
with you?</hi> He said that he was not suffered to go out till he had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.
<hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Claudiopolis</hi> said,<note place="margin">Bin. Tom. 2. p. 7, 8.</note> that <hi>Dioscorus, Iuvenal,</hi> and
the leading men, led on them, as simple ignorant men, that knew not the
Cause, and frightned them with defaming them as <hi>Nestorian</hi> Hereticks.
Thus they cryed out that they were frightned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops answered, that</hi> A Christian feareth no man, <hi>(and
yet they were afraid before they ended)</hi> A Catholick feareth no man; we
are instructed by flames: If men were feared, there would be no Martyrs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dioscorus</hi> noted what Bishops those were that said they <hi>subscribed to a blank
Paper,</hi> when it was about a matter of Faith: But asked, who made them
by their several interlocutions to speak their consent? Hereupon the Acts
of the <hi>Ephes.</hi> Council were read, among which were the words of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorus,</hi>
Anathematizing any that should contradict or <hi>retract any thing held
in the</hi> Nicene <hi>or the</hi> Ephesine <hi>Synods:</hi> Adding, <hi>how terrible and formidable
it was, If a man sin against God, who shall intercede for him? If the Holy
Ghost sit in Council with the Fathers, he that retracteth cashiereth the Grace of
the Spirit.</hi> The Synods answered, <hi>We all say the same: Let him be</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
<hi>that retracteth;</hi> (these Bishops that curse themselves will easily curse
others,) <hi>Let him be cast out that retracteth. Dioscorus</hi> said, <hi>No man ordereth
things already ordered:</hi> The holy Synod said, <hi>These are the words of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, &amp;c. Theodorus</hi> denyed these words recorded. <hi>Dioscorus</hi> said,
they may as well say they were not there.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Here also <hi>Eutyche</hi>'s Confession at <hi>Ephesus</hi> was read, in which he
professeth to cleave to the former <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, and to the blessed
Father <hi>Cyril</hi> that presided, disclaiming all additions and alterations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that he had himself Copies in a Book which <hi>Cyril</hi> himself sent
him, and is yet in his hands; and that he standeth to the definition of that
Council with that of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eusebius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Doril. <hi>said,</hi> He lyeth; that Council hath no such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60852:74"/>
Dioscorus <hi>said,</hi> There are four Books of it, that all contain this Definition.
Do you accuse all the Synodical Books? I have one, and he hath one, and he
hath one; Let them be brought forth. Diogenes <hi>Bishop of</hi> Cyrilum <hi>said,</hi> They
deceitfully cleave to the Council of <hi>Nice: The Question is of additions made
against Heresies. The Bishops of</hi> Egypt <hi>said,</hi> None of us receive additions
or diminutions: Hold what is done at <hi>Nice:</hi> This is the Emperour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<hi>The Eastern Bishops clamoured</hi> [Iust so said Eutyches.] <hi>The</hi> Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<hi>Bishops still cryed up the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith alone without addition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dioscorus <hi>accused the Bishops for going from their words, and said</hi> [If
<hi>Eutyches</hi> hold not the Doctrine of the Church, he is worthy of punishment and
fire, <hi>(ex ore tuo)</hi> My regard is to the Catholick and Apostolick Faith, and
not the Faith of any man: I look to God himself, and not to the person of any
man, nor care I for any man, but for my soul and the true and sincere Faith.]
<hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops cryed out</hi> [Let no man separate him that is indivisible.
No man calleth one Son two.] <hi>The Eastern Bishops cryed, [Anathema</hi> to him
that divideth. Basil Seleuciae <hi>said, Anathema</hi> to him that divideth two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
after the union; and <hi>Anathema</hi> to him that knoweth not the property of the
natures. <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops cryed out,</hi> [As he was born he suffered:
There is one Lord, and one Faith: None calleth one Lord two. <hi>This was</hi>
Nestorius <hi>voice. The Eastern Bishops cryed,</hi> Anathema to <hi>Nestorius</hi> and
<hi>Eutyches. The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops cryed,</hi> Divide not the Lord of Glory, that
is indivisible.</p>
               <p>Basil <hi>Bishop of</hi> Sileuc. <hi>reported how rightly he had spoken at</hi> Ephesus,
<hi>and how the</hi> Egyptians <hi>and Monks with noise opposed, and cryed</hi> [Cut
him in two that saith <hi>Two Natures,</hi> he is a <hi>Nestorian.] The Lay Judges
asked him,</hi> If he spake so well, why did he condemn <hi>Flavianus? He said,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was necessitated to obey the rest, being 130 Bishops. Dioscorus <hi>said,</hi>
Out of thy own mouth art thou condemned,<note place="margin">☞</note> that for the shame of men hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated
and despised the faith. Basilius Seleuc. <hi>said,</hi> If I had been called to
Martyrdom before the Iudges I had endured it; but he that is judged of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
useth just means: Let the Son dye that speaketh even things just to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But the Eastern Bishops better cryed out, <hi>[We have all sinned, we all
beg pardon.]</hi> And <hi>Thalassius, Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Eustathius,</hi> (leading Bishops)
cryed the same, <hi>[We have all sinned, we all crave pardon.]</hi> After this the
Acts of <hi>Ephes.</hi> and <hi>Const.</hi> were read.</p>
               <p>§. 19. By what I have recited out of <hi>Binnius,</hi> and others, these two
lamentable things are undeniable:</p>
               <p>I. That this doleful Contention, Anathematizing, and ruining each
other, was about the sense of ambiguous words, and that they were of
one mind in the matter,<note place="margin">☞</note> and knew it not: The <hi>Egyptians (Eutychians)</hi>
took <hi>two Natures</hi> and <hi>two Sons</hi> to be of the same sense, which the others
did not. And they thought that the rest had asserted a <hi>Division</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
when they meant but a <hi>Distinction:</hi> And the rest thought that the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> had denyed a <hi>Distinction,</hi> who denyed but a <hi>Partition</hi> or <hi>Division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:60852:74"/>
II. And it is plain, that while all sides held that <hi>Nestorius</hi> did hold
that there were <hi>Two Sons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> which he expresly denyed, that they cursed
<hi>Nestorius</hi> in ignorance, and maintained his Doctrine (except of the apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) while they curse his person or name. The
Doctrine of this Council is found, and <hi>Nestorius</hi>'s was the same, for <hi>two
natures</hi> in <hi>one person,</hi> and <hi>one Son.</hi> This is true, whatever Faction say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it.</p>
               <p>III. That these Bishops (though we honour them for all that was good in
them) were so far from the Martyrs Constancy, that they turned as the
Emperours Countenance, and the Times, and worldly Interest turned;
voting down Things and Persons in Councils, and crying <hi>omnes peccavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
in the next: Only <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ship, saith <hi>Binnius,</hi> scaped drowning at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> and yet here at <hi>Calcedon</hi> under <hi>Martian</hi> all are Orthodox.</p>
               <p>IV. But that which is worst of all is, that yet the same men that cry <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavimus</hi>
are here violent against any mercy to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops and
Monks with whom they had joined at <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 20. When an Epistle of <hi>Cyrils</hi> was read, the <hi>Illyricane</hi> Bishop cryed
out, <hi>We all believe as</hi> Cyril <hi>did: Theodorete</hi> (that had been for <hi>Nestorius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Cyril,</hi> and cast out by <hi>Dioscorus)</hi> spake more warily, and said,
<hi>Anathema to him that saith there are two Sons: We adore our Lord Iesus,
&amp;c.</hi> All the Bishops cryed, <hi>We believe as</hi> Cyril. Had not <hi>Cyril</hi>'s name bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hap than <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> that followed him as far as they could
understand him, and spake the same words as he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Orientals <hi>cryed,</hi> We believe as <hi>Cyril. The</hi> Egyptians <hi>cryed,</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as <hi>Cyril,</hi> We are all of the same opinion and mind; Let not Satan get place
and advantage among us. <hi>The</hi> Eastern <hi>Bishops cryed,</hi> Leo <hi>and</hi> Anatolius are
of this mind; The Emperour and Senate are of this mind: <hi>The lay Judge,
Senate, and all the Council cryed,</hi> The Emperour, the Empress, and all of
us are of one mind: <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops cryed,</hi> All the World are of this
mind; We are of a mind. <hi>(And who would think that yet they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed,
even to Hereticating and Deposing, Persecuting one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O but say to the</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops,</hi> If you are all of this mind, Why did
you communicate with <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and condemn <hi>Flavianus?</hi> Dioscorus <hi>appealed
to the Records. And here</hi> Eustathius Beryl, <hi>shewed what labour</hi> Cyril
<hi>used to explain his own meaning, in his Epistles to</hi> Acacius, Valerianus,
<hi>and</hi> Successus <hi>Bishops, and that these are his words;</hi> We must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that there are two natures, but one nature incarnate of God the Word:
<hi>And this saying he confirmed by the Testimony of</hi> Athanasius. <hi>The</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
<hi>Bishops cryed out,</hi> This is the saying of <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus (yet
these men just now were all of</hi> Cyril'<hi>s mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>)</hi> Dioscorus <hi>said,</hi> We affirm nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confusion of natures, nor division, nor conversion; Anathema <hi>to him that
doth. Doth not this shew that they all agreed in Distinction of Natures?
as also</hi> Cyril <hi>did. The Judges say, Tell us whether</hi> Cyril'<hi>s Epistles agree
to what is here reported of them (by</hi> Eustathius,) Eustathius <hi>sheweth the
Book, and saith;</hi> If I have said amiss see the Book; Anathematize <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril's</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60852:75"/>
Book and Anathematize me: <hi>The</hi> Egyptians <hi>applaud</hi> Eustathius,
<hi>saying,</hi> Eustathius <hi>reporteth</hi> Cyril'<hi>s words, in which were,</hi> We must
not understand two natures, but one incarnate nature of God the word.
<hi>And</hi> Eustathius <hi>added,</hi> He hath saith there is but one nature so as to deny
Christs flesh which is consubstantial with us, let him be <hi>Anathema:</hi> And he that
saith there are two natures to the Division of the Son of God, let him be <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.
(one would have thought this should have ended their quarrel.)
And</hi> Eustathius <hi>added of</hi> Flavianus <hi>himself, that he received these</hi> naked
words, <hi>and gave them the Emperour;</hi> Let it be ordered that his own hand be
shewed. <hi>The Judges said,</hi> Why then did ye depose him? Eustathius <hi>answered,</hi>
Erravi, I erred.</p>
               <p>§. 21. Let it be here noted, that these <hi>Eutychian</hi> words of <hi>Cyril</hi> are here
openly proved, past denial: yet shamelesly doth <hi>Binnius</hi> say, that this is
<hi>Eustathii allegatio pessima &amp; haeretica:</hi> What, to repeat a mans Words?
Secondly,<note place="margin">☞</note> Is it not here plain that they were all of a mind, and did not,
or through faction would not know it? when <hi>Eustathius</hi> by a clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
had proved it, and none of them did or could contradict
him.</p>
               <p>§. 22. Dioscorus <hi>said that</hi> Flavianus <hi>in the words following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
himself, and was deposed for holding two</hi> natures after
the union; <hi>adding,</hi> I have the testimony of the holy Fathers, <hi>Athanasius, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
Cyril,</hi> in many places, that we must not say, that after the union there are
two natures, but one incarnate nature of God, the word, I am ejected with the
Fathers; I defend the Fathers sayings; I transgress not in any thing; I have
their Testimonies, not simply or transitorily, but in Books.</p>
               <p>§. 23. <hi>Aethericus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> being questioned about his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
said, he did as he was bid. In the second Action <hi>Dioscorus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
his opinion saith, <hi>Ex duabus suscipio, duas non suscipio.</hi> That Christ
is <hi>[of two natures]</hi> but not that he <hi>[is or hath two natures.]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius Doryl.</hi>
tells him of his wrong to <hi>Flavianus</hi> and him; <hi>Dioscorus</hi> confesseth, saying,
<hi>Then offer satisfaction to God and you,</hi> meaning repentance. But <hi>Eusebius</hi>
saith, that he must satisfie the Law; And so the Verbal quarrel turneth to
Personal revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basil Seleuc.</hi> (though before accused of Heresie) well reconcileth the
Controversie at last, if they would have heard him, saying, <hi>Cognoscimus
duas Naturas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>non dividimus; neque divisas, neque confusas dicimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eutyches</hi> words at <hi>Constantinople</hi> being recited, he saith, that he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Cyril, Athanasius</hi> and the Fathers. After <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and others had
denyed what each other said in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, the saying of all the
Bishops were read, each one absolving <hi>Eutyches,</hi> in words and reasons at
large. After which the Bishops cry again, <hi>Omnes erravimus; omnes veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
mereamur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third Action many things were read that concerned their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and among the rest a Law of <hi>Theodesius jun.</hi> for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the second <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, and the condemnation of <hi>Nestorius,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60852:75"/>
and of <hi>Flavianus, Domnus, Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as <hi>Nestorian</hi> Hereticks,
deposing all of their mind, forbidding any upon pain of Confiscation to
receive them, and commanding that none read the Books of <hi>Nestorius</hi> or
<hi>Theodoret,</hi> but bring them forth to be burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So far could fierce and
factious Prelates prevail with a pious and peaceable Prince, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of opposing Heresie and Schism. <hi>Martian</hi> made Laws also clean
contrary for the justifying of the men before condemned.</p>
               <p>§. 24. <hi>In the fifth Action the</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops Petition was read (who
were accounted</hi> Eutychians, <hi>adhering to</hi> Dioscorus:) <hi>They professed their
adherence to the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>and</hi> Ephesus 1. <hi>and to</hi> Athanasius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,
<hi>and</hi> Cyril. <hi>The Bishops cryed out, Why do they not curse the
opinion of</hi> Eutiches? <hi>They offer us their Petition in imposture: They
would delude us, and so depart. Let them curse</hi> Eutyches <hi>and his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and consent to</hi> Leo'<hi>s Epistle. While they cryed out to them to curse</hi>
Eutyches, <hi>they answered (by</hi> Hieracus,) If any, whether <hi>Eutyches,</hi> or any
other, hold contrary to the things contained in our Profession <hi>(the</hi> Nicene <hi>and</hi>
Ephes. <hi>Councils)</hi> let him be accursed. But for <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistle, we must not go
before the sentence of our Archbishop <hi>(of</hi> Alexandria;) for we follow him in
all things: The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ordered that the Bishop of <hi>Egypt</hi> do nothing
without him. Eusebius Doryl. <hi>said,</hi> They lie. <hi>Others bid them</hi> prove it. <hi>Other
Bishops cryed out,</hi> openly curse the opinion of <hi>Eutyches:</hi> He that subscribeth
not <hi>Leo's</hi> Epistle to which all the holy Synod consenteth is a Heretick:<note place="margin">☜</note> Anathema
to <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> and to them that love him: How shall they chuse them a Bishop
<hi>(instead of</hi> Dioscorus) if they judge not right themselves: The <hi>Egyptian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
said,</hi> The question is about Faith, <hi>(not men:) But they cryed out so
long,</hi> Curse <hi>Eutyches</hi> or you are Hereticks, <hi>that at last the</hi> Egyptians <hi>said,</hi>
[Anathema to <hi>Eutyches</hi> and to them that believe him.] <hi>The Bishops cryed to
them</hi> [Subscribe <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistle, else you are Hereticks: <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops
answered,</hi> We cannot subscribe without the will of our Archbishop. <hi>Some said,</hi>
All the Synod must not attend for one man: They that at <hi>Ephesus</hi> disturbed all
things, would here do so too: we desire that this may not be granted them, but
they may consent to the Epistle, or receive a Canonical damnation, and know
that they are Excommunicate. Photius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Tyre <hi>said,</hi> How endeavour
they to ordain <hi>(their Arch-Bishop)</hi> who are not of the same mind with the Synod?
If they think rightly let them subscribe the Epistle, or be Excommunicate. <hi>The
Bishops cryed,</hi> We are all of this mind. <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops said,</hi> We came
not hither without a just profession of our Faith. But <hi>(as to</hi> Leo'<hi>s Epistle)</hi>
we are but few <hi>(12 Bishops)</hi> and the Bishops of our Country are very many, and
we cannot give you all their minds, or represent their persons: We beseech this
holy Synod to have mercy on us, <hi>(There is no mercy where the Bishop of</hi> Rome
<hi>is concerned)</hi> and do but stay till we have an Arch-bishop, that according to the
ancient Custome of our Country, we may follow his Iudgment: For if we break pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptiously
the the Canons and Custome, and do any thing without his will, all the
Regions of <hi>Egypt</hi> will rise up against us; therefore have mercy on our age: have
mercy on us, and put us not to end our life in banishment. The same <hi>Egyptian</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60852:76"/>
Bishops cast down themselves on the Earth, <hi>and said,</hi> You are merciful men, have
mercy on us: Cecropius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Sebast. <hi>said,</hi> The whole Synod is Greater
and worthier of credit, than the Country of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is not just that ten Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
be heard, and 1200 Bishops be past by: We bid them not shew their Faith
for others but themselves. <hi>The Bishops of</hi> Egypt <hi>cryed,</hi> Then we cannot dwell
in the Province; Have mercy on us: Eusebius Dor. <hi>said,</hi> They are procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
for the rest: The Popes <hi>Legate said,</hi> If they erre, let them be taught by
the magnificence of your footsteps, &amp;c. <hi>The</hi> Egyptians <hi>cryed,</hi> We are killed;
Have mercy on us: <hi>The Bishops all said,</hi> You see what a Testimony they give
of their Bishops, <hi>saying,</hi> we are killed there: <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops</hi> cryed, We
die by your footsteps: have pitty on us, and let us die by you, and not there. Let
but an Archbishop here be made, and we subscribe and consent, Have mercy on
our grey hairs. Give us an Archbishop here: <hi>Anatolius</hi> knoweth that it is the
Custom of our Countrey that all the Bishops obey the Archbishop: Not that we
obey not the Synod, but we are killed there in our Country: Have mercy on us;
You have the power; We are subjects; We refuse not. We had rather die by the
Lord of the World <hi>(the Emperour)</hi> or by your magnificence, or by this holy Synod,
than there. For Gods sake have pity on these grey hairs; spare ten men: We die
there: It is better die here. <hi>All the most Reverend Bishops cryed out,</hi> These
are Hereticks. <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bishops said,</hi> You have power on our lives, spare
ten men; Lords are Merciful: <hi>Anatolius</hi> knoweth the Custome; We are here
till an Archbishop be chosen: If they would have our Seats, let them take them:
We are not willing to be Bishops: Only let us not die. Give us an Archbishop, and
if we gainsay, punish us: We consent to these things which your power hath decreed;
We contradict not; but choose us an Archbishop: We here stay till it's done: <hi>All
the most Reverend Bishops clamoured,</hi> Let them subscribe to the damnation
of <hi>Dioscorus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the poor <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops that had the upper hand under <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
were in a streight between the merciless Bishops in the Synod (that
had lately at <hi>Ephesus</hi> joyned with them) and the furious Bishops and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their own Country that would have killed them when they came
home (too common a Case at <hi>Alexandria.)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> But when all their dejected
cryes and begging could get no mercy from the Bishops, the Lay Judges
had some, and moved that they may be made stay in the Town till their
Archbishop was chosen (of whom you shall hear sad work anon.) The Popes
Legate requested, <hi>That if they would needs shew them any humanity, they
should take sureties of them, not to go out of the City, till they had an Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</hi>
And so it was ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 25. The next business was with the Abbots of the Monks: They had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned</hi>
Martian, <hi>that a General Council might be called, to end their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
broils, and that without</hi> turbations, forced subscriptions or persecutions by the
secret contrivances of the Clergy, and casting men out before due judgment. <hi>And
they gave in a profession of their Faith, and petitioned that</hi> Dioscorus
<hi>might be called, because the Emperour had promised them that nothing
but the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith. should be imposed. which he professed: The Bishops
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60852:76"/>
all clamoured out their repeated Curse against</hi> Dioscorus, <hi>and their</hi> Tolle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriam
à Synodo, Tolle violentiam à Synodo, Tolle notam à Synodo, Istos mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
foras. <hi>that is,</hi> Away with them; <hi>and would not hear their petition; But
the Lay Judges made it to be read: In which the Monks profess to hold
to the</hi> Nicene Creed, <hi>and that the Church might not have discord by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
more:</hi> Protesting that if their Reverences, abusing their power, resisted this,
as before God and the Emperour, the Iudges, the Senate, and the Consciences of
the Bishops, that they shake their garments against them, and put themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their Excommunication: For they would not be Communicators with those
that thus refuse the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; <hi>The Council still urged them to subscribe</hi>
Leo'<hi>s Letter.</hi> Carosus <hi>and</hi> Dorotheus <hi>in the name of the rest of the</hi> Abbots
<hi>said;</hi> They were Baptized into the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; They knew no other: They were
bid by the Bishop that Baptized them Receive no other: We believe the Baptismal
Creed: We subscribe not the Epistle: They are Bishops; They have power to
Excommunicate and to Damn, and to do what they will more: But we know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Faith: <hi>The Arch-Deacon urged</hi> Carosus <hi>to</hi> Subscribe to <hi>Leo's</hi> Epistle
<hi>as Expository of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith, and to Curse</hi> Nestorius <hi>and</hi> Eutyches:
Carosus <hi>answered,</hi> What have I to do to curse <hi>Nestorius,</hi> that have once,
twice, thrice, and often cursed and damned him already. Aeticus <hi>said,</hi> Dost thou
curse <hi>Eytiches</hi> as the Synod doth or not? <hi>Carosus replyed.</hi> Is it not written,
Iudge not that ye be not judged? <hi>Again he repeated,</hi> that he believed the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>
Creed into which he was baptized; If they said any thing else to him he
knew it not: <hi>The Apostle saith,</hi> If an Angel from heaven preach another Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
let him be accursed: what should I do? If <hi>Eutyches</hi> believe not as the
universal Church believeth; let him be accursed.</p>
               <p>§. 26. At last there was a dissention, whether <hi>Leo</hi>'s Phrases should be
put into their Definition of Faith (now drawn up a new.) A while it was
cryed down, but at last yielded to, when the <hi>Illiricane</hi> Bishops had first
slighted <hi>Rome,</hi> and cryed, <hi>Qui contradicunt (diffinitioni)</hi> Nestoriani <hi>sunt:
Qui contradicunt Roman ambulent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Anatolius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Constantinople <hi>openly declared,</hi> That <hi>Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was not condemned for matter of belief, but because he Excommunicated
<hi>Leo,</hi> and when he was thrice summoned did not appear.</p>
               <p>§. 27. After this <hi>Theodorets</hi> turn came, that had been for <hi>Nestorius,</hi>
and the Bishops all cryed out, <hi>Let</hi> Theodoret <hi>curse</hi> Nestorius. <hi>Theodoret</hi>
desired that a Petition of his to the Emperour and to <hi>Leo</hi>'s Legate, might
be read; that they might see whether he were of their belief or not. They
cryed out, <hi>We will have nothing read; presently curse</hi> Nestorius, <hi>Theodoret</hi>
told them that he had been bred of the Orthodox, and so taught, and
preached; <hi>and was against not only,</hi> Nestorius <hi>and</hi> Eutyches, <hi>but all men else
that held not the right.</hi> The Bishops interrupted him, clamouring, <hi>speak
out plainly, cursed be</hi> Nestorius <hi>and his Opinions; cursed be</hi> Nestorius <hi>and those
that love him. Theodoret</hi> answered, <hi>I take not my self to say true, but I know
I please God: I would first satisfie you of my belief; for I seek not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I need not honour, nor come hither for that: But because I am calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60852:77"/>
I come to satisfie you that I am Orthodox; and I Anathematize every He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
that will not be converted, and</hi> Nestorius <hi>and</hi> Eutyches, <hi>and every man
that saith, there are two Sons, or thinks so, I Anathematize.</hi> The Bishops
again took this for dawbing, and cryed out, say plainly, <hi>Anathema to</hi>
Nestorius, <hi>and them which hold that which is his.</hi> Theodoret said, <hi>Vnless I
may explain my own belief, I will not say it. I believe</hi>—Here they interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all cryed out, <hi>He is a Heretick, He is a</hi> Nestorian: <hi>cast out the
Heretick.</hi> Reader, would a man have believed that were not forced by
Evidence, <hi>That this Council was of</hi> Nestorius'<hi>s mind, and confirmed his
own Doctrine of the Vnity of Christs persons and two Natures,</hi> who thus fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
cryed down <hi>Theodoret?</hi> (except as to the aptitude of the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) And is it not a doleful Thought that the worthy Bishops of the
Church, even in a General Council, should no better know the way of
peace? And do not these words here translated out of <hi>Binnius, p.</hi> 92. and
106. agree too well with <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi>'s Character of Bishops and
Councils? Not but that the Church had always some Learned, Godly,
Wise, and Peaceable Men, (such as <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> were,
and many more, especially in <hi>Africk;)</hi> but you see that they were born
down by the stream of unskilful, worldly, temporizing, violent Men;
after once worldly greatness made it the way to preferment, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
their business to strive who should be uppermost and have his
will.)</p>
               <p>But <hi>Theodoret</hi> when he found that there was no hope of so much as a
patient hearing of his Explication and Confession, was fain to yield, and
say, <hi>Anathema to</hi> Nestorius, <hi>and to him who saith not that the Virgin</hi> Mary
<hi>was the Parent of God, and who divideth the only begotten Son into two Sons;</hi>
which was yet cautelously expressed; as if he said, <hi>supposing that</hi> Nestorius
<hi>did so (which himself denyed) let him be accursed:</hi> And so <hi>Theodoret</hi> was
absolved and counted worthy to be a Bishop.</p>
               <p>§. 28. <hi>Iuvenal Hierosol. Thalassius,</hi> and the rest of the Leaders, at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi>
Council 2, were pardoned: <hi>Ibas</hi> his Epistle to <hi>Maris</hi> against <hi>Cyril</hi>
was acquit, or at least the Bishop upon the reading of it. It is a sad Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of the Calamitous Divisions which these Prelates and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
made. He said that <hi>Cyril</hi> writ against <hi>Nestorius</hi> that there was but
<hi>one nature in Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Haec omnia impietatis plena:</hi> He tells how <hi>Cyril</hi>
preposessed the Bishops before they met, and made his hatred of <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
his Cause. How he condemned <hi>Nestorius</hi> two days before <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
came: How afterward they condemned and deposed one another:
How <hi>Nestorius</hi> was in hatred with the Great men of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which
was his fall: How <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Bishops or Councils would not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with each other: How they set Bishops against Bishops, and
People against People, and a mans Enemies were those of his own house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:
How the Pagans scorned the Christians hereupon: <hi>For</hi> (saith he)
<hi>no man durst travel from City to City,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>or from Province to Province, but each
one persecuted his neighbour as his enemy: For many not having the fear of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60852:77"/>
God, by occasion of Ecclesiastical zeal, made haste to bring forth the hidden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of their hearts against others:</hi> (he instanceth in some Persecutors) and
sheweth how <hi>Paulus Emisseuus</hi> helpt to heal them.</p>
               <p>§. 29. In the eleventh Action two Bishops strive for the Bishoprick of
<hi>Ephesus, Bassianus</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> (that had been <hi>Dioscorus</hi> Agent): And in
their Pleas each of them proved that the other intruded by violence into
the place, both he that first had it, and he that thrust him out and took
his Seat, and one of them made his <hi>Clergy swear to be true</hi> to him and not
forsake him; And while the Bishops were for one of them, the Judges
past Sentence to <hi>cast out both,</hi> and all consented.</p>
               <p>§. 30. <hi>But after all the crying up of</hi> Leo'<hi>s Epistle, this Synod set so
light by</hi> Leo, <hi>as that, some say, against his Legates Will, they made a
Canon, (28.)</hi> That every where following the Decrees of the Fathers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the Canon which was lately read made by the 150 Bishops, we also
Decree the same, and determine of the Priviledges of the holy Church of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
new <hi>Rome:</hi> For the Fathers did give <hi>(or attribute)</hi> rightly the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
to the Throne of old <hi>Rome,</hi> because that City ruled <hi>(or had the Empire)</hi>
And moved by the same consideration the 150 Bishops Lovers of God, gave <hi>(or
attributed)</hi> equal Priviledges to the Throne of New <hi>Rome;</hi> rightly judging that
the City which is honoured with the Empire and the Senate, and enjoyeth equal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
with ancient Queen-<hi>Rome,</hi> should also in things Ecclesiastical be extolled
and magnified, being the second after it. <hi>The Popes Legates hand</hi> Boniface <hi>is
subscribed to all; and</hi> Eusebius Doril: <hi>thus subscribed</hi> Sponte subscripsi, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam
&amp; hane regulam sanctissimo Papae in Vrbe <hi>Roma</hi> ego relegi prescentibus Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis

over and over approved by the Roman Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 31. It in is this Canon notorious,<note place="margin">☜</note> 1. That the whole General Council
and so the universal Church did then believe, that the Popes or Roman
Priviledges were granted by the Fathers (that is, by Councils) and stood
not by divine appointment. 2. That the reason that the Fathers grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, was because it was the Imperial Seat. Had they believed that
the Apostles had instituted it, they had never said that the <hi>Fathers did it
for this reason;</hi> and that <hi>Constantinople</hi> should be equal or next it for the
same reason. 3. The Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> never claimed their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<hi>jure divino</hi> as succeeding any Apostle, and yet <hi>jure Imperii</hi> claimed
equal Priviledges. By all which it is undeniable that the whole Church
in that Council, and especially the <hi>Greeks,</hi> did ever hold <hi>Rome</hi>'s Primacy to
be a humane institution, upon a humane mutable reason. What the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
can say against this, I have fully answered against <hi>W. Iohnson</hi> in a
Book called, <hi>Which is the true Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 32. <hi>The Question now is,</hi> What concord did these late Councils procure
to the Churches?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> From that time most of the Christian World was distracted into
Factions hereticating, damning, deposing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d too many murdering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
One party cleaved to <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and were called by the other <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians;</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60852:78"/>
These cryed up the Sufficiency of the <hi>Nicene Councils Faith,</hi> as that
which they were baptized into, and would have no addition nor diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and condemned the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council, and excommunicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
those that would not Anathematize it: Those that were against
them they called <hi>Nestorians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other party were those that had cleaved to <hi>Nestorius</hi> by name,
and had been persecuted for his Cause; And these were a separate Body,
and cryed down the other as <hi>Eutychians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those called <hi>Orthodox</hi> or <hi>Catholicks</hi> cryed down <hi>Nestorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
by name, indeed defending the same Doctrine as <hi>Nestorius,</hi> except as
to the fitness of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And the chief of <hi>Nestorius</hi> his first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
perceiving that indeed they were of one judgment, united with
these against the <hi>Eutychians.</hi> I have shewed that all of them seemed to
make all this stir but about some Words which one party took in one sense
and the other in another. For these words the Bishops cast the Christian
World into confusion, destroyed Love and Unity under a pretence of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Faith; so that the Church was lamentably militant; Bishops against
Bishops, in continual enimity and rage. The Emperours at their wits end
not knowing how to end the Ecclesiastical odious Wars: And the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
hardened and deriding them all and their Religion.</p>
               <p>§. 33. When the Council was ended, and <hi>Proterius</hi> made Bishop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi>
in <hi>Dioscorus</hi> stead, the City was in so great discontent that the
Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> was fain to send a Lay-man to mollifie them; for they
would not endure a <hi>Calcedonian</hi> Bishop: They set more by <hi>Dioscorus</hi> than
before (so that <hi>Binnius</hi> incredibly saith, they offered him Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>§. 34. It was not long till <hi>Martian</hi> dyed, and then they let the World
know that it was Emperours and not Popes or Councils that they regarded.
They thought then they might shew their minds, and what they did <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
in Breviario, Evagrius, Nicephorus</hi> and others tells us at large: But I
will give it you in the words of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops which conformed to
the Council, <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 147. One <hi>Timothy Elurus</hi> of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> Party who had
gathered separated Congregations before, since the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi>
got some Bishops of his own Party to make him Archbishop: The people
soon shewed their minds though it deposed their Archbishop. They set
up <hi>Timothy,</hi> and he <q>
                     <hi>presently made Ordinations of Bishops and Clerks,</hi> &amp;c.
while he thus went on, <hi>a Captain,</hi> Dionisius, <hi>came to drive him out of the
City:</hi> The people rage the more against <hi>Proterius: He gets into the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistry
to avoid their rage,</hi> a place reverenced even by the <hi>Barbarians</hi> and
the fiercest Men: But these furious people, set on by their Bishop <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞</note>
neither reverencing the Place, the Worship, nor the Time,
(which was <hi>Easter)</hi> nor the Office of Priesthood, <hi>which is a Mediation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man, did strike the blameless Man, and kill him cruelly, with
six more; and dragging his wounded Carkess every where, and cruelly drawing
it about, almost through all the parts of the City, did mercilesly beat the sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60852:78"/>
Corps, and divided his Parts, and spared not to tast his Entrails with their
Teeth like Dogs; whom they should have thought the Mediatour of God and
Man; and casting the rest of his Body into the Fire, they scattered his Ashes
into the Wind, transcending the fierceness of all Beasts: And the Architect of
all this was</hi> (their new Bishop) <hi>Timothy;</hi> first an Adulterer (taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Church) and then a Murderer, doing it in a manner as with his own
hands, in that he bid others do it: <hi>This man ruleth the Alexandrian
Church,</hi> and going on doth worse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is in the Epistle to the Emperour <hi>Leo;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bin. p. 151.</note> The like they write in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Anatolius,</hi> adding, <q>that he Anathematized the Council of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and all that <hi>communicate with it, and received none that receive it, till
they renounce it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 35. On the other side Bishop <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Adherents wrote to <hi>Leo</hi> in
praise of their new Bishop, professing the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, and declaring
what great Concord and Peace their City now had, and craving the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
approbation of him.</p>
               <p>§. 36. In <hi>Palestine</hi> also the same Fire kindled: The Monks that had been
at <hi>Calcedon</hi> returned lamenting that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith was there betrayed,
and stirred up their Fraternity to rescind the Acts; They got together
and expelled <hi>Iuvenal</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as a Traytor to the Catholick
Faith and a Changer. The Empress <hi>Eudocia)</hi> saith <hi>Nicephorus)</hi> took their
part; and strengthned them; At <hi>Schythopolis</hi> they killed <hi>Severianus</hi> the
Bishop, they compelled men to joyn and communicate with them. At <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
they killed <hi>Athanasius</hi> a Deacon for contradicting them,<note place="margin">Niceph. l. 15. c. 19.</note> and gave
his Flesh to Dogs. <hi>Dorotheus</hi> the Emperous Lieutenant would have kept
the Peace, and they compelled him to joyn with them: But after twenty
moneths <hi>Iuvenal</hi> was restored. Thus in many Countreys the War went
on; And they that knew not the <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> thought all this was done
by Bishops and Monks: But the truth is <hi>Eudocia Theodosius</hi>'s Widow, and
<hi>Pulcheria Theodosius</hi>'s Sister and <hi>Martian</hi>'s Wife, were of two sides: And
Women had great power with Emperours, and consequently with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
But at last <hi>Pulcheria</hi> procured the conversion of <hi>Eudocia</hi> to her
side, and then she owned the Council, and then others owned it. This
was in <hi>Martians</hi> days.</p>
               <p>§. 37. The great number of Letters sent from the Bishops to <hi>Leo</hi> when
he was made Emperour, which were sent in answer to his own to them,
engaged him the more for the Council Party, and against <hi>Timothy Aelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi>
He deposed him and put <hi>Timothy Salophaciolus</hi> in his place: But the
City was all in confusion between the two <hi>Timothies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Niceph. l. 15. c. 17, 18, 19.</note> Bishops. The <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Bishops write to the Emperour against <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Eutychiane.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
sends forth his circular Letters, commanding all to own the <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Council. At <hi>Antioch Petrus Cnapheus</hi> ambitious of the Archbishoprick
got into <hi>Martyrius</hi> place; by <hi>Zeno</hi>'s help: And thinking they were still
managing only the Controversie against the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> and taking the
Orthodox for <hi>Nestorian</hi> Hereticks, all were accursed by Anathema's
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60852:79"/>
that would not say that <hi>God was crucified and suffered</hi> (The Orthodox
doing the same,) and thus they increased the Confusions. <hi>Martyrius</hi> their
true Bishop when he saw that he could do no good upon them, forsook
them, with these words, <hi>Clero rebelli, &amp; populo inobedienti, &amp; Ecclesiae
contaminatae Nuncium remitto. I renounce a rebellious Clergy, a disobedient
People, and a defiled Church. Petrus Cnapheus</hi> kept the Bishoprick, and reviled
the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council. <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour banisheth him: <hi>Stephanus</hi> a friend
to the Council is put into the place: That you may know how the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
had united the people, even the Boys were set on to kill this new
Bishop with sharp Quills.</p>
               <p>Common execution was too easie a death; Being killed they cast his
Corps into the River, for favouring the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
their desired Bishop: But <hi>Calendion</hi> succeeding him, made them
Anathematize the same <hi>Peter Cnapheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 38. While <hi>Martian</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> reigned thus, the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi>
was kept up, and almost all the Bishops were brought to subscribe to it;
But death changeth Princes, and thereby Bishops. <hi>Leo</hi> dyeth, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<hi>Zeno</hi> succeedeth him: He would fain have had his peace among
them in sensuality: <hi>Basiliscus</hi> taketh the advantage of his dissolute life,
and usurpeth the Empire, and maketh use of the Bishops Schism and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to get him a party: (For the Bishops Schisms greatly serve U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers
ends.) And first he publisheth his Circular Letters against the
Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> requiring all the Bishops to renounce it, (because
his Predecessours had been for it.)<note place="margin">☞</note> To this, saith <hi>Nicephorus, lib. 6.
cap.</hi> 4. three Patriarchs, and no fewer then five hundred subscribed, and
renounced the Council. (And yet how violently they damned all that
would not receive it, and writ for it to <hi>Leo,</hi> but a little before you
have heard.) But quickly after, <hi>Acacius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
<hi>Dau. Columnella,</hi> perswaded <hi>Basiliscus</hi> to write clear contrary Circular
Letters, Commanding all to own the Council: For they convinced him
that this was the more possible way: And these also were obeyed. But
<hi>Zeno</hi> was shortly after restored to the Empire, who was for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
And then the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops turned again, and wrote to get their
Pardon, saying, That they subscribed to <hi>Basiliscus</hi> first Letters, not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
but for fear! (O excellent Martyrs.) <hi>Niceph. l. 16. c.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>§. 39. Upon this the Council was up again, and the Bishops became
Orthodox once more: Till at last <hi>Zeno</hi> thought (as the <hi>Acacians</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
laying by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that the only way to unite these Bishops, was to
leave all free, neither forbidding any to own the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> nor
yet compelling any to it. And so he wrote an Edict of Pacification, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
the case, which he called his <hi>Henoticon:</hi> For he thought that the
Bishops would never agree either <hi>for</hi> it or <hi>against</hi> it. But yet this end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the quarrels: The fire still flamed: Liberty contented not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
They were zealous for God as against his Enemies the Hereticks:
And every Party were these Hereticks and Enemies in the judgment of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60852:79"/>
the rest. All must be damned and ruined that would not be for God, that is,
that was not of their minds. When Liberty was once up, the people
were significant, and their mind was soon known. At <hi>Antioch, Calendion</hi>
was cast out of his Seat, and <hi>Peter Cnapheus</hi> got in again. (For a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
for a Bishoprick was a War which they scrupled not.) And at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
the whole City was in confusion while <hi>Peter Moggus</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> strove
who should be Bishop. <hi>Moggus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> anathematizing the <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Council, and persecuting Dissenters, the Emperour laboureth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
them. <hi>Acacius</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though supposed Orthodox, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
with <hi>Peter Moggus:</hi> whether in obedience to <hi>Zeno</hi>'s <hi>Henoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
or weary of hereticating, and why, is not known. (O how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
were separatist Bishops in those days!) <hi>Faelix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
<hi>Acacius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for this: <hi>Acacius</hi> had equal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
given by the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council, and had the presence of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and Senate,<note place="margin">☜</note> and he again condemneth <hi>Faelix;</hi> blotting his name
out of the sacred <hi>Albe</hi> (their Book of life.)</p>
               <p>§. 40. <hi>Acacius</hi> shortly dying, the Emperour found it too hard a task
to choose a Patriarch, that should not keep up the Sedition; Therefore
he will refer the choice to God: To that end he putteth a blank paper
on the Altar, and another by it, requesting of God that an Angel
might write there the name of him that God would have to be Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch:<note place="margin">☜</note>
The doors are fast locked, and forty days Fasting and Prayer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
to prevail with God: The Keys are committed to a sure and
great Courtier, but one that was subject to Angels: One <hi>Flavitas</hi> bribeth
him, and he writeth <hi>Flavitas</hi>'s name in the paper, and sealeth up the
doors: And so there was an Arch-bishop chosen by an Angel. This man
joined with <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> by Synodal Letters, to command all to
curse the Council: and yet wrote to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Communion with <hi>Peter;</hi> and he wrote to <hi>Peter</hi> that he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Communion with the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But its fearful sporting with
God and Angels: He dyed within four Months.</p>
               <p>§. 41. After <hi>Flavitas</hi> succeeded <hi>Euphemius:</hi> He joined with the Bishop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and rased <hi>Peter</hi>'s name out of the Church Book: <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Euphemius</hi> as two Generals were about gathering Synodical Armies against
each other, and against, and for the Council. But the Foot that spurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
abroad and spoileth the Designs of Worldlings, even Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
removed <hi>Peter.</hi> One <hi>Athanasius</hi> succeedeth <hi>Peter,</hi> and fain he
would have reconciled and united his Clergy and People, but he could
not: Holy zeal is too easily quenched, but not contentious carnal zeal.
<hi>Palladius</hi> succeedeth <hi>Peter Cnapheus</hi> at <hi>Antioch:</hi> Both these great Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
join together to curse the Council of <hi>Calcedon;</hi> and down went the
Council. But death again maketh a turn, they both dye, and <hi>Iohn</hi>
succeeded at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Flavianus</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Yet these must be of
the mind of the <hi>major</hi> part, and both join also to curse the Council: And
the Patriarchs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> curse them, and are for the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60852:80"/>
Council: And thus Cursing was the Religion of the Age.</p>
               <p>§. 42. But now <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour dyeth, and <hi>Anastatius Dicorus</hi> is
chosen Emperour. <hi>Nicephorus, lib. 16. c.</hi> 25. saith, that he being a man
of peace, and desiring the ceasing of Contentions, followed <hi>Zeno</hi>'s <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticon,</hi>
and left all to their liberty to think of the Council as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Hereupon the Bishops fell into three Parties; some servent for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
word of the Council; some cursing it; and some for the <hi>Henoticon</hi>
or silent peace. The East was one way: the West another: and <hi>Lybia</hi>
another. Yea the Eastern Bishops among themselves, the Western among
themselves, and the <hi>Lybian</hi> among themselves, renounced Communion
with one another. <hi>Nicephor. c. 25. Tanta confusio mentium<expan>

and blindness of mind befell the whole world:</hi> This was the Effect even
of Liberty.</p>
               <p>§. 43. The Emperour resolving to keep peace did purpose to fall on
the most unpeaceable whoever, even on both sides. At <hi>Constantinople</hi> he
put out <hi>Euphemius:</hi> (as some thought upon a personal dislike or quarrel:)
For before his inthornizing they say he had given under his hand to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemius</hi>
a promise that he would stand for the Council; and when he
had possession he demanded up his Writing: <hi>Euphemius</hi> denyed it him,
and was cast out: <hi>Macedonius</hi> succeeded him, and got the Writing: The
Emperour demanded it also of him; he also denyed it: The Emperour
would have also put him out: The people rose up in Sedition, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>It is a time of Martyrdom, let us all stick to the Bishop:</hi> And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
the Emperour, calling him a <hi>Manichee,</hi> and unworthy of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The Emperour was forced hereby to submit to <hi>Macedonius,</hi> lest
he should have lost all: The Bishop sharply rebuked him as the Churches
Enemy. But these things made the Emperour more against the Council,
partly as more against him; and when he saw time, he remembred <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi>
and cast him out: yea he put <hi>Timothy</hi> in his place, and burnt the
Councils Acts. <hi>Timothy</hi> pulled down the Images of <hi>Macedonius.</hi> The
Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch:</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were all cast out.</p>
               <p>§. 44. <hi>Peter Cnapheus Antioch</hi> had made one <hi>Zenaias</hi> a Persian Servant
and unbaptized, Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis.</hi> This man was against Images and
against the Council. He brought a Troop of Monks to <hi>Antioch</hi> to force
<hi>Flavianus</hi> the Bishop to curse the Council; <hi>Flavianus</hi> refuseth: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
stuck to the Bishop, and disputed the case with such unanswerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that so great a number of the Monks were slain, as that they
threw their Bodies into the River <hi>Orontes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> to save the labour of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. <hi>Niceph. 16. c.</hi> 27. But this endeth not the dispute; another
Troop of Monks of <hi>Coelo-syria,</hi> that were of <hi>Flavianus</hi> and the Councils
side, hearing of the tumult, and the danger of the Bishop, flock to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and made another slaughter, as great (saith <hi>Nicephorus)</hi> as the
former.</p>

§. 45. The Murders done by Bishops and Christians were sometimes
punished by Excommunication, but not by Death in those prosperous
times of the Church: The Emperour hereupon did banish <hi>Flavianus,</hi> which
his followers took for persecution; <hi>Peter Alex.</hi> being dead the Bishops of
<hi>Alex. Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> fell all into pieces among themselves, each having
their separate Conventions. The rest of the East also separated from the
<hi>West,</hi> because the <hi>West</hi> would not Communicate with them, unless they
would Curse <hi>Nestorius, Eutyches, Dioscorus, Moggus</hi> and <hi>Acacius:</hi> And
yet saith <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> l. 16. c. 28. <hi>Qui germani Dioscori &amp; Eutychetes sectatores

the contrary: <hi>Flavian</hi> was unwilling, but his timerous fellow-Bishops per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him, and he wrote his Curse against them, and sent it to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
<hi>Xenaias</hi> then went farther, and required him to Curse the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
The <hi>Isaurian</hi> Bishops were drawn to consent to Anathematize it. The
refusers are all renownced as <hi>Nestorians.</hi> And thus the Council that Curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Nestorius,</hi> is Cursed of <hi>Nestorian:</hi> The <hi>Eutychians</hi> perceiving how near
they were agreed.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Flavian,</hi> one <hi>Severus</hi> got to be Bishop at <hi>Antioch</hi> (a severe Enemy
of the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> and of the Council.) The first day when he was got in, he
cursed the Council, though 'tis said that he had sworn to the Emperour
that he would not: <hi>Niceph. lib. 16. cap.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Palestine</hi> the Condemnation or Ejection of <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
renewed their distractions and divisions.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Antioch, Severus</hi> grew so earnest, and wrote such Letters to the
Bishops under him, as frighted many against their Judgements, to Curse
the Council, and those that held <hi>two Natures,</hi> as Hereticks: Some Bishops
stood out and refused; some fled from their Churches for fear. The <hi>Isauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Bishops, when they had yielded, repented, and when they had repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they Condemned <hi>Severus,</hi> that drove them to subscribe. Two stout
Bishops, <hi>Cosmas,</hi> and <hi>Severianus,</hi> sent a Sealed Paper to <hi>Severus;</hi> and
when he opened it, he found it was a Condemnation under their Hands.
The Emperour had notice of it, and he being angry, that they presumed
to Condemn their Patriarchs, sent his Procurator to cast them out of their
Bishopricks, (himself at last being against the Council.) The Procurator
found the People so resolute, and bent to Resistance, in defence of their
Bishops: That he sent word to the Emperour, that these two Bishops
could not be cast out, without bloud-shed. The Emperour sent him word,
that he would not have a drop of bloud shed for the business; for he did
what he did for peace.</p>
               <p>§. 46. <hi>Helias,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> found all the other Churches in
such Confusion, the Bishops Condemning one another; that he would
Communicate with none of them, save <hi>Euphemius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> (before
his Ejection) <hi>Niceph. c.</hi> 32. The Monks were engaged for the Council by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60852:81"/>
such a means as this. One <hi>Theodosius,</hi> a Monk (or Abbot) gathering a
great assembly,<note place="margin">☞</note> lowdly cryed out in the Pulpit to them. <hi>[If any man equal not

Voice of their Captain, resolved the Monks; and they thenceforth took
it as a Law, that the four Councils should be <hi>saoris libris accensenda,</hi> added
or joyned with the sacred Books. And they wrote to the Emperour,

the Conflict for them, even to blood: Thus Monks and Bishops then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

the Orthodox Bishops, tumultuously cast the Emperours Souldiers out of
the Church, <hi>Niceph. c.</hi> 34. After this, they had another Contention, and
there Anathematized those that adhered to <hi>Severus.</hi> The Emperour more
provoked by all this, sent <hi>Olympius</hi> with a band of Souldiers to Conquer
them: <hi>Olympius</hi> came, and cast out Bishop <hi>Helias,</hi> and put in <hi>Iohn.</hi> The
Monks gather again,<note place="margin">☞</note> and the Souldiers bieng gone, they come to <hi>Iohn,</hi>
and make him engage himself to be against <hi>Severus,</hi> and to stand for the
Council, though it were unto Blood: He yielded to the Monks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himself to the Council, and brake his Word made to <hi>Olympius.</hi>
The Emperor is angry with <hi>Olympius</hi> for doing his Work no better; and
puts him out, and sendeth another Captain <hi>Anastatius;</hi> who came and
put the Bishop <hi>Iohn</hi> in Prison and Commanded him to despise the Council:
<hi>Iohn</hi> consulting with another Bishop craftily promised to obey him, if he
would but let him out of Prison, two days before, that it might not seem a
forced act. This being done, the Bishop on the contrary in the Pulpit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Captain and the People, cryeth out <hi>If any man assent to</hi> Eutyches,
<hi>and</hi> Nestorius, (Contraries) <hi>and</hi> Severus, <hi>and</hi> Soterichus, Caesariansis,
<hi>let him be Anathema: If any follow not the Opinions of the four Vniversal Synods
let him be Anathema.</hi> The Captain seeing himself thus deluded, fled from
the Multitude and was glad to save himself, the Emperour being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more at this. The Bishops write to him, <hi>that at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>the Fountain of
Doctrine, they were not now to learn the truth,</hi> and that <hi>they would defend the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
if need <hi>be even to blood,</hi> Niceph. 16. c. 34.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Bishop <hi>Timothy</hi> would please both sides, and pleased
neither: To some he spake for the Council, to others he Cursed it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make an Abbot, the Man refused his Election, unless he consented
to the Council of <hi>Calcedon: Timothy</hi> presently Cursed those that received
not the Council. His Arch-deacon hearing him, reproached him, that
like <hi>Euripus</hi> roled every way. The Emperour hearing it, rebuked him:
And <hi>Timothy</hi> washt away the Charge, and presently Cursed every one that
received the Council, <hi>Niceph. l. 8. c.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>§. 47. But what did <hi>Rome</hi> all this while? It were too long to recite
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60852:81"/>
their proper History: They were for the Council, and they had other
kind of Conflicts: The <hi>Goths</hi> held them in Wars, and had conquered them,
and <hi>Theodorick</hi> reigned there as King, and so they were broken off from
the Empire: <hi>Arians</hi> ruled them, who yet if <hi>Salvian</hi> say true, did (after)
shame the Orthodox in point of Temperance, Truth, and Justice.</p>
               <p>But besides their following greater Schisms, this Schism also did reach
to them. <hi>Festus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator was sent by <hi>Theodorick</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
on an Embassie: which having done, he desired of the Emperour
that <hi>Constantinople</hi> might keep the Festival days of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (which
they did not before) as they did at <hi>Rome;</hi> and he prevailed: And he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
assured the Emperour, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Honoticon</hi> (to suspend the consenting to the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council)
and would subscribe it. When this Ambassadour came home the Pope
was dead. To make good his Word to the Emperour, he got a party to
choose <hi>Laurentius</hi> Pope, who would receive the <hi>Honoticon:</hi> The People
chose <hi>Symmachus</hi> their Bishop.<note place="margin">☜</note> And so there were two Popes settled, and
the sedition continued three years, not without Slaughter, Rapines, and
other Calamities: <hi>Nicephor. cap. 35. Theodorick</hi> an <hi>Arian,</hi> more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
than the Popes, would not deprive them of their liberty of choice,
but called a Synod, to judge which was the rightful Bishop, and upon
their judgment confirmed <hi>Symmachus:</hi> But <hi>Laurentius</hi> loth to lose the prey,
stirred up the People to Sedition, and thereupon was quite degraded.
This was a beginning of Schisms at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 48. The Emperour at <hi>Constantinople</hi> favouring the addition <hi>[Qui
crucifixus est pro nobis,]</hi> the People who disliked it, seditiously cut off a
Monks head, and set it upon a pole, inscribing <hi>[An Enemy to the Trinity.]</hi>
The Emperour overcome and wearied with their Confusions, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Murders and Rebellions; called an Assembly, and offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
his Empire, desiring them to choose another: This smote them with
remorse, and they desired him to reassume his Crown, and promised to
forbear Sedition: But he dyed shortly after.</p>
               <p>§. 49. Anno 452. Valentinian <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour attempted a great
alteration with the Bishops, by a Law recalling the Judicial Power of the
Bishops in all Causes, except those of</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Religion, <hi>unless the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
contending voluntarily chose them for the Judges. This</hi> Binnius <hi>(and
the other Papists) take for a heinous injury to the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> In all mens
judgment, <hi>saith</hi> Binnius, it is absurd that the Sheep should judge his Shepherd:
If to day the Pretor stand at the Tribunal of the Bishop, and to morrow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

punish the servants of the highest judge, and consecrated men: who will not say
that this is most absurd?</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This sheweth what Church-grandure and power these men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect;
If they have not the Civil power, and be not Magistrates or Lords

Hath God no Servants but the Clergy?</p>
               <p>2. By this rule both Princes and People should be free from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

therefore should not be judged by Bishops.</p>
               <p>3. But what a wicked rebellious doctrine is intimated in the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that <hi>Princes are Earthly Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Prelates are the servants of the

power more past all dispute?</p>
               <p>4. And what absurdity is it, <hi>that every soul be subject to the higher power?</hi>
And that he that's one of your Sheep in one respect, may be your Ruler in

his <hi>Tutor?</hi> And why not of him that is his <hi>Priest.</hi> Was not <hi>Solomon</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of <hi>Abiathar</hi> when he displaced him? May not one man judge who
is fit or unfit for Church Communion, and another judge who is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the sword? Did Christ come to set up a Ministry instead of a
Magistracy? He that saith, Man who made me a Judge, came not to
put down Judges: He that saith, By me Kings reign, came not to put
down all Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Christ sets up a Kingdome of Priests, or a Royal Priesthood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But his Kingdom is not of this World, or Worldly: It is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Kingdome, conquering sin and Satan, putting down the World out of
our hearts, and making us hope for the everlasting Kingdom which we
shall shortly enjoy. The Disease of the Disciples that strove who should
be greatest, and sit at the right and left hand, and said, Lord wilt thou
at this time restore the Kingdom to <hi>Israel,</hi> hath prevailed after all this
warning on a Worldly Clergy, to the great calamity of the Church.
And what wonder, when even then St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All seek their own</hi>
(too much) <hi>and none the things of Iesus Christ</hi> (so naturally as <hi>Timothy</hi>
did) and so zealously as they ought. Too many Popes haue been <hi>Peters</hi>
Successours in the Character given him, <hi>Mat. 16. Get thee behind me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
Thou art an offence unto me; For thou savourest not the things that be of
God, but those that be of men.</hi> I understood not who were the spring of
our late Fifth-Monarchy mens diseases, till I read <hi>Campanella de Regno
Dei,</hi> and some such Papists, where I see that <hi>Christs reign by his Vicar
the Pope over all the Princes and People of the World,</hi> is the true Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
Heresie; For which they bring the same Prophecies as the Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
do for their Expectations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Pope, Prelates and Clergy (called the Church) are not to reign
by deposing Kings, but by Ruling them and being above them: As Love is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Law, which yet is made for the ungodly that want Love, and must be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60852:82"/>
ruled by fear; so Princes are for the World of unbelievers, but not for the
Church and Spiritual persons who live above them in the life of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This was one of the first Heresies which the Apostles wrote
against: Many tempted Christians then to think that Christianity freed
them from service and subjection and made all equal: But how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
frequently and earnestly, do <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> condemn it? Is it not a
shame to hear such Papists as cry up such a Heresie as this, cry down
and damn a <hi>Nestorian,</hi> or an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> or a <hi>Monothelite,</hi> for an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
use of a word? <hi>Paul</hi> saith, He that teacheth otherwise (against sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection)
is proud, knowing nothing, but doting.</p>
               <p>2. Love doth indeed set us above Fear, and Legal threats so far as
it prevaileth: But it is imperfect in all, and Fear still necessary.</p>
               <p>3. And this taketh not down either the Law or Magistracy to us, but
only maketh us less need such means. It's one thing to love and live
so holily and justly as never to need or fall under the sword of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
and another thing to be freed from subjection and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This increaseth in many the opinion, that the Papal Kingdom is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,
in that they set up themselves above Rulers that are called
Gods.</p>
               <p>3. But why must this priviledge extend to the Clergy only? Have
not other Christians as much holy love, and spirituality, as most of them?
And must Princes rule only Infidels?</p>
               <p>Some suspect none as inclining to Popery, but those that take up some
of their Doctrines of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Images, &amp;c. But
they that on pretence of the raising of the Church, and defending its
power, do first call the Clergy only the Church, and then seek to make
themselves the Lords of Princes, by the pretences of an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Power, and plead themselves from under them, and take it for
their priviledges to be free from subjection to them and their penal
Laws, are doubtless levened with that Popish Heresie, which hath done
much of all the mischiefs, which the forecited History describeth.</p>

dyed so, but after eleven years <hi>Misenus</hi> repented, and was absolved by
a Council of 55 Bishops: (might not the Pope alone have done it?)</p>
               <p>§. 64. CXLII. You have heard before how <hi>Festus</hi> got <hi>Laurentius</hi> the
Arch-presbyter chosen Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> and more chose <hi>Symmachus: Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
an <hi>Arian</hi> being King was just, and had so much wit as to please the
Clergy while his Kingdom was unsettled. The Pope, under his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
excommunicated both Emperour and Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for
Communicating with Hereticks;<note place="margin">☜</note> but he never excommunicated <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
at home, though an <hi>Arian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> There was reason for it: Interest is such

the Senate, the Clergy, and the People, five or six several Councils
are called at <hi>Rome,</hi> mostly to heal this rupture: For at first the <hi>Laurenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
laid some Crimes to the charge of <hi>Symmachus;</hi> and when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils

many being killed, and all in confusion: So that it was work enough in
three years for King and Council to end the Schism.</p>

the King, contriving which way to root out the Orthodox with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violence;<note place="margin">☜</note> he commanded that when any Bishop dyed, no other
should be ordained in their places. Hereupon the Nonconformists seeing
the Churches like to decay, <hi>ann.</hi> 504. held a Synod, in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
and do their that though they suffered death for it they would go on, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
Office; concluding that either the mind of the King
would be mollified, or else they should have the Crown of Martyrdom.
This is called <hi>Concilium Byzacenum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 66. It is greatly to be noted, that many following Councils in <hi>Spain,
France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> which were held under the <hi>Gothish</hi>
Kings, were more pious and peaceable than the rest fore-described. The
Reasons seem to me to be these: 1. These Kings being conquering <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the Bishops durst not damn them for Heresie, for fear of their own
necks; and so were greatly restrained from the hereticating work of
Councils. 2. These Kings having a narrower Dominion than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60852:85"/>
and being jealous of their new gotten Conquests, were nearer the
Bishops, and kept them more in awe than the Emperour did. 3. And
these Councils being small (of a few Bishops) had no such work for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy
and ambition, as the great General Councils had: 4. And the
great proud pretending Patriarchs that set the World in a continual
War, were not here to strive who should be the greatest. The Pope
himself was seldom mentioned in the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Councils, or
the <hi>African.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 67. CXLIV. One of these honest Councils is <hi>Agathense</hi> by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Alaricus,</hi> by 35 Bishops, <hi>Casarius Arelatensis</hi> being chief:
Where many Canons for the Clergy were made or repeated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>3d</hi> Canon is, that if <hi>Bishops wrongfully excommunicate any one, other
Bishops shall receive them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> (Did the Popes observe this with <hi>Acacius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemius,</hi>
&amp;c.) Can. 63. <hi>If any Citizens on the great solemnities, that it,
Easter, the Lords Nativity, or Whitsuntide, shall neglect to meet where the
Bishops are, (seeing they are set in Cities for Benediction and Communion,) let
them be three years deprived of the Communion of the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> (Doth not
this prove that the City Churches then met all in one place, and so were
but one Assembly at those times? How else could all the Citizens be with
the Bishop at one time?) But even these Canons forbid Clergy-men to
sue any before a Secular Judge, or to appear or answer at anothers
suit, Can. 32. Otherwise both are to be excommunicate, Can. 37. It
punisheth those that kill men, but with denying them Communion. Can.
50. Only if a Bishop, Presbyter, or Deacon, commit a <hi>Capital crime,
he shall be deposed and put into a Monastery, and have but Lay-communion.</hi>
(When Murderers are hang'd, and Trayters also quartered, this Canon
is laid aside.) I thought a <hi>Monastery</hi> had been a <hi>desirable</hi> place, and not
bad enough to serve Traytors and Murderers instead of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>§. 68. CXLV. A Council at <hi>Apanna</hi> under <hi>Sigismund</hi> King of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
recited such like Canons as the former: save that there is one
just such as our Fanaticks in <hi>England</hi> would have made, who would not
worship God in any Temple which the Papists had used to their Mass:
so faith Can. 33. <hi>The Temples (or Churches) of Hereticks, which we hate
with so great execration, we despise to apply to holy uses, as judging their
pollution to be such as cannot be purged away. But such as by violence they
took from us we may recover.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> This is just <hi>Down with the Idolatrous Steeple-houses.</hi>
But if they would give the Nonconformists in <hi>England</hi> leave to
Preach in such places, they would be thankful, and think God will not
impute the sin of others to us.</p>
               <p>§. 69. CXLVI. A Council at <hi>Sidon</hi> of 80 Bishops, was called by the
Emperour <hi>Anastasius,</hi> where they agreed to curse the Council of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60852:85"/>
and <hi>Flavianus Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Iohan. Paltens.</hi> were banished for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing.
This was about the time when the foresaid Fight was between
the Monks and the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> when the Carkasses of the <hi>Eutychian</hi>
Monks were cast into the River.</p>
               <p>§. 70. About this time was the fall and rise of the Papacy. The
fall, in that the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire made little use of Popes, but did their
Church work without them. Their rise, in that the <hi>Western</hi> Empire
and <hi>Africa</hi> being divided between many late conquering Kings, they all
labour to settle themselves in a peaceable possession by pleasing the
Clergy, who, as they found, had no small interest in the People.</p>
               <p>§. 71. CXLVII. <hi>Hincmazus</hi> in the life of <hi>Remigius,</hi> tells us of a
strange thing done at a Council at <hi>Rhemes;</hi> that one <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
all the rest to dispute, and when <hi>Rhemigius</hi> came in would not
rise to him, but upon the shaddow of <hi>Remigius</hi> passing by him, he was
struck dumb, and falling at <hi>Rhemigius</hi> feet, by signs askt pardon, and
was suddenly cured of his dumbness and Heresie, confessing the Deity of
Christ.</p>
               <p>§. 72. CXLVIII. Because <hi>Iohan. Nicopolit.</hi> did but call some of his
Bishops to flatter the Pope, and to curse all Heresies and <hi>Acacius,</hi> this
is put in among the Councils. But the <hi>Concil. Tarracense, Anno</hi> 516.
seems more regardable (under <hi>Theodorick)</hi> where the Clergy are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<hi>from buying cheaper and selling dearer</hi> than others, (this it seems
grew to be a part of their priviledges.) and <hi>from judging causes on the
Lords day:</hi> And it is ordered that the Bishop send a Presbyter one week,
and a Deacon another, to the Country Congregations, and to visit them
himself once a year, because by the old custome he is to have a third
part of all the Church profits.</p>

our Corporations with the Neighbour Villages? And if one of our
Bishops that have above a thousand Parishes, or many hundred, should

not our Bishops be yet richer men than they are? Especially if they that
confine Bishops to Cities, could get a Prince to call no Corporation a
City but one or two in a Kingdom, and be as the <hi>Abuna</hi> is in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
that hath the thirds of all the Ecclesiastical benefits in the Empire. This
Council had ten Bishops.</p>
               <p>§. 73. CXLIX. The <hi>Concillium Gerundense</hi> is next, <hi>Anno</hi> 517. under
<hi>Theodorick;</hi> It consisted of seven Bishops, (Bishopricks began to grow
so big, that they could not so suddenly meet by the scores and hundreds
as when every Church was known by one <hi>Altar</hi> and one <hi>Bishop,</hi> as <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:60852:86"/>
speaks.) The seven men made Canons, that the same Liturgy
should be used in the other Churches of that Province as were used in
the Metropolitan Church.<note place="margin">☞</note> (For formerly every Bishop in his own Church
did pray as he thought best, without Imposed or agreed Uniformity
of many Churches, much less of all in a Nation.) They Decree also
that Litanies be used on the Kalends of <hi>November.</hi> A Litany then signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
a solemn supplicating of God by the People Assembled, Fasting,
Walking, Singing, and Praying, as is used here in the Rogation Week:
sometime they walked to the Memorial of some Martyr, sometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the streets, oft bare foot, continuing it with Fasting for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
times. The Last Canon is, <hi>That the Priests say the Lords Prayer
twice a Day, Morning and Evening.</hi> (That was a short Liturgy.)</p>
               <p>§. 74 CL. When <hi>Iustin</hi> was made Emperour, the Bishops turned in
the <hi>East,</hi> and down went the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> and a Synod of 40 Bishops
at <hi>Constantinople</hi> resolved that the Names of <hi>Euphemius</hi> and <hi>Macedonius</hi>
should be restored into the Dyptick (their Book of life) and that <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
should be condemned with his Adherents.</p>
               <p>§. 75. The Case hath been oft intimated before; In those times when
all the Empire was in confusion between <hi>Eutychians,</hi> and the Orthodox,
and some Emperours took one side, and some the other, and some in
vain endeavoured peace: The Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> were
more <hi>Eutychian</hi> than <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though the Emperour that favoured the
<hi>Eutychians</hi> were present: <hi>Acacius</hi> was Orthodox, but pleased the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
so far as to Communicate with, or not curse and excommunicate
the Bishops of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For this, as you have oft heard,
the Pope Excommunicated him, and he so dyed (having done as much
for the Pope.) <hi>Euphemius</hi> and <hi>Macedonius</hi> that succeeded were both Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
and commanded by the Emperour to Communicate with the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi>
and persecuted, and both cast out by him, for not obeying him,
as is before described in that and another such matter: The Pope had
required them to blot <hi>Acacius</hi> name out of the Dyptick: The Court,
Clergy, and People were against it, thinking it arrogancy in one man,
to Excommunicate the Patriarch of the Imperial City that was Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
upon his personal revenge or quarrel: They obeyed not the Pope:
The Pope is against them for not cursing a dead Orthodox Bishop <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacius:</hi>
The Emperour was against them for being against the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians,</hi>
as the Pope was for not being more against both them,
and all that did not curse them as much as he did, Were not
these Bishops in a hard case? Both agree to their extirpation, and
when they were dead to damn their names: But the Clergy and People
agreed not. The <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches were hereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divided.
(that is, <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Rome.)</hi> Is not the Christian World beholden

That will rather divide the Christian World, than endure the names of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60852:86"/>
Orthodox persecuted Bishops to be honoured when they are dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not blot out and abhor the name of another dead Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Bishop their Predecessour, when the Pope cursed him for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with an <hi>Eutychian.</hi> I know the Papists will cry up, <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Faith and Purity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But if ever any did overdo the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
that reproved Christ for eating with Publicans and Sinners: If
ever any became Plagues of the World, by being <hi>Wise, Orthodox, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
overmuch,</hi> and made use of the name of <hi>Faith,</hi> to destroy <hi>Faith,
Love, Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and cryed up the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi>
to destroy the Church and Unity, and crumble it into Sects and
Factions; it is certainly these men.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> that thus began their separation by the spirit
of Pride and Envy that <hi>Rome</hi> had against the growing greatness of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
continue their Division to this day; And it hath been no small
cause of the ruin of the Empire and the Christian Cause, and delivering

than that he should not have his will upon an Orthodox dead mans name.

<hi>Amantius</hi> was one of the Greatest men, but uncapable of the
Empire, because he was an Eunuch: He gave a great sum of Money
to <hi>Iustine,</hi> to hire the Souldiers to choose <hi>Theocritus,</hi> his bosom friend:
<hi>Iustine</hi> with that Money hired them to choose himself, and quieted
<hi>Amantius</hi> and <hi>Theocritus,</hi> by murdering them both. And because <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi>

However by going on such a Message for real Hereticks, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
with what sincerity the Popes prosecuted the dead names of the
three Orthodox <hi>Constant.</hi> Bishops, on pretence of zeal against Heresie:
When their interest urgeth them,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Let the World be set on fire rather than
you shall speak favourably of an</hi> Eutychian: But when interest changeth, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they in</hi> Italy <hi>shall suffer,</hi> John <hi>goeth to</hi> Constantinople <hi>for favour
to the</hi> Arians. Suppose he did not speed: What went he thither for? On
this provocation, <hi>Theodorick,</hi> on other quarrels, put to death <hi>Symmachus,</hi>
and his Son-in-law <hi>Boetius, Roman</hi> Senators and excellent men, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
<hi>Iohn</hi> when he returned, and in the prison he dyed: And when
he was dead the <hi>Arian</hi> King chose <hi>Foelix</hi> the fourth Pope: Was this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
valid? If yea, he that is strongest, though a Heretick may choose the
Pope? If not, than their succession was then interrupted.</p>
               <p>§. 81. CLIV. We have next a great Council called <hi>Ilerdense</hi> of eight
Bishops ander <hi>Theodorick.</hi> to mend some faults of the Clergy, <hi>viz.</hi> That
they that Minister at the Altar abstain from mans blood, <hi>Can.</hi> 1. That
they that commit Adultery, and take Medicines, or give them to cast the
Birth, or that Murder the Child, shall abstain from Communion seven
yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>: And if they be of the Clergy, must be content with the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Chore without their Office, <hi>Can.</hi> 2. None shall draw an
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60852:87"/>
offender, though a Servant out of the Church, (nor say other Canons
out of the Bishops house) that flyeth thither for any Crime (The Church
and Bishops Houses had the priviledge to be the harbour for murderers,
Thieres, Traytors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But <hi>Can.</hi> 11. alloweth the Bishop to punish them
more than others (with longer forbearing the Sacrament) if those of the
Clergy murder one another: O severe Laws!</p>
               <p>§. 82. CLV. Next we have a Council (not all so great, having but six
Bishops) under <hi>Theodorick,</hi> that ordered that the Epistle should be read

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>fore the Gospel, and some things like others.</p>
               <p>§. 83. CLVI. And four ordinary sayings, were said over again by fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Bishops at <hi>Aules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 84. <hi>It seems the</hi> Semepelagians <hi>then much prevailed: For one</hi> Lucian
<hi>made a Recantation of his Errors to a Council of 17 Bishops at</hi> Lyons, <hi>as
urged by them: One of his supposed errors was, that</hi> Some are deputed to
death, and others predestinate to Life; <hi>and another, that</hi> none of the Gentiles
before Christ were saved by the light of Nature: <hi>And now he owneth:</hi> That
in the order of times, some were saved by the Law of Grace, others by the Law,
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and others by the Law of Nature; But none ever freed from Original
Sin, but by holy blood.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Faustus Rheg.</hi> against the <hi>Praedestinarians</hi> was owned by the foresaid
Council at <hi>Arles, Bin. p.</hi> 386.</p>
               <p>§. 85 <hi>Theodorick</hi> made the Clergy Subject to Civil Judicatures; allowing
them their liberty of Religion: When he dyed (of whose Soul in Hell
they pretend visions) his successours <hi>Athalaricus,</hi> for the quiet possession
of his Kingdom, at the Clergies Complaint of this as an injury, was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to restore them to their Dominion, and Freedom from subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>§. 86. <hi>Iustinian</hi> succeeding <hi>Iustin,</hi> (by his choice) Compileth the Laws
into better order then before, and to the great advantage of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Clergy, and against Heresies: And yet two things trouble the Papists
in them. 1. That he seemeth to pretend to a Power over the Church
Laws. But their shift is to say that he did it but as a defence and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bishops Laws. 2. That he restored the Names of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors'
<hi>Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Anastasius,</hi> with Notes of Piety and Honour; whom
the Popes had presumed to damn as <hi>Eutychians</hi> or <hi>Toleraters</hi> of them: But
for this they say; It was the doing of <hi>Tribonianus,</hi> a Heathen Lawyer, that
did the work: As if <hi>Iustinian</hi> would let him do what he disliked, and not
correct it.</p>
               <p>§. 87. When <hi>Iustinian</hi> resolved to set up the Council of <hi>Calcedon;</hi> he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60852:88"/>
Cursed <hi>Severus,</hi> and deposed the two Patriarchs, <hi>Anthimius</hi> of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and <hi>Theodosius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for they were both <hi>Eutychians: Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
had perswaded them rather to forsake all worldly interest, than the
Faith (as he called it.) But here I cannot see how the Historians (as <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius)</hi>
will be reconciled with themselves; that say, <hi>Iustin</hi> caused <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
Tongue to be pulled out; and yet, that he afterward perswaded <hi>Anthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
at <hi>Const.</hi> unless he did it only by writing.</p>
               <p>§. 88. So far was <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s resolution, and power, from reconciling
the Bishops of the Empire, that he could not keep Unity, in his own House
or bed: For his Wife <hi>Theodora,</hi> was firm to the <hi>Eutychians;</hi> and cherished
them, as he did the Orthodox, and both with so great constancy, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrius</hi>
suspecteth they did it politickly, by agreement, (for the peace of
the Empire) that each party might be kept in dependance on
them.</p>
               <p>§. 89. An Insurrection in <hi>Constantinople</hi> occasioned the killing
of about thirty thousand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Evag.</hi> l. 4. c. 10. 11. and <hi>Nicep.</hi> l. 17. c. 7.</note> saith <hi>Evagrius c.</hi> 13. out of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 90. About this time a miracle is spoken of so credibly, that I think
it not unfit to mention it: <hi>Hunnerikus</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> being an <hi>Arian, Goth</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
the Orthodox Bishops, especially on pretences that they refused
to swear fidelity to him, and his Son: (say some) They were forbidden to
preach, and for not obeying, or for Nonconformity; the Tongues of
many were cut out, who they say did speak freely after as before: It
were hard to be believed; But three Historians I have read that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that they saw, and heard the men themselves, <hi>viz. Victor Vticensis Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeas
Gazaeus de Anima, &amp; Procopius in Evagrius, l. 4. c.</hi> 14. Who yet add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that two of them upon some sinfulness with Women, lost their speech
and remained dumb. <hi>Nicephor.</hi> saith <hi>Rem cum foeminis habuissent:</hi> Alas, that
miracles will not prevent Sin.</p>
               <p>§. 91. In the eleventh year of <hi>Iustinian, Athalaricus</hi> being dead, and
<hi>Theodatus</hi> a Kinsman succeeding, this man loving books better than War,
yielded up <hi>Rome</hi> and the Crown to <hi>Bellisarius Iustinians</hi> General; and so
after the <hi>Gothes</hi> had kept it 60 years, it was restored without a drop of
blood, saith <hi>Evagrius l. 4. c.</hi> 18. But when <hi>Bellisarius</hi> went away <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Gothes</hi> again, <hi>c.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>§. 92. Three several Countries about that time, received the Christian
Faith, much through the Reverence of <hi>Iustinians</hi> power, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Heruli,</hi>
the <hi>Abasgi,</hi> and they of <hi>Tanais, Evagr. c.</hi> 19. 21. 22. But the grievous
Wars and Successes of <hi>Cosroes</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> in the East, and a plague of fifty
two years continuance, which destroyed a great part of mankind, took
down much of the <hi>Roman</hi> Glory.</p>

§. 93. CLVII. A second <hi>Concillium Aransicanum</hi> Condemned <hi>Semepelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme,</hi>
propagated by <hi>Faustus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rhegrim,</hi> after <hi>Prosp.</hi> who had

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sense</hi> of ten Bishops, decreed that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Priest should breed up young Readers, who may marry at age; that
the parish Priests shall preach, or in their absence, the Deacon read a Sermon:
That <hi>Lord have mercy on us</hi> be often said: That <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> be oft
said: That, <hi>As it was in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. be oft said.</p>
               <p>§. 95. CLIX. A Synod of 16 Bishops at <hi>Carpenteracte</hi> decreed that the
Bishop of the City should not take all the Countrey Parish maintenance to
himself.<note place="margin">☜</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. 96. CLX. As <hi>Faelix</hi> was chosen Pope by <hi>Theodorick;</hi> so <hi>Athalaricus</hi>
claiming the same power, chose after him <hi>Boniface</hi> the second: An <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Heretick made the Pope. Others not willing of the Kings Choice, chose
<hi>Dioscorus;</hi> so there are two Popes: But <hi>Dioscorus</hi> quickly dyeth; and
<hi>Boniface</hi> Condemneth him when he is dead, on some pretence of money
matters, as Simoniacal; and calling a Synod, appointeth <hi>Virgilius</hi> a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
his Successor. After he calleth another Synod, to undo this Choice,
upon his Repentance; and shortly after dyeth himself. <hi>Agapetus</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, absolveth the dead man <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> whom <hi>Boniface</hi> Cursed:
such work did Church-Cursing then make, as the Engine of Ambition.</p>
               <p>§. 97. CLXI. A Council of 8 Bishops at <hi>Toletane,</hi> said somewhat again to
keep Bishops from Women, and from giving their Lands from the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 98. CLXII. <hi>Iohn</hi> was put by <hi>Iustinian,</hi> to call a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> on
an odd occasion (which sheweth what it was that Bishops then divided the
the World about) In the days of <hi>P. Hormisda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> there was a Controversie
<hi>(de nomine)</hi> whether it might be said: <hi>One of the Trinity was Crucified: Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misda</hi>
declared against it, because they that were for it, were suspected of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychianisme,</hi>
(and condemned after) But the <hi>Nestorians</hi> laid hold of this,
and said: <hi>If we may not say that one in the Trinity was Crucified;</hi> then we
may not say: <hi>Mary was the Parent of one in the Trinity:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>Iustinian</hi> sent about
this to <hi>Iohn;</hi> and he and his Synod said contrary to <hi>Hormisda: That we
may say, that one of the Trinity was Crucified.</hi> Doth not this plainly confess
the bloud and doleful divisions, caused by Bishops and Monks for so many
Ages about <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> and <hi>Eutychianisme,</hi> was but about a <hi>Word</hi> which
in one sence is <hi>true,</hi> and in another false; which one Pope saith, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unsaith. When <hi>Binnius</hi> after <hi>Baronius</hi> hath no more to say for excuse
of this; but that <hi>It a mutatis hostibus arma mutarinecesse fuit:</hi> O for honesty:
<hi>Against divers Enemies we must use divers Weapons.</hi> But Sir may you use <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
assertions,</hi> as Articles of Faith? Or do you not here undenyably tell us
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60852:89"/>
that <hi>Ambiguous words,</hi> and <hi>Clergy Iurisdiction,</hi> have been the causes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Divisions, and Ruines of the Church for 1300 years?</p>
               <p>§. 99. <hi>Iustinian</hi> took a better Course to Convince, and Reconcile dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
than violence. There is in <hi>Binnius, p. 409. &amp;c.</hi> The recital of a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or Friendly Conference between the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Bishops, and <hi>Hypati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
with others of the Orthodox: The most clear, rational, and moderate
of any thing, that I find before that time explaining their Controversie:
And which fully proveth what I have all along said as my Opinion, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the world was confounded by unskilful men about <hi>hard Ambiguous words</hi>
and by a <hi>Lordly, selfish, imposing Spirit,</hi> in too many of the Captains of those
Militant Churches: And that <hi>clear distinguishing explication of Terms,</hi> with
<hi>humble Love,</hi> would have prevented most of those divisions.</p>
               <p>In that Conference, these things are specially notable. 1. That the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bishops called <hi>Eutychians,</hi> condemned <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and yet honoured <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus,</hi>
who defended him; so that it was a quarrel more about Men,
Names, and Words, than Doctrine. 2. That <hi>Hypatius,</hi> and the Orthodox
(though they were not willing to suspect Corruption in <hi>Gyril</hi>'s Epistles, yet)
could not deny but <hi>Cyril</hi> used <hi>Eutyches</hi> words, that is <hi>asserted, one Nature of
God Incarnate,</hi> after the Union. 3. That yet they proved that <hi>Cyril</hi> also
held two Natures: (but say the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> he only held two before the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
considered intellectually) so that either <hi>Cyril</hi> was an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> or else his
unskillful speaking, as both parties did, set the world together by the Ears.
4. That unrighteous partiality greatly prevailed with the Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and Councils of these times; when they could (as <hi>Hypatius</hi> here did)
put a Charitable Construction upon the same words of <hi>Cyril,</hi> for which they
condemned so many others, who as his obedient followers, held what they
did of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s. <hi>Vnam naturam Dei incarnati:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> They say, <hi>We neither Condemnit,
nor Iustifie it.</hi> If they had used that moderation with all others, all had been
in greater peace. 5. That they say so much of the falsifying of <hi>Athanasius</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> of <hi>Appollinaries</hi> Epistle fathered on <hi>Iulius,</hi> of the falshood
of the <hi>Dyonysius Areopag. &amp;c.</hi> As he tells us, that we must not be over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in trusting to writings ascribed to the Ancients. 6. That <hi>Nullus ex anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
recordatus est ea;</hi> was thought a good argument against the Authority
of <hi>Dyonisius Areopagita.</hi> 7. They instance in the difference between the
Greeks and Latins about the words <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> and <hi>Persona,</hi> which set the
Latins on condemning the <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> it on condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<hi>Latins</hi> as <hi>Sabellians,</hi> till <hi>Athanasius</hi> that understood both Tongues, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them, that their meaning was the same (And necessity urged <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
to reconcile them) which <hi>Greg. Nazianzene</hi> and other peaceable men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
promoted; And yet <hi>Hierome</hi> was judged a <hi>Heretick</hi> after, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
the word <hi>Hypostasis.)</hi> And yet must <hi>Hard ambiguous words</hi> confound
and divide the Churches still?</p>
               <p>8. They confess that <hi>Cyril, [idem dicebat esse substantiam, quod naturam
vel subsistentiam] &amp; ideo in duodecim Capitulis suis pro duabus substantiis vel
naturis duas subsistentias posuit.</hi> Reader, If this great Learned Voluminous
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60852:89"/>

                  <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>subsistence,</hi> and put them one for another; what could be
expected from the multitude of poor unlearned Prelates, that took his name
for their guide, and cryed out in Council, <hi>Great is</hi> Cyril; <hi>We believe as</hi>

(between <hi>Nestorians, Eutychians, Severians, Monothelites</hi> and <hi>Catholicks)</hi> such
a strife about words as <hi>Cyril</hi> had occasioned?</p>
               <p>9. Note that <hi>Hypatius</hi> and the Orthodox here maintain, that <hi>Flavianus</hi>
himself subscribed as much for one Nature as <hi>Dioscorus</hi> could have desired:
And that the Controversie lay in a syllable, Whether Christ were one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
<hi>Ex duabus naturis,</hi> or, <hi>In duabus;</hi> the <hi>Eutychians</hi> said <hi>Ex,</hi> and the rest

this be true, were they not all of a mind and knew it not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. Note that the <hi>Eutychians</hi> took <hi>Theodorets</hi> Anathema, <hi>Nestorio &amp;

out only, <hi>Curse them, curse them,</hi> and he interprets <hi>Theodorets Valete,</hi> as
saying, <hi>Now take my Bishoprick if you please.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. In a word, had this <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> been used by the Bishops, which
this Conference expresseth, it had prevented much Confusion in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
scorn against the Bishops, hardening of the Infidels, and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>§. 102. CLXIV. <hi>Menna</hi> being made Bishop of <hi>Const.</hi> a Council was
there called. Sure no <hi>Roman</hi> Presided; for there was then an <hi>Inter-regnum:</hi>
But was it then a good Council? As please the Pope! Yet so impudent is
<hi>Binnius</hi> as to say, that <hi>Menna</hi> was the Popes Vicar, and his Legates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided,
when there was no Pope on Earth.</p>
               <p>The work of this Council was to condemn and curse <hi>Authimus,</hi> (a Bishop
of <hi>Const.</hi> got in by the Empress, and put out by the Emperour) with <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
late Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Apamea,</hi> and <hi>Zoaras</hi> a Monk,
as being <hi>Acephali,</hi> that is, <hi>Severians,</hi> or <hi>Eutychians,</hi> as they were variously
called: <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> have cruel persecutions also laid to their charge,
(for persecution hath but its time.) The Emperour hereupon maketh a
fevere Law against them, sending them by banishment to solitude, and
condemning their Books to the fire, and judging their hands to be cut off
that writ them. (We may see whence our Church-History mostly cometh,
even from the stronger side, that had power to burn all which they would
not have known.)</p>
               <p>Two things in this Council offend the <hi>Romanists:</hi> 1.<note place="margin">☞</note> That <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> is called <hi>Patriarcha Oecumenicus:</hi> 2. That <hi>Euphemius, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and <hi>Leo</hi> are named, and <hi>Leo</hi> last: the two first having been damned
by the Popes so oft since they were dead. And they have no better reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but to say that some ill <hi>Greek</hi> hand hath falsified the Councils. (Is that
all the certainty we have of recorded Councils.) If you suspect the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
why may we not also suspect the <hi>Romans;</hi> especially in the days of wicked
Popes?</p>
               <p>The People cryed out here, <hi>Quid manemus in communicati? Binnius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that <hi>from the time that</hi> Macedonius <hi>their Orthodox Bishop was ejected, the
faithful Catholicks withdrew themselves from the Communion of impious</hi> Timothy
<hi>that was put into his place.</hi>

               <p>§. 106. But <hi>Theodosius</hi> is said by <hi>Liberat.</hi> and others, to have first desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the place,<note place="margin">☜</note> being wearied with the Peoples Wars: The case was this:
A new controversie was started, whether the body of Christ was <hi>corruptible</hi>

and chose two Bishops: Those that were for the <hi>incorruptability,</hi> had
<hi>Gainas</hi> for their Arch-Bishop, and were called by the other <hi>Phantasiastae,</hi>
and <hi>Gainites:</hi> Those that were for the <hi>corruptability,</hi> had <hi>Theodosius</hi> for their
Arch-Bishop, and were called by the other <hi>corrupticolae,</hi> and <hi>Theodosians.</hi>

with Arms, but with the concord of the Citizens: The women cast stones on them
from the tops of the Houses; But the Souldiers did that by Fire which they could
not do by Arms.</hi> And saith <hi>Liberatus, That City is divided with that Schism to

               <p>§. 107. The Case of the Orthodox <hi>Paul</hi> that succeeded him, is described
by <hi>Liberatus, c.</hi> 23. He intending to put out <hi>Elias</hi> the Master of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
as a Heretick, by a power received from the Emperour, one of his
Deacons discovered it to <hi>Elias</hi> by Letters. <hi>Paulus</hi> fearing the fate of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius,</hi>
and getting the Letters, got <hi>Rhodo</hi> the Emperours <hi>Augustal</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to secure the Deacon, who by one <hi>Arsenius</hi> Murdered him: for
which alledging the command of <hi>Paulus</hi> the Bishop, and the Emperours
command to obey <hi>Paul,</hi> the Emperour put to death the Magistrate <hi>Rhodo,</hi>
and deposed <hi>Paulus,</hi> and put <hi>Zoilus</hi> in his place.</p>
               <p>§. 108. There is in <hi>Liberatus, c.</hi> 22. An Epistle of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> in

               </p>
               <p>§. 109. <hi>Niceph. l. 17. c.</hi> 26. saith, that <hi>Vigilius,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was again

imposuit,</hi> saith <hi>Niceph. c. 9.)</hi> and <hi>eo insolentiae progressus est,</hi> he grew so
insolent that he Excommunicated <hi>Menna</hi> for four Months: which so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<hi>Iustinian,</hi> that he sent men to apprehend him, and when he fled to the
Altar, they drag'd him away, and <hi>Anastasius</hi> in <hi>lib. Pontif.</hi> saith, They ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a rope about his neck and drag'd him about the streets till the evening,
and made him glad to communicate with <hi>Menna.</hi> But at last he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his Bishoprick.</p>
               <p>§. 110. Two heinous crimes <hi>Evagrius</hi> chargeth <hi>Iustinian</hi> with: 1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
covetousness and extortion. (But he used to do very great good
works.) 2. Encouraging Murderers (see <hi>Evagr, l. 4. c. 31.)</hi> so that men
were no where safe, but they that killed them, as in an act of manhood
were protected.</p>
               <p>§. 111. And though he was the great Zealot for the Orthodox against
all Hereticks, he dyed a reputed Heretick; in so much that <hi>Evagrius</hi> over
boldly pronounceth, <hi>That when he had set the whole World on tumults and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and at last received what was due for his lewd practices, he departed into
endless torment prepared for him by the just judgment of God, l. 5. c.</hi> 1. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant

That the Body of Christ was every way incorruptible; and

               <p>1. Blameless Passions of Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Dissolution of
the Bodies Elements. The first they said Christ was subject to before the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but not after (nor we:) The later not at all. The Hereticks that held
the contrary, were called the <hi>Aphthartodocitae,</hi> saith <hi>Nicephorus, [Quá multi

<hi>Iustinian</hi>'s <hi>soul and name;</hi> some place him yet in Heaven, and others in Hell.
If it be true that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> saith of him, my Vote should go against the
<hi>Damners,</hi> viz. <hi>[Nil tale de Christo propter summum ipsius erga illum amorem &amp;
desiderium audire constituerit: Princeps etenim iste tanto in Christum pietatis ardore

Itaque propter vehementem in Christum amorem illius gratiâ multa etiam
violenter fecit,</hi> &amp;c. And if it came from vehement love to Christ, all I will say
is, 1. Let him that is without Error, be the first in damning him. 2. But it
was just with God to leave him to be numbered with Hereticks, who was so
blindly zealous in executing the Sentences of Hereticating Prelates: (The Case
of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and many others before.)</p>

               <p>The 5th Canon decreeth, that a Bishop shall be ordained in his own <hi>Church

Church.</p>
               <p>Much ado many Councils made to keep Priests and Bishops from Wives, and
to restrain them from Fornication.</p>
               <p>§ 8. CLXX. In a Synod at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> An. 547. the business was debated
<hi>de tribus Capitulis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 9. Here the occasion of this stir must be noted. One <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Caesar. Cap.</hi> was an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> but for his skill in business, was great with the
Emperor. He thought if he could but cast any slur on the <hi>Calcedom</hi> Council, it
would justifie their Cause: And the Emperor being speaking against the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:60852:92"/>
(or <hi>Acephali) Theodorus</hi> told him that he might easily bring them all
in, if he would but condemn <hi>Theodorus Mopsuestenus,</hi> and the Writings of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
and the Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi> against <hi>Cyril,</hi> which the Council had received, it would
satisfie them. This seemed to the Emperor a happy way of concord (the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
putting him on) and so he set himself earnestly to effect it. These three
men had been accounted <hi>Nestorians,</hi> and two of them had written smartly against
<hi>Cyril</hi> as heretical and turbulent; but yet renouncing <hi>Nestorius</hi> they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and justified at <hi>Calcedon</hi> against their Accusers. And if one may judge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
by the Evidence that is left us, they seem to have been far wiser and
better men than the majority of the Bishops of those times: But neither Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Piety, nor soundness in the Faith, is any security in such times, against Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caters,
that can but get the upper hand and major vote. And Ignorance usually
is most proud and loud, most confident and furious; and such can easilier make
wise men pass for Hereticks, than learn of them to be wise. But the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sets a strait.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iustinian</hi> was earnestly set upon this Project, the Defenders of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
Council perceived themselves in a difficulty; should they condemn these
three men, they would seem to condemn the Council (about which there had
been such a stir in the Empire:) And they should seem to justifie the <hi>Eutychians,</hi>
and to strengthen them: And if Council were against Council, it would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
Councils: And if they should refuse the Condemnation, they would seem
to desert <hi>Cyril,</hi> and the first <hi>Ephesian</hi> Council, and perhaps might be called <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi>
but, worst of all, they should displease the Emperor, and might occasion
his favouring the <hi>Eutychians.</hi> Therefore they took this prudent course, to put
off the business to a General Council, and to delay till then the Emperors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
               <p>But the Emperor did first publish his Edict, in which after the Confession of
his Faith, and praise of the four Councils, he addeth ten Curses (Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms,
according to the Custom and Religion of those times) of which the
three last are against the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> or the Councils seeming approbation of the
three forenamed men. The Bishops resisted a great while, but at last were forced
to submit.</p>
               <p>§ 10. CLXXI. To this purpose <hi>Vigilius Romanus</hi> had a meeting of about
30 Bishops,<note place="margin">Constant. an. 547.</note> where <hi>Vigilius</hi> yielding was called a Desertor, as prevaricating to
please the Emperor; he got them to give in their reasons on both sides in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and then gave all to the Emperor's party, and persuaded the rest to silence
and communion till a Council, because it was not a Controversie about Faith, but
about Persons.</p>
               <p>§ 11. The Emperor's Party (acted by <hi>Theodore Caesar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> got some Bishops to

by gifts, or seeking; but with the will of the King, by the election of the Clergy and
the Lay-people.<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 11. Also (as the ancient Canons have decreed) let none
be made Bishop to an unwilling People (or without the Peoples consent) nor let the
People or the Clergy be inclined to consent, by the oppression of persons in power (which
is not lawful to be spoken:) But if it be otherwise done, let the Bishop be for ever
deposed from his obtained honour of Pontificate, who is ordained rather by force, than
lawful decree.<note place="margin">☞</note> C. While one Bishop is living, let not any other be there made
Bishop; unless perhaps in his place, who is ejected for some capital Crime. <hi>Can.</hi> 21.
Though all Priests, and others, must be careful to relieve the Poor with necessaries, yet
especially every Bishop must from the Church-house as far as they can, administer
necessaries for food and rayment to such as are in weakness both in his Territories and
his City, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note I. Were those Bishopricks any bigger than our Parishes of Market-Towns
with the Chappelleries? where 1. All the Laity met to choose the Bishop.
2. Where the Bishop could know and relieve all the Poor. 3. And this from
the <hi>domus Ecclesiae,</hi> which was but one.</p>
               <p>II. Our Nonconformists plead, that according to these ancient Canons, 1. Those
Bishops are no Bishops who came not in by any <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>consent</hi> of the People or
Clergy, but by <hi>power are imposed on the most unwilling.</hi> 2. That those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that were never deposed for any Crime, are not to be forsaken by their
Flocks, nor imposed persons thrust into their places, accepted by the People, while
the first hath true right.</p>
               <p>§ 13. CLXXIII. We come now to that which they will needs call the fifth
General Council at <hi>Constantinople, An.</hi> 553. of 165 Bishops. In which let these
particulars be noted. 1. That <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Letters or <hi>Formulae</hi> were first read, in
which he expresly affirmeth, that it was the Emperors that called the former
General Councils, and he that called this. 2. That he lamenteth the divisions
which former Councils had left unhealed: saying, <hi>[The followers of</hi> Nestorius
<hi>and</hi> Eutyches <hi>made so great trouble in the holy Churches of God, that divisions and
schisms were made in them, and the Churches had no Communion with one another:
For no man that travelled from one City to another, did presume to communicate,
nor any Clerk that went from one City to another, to go into the Church.]</hi> Here was
lamentable separation indeed. 3. That <hi>Iustinian</hi> was made believe, that these
divisions would be healed, if the <hi>tria Capitula</hi> of the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> were
but condemned: For the <hi>Eutychians</hi> did so much boast of <hi>Cyril,</hi> being confident
that they did but follow him, and his first <hi>Ephesian</hi> Council, that if he were vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
he thought they would be satisfied. 4. And he thought that the three
Bishops were indeed so far to be condemned, having disgraced <hi>Cyril,</hi> and favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Nestorius,</hi> and the other was <hi>Nestorius</hi>'s Master. 5. That the <hi>receiving</hi> and
the <hi>cursing</hi> of the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> having hitherto been the great Contest
among the Bishops, some were loth now to cast so great a dishonour upon it, and
to give the <hi>Eutychians</hi> so much cause to boast; supposing they would but be the
more confirmed in their opposition.</p>
               <p>§ 14. <hi>Note also, that</hi> Vigilius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>was then at</hi> Constantinople, <hi>but
came not to the Council, nor sent any Legate to it: But the Emperor tells the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60852:93"/>
Council,</hi> 
                  <q>That when <hi>Vigilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> came to that City, the Emperor
exactly opened to him all things about the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and asked him what he
thought of them; and that <hi>Vigilius</hi> not once nor twice, but often in writing,
and without writing, anathematized the impious <hi>tria Capitula.]</hi> And that he had
shewed that he was ever of the same judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they had made</hi> Iustinian <hi>believe,</hi> that <hi>Ibas</hi> in his Epistle denieth God the
Word to be made man, and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be the Mother of God.]</p>
               <p>§ 15. The Emperor's Writing being read, at the next meeting the Council
sent to <hi>Vigilius</hi> to sit with them, but he still refused, alledging, <hi>That there were
few of the Western Bishops there.</hi> To which their answer is notable, that <hi>[The
meeting of all the rest ought not to be delayed for the Western Bishops: For in all the
four General Councils, there was never found a multitude of the Western Bishops, but
only two or three Bishops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>and a few Clerks. But now you are here, and many</hi> Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
<hi>Bishops are at hand, and many of</hi> Africa, Illyricum, <hi>&amp;c. And if he would
not meet them, they must do it without him.</hi> They urged him also with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
words, that he <hi>being alone, had oft in writing, and without writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the</hi> tria Capitula, and the Emperor desired him but <hi>to do that with others,
which he had done by himself.</hi> But yet <hi>Vigilius</hi> would not come: Whether it
was because he understood not <hi>Greek,</hi> and so should be a contemned Cypher (for
he saith, <hi>They all knew that he understood it not)</hi> or whether it was to avoid the
Censure that he had before incurred, or both, is not known. For you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had suffered defamation at <hi>Rome</hi> already, as a Revolter from
the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council, for joining herein with the Emperor in the beginning, and
his chief interest lay at home.</p>
               <p>§ 16. <hi>Theodorus Mopsuestenus</hi> Writings are searched; and though he is highly
extolled by many good Authors, yet many passages recited in the Council, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> do shew either the error of his judgment, or his unskilfulness in
speaking; for they are not justifiable. But if every Papist voluminous Writer
should be damned as a Heretick, whose Writings have more and greater Errors
than the Council gathered out of <hi>Theodore Mepsuostenus,</hi> it would be a hard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for their exceeding labours. When such men as <hi>Tostatus, Aquinas, Scotus,
Ockam, Durandus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Suarez, Vasquez, Cajetane,</hi> &amp;c. have
spent their days in diligent labours, how easie a matter is it for a proud idle
Drone that doth nothing or worse, to gather as many and as great Errors out of
their Works, as were in many then counted Hereticks. But the approbation of
God, who pardoneth failings, will be the comfort of such as improve their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents;
when the slothful, unprofitable Servant shall be condemned, and quarrelling
with the imperfections of the diligent will not save them.</p>
               <p>It is evident that <hi>Theodore</hi> and <hi>Nestorius</hi> acknowledged Christ's Godhead and
Manhood, Soul and Body, and the personal Union of them. But they were none
of them perfect in Logick and Metaphysicks, nor so spake as that no man could
blame their words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§ 17. Next the words of learned</hi> Theodorite <hi>are scanned; and many very
smart passages against</hi> Cyril <hi>are recited: Many verbal Controversies are repeated.</hi>
Theodorite <hi>is accused for saying,</hi> That <hi>Mary</hi> begat not God in the nature of God;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60852:94"/>
but Man as united to the Godhead;<note place="margin">☞</note> That Christ was forsaken, suffered, hungered,
slept, was ignorant of that day and hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as man, and not as God: That it was
not God that was ignorant, <hi>(he meant</hi> not as God, <hi>or not</hi> the Deity) but the form
of a Servant, which knew no more than the Deity revealed: <hi>And so of many
other properties or acts of the Humanity, he saith,</hi> It was not <hi>Deus Verbum</hi> that
wept, that learnt obedience, <hi>&amp;c. meaning only not</hi> quâ Deus, <hi>or not</hi> Deitas, <hi>for
want of care in speaking. And</hi> Ep. ad Ioh. Antioch. (Bin. p. 559.) <hi>it's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that he also misunderstood</hi> Cyril, <hi>and thought he held that by</hi> Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>the</hi> Deity <hi>was properly become very flesh. A severe</hi> Epist. ad Ioan. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,
<hi>against</hi> Cyril <hi>after his death is there charged on him, in which he with great
saltness rejoiceth in his death,</hi> [Miserum illum nec ad similitudinem aliorum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misit

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Binnius</hi> thinketh some bad man fathered this falsly on <hi>Theodoret,</hi> I would hope
so too: But it's strange that the Council fathered it on him, and none did vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him. And the next Charge <hi>(Bin. p. 559.)</hi> rebuketh his Charity, <hi>viz.</hi> his
Speech at <hi>Antioch</hi> in the presence of <hi>Domnus, [Nemo neminem jam cogit blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemare—non
jam est contentio: Oriens &amp;</hi> Aegyptus <hi>sub uno jugo est: Mortua
est invidia; &amp; cum eo obruta est contentio: requiescant</hi> Theopathitae.] Is not
this of the same kind? And this is not denied to be his. Whosoever it was, it
was sad that Bishops should have such minds, and use such words of one another,
especially if it be as I confidently believe, <hi>viz.</hi> that not distinguishing the <hi>concrete</hi>
from the <hi>abstract,</hi> and <hi>Qui Deus,</hi> from <hi>Quâ Deus,</hi> they both meant the same
thing, and differed but about the aptitude of words, for want of explication and
distinction.</p>
               <p>§ 18. In brief, After the reading of many Papers, and <hi>Ibas</hi> Epistles, the <hi>tria
Capitula</hi> were condemned, viz. <hi>Theodore Mopsuest.</hi> and the writings of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
against <hi>Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> Epistle. And so the Emperor found the Council as
obedient as he desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:60852:94"/>
§ 19. But <hi>Vigilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would not come to the Council, now
giveth in his <hi>Constitutum,</hi> or his own judgment upon the whole Case, and that
with great moderation. He first reciteth many passages of <hi>Theodore Mopsuest.</hi>
which he renounceth; and he dispraiseth the passages of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ibas,</hi> but
he refuseth to join in the anathematizing of them, alledging that good men have
their errors, and instancing in many whose errors were noted, and yet their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
not condemned, especially when they had either recanted them, or better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
their words: And he noteth that it would be a great injury to the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
Council, to have its own members now thus condemned, that were by them
accepted. <hi>[Quid enim aliud est mendaces aut simulantes professionem rectae fidei
Patres in sancta Calced. Synodo residentes ostendere, quam dicere aliquos ex eis
similia sapuisse Nestorio; quorum judicio Nestorium ejusque dogmata fuisse dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And soberly he saith,</hi> [It is not lawful to pass any new judgment on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the dead, but we must leave all men in the case that death found them,
and in special <hi>Theodore Mopsuest.</hi> what the Fathers did is evident from what
is said; I dare not condemn him by my sentence, nor yield that any one else condemn
him: but far be it from me to admit his wrong opinions.]</p>
               <p>This was the right way: If they had all dealt as wisely and Christian-like,
Counsels had not been the Confounders of the Churches.</p>
               <p>§ 20. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> nameth many of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Errors that were condemned in
this Council, but it is not found in the Acts. <hi>Binnius</hi> doubteth not but the
<hi>Origenists</hi> stole them out, and falsified the Records, and also forged those Epistles
of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> in which the opinion of <hi>One Operation</hi> is asserted. But will they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us equally to suspect such Records as have been kept at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 21. <hi>What good this Council did, and how the peaceable Emperor attained
the end that</hi> Theodore Caesar. <hi>promised him, of uniting Dissenters, I shall tell you
but in the words of</hi> Binnius <hi>(who followeth</hi> Baronius <hi>in almost all)</hi> 
                  <q>What
<hi>Theodore Caesar.</hi> promised, that the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereticks called <hi>Hesitants,</hi> when
the three <hi>Capitula</hi> were condemned, would receive the holy <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council, was
not obtained, when this was ended; but rather a most grievous mischief was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Church: For when the Defenders of the three <hi>Capitula,</hi> with <hi>Vigilius</hi>
the Pope did not acquiesce in the Councils decree, the whole Catholick Church was
torn by Schism; and which is worse, the Emperor stir'd up Persecution, in which
he deposed or banished <hi>Vigilius</hi> (holding to his <hi>Constitutum)</hi> Victor. Afric. <hi>and
others.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 22. <hi>I do impartially commend</hi> Vigilius'<hi>s moderate</hi> Constitutum, <hi>but I must
needs say that there needeth no other instance than</hi> Vigilius, <hi>that</hi> Interest <hi>is a Law
to some</hi> Roman <hi>Bishops, and that their pretences of Infallibility, Tradition and
Antiquity, notwithstanding they have changed their very Faith, or judgment of
Councils at least, as their wordly motives changed.</hi> Vigilius <hi>first flattered the
Emperor, and joined with him against the</hi> tria Capitula, Conc. Calced. <hi>that is
against</hi> Theodore Mopsu. Theodoret <hi>and</hi> Ibas <hi>three Bishops, saith</hi> Binnius <hi>p.</hi> 608.
<q>[Seeing therefore that before this Council a Schism arose in the <hi>Western</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi>
Church, because <hi>Vigilius</hi> had consented to the Emperor's opinion, it became
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60852:95"/>
necessary, for the avoiding of Schism, Sacriledge and Scandal, that he should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
his <hi>Constitutum,</hi> in defence of the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> by vertue whereof the
<hi>Western</hi> Churches should be united, and the contempt of the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council
should be avoided, which the Impugners of the <hi>tria Capitula</hi> did fraudulently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive;
and that the Universal Church should learn by this example, that no man
that dyed in the true Faith, should be condemned when he is dead: But, (did
<hi>Vigilius</hi> stop here?) No, saith <hi>Binnius,</hi> [But when after the end of his Council
the Church received yet greater damage, and the Emperor persecuted them that
contradicted the Synod<note n="*" place="margin">And would not Papists have Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do so?</note>, and it was feared that the whole <hi>East</hi> would be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and separated from the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Church, unless the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> approved the fifth Synod, then Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> in a Cause which could bring
no prejudice to the Orthodox Faith, did well and justly change his former sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and approved the Synodal Decree, for condemning the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and
revoked and made void his <hi>Constitutum,</hi> which he before published in defence of
the <hi>tria Capitula.</hi> The prudent and pious Pope (that came to the Popedom by
Bribery, Tyranny, and Murder of his Predecessor) did in this prudently imitate
St. <hi>Paul</hi> about Circumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>O what certainty and constancy is here in the Papal judgment; For a Pope
about one Cause to judge for it, against it, and for it again in so short a time?
And all this upon reason of Policy and State. Did the same so often change, and
prove first true, and then false, and then true again?</p>
               <p>But the Papists excuse is, that it was <hi>de Personis, non de Fide. Answ.</hi> But 1. Is
it lawful to take the same thing for true and false, good and bad <hi>de Personis,</hi> as
our interest requireth? 2. Why are the Persons condemned but on supposition
that their Faith was condemnable? 3. You confess that it was for the advantage
of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Faith, and the depression of the Faith of the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council,
that the <hi>tria Capitula</hi> were condemned.</p>
               <p>Reader, If all this will not tell thee how much need there is of a surer and
more stable support of our Faith than Popes and Councils, yea and better means
of the Churches Unity and Concord, I must take thee for unteachable: what
have such Councils done, but set the Churches together by the ears?</p>
               <p>§ 23. <hi>Liberatus</hi> in his Breviary saith, <hi>(c. 3. 10. 24.)</hi> that <hi>Theodore Mopsu.</hi>
his Works were approved by <hi>Proclus, Iohan. Antioch.</hi> the Emperor, the Council

he did after</hi> Silverius'<hi>s death, as beginning then to have right to his Papacy, and
to give him so differing a Character (from</hi> Sanctissimus Papa) <hi>before, while he
possessed the same Seat, as these words of his express,</hi> [Cum omnium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seeing
that Villany (or Crime) of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> did exceed the Crimes of all Schismaticks, by

by the true door, a false (or counterfeit) Bishop, and as it were Antichrist, the
lawful Pastor and Bishop being yet living, did add most pernicious Heresie to his
Schism.] <hi>Yet this man became the</hi> most holy Pope, by the vertue <hi>of his place, as

this was true, no marvel if it confirmed the Emperor in his way: But I doubt
the obedient Bishops were too ready to receive such reports.</p>
               <p>§ 26. CLXXV. The same year 553. the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops held a Council at

continued for near an Hundred years, till the time of Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> who reduced
them.<note place="margin">☜</note> Were not these great Councils and Bishops great Healers of the Church,
that about condemning some written Sentences of three dead men, thus raise a
War among the Churches? Were Hereticks or Hereticaters the great Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</p>
               <p>§ 27. But here followeth a Case that raiseth a great doubt before us, Whether
the Pope alone, or all his <hi>Western</hi> Bishops, when they differ from him, are the
Church? After the death of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> the Secular Power procured <hi>Pelagius</hi> the
Archdeacon to be made Pope; the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops disclaiming <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and <hi>Pelagius</hi> obediently receiving it (and the Popedom,) there could not
be three Bishops got that would ordain him, as the Canons required, so that a
Presbyter <hi>Ostiensis</hi> was fain to do it.</p>
               <p>Besides the Question (Which now was the Church?) here are other hard Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be solved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:60852:96"/>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Whether <hi>Iustinian's</hi> Election of a Pope was valid? And if so,
Whether other various Electors may do it as validly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether a Presbyter's Ordination of a Bishop or Pope was valid? If
so, Whether Presbyters may not ordain Presbyters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Whether this Pope was truly Head of the Catholick Church, when
his Bishops obeyed him not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Whether it was then believed at <hi>Rome</hi> itself, and in the <hi>West,</hi> that a
General Council, approved by the Pope, was either infallible, or necessarily to be
obeyed?</p>
               <p>Qu. 5. <hi>Whether it be true which</hi> W. Iohnson, <hi>alias</hi> Terret, <hi>often tells me,</hi> That
it is not possible that there can be any Schism in the Catholick Church, because of the
essentiality of its Union?</p>
               <p>§ 28. Note that this Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> because his Bishops rejected him and the
Council, got <hi>Narses</hi> the General to <hi>compel them:</hi> And then who can doubt but
he was Pope, and they his Subjects?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Narses</hi> scrupled it, lest he should be guilty of Persecution; <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s
Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> telleth him, it is no sin, and bids him not fear it; for it's no Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
which compels not men to sin: but all that separate from the Pope, and
assemble separatedly do sin, and are damned Schismaticks; therefore he desireth
him to send the Bishops of <hi>Aquileia, Milan,</hi> and the rest that yield not, Prisoners
to <hi>Constantinople. Narses</hi> obeyeth the Pope and Emperor; the Bishops excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<hi>Narses;</hi> the Pope writeth to him, that it is no news for erring Bishops
to take themselves for the Catholick Church, and to forbid others their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and counselleth him to go on and repress them. And the Civil Sword
and the Ecclesiastical were thus engaged in a <hi>Roman</hi> War; one Bishop <hi>Sapandus</hi>
of <hi>Ares</hi> in <hi>France</hi> the Pope got specially to stick to him, whom therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to King <hi>Childebert,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ 29. CLXXVI. A Council at <hi>Paris</hi> deposed Bishop <hi>Saphoracus</hi> for some great
Crime.</p>
               <p>§ 30. While the <hi>Romans</hi> were resolving to subject themselves to the <hi>Goths</hi>
again, because the Pope made <hi>Narses</hi> their Persecutor, <hi>Narses</hi> took it so ill, that he

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60852:96"/>
may tell us it was worthy to be detested (not much unlike the <hi>Manichees;)</hi>
and many old Canons they recited: But I could have wished that they had not
made a mans diet the note of his Heresie, and a sufficient cause of his conviction
and damnation. The <hi>Priscillianists</hi> (as these say) would not eat flesh, nor
herbs boil'd with flesh.<note place="margin">☜</note> This Council ordered that if any that abstained from flesh,
did not eat herbs boiled with flesh, he should be taken for an Heretick. This is
not conformable to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rules or Spirit.</p>
               <p>§ 33. This Council ordered that none should be buried within the Church,
which <hi>Binnius</hi> well sets home. And whereas <hi>Priscillian</hi> taught that in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
[the <hi>Pax vobis,</hi> Peace be unto you] should be said only by the Bishop, and
<hi>Dominus vobiscum</hi> by the Priest, the Council contradicted him. 1. We see here
what Trifles divided men! 2. We see that yet the Churches usually were no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than met in one place with the Bishop, or might do: For it is supposed that
every Church-Assembly had a Bishop present to say his part.</p>
               <p>§ 34. <hi>Thedomirus</hi> the <hi>Suevian</hi> King, under whom this Council was held, was
the first of that race that turned Orthodox; all the <hi>Sueves</hi> before him (with the

               <p>§ 35. CLXXX. <hi>Anno</hi> 566. The contest about choice of Bishops grew sharp.
King <hi>Clotharius</hi> made one <hi>Emerius</hi> Bishop <hi>Santoniensis;</hi> the Canons had before

                  <hi>Can. 21. They say,</hi> [Those that the Law commandeth to be put to death, if
they desire to hear the Preacher, we will have to be convicted unto life, <hi>(that is,
not to dye:)</hi> For they are to be slain with the sword of the mouth, and deprived

are of the same mind, against putting penitent Malefactors to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 38. CLXXXII. <hi>Anno</hi> 570. There was a Council at <hi>Lyons</hi> of Fourteen
Bishops, who recited six Canons to restrain the Vices of the Clergy: <hi>Binnius,</hi>
out of <hi>Greg. Turon.</hi> tells you the occasion was, that one <hi>Salonius</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius,</hi>
as soon as they were made Bishops, being then at their own will, broke out into
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60852:97"/>
Slaughters, Murders, Adulteries, and other wickedness. And <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Tricas.</hi> keeping his Birth-day, they sent a Troop with Swords and Arrows, who
cut his Cloaths, beat his Servants, and carried away all his Provision, leaving him
with reproach: The King <hi>Gunthram</hi> hearing of it, called this Synod, which
found them guilty, and deposed them: They tell the King that they are unjustly
cast out, and get his leave to go to the Pope, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3d. The Pope writeth to the
King to have them, as wronged men, restored, (this was the Papal Justice and
Reformation:) The King chideth, but restoreth them; but they grew never
the better afterward, but asking pardon of Bishop <hi>Victor,</hi> he forgave them, and
for that was afterward excommunicate.</p>
               <p>§ 39. CLXXXIII. <hi>An.</hi> 572. a Council was called under King <hi>Ariomire</hi> at
<hi>Braccara</hi> of 12 Bishops: They are mostly forbidding Bishops to take money
for their Ordinations, Consecrations, and other Actions. And the first Canon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
them to <hi>walk</hi> to all their Parishes, and see that the Clerks did things
rightly; that <hi>Catechumens</hi> learnt the Creed, and to preach to the People to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
Murder, Adultery, Perjury, False-witness, and other mortal Sins, to do as
they would be done by, and to believe the Resurrection, Judgment and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

Church.</p>
               <p>§ 41. After <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s death, his Sisters Son <hi>Iustinus</hi> was Emperor, a sensual
and covetous man, who murdered presently a Kinsman of his own name, upon
suspicion that he was too great; yet he drew up a good Profession of Faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
all the Bishops to agree in it: But <hi>Chosroes,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> invaded his
Empire, because the <hi>Greater Armenia</hi> (which was then under the <hi>Persians,</hi> as
the <hi>Lesser</hi> was under the <hi>Romans)</hi> to avoid the <hi>Persians</hi> persecutions, had revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Empire, and destroyed their Rulers: The <hi>Persians</hi> conquered so much
of the <hi>Eastern</hi> part of the Empire, and <hi>Iustine</hi>'s Soldiers made so little resistance
as drove him out of his wits; and his Wife, by intreaty, got the <hi>Persians</hi> to make
a Truce. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was then made <hi>Caesar,</hi> and afterward Emperor upon <hi>Iustine</hi>'s
death; and <hi>Iustinian</hi> his Captain repelled the <hi>Persians,</hi> and recovered much of
what they had conquered.</p>
               <p>§ 42. <hi>An.</hi> 576. Divers Kings of <hi>France</hi> by War among themselves destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches, and confounded all; and a Council at <hi>Paris</hi> was called, but in vain,
to have persuaded them to Peace.</p>
               <p>§ 43. After <hi>Benedictus, Pelagius</hi> 2d was Bishop at <hi>Rome; Tiberius</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

confederating with him.</p>

               <p>§ 1. BEing come to the Reign of Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by 2 or 3 General Councils for a <hi>Monothelite</hi> Heretick, (as
<hi>Vigilius</hi> was by his own Bishops for an <hi>Eutychian)</hi> and having shewed you
what work both the heretical and hereticating Bishops and Council made in the
world about (not only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of dead men;</hi> I shall next shew you what work they made also about the words,
<hi>[One Operation,</hi> and <hi>One Will,]</hi> or <hi>[Two Operations,</hi> and <hi>Two Wills.]</hi> Reader,
Wouldst thou think that there were venom enough in one of these words, to
poyson almost all the Bishops in the world with the Plagues of Heresie, or
Heretication and Contention?</p>
               <p>§ 2. The old Controversie still keeping the Churches all in pieces, some
being for two Natures after Union, and for the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council, and others
against it, and but for one Nature after Union: <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
was told, that it would unite them all, if they would confess <hi>One Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and <hi>One Will in Christ,</hi> or at least lay by the talk of <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Two,</hi> and
use the words, <hi>[Dei virilis Operatio.]</hi> The <hi>Operation</hi> (and <hi>Will)</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
CXCVII. He therefore called a Synod at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in which this
was decreed (called <hi>Satisfaction.)</hi> For they said that <hi>Dei virilis</hi> signified
two Natures, and so they thought they had at last hit the way of concord,
which neither the General Council of <hi>Ephes. 1. Ephes. 2. Constant. 2. Calcedon.
Constant.</hi> 3. had found out: but all set the Bishops but more by the ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent his Decrees to <hi>Sergius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople, Sophronius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> persuaded the silencing of the names of <hi>[One]</hi> or
<hi>[Two] Operations or Wills. Sergius</hi> sent the Case to <hi>Honorius</hi> to <hi>Rome;
Honorius</hi> rationally persuaded them to use neither the <hi>one</hi> word, nor the <hi>other,
(One</hi> or <hi>Two)</hi> foreseeing that a new quarrel was arising in these words, and
(little knowing how for this he was by General Councils to be Hereticated,
when he was dead) persuaded them to a silent Peace. It is but few Popes
that were so wise and peaceable; and this one must be a Heretick for it, or
General Councils be fallible, and much worse.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Because (knowing the effect of the old unhealed Cause) I foresee
that such men will go near to Hereticate me also when I am dead, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
Hereticating Incendiaries in the <hi>Nestorian, Eutychian,</hi> and <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>
quarrels; I will recite the words of <hi>Binnius</hi> himself, who saith the same
that I have said from the beginning, (though I justifie him not from self-contradiction.)</p>
               <p>Tom. 2. <hi>p. 992. [Honorius,</hi> fearing (which after came to pass, and which
he knew had fallen out in former Ages about the word <hi>Homoousion</hi> ☜ and
many others) lest that Contention should grow to some great Schism, and seeing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60852:100"/>
withall that Faith might be safe without these words, he was willing to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
both Opinions, and withall to take out of the way the matter of Scandal and
Contention. Writing therefore to <hi>Sergius,</hi> he advised him to abstain from the
word [One Operation] lest they should seem with <hi>Eutyches</hi> to assert but One
Nature in Christ; and yet to forbear the word [Two Operations] lest with
<hi>Nestorius,</hi> they seemed to assert Two Persons. <hi>(A Slander contrary to his
words.) I again say, If all the Hereticating Bishops and Councils had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this discretion and moderation, O what had the Church escaped!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet they are fain to stretch their wits to excuse his words elsewhere, <hi>[Unde
&amp; Unam Voluntatem fatemur Domini nostri Iesu Christi.]</hi> But it's certain
that in some sense it is <hi>One,</hi> and in another sense <hi>Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. The Emperor <hi>Heraclius</hi> interessed himself in the Controversie, <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
saith by the fraud of <hi>Anastasius</hi> Patriarch of the <hi>Iacobites,</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,

                     </gap>ndi Concilium Calcedonense.</hi> The <hi>Iacobites</hi> were <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi>
the greatest enemies of the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council; and it's strange then
how they deceived him, to defend it by destroying it.</p>
               <p>But, saith he, <hi>[While he, besides his place and office, by the persuasion of the
Devil, was wholly taken up in defending questions of Faith by his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
&amp;c.] Here you may see what the Papists Clergy would make of Kings
and all Lay-men: If they be <hi>wholly taken up in defending questions of Faith
by their own judgment,</hi> they pronounce them to be persuaded to it <hi>by the Devil.</hi>
Error is from the Devil; but sollicitous searching after the defence of Truth,
is liker to be of God. But they must not do it by <hi>their own judgment:</hi> By
whose then? By the Bishops no doubt; What Bishops? General Councils.
And had not the Emperors long enough followed Councils, and banished such
as they condemned, till, while they almost all condemned one another, the
world was scandalized at the odious Divisions and Cruelties of the Church?
But must they follow Bishops without using <hi>their own judgments</hi> about the
Case? What, as their meer Executioners? Must the Princes of the world act
as Brutes, or Idiots, or Lictors? Was this the old Doctrine, <hi>Let every Soul
be subject to the higher Power,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>§ 5. CXCVIII. King <hi>Sisenandus</hi> (the second that had all <hi>Spain)</hi> called
a Council at <hi>Toletum</hi> of all his Kingdom, <hi>An.</hi> 633. of 70 Bishops, who
made many good Canons for Faith, Order, and Reformation; the last is a
large defence of the King against Rebellion: But they order that when a
King is dead, the <hi>Prime Men of the whole Nation, with the Priests, by common
consent, chuse another, that retaining the Concord of Unity, there should be no
strife through Force or Ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they decree the Excommunicating of wicked Kings that live in great
sin; which I doubt whether the fifth Commandment forbid them not to
have done, it being a purposed dishonour.</p>
               <p>§ 6. CXCIX. Another at <hi>Toletum</hi> was called 636, by King <hi>Chintillane,</hi>

used to preach to the Bishops by their Letters and Decrees. Dukes and Lords
here subscribed.</p>
               <p>§ 22. <hi>Eugenius</hi> is Pope, and dyeth; <hi>Vitalianus</hi> succeedeth him: <hi>Constans</hi>
the Emperor cometh to <hi>Rome,</hi> giveth them gifts, and communicateth with
them. It's said he kill'd his Brother <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and after was kill'd himself:
<hi>Mezentius</hi> usurpeth the Empire. <hi>Constantine Pogonatus,</hi> Son to <hi>Constans,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth
him, and reigneth. Pope <hi>Vitalianus</hi> helpeth him, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
his help. <hi>Rome</hi> stood so much between the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire, and the
<hi>Western</hi> Kings <hi>(Goths, Lombards, Franks,</hi> &amp;c.) that both sides flattered
the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, (though they oft suffered from both.) The Empire to
keep them from turning to the <hi>Goths,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Goths</hi> to keep them from
turning to the Empire. And they that had most need of the Popes, most
advanced them; and they that had least need and most dominion, kept them
under.</p>
               <p>§ 23. CCV. Another Council at <hi>Toletum, An.</hi> 655. called by K. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessuinthus,</hi>
(not the Pope,) made divers good Canons for Church-order;
among which the tenth is, that because all the Canons oft made, could not
keep Bishops and Priests from Lechery, they tryed this additional way, to
decree that all their Children begotten of their Servants, Maids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should
be uncapable of inheritance, and should live in continual servitude to the
Church.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Recaredus</hi> made a Law, that Bishops and Priests Concubines should
be whipt with an hundred Stripes; and others, that they should be sold for
Slaves.</p>
               <p>§ 24. CCVI. The King of <hi>France (Clodoveus)</hi> called his Bishops to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at a Village called <hi>Clypiacum,</hi> and made a Sermon to them, and they
applauded him.</p>
               <p>§ 25. CCVII. He called another Synod at <hi>Cabilone</hi> for Church-order,<note place="margin">☞</note>
where <hi>Can.</hi> 10. it was decreed, that all <hi>Ordination of Bishops should be null,</hi>
that was otherwise made than by the election of the <hi>Comprovincials,</hi> the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> and the <hi>Citizens.</hi> (A threefold Lock is not easily pickt) Let
<hi>England</hi> understand this, to be the old Canons and Custom.</p>
               <p>§ 26. CCVIII. A <hi>Concil. Emeritense,</hi> called by King <hi>Recessuinthus,</hi> made
more Orders for regulating Bishops and Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 27. CCIX. A Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> justified a Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi> wronged by
his Archbishop.</p>
               <p>§ 28. CCX. Another at <hi>Toletum</hi> under King <hi>Wamban, An.</hi> 675. sought
to reform the Bishops and Clergy.</p>
               <p>§ 29. CCXI. <hi>An.</hi> 675. the same King <hi>Wamban</hi> had a Synod at <hi>Braccara,</hi>
for reforming the Clergy. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. was to correct the Bishops that had turned
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60852:101"/>
Piety into Pride and Vanity; going to the Solemnities of the Martyrs, with
Reliques hanged about their necks, carried in Chairs by Deacons in white, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
O what hath the Pride of Prelates done in the world!</p>
               <p>§ 30. Pope <hi>Adeodatus,</hi> and after him <hi>Donus</hi> reigned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> were <hi>Monothelites,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>West,</hi> having lost the <hi>East,</hi> took part with <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Donus</hi> came <hi>Agathy,</hi> in whose time the Bishop of <hi>Ravemia,</hi> after<note place="margin">☜</note>
long rejecting the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as heretical, returned to communion with
him. <hi>Constantine</hi> sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to require the Bishop to keep Missionary
Legates at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and intreated them to lay by Philosophical Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
and preach the pure Scripture, that the Churches at last might have
Peace. (But alas how long was that counsel vain!)</p>
               <p>§ 31. CCXII. <hi>Beda</hi> saith, an <hi>English</hi> Council met, <hi>An.</hi> 679. under <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus,</hi>
to own the Catholick Faith, <hi>Bed. l. 4. c.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>§ 32. CCXIII. The same year 679. A Council at <hi>Milan</hi> told the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
their opinion for <hi>Two Wills and Operations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 33. CCXIV. A Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> prepared matter for the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
against the <hi>Monothelites.</hi> This tended to please the separating Bishops of
<hi>Italy</hi> that divided from the Pope, for seeming to desert the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
by condemning the <hi>tria Capitula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 34. CCXV. Now cometh the 3d Council of <hi>Constantine,</hi> called the 6th
General Council, in which 289 Bishops condemned the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> that
were for <hi>One Will and Operation. Constantine Pog.</hi> being against them;
<hi>Macarius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> was the chief of them, who would have
consented to name neither <hi>One nor Two,</hi> but when they had done all, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he would be cast into the Sea, before he would say <hi>there were in
Christ two Wills and Operations;</hi> thinking that he held to <hi>Cyril,</hi> and the first
<hi>Ephesian</hi> Council against <hi>Nestorius. George</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> deserted
him, and he was deposed and banished (to <hi>Rome;</hi> no hard Banishment but
for ill company.)</p>
               <p>§ 35. A long stir there was among them, perusing former Writings;
<hi>Macarius</hi> and his Party producing many, which others said were falsified (so
little certainty is there oft of Copies.) The Epistles of <hi>Sergius Const. &amp;
Honor. Rom.</hi> are read, which I should think peaceable and honest; but the
General Council damned and cursed them both as Hereticks. The Papists
say, General Councils may err in matter of Fact: How much more then in
matter of Faith, which is more obscure? and matter of Fact is much of the
matter of our Faith.</p>
               <p>No Man's name had so strange a Fate against Hereticaters, as the great
Hereticater <hi>Cyril</hi>'s; who (in this Council in <hi>Cyrus artic.</hi> and many others)
was fully proved to assert <hi>One Nature of God incarnate after the Union]</hi> and
yet called Orthodox, and those that said as he, and much less, were damned
Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Some that confessed <hi>two Natures,</hi> yet denying <hi>two Wills</hi> after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,<note place="margin">☜</note>
supposing the Humane Will called Natural had been laid by, were
here damned with the rest.</p>

§ 36. CCXVI. <hi>An.</hi> 681. King <hi>Ervigius</hi> held another Council at <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
for the Royal Power, and reforming the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The Pope had so little to do, and the Kings so much in all these <hi>Spanish</hi>
Councils, that it's strange <hi>Spain</hi> is now become so servile to the Pope. <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
is forced to confess here <hi>(To. 3. p.</hi> 110.) that <hi>[The study and labor of
chusing fit men to be made Bishops, was in the power or hands of the</hi> Gothish
<hi>Kings, which by the indulgence of the</hi> Roman <hi>Popes is in the</hi> Spanish <hi>Kings

what they cannot keep!)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 682. Some Synods in <hi>France</hi> did, we know not what.</p>
               <p>§ 37. <hi>Leo</hi> 2d is made Pope by the Emperor; and because he confirmed
the Acts of this Council, which damns <hi>Honorius</hi> as an Heretick, the Papists
know not which way to turn themselves.<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> would have <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistle
forged. <hi>Binnius</hi> will have either the Acts corrupted by <hi>Theodore Const.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were sent to <hi>Leo,</hi> or that necessity compelled him to this hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by the iniquity of the times, and that Heresie else would have revived,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that by their reckoning, they that relie all on Tradition and Fathers,
leave not Fathers, Councils or Traditions certain for one Age.</p>
               <p>§ 38. CCXVII. <hi>An.</hi> 683. K. <hi>Ervigius</hi> had another Synod of 48 Bishops
at <hi>Toletum,</hi> for restoring some guilty of Treasons, securing the King,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 39. <hi>Constantine Pogon.</hi> restored to <hi>Rome</hi> the power of making Popes
without the Emperor, which the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings and other Emperors had long
denied them.</p>
               <p>§ 40. <hi>Benedict</hi> 2d is made Pope: A new Controversie in his time is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops write an Epistle, in which they assert <hi>Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in Christ, his Divinity, his Soul and his Body,</hi> and say withall that a
<hi>Will begat a Will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bin. pag. 127.</note> that is, <hi>the Divine Will begat the Humane.</hi> The numbers
of <hi>One, Two,</hi> and <hi>Three,</hi> had so confounded Men in those times, that the
words frightned the Pope, and he expostulated and warned them to take heed
in what sense they used them; which hath made it a question whether this
Pope were not erroneous himself.</p>
               <p>§ 41. CCXVIII. Another Council at <hi>Toletum</hi> against the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 42. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 5th was the first Consecrated without the Emperor since
the liberty granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoric</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> called a Council, <hi>An.</hi> 685. in which he depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
several Bishops.</p>
               <p>§ 43. <hi>Constantine Pog.</hi> dying, <hi>Iustinian</hi> 2d his Son is Emperor. <hi>Binnius</hi>
saith, he was not sound in the Faith (a hard thing then!) And that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of the liberty granted in chusing Popes, and so ordered that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
of <hi>Ravenna</hi> approve them, by which Bribery was used with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.
And while the Soldiers, and Clergy could not agree, they were fain to
consent to a third, <hi>Conon,</hi> to be Pope.</p>
               <p>§ 44. <hi>Conon</hi> being dead, <hi>Theodore</hi> and <hi>Paschal</hi> strove for the Popedom,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60852:102"/>
and got their Parties to stand it out for them. <hi>Paschal</hi> promised the Exarch
a great Sum of Gold to make him Pope. When they could not agree, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
a third was chosen. The Exarch forced him to pay the Gold, and so he
got the Soldiers love and the Popedom.</p>
               <p>§ 45. CCXIX. <hi>An.</hi> 688. Another <hi>Toletan</hi> Council writ a defence of
their assertion, that Christ had <hi>three Substances,</hi> and that <hi>Voluntas genuit Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 46. CCXX. A Council at <hi>Caesar-Augusta,</hi> made five Canons; the last
was, that when the Kings dyed, the Queens should lay by their civil Habits,
and be put into a Monastery, and profess Chastity.</p>
               <p>§ 47. CCXXI. <hi>An.</hi> 692. Was the famous great Council called the
<hi>Quini-Sextum</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by <hi>Iustinian</hi> 2d's Order; why it should not
be called a 7th General Council, I know not. It was called by the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Callinicus Constant.</hi> to make a full Body of Canons for Practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the 5th and 6th Councils made none. <hi>Binnius</hi> saith, It could not be a
General Council,<note place="margin">☜</note> because the Pope was not there by himself, or his Legates,
and yet confesseth that neither was he or his Legates at the first <hi>Constantine</hi>
Council, and yet it was universal. And why doth not another Bishops ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<hi>(E. G. Alexand. Ierusal. &amp;c.)</hi> null a General Council as well as
the Popes? The Papists rail at this Council as a <hi>Convention of Malignants,
(Bin. p. 154.)</hi> and against <hi>Balsamon,</hi> that defendeth it as a wicked <hi>Greek</hi>
Impostor; (the word <hi>[wicked]</hi> in these Mens writings is a term of art and
interest, and no <hi>moral</hi> term.) They recited abundance of old Canons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of great use. One would wonder whence the anger against them ariseth.
It was <hi>per summam nequitiam,</hi> saith <hi>Binnius,</hi> that they called themselves a
General Council: And the <hi>Holy Ghost was not with them,</hi> because the Pope
was not with them, <hi>(p. 154, 155.)</hi> and they ordained many things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Apostolical Constitutions, and the Canons of General Councils. Reader,
you see here, 1. How little trust Papists lay on that part of Tradition which
dependeth on Councils? 2. That it is the Pope (one Man) that is the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Tradition and Iudgment,</hi> without whom Councils are nothing.
3. That if the Pope be absent, all the other Bishops assembled in Councils
by the command of Emperors, may be called Knaves and wicked Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
Alas how few Bishops adhered to the Pope, (when <hi>Italy</hi> was not
yet cured of Separation from him) in comparison of those that met in these
<hi>Eastern</hi> Councils which they revile! 4. You see here, how far they are from
truth, that say the Universal Church still cleaved to the Pope, when most (by
far) of the Bishops in the world forsook him! you see <hi>Luther</hi> was not the
first.</p>
               <p>§ 48. Note that <hi>Tharasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople, An.</hi> 692. in the 2d
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> tells them, that <hi>it was the same Bishops</hi> that met in the 6th
General Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who met again here under <hi>Iustinian.</hi> And
were not the Bishops of the place so near the time competent Judges of the
matters of so notorious Fact? And were the same Bishops an infallible Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council at the 6th Council, and yet all wicked Schismaticks or Knaves,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60852:103"/>
and wicked Men, when they meet again but to make Church-Canons for
Reformation? If this do not tell you how truly <hi>Binnius</hi> saith, in their own
judgment [that <hi>Councils have just so much authority as the Pope giveth them]</hi>
what can tell it you?</p>
               <p>§ 49. Yea, <hi>Binnius</hi> makes this Council to be <hi>Monothelites:</hi> And were the
same Men Orthodox in the 5th or 6th Council ten years before, and Hereticks
in this? Is this the constancy of the Church and Bishops Faith?</p>
               <p>§ 50. The 13th Canon is one that displeaseth them; in which the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in separating Priests from their Wives,<note place="margin">☞</note> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
renounced; and it is decreed that no Priest be required to separate from
his Wife, (so be it they abstain at Fasts and necessary Seasons) nor any
Priest endured to put away his Wife, on pretence of piety; else he must be
deposed.</p>
               <p>§ 51. Another is the 16th Canon, that maketh Deacons like Overseers
of the Poor.</p>
               <p>§ 52. The 22d is a hard Canon that Bishops and Priests, ordained with
money, and not by <hi>examination</hi> and <hi>election,</hi> be deposed, and they that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
them.</p>
               <p>§ 53. The 36th Canon displeaseth them also, which confess the Church
of <hi>Constantinople</hi>'s Priviledges as equal with <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 54. The 38th Canon containeth one great cause of the old Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz. That whatever alteration the Imperial Power makes on any City, the
Ecclesiastical Order also follow it.</hi> Did God make this Law? Are not as
many Souls in a Town that's no City as capable of being a Church as Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens?
It is in the Princes power to make and unmake Cities: May he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
make or unmake Churches? What if a King will have but one
City in his Kingdom, must there be no more Churches or Bishops? What if
there be no Cities (as in many <hi>American</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Countries) must
there be no Churches? What if the King will disfranchize most of the
Cities, and another will make every Market Town a City; must Churches
be altered accordingly? If so, O that our King would make us so many
Cities, as the work and the souls of Men need true Bishops, that one might
not have a thousand Parishes without any subordinate Bishop!. But if this
hold, the Emperor might have taken down <hi>Rome,</hi> and set up <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
or any other at pleasure.</p>
               <p>§ 55. <hi>Can.</hi> 50. Forbad Clergy and Laity to play at Dice, on pain of
Deposition, or Segregation.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Can.</hi> 51. forbids going to Shews, Jesters, Stage-Plays, Huntings.</p>
               <p>The 55th Canon commands the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to amend their Customs,
and not to fast on Sabbath-days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 62. Forbids Womens Publick Dancings, and Mens and Womens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

               <p>
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 72. Nullifieth Marriage with Hereticks. (Alas, good Bishops, did

or hundred Parishes had the Bishop then to hear? Not so many as
ours.)</p>
               <p>§ 56. The 82 Canon offends the Papists, forbidding the Picture of a
Lamb to be made for Christ as the Lamb of God.</p>

               <p>§ 57. <hi>CCXXII.</hi> An. 693. <hi>was another</hi> Toletan <hi>Council, called by King</hi>
Egica: <hi>Before it the King writeth a Sermon for them, wherein he tells them,</hi>

But if less, it must be part of anothers charge.</p>
               <p>§ 58. CCXXIII. <hi>An.</hi> 694. was another <hi>Toletan</hi> Council under the same
King <hi>Egica:</hi> (One would wonder that the Legislative vertue of the Church
should be continued to such fertility and multitude of Laws, as must follow
if in all Countries there be every year a Council: How great must the
Volumes of Laws be at last?<note place="margin">☜</note>) <hi>Binnius</hi> in his Notes on this Council tell us,
<hi>That though</hi> Paul <hi>would have the believing Husband or Wife stay with the
Unbeliever, in hope of Conversion, yet many hundred years experience hath
taught us the contrary, (that it tendeth rather to hurt than good) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now it must be otherwise, and they must separate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 59. CCXXIV. Even to those days the number of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> in
most Countries was the greatest, and the care of good men was to convert
them: (And therefore we read still of so many baptized at age.) A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

that the best Preachers should be sent from the Neighbor Churches to
convert the Heathens, (that was better work, than striving who should be
chief, or raging about hard words.)</p>
               <p>§ 60. CCXXV. A Synod at <hi>Aquileia, An.</hi> 698. condemned the 5th
General Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>

They all condemned the 6th General Council, and their Opinion of <hi>two
Wills,</hi> and <hi>two Operations.</hi> Where it is manifest,</p>
               <p>1. How great a part of the Church regarded not the Authority of

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">Councils called about Images and some others.</head>
               <p>§ 1. POpe <hi>Gregory</hi> the 2d is the Man that must set up Image-worship
against all opposition,<note place="margin">☜</note> rebel against his lawful Sovereign, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with other Princes to alienate the <hi>Western</hi> Empire, when the <hi>East</hi> was
almost ruined before, and so to weaken the Christian Power, that the <hi>Turk</hi>
might shortly win the Empire.</p>
               <p>§ 2. To have recited all along as we went on, what new Ceremonies,
Formalities and Orders were invented and brought in by the Popes, and how
Doctrine and Practice grew corrupted, being a thing done already by many
others, would have been tedious here, and besides the design of this writing,
which is but to shew how Prelates have used the Church by their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about JURISDICTION and HARD or AMBIGUOUS WORDS;
and what hath been the work especially of General Councils. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell you well the work of the following Councils, without telling some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the occasion of the matter.</p>
               <p>The Primitive Christians used not Images in the Worship of God, (read
<hi>Dalaeus de Imaginibus.)</hi> But the contempt of Christianity by the Heathens,
occasioned many to oppose their contempt by glorying in the Cross of Christ,
and by making the transient sign of it with their fingers; and thence they
grew to use the fixed sign of it; and thence to speak of and believe many
Miracles wrought by it; and thence to make the Image of Christ crucified,
(which yet <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemned;) and thence by degrees to make the
Images of the Apostles and Martyrs; and thence to make in their Churches
the Images of their deceased Bishops, (till an Excommunicater ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Opinion, that pull'd any of them down.)</p>
               <p>And abundance of Dreams, Visions, Apparitions and Revelations were the
pretended Proofs that prevailed for many such Superstitions, but especially
for <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Prayers for the dead.</hi> Among others, an
<hi>English</hi> Monk, <hi>Egwin</hi> of <hi>Evesholme,</hi> chosen Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> must lead
the way, by pretence of a Vision, (a Dream, no doubt) see <hi>Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
p.</hi> 209. in his own Chart <hi>Egwin</hi> saith, <hi>[That the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to a certain Shepherd called</hi> Eoves, <hi>and afterward to himself with two
Virgins, holding a Book in her hands, and told him in what place she would
have him build her a Monastery.</hi> The crafty Dreamer divulged the Vision,
and some good Men opposing it, the Pope must have the hearing of it. The
Pope put it to the Oath of <hi>Egwin,</hi> whether ever he saw such a Vision or not?
<hi>Egwin</hi> sware it, and the matter was past doubt, (just as honest <hi>Commenius</hi>
took <hi>Daubritius</hi>'s Prophesies to be of God, because the melancholy Man
sware that they were true.) Hereupon <hi>Egwin</hi> is sent home, and a Council
called to take <hi>Egwin</hi>'s words again that he had such a Vision, (and in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60852:105"/>
end was added, <hi>That the Virgin</hi> Mary'<hi>s Image must be set up in the place.)</hi>
The Pope sent to King <hi>Kenred</hi> and King <hi>Offa</hi> by Bishop <hi>Brithwald,</hi> to
grant what the Vision intended; who obediently make over a great part of
the Countrey to that Monastery, as you may see described in <hi>Spelman, Conc.
p. 209, 210. in Charta</hi> Kenredi <hi>&amp;</hi> Offae <hi>Regum.</hi> And <hi>p. 211. in Charta</hi>
Egwini, who saith himself, that <hi>[God being propitious to him, he had in a
little time got for the said Church an hundred and twenty Farms given, as
is written and confirmed in the Charter of that Church.</hi> Many Villages are
there named, and some great ones, in the fattest and richest part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Worcester.</hi> Was not this a profitable Dream or Vision? And should
we not have many <hi>Dreamers</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> if they could get as much by it
as <hi>Egwin</hi> did? And herewith Images are set up.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binnius</hi> question whether <hi>Naucler</hi> and <hi>Bale</hi> say
true, that this Council first brought Image-worship into <hi>England,</hi> because it
came in before with <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk. To which <hi>Spelman</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 217, 218. <hi>vide</hi> caetera.</note> well answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That the use of the Cross in banners and otherwise was here before, and
some Images for Instruction and Commemoration, as <hi>Beda</hi>'s own words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate;
but not any worship of Images, or worshiping before and towards
them.</p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> saith, (proving that Image-worship was not then in
use among the <hi>Saxons)</hi> that even praying to the Saints themselves was not
then in use, mentioning an old <hi>Psalter</hi> of his written about the time of the
2d <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, in which there were an hundred seventy and one Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
inserted between the <hi>Sections</hi> of the 119th <hi>Psalm,</hi> and in them all not one
name of any Saint, or the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> much less any Prayer directed to
them.</p>
               <p>§ 4. If one talk now with our <hi>English</hi> Papists, they are so loth to
own their own Doctrine and Practice, that they will tell you they hold not
the worshiping of the Image, but of the Person signified by it. But to tell
them how commonly their Writers defend worshipping Images, (if <hi>Colere</hi>
and <hi>Cultus</hi> signifie Worship) and what <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith of giving the worship
of <hi>Latria</hi> to the <hi>Image of Christ,</hi> and to the <hi>Cross,</hi> though undeniable, yet
will not be taken for sufficient proof. I shall therefore give you here th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sense of the Papal Church in <hi>England,</hi> in the form of Abjuration which
they prescribed to those that they then called <hi>Lollards,</hi> as it is found in the
<hi>Tower</hi> Records; and you must take it in the old <hi>English</hi> in which it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
because I do but transcribe it, and must not alter it, the sense of it being
plain and obvious.</p>

               <p>Here you see whether Papists worship <hi>Images,</hi> and whether they take it
not for Heresie (which is death) not to worship them, and whether they
leave it to mens liberty or not.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>Leo Isaurus</hi> being Emperor, he took the <hi>worshipping of Images</hi> to be
<hi>Idolatry;</hi> and his Empire being invaded by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who were scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60852:106"/>
by the Christians Images, he thought it was a warning to him to reform
them; and he published his Edict accordingly against the Religious adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and use of the Images of Angels, Martyrs, or Saints. <hi>Gregory,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> resisted him, and made Men believe that this was to fight against
Christ, and impiously to despise the Saints. The Emperor commanded his
Obedience on pain of Deposition. He would neither obey nor suffer. The
Emperor sent Men to apprehend him, (some say to kill him,) but he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them. The <hi>Lombards</hi> were stirred up to make War against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
as an Enemy of Christ:<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>[The Pope</hi> (saith <hi>Binnius, p.</hi> 177. out of
<hi>Zonaras) entered into a League with</hi> Charles Martell <hi>King of</hi> France,
<hi>that, if there were need, he should defend the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>against the
Emperor</hi> (their proper Sovereign) <hi>which League being prudently made, the
Emperor abstained for fear of</hi> Charles, <hi>who by great Victories was become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.—
But when the Emperor would not obey the Pope's pious warnings, but
used Tyranny in the</hi> East <hi>against the Orthodox, then the Pope anathematized
him as a known declared Heretick, and exhorted all his Subjects in</hi> Italy <hi>to
depart from his obedience.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note how Rebellion is the work and strength of the <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
do not our Papists now disown all this, and profess themselves to be the

seize on another mans Inheritance, and the Son keep it, and disclaim his
Fathers act, this is but a dead Confession.</p>
               <p>But hear the next words in <hi>Binnius,</hi> and judge what Doctrine yet they
hold, <hi>[Quo facto Sanctissimus Pontifex clarissimum posteris suis reliquit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum;
ne in Ecclesia Christi regere permittantur haeretici Principes, si fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter
moniti errori pertinaciter adhaerescant.]</hi> That is, BY WHICH FACT
(deposing the Emperor in <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> and absolving all his Subjects from their
Obedience) THE MOST HOLY POPE LEFT HIS POSTERITY
A MOST CLEAR (or Famous) EXAMPLE, THAT HERETICAL
PRINCES MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO RULE, IF BEING
OFT WARNED THEY PERTINACIOUSLY ADHERE TO ER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROR.]</p>
               <p>Note this ye Princes and Rulers that hear of Papal Loyalty.</p>
               <p>1. It is not lawful for them, if they can help it, to permit any of you to
reign over Christians, if they do but judge you Heretical. To tolerate you
is against their Consciences, if to depose you be not above their strength.</p>
               <p>2. By this Rule you see, that they were virtual Rebels to most or many
Emperors, when they durst not actually rebel. 1. When <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great banished <hi>Athanasius,</hi> it's like they would have taken him for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
2. <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> being <hi>Arrians,</hi> the Pope did virtually rebel
against them, and depose them (if then they were of the same mind as now.)
3. <hi>Theodosius junior, Zeno, Anastasius,</hi> and other Emperors they virtually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
as <hi>Eutychians. 4. Iustinian</hi> the first they virtually deposed as a <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasiastick.</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60852:106"/>
5. <hi>Philippicus,</hi> and many more Emperors are called by them <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites.</hi>
6. <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Constantine,</hi> and others, are called <hi>Iconoclastae.</hi> 7. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christian Princes and States, now are called by them <hi>Protestant</hi> or <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Hereticks. All these, they say, are such as may not be permitted, and
therefore they have interpretatively and virtually rebelled, and deposed
them.</p>
               <p>3. You see how great a matter this <hi>Excommunication</hi> is, and how impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is, by it for Kings and States to continue long in any right to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions:
For all men err; and while there are so many Patriarchs, Prelates,
if not Priests that have the power of Excommunicating, all men may expect
it: For he that is orthodox in the judgment of one Patriarch, will be a
Heretick in the judgment of another: while <hi>Rome, Const. Alexand. Antioch,
Ierusal.</hi> are so seldom of one mind. If with the repenting <hi>Lollard</hi> (afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
you will swear to hold that for Error which the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>
saith is such, perhaps the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> may be of the contrary
mind:<note place="margin">☜</note> Those called <hi>Arrians, Nestorians, Eutychians, Monothelites, Iconoclasts,</hi>
&amp;c. have in their turns had most of the known Christian World. And
he that is Excommunicate by one, must be received by none.</p>
               <p>4. But if it be the Popes prerogative, that though more may Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
Kings and Emperours, none but he can <hi>depose</hi> them, and <hi>disoblige</hi> all
their Subjects, it's pity but those Princes that are in love with such a Papacy
should know by experience what they love: For he that will take Satan for
his Ruler, must bear the inconveniences of his Government.</p>
               <p>5. You see here how the Empire was weakned, and so exposed to the
Turk; even by the Rebellion of <hi>Rome</hi> cutting off the <hi>Western</hi> Empire from
it.</p>
               <p>6. And you see what true Subjects they were to the <hi>Arrian, Gothish</hi> Kings,
at <hi>Rome, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. who would have deposed them if they could. What
wonder if the <hi>Goths</hi> kept down the Pope.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>In these times the Pope met with an</hi> English <hi>Bishop</hi> Wilfrid, <hi>who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
flattered and adored him, and he accordingly made him Bishop
of</hi> Mentz, <hi>and his great agent (even about this foresaid English Council
which was to set up Church-Images:) and recommended him to many
Christian Princes: And why was all this? and what was his rare merit? He
took this Oath to the Pope</hi> (Bin. p. 178) <q>[In the name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ our Saviour, in the Reign of <hi>Leo the great</hi> Emperour <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
Bishop by the Grace of God, do Promise to thee, <hi>Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and to thy Vicar Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Successors, by the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, the inseparable <hi>Trinity,</hi> and this most Holy Body of thine, that
I will exhibite all faith and purity of holy Catholick faith, and in unity of
the same faith, God operating, will persist, in which all the salvation of
Christians is proved undoubtedly to consist; and will no way consent,
whoever perswadeth me, against the unity of the common and universal Church,
but, as I said, will exhibite my faith and purity and concourse to thee and to
the Profits of thy Church, to whom by the Lord the Power of binding and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60852:107"/>
loosing is given, and to thy aforesaid Vicar and his Successors in all things,
<hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more meritorious with a Pope, or any Prelate of that Spirit,
than to be absolutely devoted to him, and swear obedience to him: Indeed
they that are fully fallen from God (as Satan is) would be as Gods to the
world themselves, and have all men depend upon them, and obey them.</p>
               <p>§ 7. What Arguments moved the Emperor to be against Images, (special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the 2d Commandment) and how <hi>Gregory</hi> thought that it was not the
Images of God and Christ, and Angels and Saints that were forbidden, you
may see in his <hi>Epistles</hi> too long to be here recited.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Here <hi>Binnius</hi> inserteth three <hi>Roman</hi> Councils. One cursing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Marriages. Another persuading <hi>Corbinianus</hi> to keep his Bishoprick, who
would fain have laid it down. And a third for Images, against the <hi>Iconoclasts</hi>
(the Emperor's Heresie.)</p>
               <p>§ 9. <hi>Gregory</hi> 3d succeedeth <hi>Gregory</hi> 2d. He sendeth his Epistles for
Images to the Emperor. The first Messenger durst not deliver them. The
rest were stopt at <hi>Sicily,</hi> and kept Prisoners. The <hi>Lombards</hi> infested <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope importuneth the <hi>French</hi> King for help. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> is
made King in <hi>Spain</hi> against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and first called himself <hi>[Catholick
King.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note>] Two Councils, <hi>Binnius</hi> saith, were held at <hi>Rome</hi> for Images. The
Title of the second is, <hi>[Pro Imaginum Cultu,</hi> for the Worship of Images:
<hi>An.</hi> 732. Image-worship was then avowed. But the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches did
more obey the Emperor.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> coming next, in whose time <hi>Italy</hi> was distressed by
<hi>Luitprandus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who took four Cities from the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he protected <hi>Trasimundus</hi> Duke of <hi>Spoleto:</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> helped <hi>Trasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi>
on condition he would restore to them the four Cities; he performeth
not his promise: wherefore Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> turned to <hi>Luitprand,</hi> and to win
him, <hi>Salutaria illi praedicavit,</hi> saith <hi>Anastasius;</hi> and he promised him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the four Cities. For the performance whereof, this Pope travelled to
him himself, (noted by <hi>Anastasius</hi> as a great act of self-denial, as venturing
his life for the Cause of God, that he would go to the King to ask for four
Cities) which he happily obtained.</p>
               <p>§ 11. In this Pope's time the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was translated from the
King and his Line, to a Subject, his <hi>Major Domûs.</hi>

               <p>Charles Martell <hi>the great</hi> French <hi>Conqueror was the Pope's Patron against
the Emperor who was his Sovereign.</hi> Gratian. d. 16. q. 1. post Can. 59.
<hi>tells it us as a matter of Church-credit, that when he was dead, he was damned
to Hell</hi> (much blood, <hi>and</hi> defending Popes that rebel against their Sovereign
<hi>are a very likely proof.)</hi> Carolomannus <hi>succeeded him, who, after two years
Reign, resigned his Crown, and chose a Monastery.</hi> Chilperic <hi>that came
after, proved very</hi> dull <hi>and</hi> sensual, <hi>and giving himself to his pleasure, let
the business of Government lie most on the hands of</hi> Pepin, <hi>who was his</hi>
Major Domûs, <hi>who thereby got the</hi> power <hi>and the</hi> respect <hi>that was proper to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60852:107"/>
the King, while the King grew into contempt. (And if Kings cannot keep
up their Power and Honour by the meer dignity of their place, without</hi>
personal worth and performance; <hi>why should Popes, Prelates and Priests, (whose
Power and Honour, as a Physicians, depend upon their Worth and Work)
expect to keep up their Power and Honour meerly by their Offices?)</hi> Pepin
<hi>won first the Nobles of</hi> France, <hi>and then the Pope; For, as</hi> Baronius <hi>and</hi>
Binnius (p. 197.) <hi>tell us,</hi> 
                  <q>[It seemed to the most Potent <hi>Pepin (Major

                     <note n="*" place="margin">No wonder.</note> and to the rest of the chief Men, and to all the People, that
he that had not the Matter and Force of the Kingdom, should not have
the name of a King; and on the contrary, he that had the Riches, Power
and Virtue, should also have the name of King: And because these Princes
and People were Christians, they judged that these their Councils would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stand ratified to Posterity, nor be acceptable enough to God, unless they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Authority and Force from the common Father and Pastor of the
Christian Church, the Vicar of the Lord Christ, and Successor of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
Therefore they send Legates to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Zachary,</hi> of whom Bishop <hi>Burchardus
Herbipol.</hi> was the chief, who were to ask the things aforesaid of him. He
consented, and decreed, and wrote back, that <hi>Chilperic</hi> being thrust into a
Monastery,<note n="*" place="margin">Were not Monks holy men then?</note> St. <hi>Boniface</hi> should declare and anoint <hi>Pepin</hi> King in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>

the Hereticks of our times deny not the History.—But they sharply impugn two
circumstances: The first is, that it was a great wrong to <hi>Chilperic,</hi> that the
Kingdom was taken from him: The second, that the said Translation was
made by the consent of the Council, Nobles and Commons, without the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Apostolic Seat<note n="*" place="margin">If you will needs have the honour of so had a work, (that you may have power to do the like) take it.</note>. <hi>Serarius</hi> proveth that the cause of the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kingdom was just. 1. Because all the best men did desire and
wish it, and did by their counsel and help co-operate to it. 2. Because St.
Bishop <hi>Burchardus</hi> did, as Legate, sollicite the Pope for it. 3. Pope <hi>Zachary</hi>
commanded it to be done; 4. And the most Holy <hi>Boniface</hi> at the Pope's
command did execute it. 5. And being approved by Divine Testimony, it
is recited in the sacred Canons, 15. <hi>q. 6. c. alius.</hi> 6. And by none of the
old Historians not praised, or disallowed: Only our new Hereticks, that love
Novelty, Arrogance and Rebellion by their perverse judgment by Contumelies
and Lyes disallow it. And that it was by the Authority of the Apostolick
Seat, that the Kingdom was translated from <hi>Chilperic</hi> to <hi>Pepin,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Historians do so expresly say, that it's a wonder with what front the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating
Hereticks dare call it in question.<note place="margin">☜</note> Lastly, It is here to be noted, that
it was by this same Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> that the nomination or postulation of Bishops

if elsewhere you read that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> give Bishops to the Churches,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60852:108"/>
remember that it is not done by their own Right, but by the Grant of the
Apostolick Seat: In vain therefore do the innovating Hereticks glory in this

               <p>§ 12. From this Story and these words, let the Reader think how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
these Questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Had not Kings need to take heed of making any one man too
great, if greatness and exercise of Government, give him so much right to
the Kingdom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Had not Kings need to look to their manners, for their Crowns
sake, as well as their Souls, if Lust, Sensuality and Dulness forfeit their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Did not Wars and weakning of the Empire make a great change
with Popes, when they that were set up and banished at the Emperor's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
can now first depose the Emperor in the <hi>West,</hi> for being against Images
and Persecuting, and then can translate the Crown of <hi>France?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Was not an ambitious Pope a fit Tool for <hi>Pepin</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
to work by, to put a pious gloss on their Conspiracy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Did not the Pope rise thus by serving the turns of Conspirators,
and of Princes in their quarrels with one another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. Are Subjects Judges when a King's Sins make him unworthy of
the Crown?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. Yea, is the Pope Judge, and hath he power to depose Kings, if he
judge them such Sinners, and unfit for Government?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. Is it a good Reason that a King is justly deposed, because <hi>Good Men
and Holy Bishops are the Desirers and Promoters of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. Would not this Reason have served <hi>Maximus</hi> against <hi>Gratian?</hi>
Was it not <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Plea? If he had but had the Pope and People on his
side, you see how it would have gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Is it the mark of an Innovating Heretick, to say <hi>that the Church
should be subject to Kings;</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> said it of all Christians so
long ago?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 11. Is it a Note that Protestants love <hi>Rebellion,</hi> because they are
against Popes deposing Kings? Or is there any heed to be taken of the words
of impudent Revilers, that dare speak before God and Man at this rate? Is
deposing Kings the Papists freedom from Rebellion, and is our opposing it
a character of Rebels?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 12. Is it any wonder that Bishop <hi>Burchardus</hi> desired it, and that
Bishop <hi>Boniface</hi> executed the Pope's command, who had been translated from
<hi>England</hi> by him to such dignity, and had sworn Obedience and Service to
him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 13. Is it any wonder that the Pope made these Bishops <hi>Saints?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 14. I hope they were really godly Men: But is it any wonder that
some good Men at such a time as that, did think it had been for the interest
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60852:108"/>
of Religion, to have all Power in the Clergies hands, especially being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Bishops that were to have so great a share? How few Bishops are
afraid of too much power, or ever do refuse it!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 15. If the King of <hi>France</hi> had his Kingdom by the Pope's gift, what
wonder if he had the power of nominating Bishops also by his gift?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 16. Whether he that hath power to give, hath not power to take
away, and be not Judge when the Cause is just?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 17. With what face do Papists at once make these claims, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Loyalty to Kings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. Whether it concern not Kings to understand on what terms they
stand with the Pope and his Clergy, that must not be subject to them, but
have power to depose them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 19. If there be any Party among them that hath more Loyal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
is it a sign of the concord of their Church, that agreeth not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of so great moment? Or a proof that the Pope is the infallible Judge of
Controversies, that will not determine so great a Point on which the Peace of
Kingdoms doth depend?</p>
               <p>§ 13. About the same time they persuaded <hi>Rachis</hi> King of the <hi>Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi>
Successor to <hi>Luitprand,</hi> for the love of Religion to lay down his Crown,
and go into a Monastery; so that Monasteries are places for the worst and
the best; some too bad to reign, and some too good, lest they should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
the Clergy.</p>
               <p>§ 14. <hi>It may be you will think that this Pope</hi> Zachary, <hi>and his sworn
Vassal St.</hi> Boniface, <hi>were some very profound Divines, that could by their
wisdom and piety thus master Kingdoms. Doubtless they were zealous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
to Heresies (except their own) and Successors of the Hereticating
and Damning Fathers. For</hi> Epist. 10. (Bin. p. 206, 207, 208.) Zachary
<hi>writeth to</hi> Boniface, <hi>to expel</hi> Virgilius <hi>from the Church and Priesthood, for</hi>
holding Antipodes, <hi>viz. that Sun-shine, and Moon-light, and Men are under
the Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note>

                  <hi>That by</hi> [another world] <hi>is

               </p>
               <p>§ 15. <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Did God make Popes to be the Governors of the <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
for so many hundred years, before they knew that there was any <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</hi>
And when they excommunicated and silenced those that affirmed it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:60852:109"/>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Were these Popes and Bishops Men of such wisdom, as were fit to
hereticate Dissenters as they did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Do we not see here what some Councils were, and did in those
times?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Do we not see what Heresie signified at <hi>Rome,</hi> and how little
heed there was to be taken of their outcry against some Heresies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Whether was all the World, or all the West bound to avoid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
after with <hi>Virgilius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. Do we not see here of what Infallibility the Pope is, in judging
of matters of Faith, and how happy the World is to have such a Judge, and
of what credit his Heretications and Excommunications are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. Do we not see how Religion hath been depraved and dishonoured
by the Pope and his Clergy, calling Good Evil, and the most certain Truths
by the name of <hi>[Perverse and unjust Doctrines, against the Lord, and Mens
own Souls?]</hi> What heed to take of these Mens words, when they seem zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
against Sin and Error?</p>
               <p>§ 16. Perhaps you will ask, How could any but Idiots be so ignorant?
Whither did they think the Setting-Sun went? Or what did they think the
Earth stood upon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The easiest things are strange to Men that never learnt them; it's
pity that it should be true, that <hi>Lactantius</hi> and other Ancients, yea, <hi>Austin</hi>
himself were ignorant of the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> but yet they had more Modesty
than to hereticate and excommunicate them that affirmed it. Few Bishops
had much Philosophy then. <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Apollinaris</hi> that were most Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,
had been hereticated and disgraced it. <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Tatianus</hi> sped
not much better. Councils had forbid Bishops to read the Books of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
<hi>Austin</hi> had a truly Philosophical head, being the Father of School-Divinity;
but he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and had little from his Teachers. You
may see in a great Hereticater <hi>Philastrius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> what they thought then of the
course of the Sun, by what he saith of the Stars: As it was one Heresie to
<hi>call the Star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by the names of living Creatures,</hi> so it was another to deny <hi>that
the Stars were Luminaries arbitrarily moved; that by Angels were set out at
night to light the World, and at morning retired inwards, or were taken into
their place again, as Men set out lights to the street at night, and take them in
again.</hi> I confess that no General Council declared this, (as they have done
worse things;) but you see what kind of Men were hereticated by Pope
<hi>Zachary, St. Boniface,</hi> and <hi>St. Philastrius,</hi> and such Bishops; and how little it
signifieth in such Writers, whether you read a Man called a Saint, or a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
an Orthodox Catholick, or <hi>Nefandissimus Haereticus,</hi> as they use to
speak: I speak it only of such Men.</p>
               <p>§ 17. For, Reader, I must still remember thee, that this Folly, Pride, and
almost Fury, was not the <hi>Genius</hi> or Character of the true spiritual Ministers
and Church of Christ, but of a worldly, ignorant, domineering sort of Men;
that made it their business to get Preferment, and have their wills. God had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60852:109"/>
all this while abundance of faithful Ministers that sate down at the lower
end; and humble holy People, that set not up themselves in worldly Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and came not much on the Stage, but approved themselves in secret,
and in their several Places and Conversations to God, some Lay-men, some
Priests, some Bishops, some of their names are come down to us in History, but
those are few. They strove not for great Places, nor did their Works to
be seen of Men, nor looked to Men for their Reward.</p>
               <p>§ 18. <hi>Some of the Canons and Councils of these Universal Pastors were
answerable to their Excommunications. In</hi> Zachary'<hi>s 12th</hi> Epistle <hi>to his
Vassal</hi> St. Boniface, <hi>he giveth him the resolution of many doubts. One is,</hi>
[After how long time Lard may be eaten? <hi>And it is resolved by the Pope;</hi>
That there is yet no Canon or Law for this by the Fathers, but he determineth
himself, 1. That it must not be eaten before it be dried in the smoke, or boiled,
(or basted) with fire; But if you list to eat it raw, it must be eaten after the
Feast of <hi>Easter.]</hi> Binnius, p. 209. <hi>(What would become of the Church, if
there were not a Judge of such Controversies, and an infallible Determiner
of such Questions?)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 19. CCXXV. I told you before how the Pope commanded <hi>Boniface</hi> to
call a Council to eject him that asserted the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> I must next add a
<hi>French</hi> Council called by King <hi>Carolomannus</hi> to Reform the Clergy <hi>(an.
742.)</hi> and <hi>to recover Christian Religion, which in the dayes of former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
dissipata corruit, <hi>being dissipated, was ruined; and to shew the People how
they may come to save their Souls, who have been hitherto deceived by false
Priests.</hi> (They are the words of the King and Council, <hi>Bin. p. 210. c. 2.)</hi>
Where it was decreed that Priests be not Soldiers, (unnecessarily:) That
they keep not Hounds to go an hunting with, nor Hawks: That every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Fornicator shall in the Jayl do Pennance with Bread and Water. If
the Fornicator be a Priest, he shall be first scourged, and then remain in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
two years: But if an inferior Clerk or Monk so fall, he shall be whipt,
and then do Pennance a whole year in Prison, and so the Nuns.</p>
               <p>This was somewhat like a Reformation: Had it not been done by a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it might have past for Heresie. It was at <hi>Ratisbonne; Boniface</hi> presiding.</p>
               <p>Such another Council called <hi>Leptinense,</hi> there was under <hi>Carolomannus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Council at <hi>Rome</hi> repeated the oft repeated Canons, to keep Bishops
and Priests from Nuns and from Fornication.</p>
               <p>§ 20. <hi>An.</hi> 744. Another <hi>Synodus Suession.</hi> under <hi>Chilperic</hi> governed by

killed: Then <hi>Gervilio</hi> his Son, a Lay-man, is made Archbishop to comfort
him. At another War he pretends a Conference with him that kill'd his
Father, and murders him; this is past by as blameless: But <hi>Boniface</hi> saith,
<hi>That a Man that had his hand in Blood, must not be a Bishop;</hi> and so got
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60852:110"/>
him out, and was made the chief Archbishop of <hi>Germany</hi> himself in his
place. Judge whether he served the Pope for nought.</p>
               <p>§ 22. Yet <hi>Boniface</hi> had not done with the two Hereticks, <hi>Aldebert</hi> and
<hi>Clemens,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man and a <hi>Scot. Boniface</hi> sendeth to <hi>Rome (Bin.</hi> p. 216.)
to desire the Pope, that as he had himself condemned these two Hereticks, the
Pope would also condemn them, and cast them into Prisons, where none
might speak with them. (Thus the Pope obtained his Kingdom, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Church. The motive was, that <hi>Boniface</hi> prosecuting them, had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
much for their sakes, the People saying that he had taken from them
holy Apostolick Men, (but this was not a Prison.) The Crimes which he
chargeth on <hi>Aldebert</hi> a Bishop are, that he was an Hypocrite, (an open
Crime!) that he had said an Angel appeared to him, and he had some rare
Reliques, and that he said he was Apostolick, and wrought Wonders; that
he got some unlearned Bishops to make him a Bishop absolutely, against the
Canons. He would not consecrate any Church to the memory of an Apostle
or Martyr; and spake against visiting in Pilgrimage the Temples of the
Apostles: He made Churches to his own honour, and set up Oratories and
Crosses up and down, and drew People from other Bishops to himself. That
he gave his nails and hair to be honoured with the Saints Reliques, and
would not hear Confessions, saying he knew their sins already.] If all this
was true, (which I know never the more for this Accusation) he seemed an
Hypocrite indeed, but whether an Heretick, I know not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scot</hi> Heretick is accused as denying the Church Canons, and the
meaning of some Fathers, despising the Synods Laws, saying that he may
still be a Bishop (for so he was) though he had two Sons, (in Adultery,
saith <hi>Boniface,</hi> perhaps in Marriage;) and (as he saith) holding that a
Man may marry his Brothers Widow, and that Christ at his Descent deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
all Souls out of Hell.] This was a foul Error indeed, if truly
charged. These were charged by <hi>Boniface</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Synod, to be
forerunners of Antichrist, (and how like are <hi>Aldebert</hi>'s Pretensions to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Roman</hi> Saints!) A Prayer also of <hi>Aldeberts</hi> was read, in which he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Angels under several strange names: Bishops and Presbyters had Votes
in this Council, and subscribed the Hypocrites condemnation. <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 218.
But there is no certainty that he named more than three Angels.</p>
               <p>§ 23. <hi>Stephen</hi> the 2d was chosen Pope by ALL THE PEOPLE after
<hi>Zachary,</hi> and dyed four days after suddenly.</p>
               <p>§ 24. <hi>Stephen</hi> the 3d was chosen by all the People (saith <hi>Anastasius.)
Aistulphus,</hi> King of the <hi>Longobards,</hi> threatned <hi>Rome,</hi> took their Gifts, and
demanded their Subjection. The Pope (after <hi>Gregory</hi> the 2d's Rebellion)
was glad to send to the Emperor, to crave an Army to save <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi>
when he could get no help from <hi>Constant.</hi> he sent to <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi>
One that he had made King by Rebellion, was obliged to help him, and by
an Army forced <hi>Aistulphus</hi> to covenant to restore <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and many other
<hi>Italian</hi> Cities, (not to the Emperor, whose Agent claimed his right, and was
denied by <hi>Pepin;)</hi> but to the Pope, (to reward him, and get the pardon of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60852:110"/>
his sins.) <hi>Aistulphus</hi> broke his Covenants. <hi>Pepin</hi> with another Army forceth
him to deliver them, and returneth. <hi>Aistulphus</hi> dyeth; <hi>Desiderius</hi> a Captain
by Usurpation invadeth the Kingdom, <hi>Radchis</hi> that had been King before,
and went into a Monastery, and the Nobles of the <hi>Longobards</hi> resist the
Rebel.<note place="margin">☜</note> He sendeth to the Pope, offering him all that he could desire (more
Cities) to help him: The Pope maketh his own bargain with him, as he did
with <hi>Pepin,</hi> (and <hi>Charles Martell</hi> before) and by the help of the <hi>French,</hi>
setleth the Rebel <hi>Desiderius</hi> in the Kingdom. <hi>Pepin</hi> maketh a Deed of Gift
of all the foresaid Cities to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (Was this <hi>Constantine</hi>'s
Gift?) He gave away another Mans (the Emperor's) Dominions, and
with <hi>Desiderius</hi>'s additions, now the Pope is become a Prince.</p>
               <p>§ 24. CCXXVIII. We come now to a great General Council of 338
Bishops at <hi>Constantinople, An.</hi> 754. under <hi>Constantine Copronymus</hi> against the
worshiping of Images:<note place="margin">Sixtus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sis &amp; Pet.</note> The Adversaries of it will not have it called the
7th General Council, because divers Patriarchs were absent, and it decreed,
say they,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Crabbe p.</hi> 458. say it was at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth them.</note> against the Truth. <hi>They not only condemned the worshiping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and</hi> Germanus Constantinus, Georgius Cyprius, Jo. Damascenus, <hi>and other
Worshipers of them, as Idolaters; but destroyed the Reliques of Martyrs, and
exacted an Oath of Men (by the Cross, and the holy Eucharist) that they
would never adore Images, but execrate them as Idols, nor ever pray to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apostles, Martyrs, and blessed Virgin,</hi> saith <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binnius, p.</hi> 235.
But the 15th and 17th definitions of this Council recited in the 2d <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council,<note place="margin">☜</note> shew that they were not so free from praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
and Saints, as we could wish they had: For they decree we must <hi>crave her
intercessions, and theirs;</hi> but they forbad praying to their Images.</p>
               <p>§ 25. The Acts of this Council (not pleasing the Adversaries) are not
delivered fully to us; but it fell out that their <hi>Decrees</hi> are repeated word by
word in the 2d <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and so preserved.</p>
               <p>§ 26. <hi>There is one Doctrinal definition of this Council, owned also by
their Adversaries the 2d</hi> Concil. Nicen. <hi>which by the way I will take notice
of, about the glorified Body of Christ, (and consequently ours after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection)
that it is a Body but not</hi> Flesh, <hi>Bin. p. 378. defin.</hi> 7. <q>[Siquis
non confessus fuerit Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum post assumptionem
animatae, rationalis &amp; intellectualis Carnis simul sedere cum Deo &amp; Patre,

ab iis à quibus compunctus est, &amp; maneat Deus extra crassitudinem car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
Anathema.]</q> 
                  <hi>To which saith the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council by</hi> Epiphanius,
<q>[Huc usque recte sentiunt &amp; Patrum traditionibus convenientia dicunt, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Two sorts I would have take notice of this:</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Papists,</hi> who say that the Bread is turned into Christ's <hi>very Flesh,</hi>
when he hath no very Flesh in Heaven: And therefore the meaning must be
of the Sacramental Sign, that it is the Representation of that real <hi>Flesh</hi> of
Christ which was sacrificed on the Cross.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:60852:111"/>
2. Some prejudiced <hi>Protestants</hi> that think he that saith, <hi>[Our Bodies (and
Christs) in Heaven; will not be Flesh and Blood formally and properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but spiritual glorious Bodies]</hi> doth say some dangerous new assertion;
such gross thoughts have gross heads of the heavenly state. To these I say,
1. You contradict the express words of God's Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. Flesh and
Blood cannot enter,</hi> &amp;c. That it is meant of Formal Flesh and Blood, and not
Metaphorical (Sin) is plain in the Context, see Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the
Text. 2. Give but a true definition of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and it will convince
you of itself. 3. You see here that you maintain an Opinion which these
two (even adverse) General Councils anathematized.</p>
               <p>§ 27. By this Council we may see, how little General Councils signifie
with the <hi>Papists,</hi> either as to Infallibility, Authority, or preservation of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
longer than they please the Pope. As to their Objection, that call it
<hi>Pseudo-septimum,</hi> that the Pope was not there; I answer 1. No more was he
by himself or Legate at the first of <hi>Constant.</hi> called the 2d General Council,
as <hi>Binnius</hi> professeth. 2. Is not the Church the Church, if the Pope be not
there? Then he may choose whether ever there shall be more General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
(as indeed he doth.)</p>
               <p>§ 28. CCXXIX. <hi>An.</hi> 756. King <hi>Pepin</hi> called a Council in <hi>France,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that things were so far out of order, that he could attempt but a partial
Reformation, leaving the rest till better times. The first Canon was, that
every City have a Bishop;<note place="margin">☞</note> of old <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signified every such Town as our
Corporations and Market-Towns are: And by all the old Canons and
Customs (except some odd ones) every such Town of Christians was to
have a Bishop; and in <hi>Phrygia, Arabia,</hi> &amp;c. the Villages had Bishops, saith
<hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp;c. And in many places the Villages had <hi>Chorepiscopos,</hi> which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius
(Annot. in Epiphan. Arian.)</hi> fully proveth <hi>were true Bishops.</hi> And
yet then the most of the People in most Countries were without the Church;
so that then a Church was no greater than was capable of personal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Here this King (being made by the Pope) so far gratified the Clergy, as
to decree that Contemners of Excommunication should <hi>be banished.</hi> And
now the <hi>Keys</hi> do signifie the Sword, and Church-Discipline is made another
thing than Christ had made it.</p>
               <p>The 13th <hi>Cap.</hi> is, That no vacant Bishop meddle in another Bishop's Parish
without his consent, (by what true authority then can the Pope meddle in
other Mens Diocesses, since the foundation of his humane authority in the
Empire is subverted?)</p>
               <p>The 14th <hi>Cap.</hi> decreed, That Men may use Horses and Chariots for Travel
on the Lord's-day, and get Meat and Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not do common
work.</p>
               <p>The 17th, That no Clerk try his Cause before a Lay-Judge, without the
Bishop's leave.</p>
               <p>§ 29. Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> dying, in the division at the next choice, (by all the
People) the stronger part chose <hi>Paulus</hi> a Deacon, CCXXX. in his time a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60852:111"/>
                  <hi>German</hi> Council condemned <hi>Oathmarus,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Gallus,</hi> for Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
and put him in Prison, where he dyed of Famine; as Historians say,
maliciously upon false accusation.</p>
               <p>§ 30. At this time the <hi>Greeks</hi> accused the <hi>Romans,</hi> for adding the word
<hi>[Filioque]</hi> to the Creed:<note place="margin">☜</note> And about that and Images, they say there was
some Synod at a Village called <hi>Gentiliace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 31. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> dying, and the People having still the choice, he that
could get the greatest strength was in hope of so rich a Prey: And <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
Brother to one Duke <hi>Toto,</hi> getting the strongest Party, by fear compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>George</hi> Bishop of <hi>Praenestine,</hi> with two more Bishops, to make him Pope,
(being first ordained Deacon,) he possessed the Popedom alone a year and a
month:<note place="margin">☜</note> Then one <hi>Christopher</hi> the <hi>Primocerius,</hi> and his Son <hi>Sergius</hi> being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
got out to the King of the <hi>Longobards,</hi> and craved his help against
<hi>Constantine</hi> as an Usurper; and gathering some strength got into <hi>Rome,</hi> killed
<hi>Toto;</hi> and caused <hi>Constantine</hi> the Pope, and another Brother <hi>Paessivus</hi> to take
Sanctuary. One <hi>Waldipertus</hi> a Presbyter was of <hi>Christopher</hi>'s Party, and to
make haste, without <hi>Christopher</hi>'s knowledge, he gathereth a Party, and they
make one <hi>Philip</hi> (a Presbyter) Pope. (So there were two Popes.) <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
incensed, swore he would not enter <hi>Rome,</hi> till <hi>Philip</hi> was pull'd out of
the Bishop's house; which <hi>Gratiosus,</hi> one of his Party, presently performeth,
and <hi>Philip</hi> returneth to his Monastery. <hi>Christophorus</hi> calleth the Clergy, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Soldiers together, and (by his means) they chuse another <hi>Stephen,</hi>
(and so there are three Popes.) The Actors being now in their zeal, go
to <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Bishop, and <hi>Vicedominus</hi> that joined with Pope <hi>Constantine,</hi> and
they put out his eyes, and cut out his tongue. Next they attempted the like
excaecation on <hi>Passivus.</hi> Bishop <hi>Theodore</hi> they thrust into a Monastery, and
there (while he cryed for a little water) they famished him to death. <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
they put into another Monastery. They took all their Goods and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.
Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> they brought out, and set on Horseback on a
Womans Saddle with Weights at his Feet, and put him into a Monastery,
(How holy then were Monasteries!) Shortly after they brought him forth,
and Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> and some Bishops deposed him. Then the Citizens were to
make their penitent Confessions for owning him. Next the Army goeth to
<hi>Alatrum</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> where <hi>Gracilis</hi> the Tribune that had been for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
is apprehended, brought bound to <hi>Rome,</hi> imprisoned, and after his
eyes put out, and his tongue cut out. After this, <hi>Gratiosus</hi> and his Zealots
go to the Monastery where they had thrust Pope <hi>Constantine,</hi> and drag him
out, and put out his eyes, and leave him blind in the street. Next, they go
to their own Friend Priest <hi>Waldipertus,</hi> and feign that he had laid a Plot with
the <hi>Longobards</hi> to kill <hi>Christopher,</hi> and send to apprehend him, and when he
fled for Sanctuary to a Temple, they drew him out with the blessed Virgins
Image in his hand (even then when they were rebelling for the sake of
Images;) but that would not save the Priest, (because he set up <hi>Philip</hi> for
Pope;) they thrust him into a filthy Dungeon-hole, but that was too good
for him: In a few days they drew him out, and casting him on the earth, put
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60852:112"/>
out his eyes, and cut out his tongue, and put him into an Hospital, where he
dyed of the pain. And now Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> had, no doubt, a lawful calling to
be Pope. He sends his Legats to the King of <hi>France.</hi> He brings forth
blinded Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> to answer for his Crime, who falling flat on the earth,
he lamenteth his sin as more than the Sands on the Sea-shore, and professeth
that the People chose and forced him to be Pope, because of their sufferings
under <hi>Paul:</hi> But at his next appearance he tells them, that he did no more
than many other Lay-men did, who invaded Bishopricks; as <hi>Sergius</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Ravenna, Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp;c. when they heard this, all
the Priests caused him to be buffeted, and cast him out of the Church, and
burnt his Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the most holy Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> cast himself on the
earth, with all the Priests and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with tears lamented their
sin, that they had taken the Communion from the hands of Pope <hi>Constantine,</hi>
(it seems it is a sin to communicate with Bishops that are brought in irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by secular Power without due Election,<note place="margin">☞</note> and they are no Schismaticks
that refuse it.) And so they all performed their Pennance for it, <hi>Anastas. in
ejus vita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 32. CCXXXI. On this great occasion Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> (being far unable
now to call General Councils) sends to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to entreat him to
send some wise Bishops to a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> who sent him about a dozen,
who, with some others, agreed against <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Election, and such other
for the time to come; and damned a Synod that <hi>Constantine</hi> had held; and
also passed their judgment for Images.</p>
               <p>§ 33. But here was a great difficulty, (such as often after happened)
Whether <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Papal Acts were valid; and the Council decreed that
they should all be void except his <hi>Baptizings,</hi> and his <hi>Consecrations:</hi> And so
those Priests that he Consecrated, when they were after duely chosen, officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without a new Consecration.<note place="margin">☞</note> Either he was a real Pope, or no Pope. If
a Pope, then by the Canons <hi>Stephen</hi> was no Pope, and so the Succession there
failed. If no Pope, then, 1. How come his Consecrations to be valid?
2. Are not Presbyter's Ordinations better than a Lay-mans? 3. Then the
Universal Church had no Head, and so was no Church (with them) while
<hi>Constantine</hi> was Pope.</p>
               <p>§ 34. A like Schism fell out at <hi>Ravenna:</hi> The power of the Magistrate
made one <hi>Michael, Scriniary</hi> of the Church, (a Lay-man) Archbishop, the
People being for one <hi>Leo,</hi> whom they imprisoned. He kept the place above
a year; but by the help of the Pope, and the <hi>French,</hi> the People rose and
cast him out, and brought him Prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> and set up <hi>Leo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 35. <hi>Christopher</hi> and his Son <hi>Sergius</hi> were the Captains that had wrought
this great deliverance to the Church: And now they plead with King <hi>Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derius</hi>
for St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Rights, as still zealous for the Pope. The King is angry
with them, and jealous of their power, and seeketh to destroy them, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to set their own Pope against them. They get the Citizens to stand
by them, and the King cometh with an Army. The Pope seeing which was
like to be the stronger side, in great wisdom went out to the King, and after
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60852:112"/>
some days conference with him, sendeth to <hi>Christopher</hi> to render himself to
the King. The Citizens hearing this, forsook <hi>Christopher</hi> and <hi>Sergius; Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosus</hi>
(seeing they were deserted by the People through the Pope) went
out first to the King and Pope, and <hi>Sergius</hi> next, and <hi>Christopher</hi> last. The
Pope was so kind to them that made him Pope, that he made them Monks,
and put them in Sanctuary in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church to save their lives: But they
had <hi>Adonibezek</hi>'s justice, and were soon drag'd out thence, and <hi>Christopher</hi>'s
eyes put out, of which he dyed. But <hi>Sergius</hi> was awhile a Monk, and
then thrust in the <hi>Laterane</hi> Cellar. Thus went the matters of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Monarch at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 36. A little before the Pope's death, <hi>Sergius</hi> was fetcht blind out of the
Cellar, and kill'd; the next Pope searcht out the Authors, and found them
to be <hi>Paulus Cubicularius,</hi> and the last Pope's Brother, and other great Men;
and he prosecuted some of them to Banishment, but the Archbishop of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi>
caused <hi>Paul</hi> to be killed.</p>
               <p>§ 37. It was <hi>Adrian</hi> (a Deacon) that was then chosen Pope (Son to
the chief Man in <hi>Rome,</hi> ablest to effect it.) Upon these stirs, <hi>Desiderius</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
friendship with the Pope; but he demanding the Cities which <hi>Pepin</hi> had
given the Church (some of which <hi>Desiderius,</hi> still kept) and doing the
foresaid justice on the Friends of <hi>Desiderius,</hi> he came with an Army and
killed many, and took many Cities. The Pope urgeth the restitution of all his
Cities, (indeed the Emperor's) given him by <hi>Pepin;</hi> he still denieth; the
Pope gets <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to come with an Army, for fear of whom the
<hi>Longobards</hi> flie. The Dutchy of <hi>Spoletum,</hi> and other Cities, yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Pope, (and, as a token of subjection, receive tonsure.) <hi>Charles</hi>
besiegeth <hi>Desiderius</hi> in <hi>Papia,</hi> and forceth his Brother <hi>Carloman</hi>'s Wife and
Children that fled to the <hi>Longobards,</hi> to yield themselves to him; while the
Siege continued <hi>Charles</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was gloriously entertained by the
Pope, and renewed to him <hi>Pepin</hi>'s gift of all the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and
many Dukedoms and Cities, (which were none of his own to give) and
now the Pope is a Prince indeed. And <hi>Charles</hi> returning to the Siege, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth
<hi>Papia,</hi> taketh King <hi>Desiderius,</hi> and winneth all the <hi>Longobards</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
And thus Strength gave Right (according to the Atheists Opinion now
stirring, that <hi>[Right is nothing but a power to get and keep.] Pepin</hi> and
<hi>Charles</hi> make themselves Kings, and the Pope a Prince; that while they share
the Emperor's Dominions between them, they might be a strength to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
And <hi>Desiderius</hi> being himself but an Usurper, helped by the Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Throne, no wonder if when interest changed, the same hand take him
down. How <hi>Charles</hi> his Brother <hi>Caroloman</hi> dyed, and why his Wife and
Sons fled from <hi>Charles</hi> to the <hi>Longobards,</hi> and what became of them, is not
well known.</p>
               <p>§ 38. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the 1st thus made a greater Prince than any before him,
did greater works than they had done, and <hi>ob nimium amorem Sancti Petri,
&amp; ex inspiratione Divina,</hi> built many great and stately Buildings, made all
places about his Palace, Baths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fit for splendid pomp and pleasure, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60852:113"/>
all this from meer self-denial and holiness: Many Churches also he repalred
and adorned, and did many other such good works.</p>
               <p>§ 39. This great <hi>Adrian</hi> was before but a Deacon. I have oft mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
to read that Deacons were so ordinarily then made Popes, (and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Lay-men) when yet the old Canons required an orderly rising through
the several degrees.<note place="margin">☞</note> It was no wonder that then a Deacon at <hi>Rome</hi> was a
far higher preferment than a Bishop: For a Deacon (and a Priest) might
be chosen Pope, but a Bishop could not: For of old (when Diocesses and
Parishes were all one) the Canons decreed that no Bishop should remove to
another Church, (except being Consecrated by others, he never consented
nor had possession;) so that every Bishop must live and dye in the place
where he was first Ordained; so that <hi>Rome, Const. Alex. Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. and
all the great Seats chose either Deacons, Priests, or Monks to be their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
and Bishops. No wonder then, if as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> saith, <hi>Orat.</hi> 5. it was
the custom to have almost as many Clergy-men in every Church as People, in
regard of the present Honour, and the future hopes of Preferment. Indeed
he carried it that had the greatest Friends, which was as commonly the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
as the Priest or Archdeacon. By which we may conjecture, whether the
worthiest Men were made Popes: For if they were the worthiest, why were
they by former Popes never made higher before than Deacons? Did not the
Popes know the worthiest men?</p>
               <p>And if a breach of the Canons in Elections nullifie the regular Succession,
by this it is evident, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Seat hath no such Succession.</p>
               <p>§ 40. By the way the Reader must note, that in all the Writings of the
Popish Clergy concerning these matters, there are certain terms of Art, or
Interest, which must be understood as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>§ 41. About the death of <hi>Paulus Cubicularius,</hi> and others, note, that it
had long been the way of the Church-Canons, to contradict God's great Law
for humane safety, <hi>[He that sheddeth Man's blood, by Man shall his blood be
shed;]</hi> and on pretence of being (more) merciful (than God) to entice
Murderers, Adulterers, and all wicked Thieves and Criminals to make up the
Church of Christ, by decreeing, that instead of being Hanged, or Beheaded,
if they would but be Baptized, they should but be kept for a time from the
Sacrament, or do Pennance; and what Villain would not then be a
Christian?</p>

§ 42. <hi>Here ariseth a great Controversie with</hi> Sigibert, <hi>(a Monk-Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian)
and</hi> Gratian <hi>himself, which</hi> Baronius <hi>and</hi> Binnius <hi>take up,</hi> viz. <hi>the first
say,</hi> [That <hi>Charles</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Council there with Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> gave him
the power of chusing the Pope, and ordering the Apostolick Seats; and all Bishops
and Archbishops in all Provinces, to receive Investiture from him; and that none
should Consecrate a Bishop unless he were praised and invested by the King; and
that they Anathematize all that rebel against this Decree, and confiscate their
Estates if they repent not: But, <hi>say</hi> Baronius <hi>and</hi> Binnius, this is a lye, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
deceit to flatter the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> a Schismatick. <hi>And while Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers
may have the Lye given them so easily by Dissenters in matters of such
publick Fact, we are left at great uncertainty in History, others as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giving the Lye to the Papal Flatterers, as they do those of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that do not please them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One of the Reasons against this Decree, is the contrariety of the</hi> French
<hi>Constitutions,</hi> l. 1. c. 84. <hi>saying,</hi> [Not being ignorant of the sacred Canons
we consented to the Ecclesiastick Order, to wit,<note place="margin">☜</note> that Bishops be chosen by the
Election of the Clergy and PEOPLE, according to the Statutes of the Canons
out of their own Diocess, without respect of Persons or Rewards, for the merit of
their life, and their gift of wisdom, that by example and word they may every
way profit those that are under them.]</p>
               <p>1. This indeed sheweth how Bishops by the Canons were to be chosen,
even till these days of <hi>Charles the Great;</hi> he was to be taken for no Bishop
that came not in by the Peoples (as well as the Clergies) Election, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at least.</p>
               <p>2. But this contradicteth not what <hi>Sigibert</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> say; the Emperor
might still have a negative voice after all, especially as to a Pope: In very
deed, the door is safe that hath divers locks. 1. It belongeth to the Clergy
and Ordainers to judge who shall be <hi>[A Bishop or Minister of Sacred things.]</hi>
2. It belongeth to the Flock to discern whom they will accept for THEIR
Bishop or Pastor. 3. It belongeth to the Magistrate to judge whom he will
countenance or tolerate in that Office.</p>
               <p>§ 43. <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> the Historian was Secretary to <hi>Desiderius</hi> the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobard</hi>
King; <hi>Charles</hi> in anger commanded his hand to be cut off, for doing
somewhat for his own King against him; the Courtiers added, <hi>that his eyes
should be put out;</hi> which made <hi>Charles</hi> consider and say, <hi>If we do but cut off
his hand, where shall we find such another Historian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 44. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor now dying, called <hi>Copronymus;</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi>
call us to take notice what a Leader we follow that are against the Worship
of Images; saying that he dyed with the <hi>beginnings of Hell-fire,</hi> convinced
of his sin against the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that all his life he loved the smell of
dung, and stinking things; strong Arguments for Image-worship, as worthy
as <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s and <hi>Gratian</hi>'s, to be suspected as Lyes, or of little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>

§ 45. While <hi>Leo Isaurus</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> lived, the Councils of Bishops
went with them, and Images went down in the Eastern Empire: <hi>Constantine</hi>
dying, his Son <hi>Leo</hi> succeeded him, saith <hi>Binnius,</hi> in his Heresie, Impiety and
Sacriledge, that is, in his opposition to Image-worship, and such like. <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
saith, he first feigned himself a Catholick, (that is, for Images) but
after fell off: His Sacriledge was, that loving Jewels, he took for himself a
rich Crown, which <hi>Maurice</hi> had devoted to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> whereupon
Carbuncles arose on him, and he dyed: but had not <hi>Maurice</hi> himself a sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
death? Thus partial Historians feign and apply Judgments.</p>
               <p>§ 46. <hi>Irene, Leo</hi>'s Widow, with her Son <hi>Constantine</hi> a Child, next ruled,
and, saith <hi>Binnius, God by a Widow and an Orphan Child, by a Wonder, did
tread down the Impiety that had been set up, and restored Religion,</hi> that is,
<hi>Images.</hi> And indeed <hi>Rome</hi>'s interest and proper way hath been chiefly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
under <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Rebels.</hi> And it is no wonder if <hi>Irene</hi> a <hi>Woman,</hi> and
her <hi>Child,</hi> were more for <hi>Images</hi> than their Predecessors. <hi>Children</hi> use to
play with <hi>Images,</hi> and Womens Fancies are oft not unsuitable to them. I
think it as observable a matter, as <hi>Binnius</hi> doth, to note the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>§ 47. There are in <hi>Binnius</hi> the Titles of 44 at least Epistles of Pope
<hi>Adrian</hi>'s recited:<note place="margin">☞</note> The 36th saith, <hi>[He professeth that the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>doth embrace and reverence the Whole fourth</hi> Calcedon <hi>Council.</hi> Remember
then that the last Canon is approved, which declareth the reason of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Priviledges to be because it was the Imperial Seat, and therefore that
<hi>Constantine</hi> should have the like, and that it was <hi>given it by the Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most or many of them are thanks to <hi>Charles</hi> for giving St. <hi>Peter</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Cities and Dukedoms, and Exhortations to him to continue his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
By their ordinary language you would not suspect any Selfishness, Pride
or Covetousness in the Popes; it is but for St. <hi>Peter</hi> that they desire
all.</p>
               <p>§ 48. In his Epistle to <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> (the Child and Mother) to
entice them to be for <hi>Images,</hi> he tells a fabulous Story<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Hen. Fowlis</hi> of Papists Treasons, <hi>P.</hi> 120. proving the whole Story false.</note> of a Vision of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s
sending him to <hi>Silvester</hi> as his Guide, to be baptized of him, and
to be thereby cured of a Leprosie: It was <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> that appeared to
him; and he asked <hi>Silvester</hi> whether there were left any Images of <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Paul,</hi> which he affirmed, and shewed him their Pictures; and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
cryed out, <hi>These are the Men that appeared to me.</hi> And part of their
Message to him was, that he should bring all the world into the subjection of
the Church of <hi>Rome.]</hi> Was not here a strong Argument to a Woman and
a Child to be for the <hi>Pope</hi> and for <hi>Images,</hi> contrary to current History, (that
tells us <hi>Constantine</hi> was baptized at <hi>Nicomedia</hi> a little before his death;) and
without any credible proof. Thus the Papal <hi>Rome</hi> was built. When <hi>Adrian</hi>
had given away the Western Empire to <hi>Charles,</hi> yet he thus flattereth a
Woman and Child in the East, as if he had done them no wrong at
all.

§ 49. <hi>Paul</hi> Bishop of <hi>Const.</hi> having sworn against Images, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
is said to resign his place, and to tell them that they must have a
General Council; and <hi>Tarasius</hi> succeeding him, being for <hi>Images,</hi> got a
promise of a Council. It seems by their Epistles, though they agreed about
<hi>Images,</hi> Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and this <hi>Tarasius</hi> accused each other as suspected of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
see <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 262. and the Epistles. <hi>Irene</hi> knew that <hi>Tarasius</hi> was for
her turn, and <hi>Tarasius</hi> knew that <hi>Irene</hi> was for Pictures; and so between them
common notice was given abroad before-hand to the Bishops, (that lately
had condemned Image-worship,<note place="margin">☜</note> and pull'd them down) that the Empress
and the Patriarch were for restoring Images, and would call a Council to that
end: and this was enough to prepare the majority of the Bishops for a sudden
change.</p>
               <p>§ 50. Besides a Council at <hi>Wormes, An.</hi> 772. to little purpose, <hi>Velserus</hi>
hath published one of that year at <hi>Dingolvinga</hi> in <hi>Bavaria</hi> under Duke
<hi>Tassilo,</hi> which had divers Canons of Equity, and some of Superstition; one
was, that certain Bishops and Abbots agreed, that whosoever dyed first, the
rest should sing so many <hi>Psalms,</hi> and get thirty Masses to be said. And a
notable Priviledge is granted to all that will but seek liberty or shelter in the
Church, that both they and their Posterity shall be free, unless they bring a

                  <q>Constitutions that are contrary to the Canons, and to the
Decrees of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to <hi>Good Manners,</hi> are of no moment:</q>
                  <hi>(which nulleth even many of the Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>also, as against</hi> Good

               <p>
                  <hi>Another notable Canon is,</hi>

Caput amputetur: Delatores autem sunt qui ex invidia produnt alios.]</q> 
                  <hi>That
is,</hi> 
                  <q>Let a Delator's tongue be pull'd out, or if Convict, his Head cut off: Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

               <p>Another Canon is, <q>

               <p>§ 54. CCXXXII. We come now to the great General Council at <hi>Nice</hi>
2d, called by the <hi>Papists</hi> the 7th, (that is, the 7th which pleased
them.)</p>
               <p>I have before noted that <hi>Irene,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Leo,</hi> now Ruled, her Son
<hi>Constantine</hi> being Titular Emperor, a Child, under her Government. One
<hi>Stauratius</hi> a Senator most swayed her, or ruled her. <hi>Taurasius</hi> the Patriarch
joined with her for Images. They call a Council at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> A Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council and three Emperors <hi>(Leo, Const. &amp; Leo)</hi> had lately condemned
Images,<note place="margin">☜</note> and taken them down. The Pope and many <hi>Italians</hi> had resisted by
force. This violence made the Emperor use severity against the Resisters.
At <hi>Ravenna</hi> they killed <hi>Paulus</hi> the 14th Exarchate. In <hi>Rome</hi> they took <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
a Duke, and put out his eyes. In <hi>Campania</hi> they beheaded <hi>Exhileratus</hi>
the Duke, and his Son <hi>Adrian,</hi> who took the Emperor's part. How the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
hereby lost <hi>Italy,</hi> is before shewed. But this Woman <hi>Irene</hi> will do as
the Pope would have her: She is as much for Pictures as the Pope himself.
She calling this Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the old Soldiers bred up under
the former Emperors being against Images, <hi>(haeresin medullitus imbiberant,</hi>
saith <hi>Binnius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> p. 396.) Would not endure them in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. At which the Empress being troubled, dismissed the Bishops till
they had purged the Army of those old Soldiers, and then she called the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to <hi>Nice;</hi> and there (they knowing their errand before-hand) damned
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60852:116"/>
themselves and their Brethren that had held the former universal Synod, and
set up Images again.</p>
               <p>§ 55. By the way, I appeal from Pride and Ignorance, to Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Reason, how the taking down of Images can (in the <hi>Roman</hi> sense)
be called an Heresie,<note place="margin">☞</note> unless it be an Article of Faith, that Images must or may
be used. And can any Man that ever read and believed the Scriptures, and
the Writings of the first four hundred years, believe that having or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
of Images, or Saints by Images, is an Article of Faith, or necessary to
Salvation? The best of them that any Man can plead with Modesty is, that
they are <hi>indifferent,</hi> or <hi>lawful,</hi> and useful to some Persons. The <hi>Papists</hi> tell
us now that they would not compel us to bow toward Images, but leave it to
our liberty. Must it be Heresie, and the Christian world cast into distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about it, when yet this Image-worship is Idolatry in the sense of one part
of Christians, and but indifferent and convenient to the ignorant (that have
other helps enow) in the sense of others? O what a Plague hath it been to
the world, to have a worldly Clergy invade the Churches!</p>
               <p>§ 56. At the meeting of this Council we have first the Call and Title, in
which,</p>
               <p>1. The Emperor and his Mother are called the Governors of <hi>the whole
world, (Orbis Terrarum.)</hi> And yet our <hi>Papists</hi> (as <hi>W. Iohnson</hi> in his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
represt,</hi> &amp;c.) would make Men believe that if they find but such a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Council, or of the Church, it must needs signifie more than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
even all the Earth indeed.</p>
               <p>2. It's expresly said over and over, that this Council was called by the
Emperor, and by their Decree and Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tharasius</hi> beginneth with telling them the need of Reformation (for Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,)
and reporting how they were assaulted at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when they
met there, (and so removed to <hi>Nice,)</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ 57. Next the Letters of the Empress and her Son are read, in which
they are before made know what they must do. They are told what <hi>Paul
Const.</hi> on his Death-bed said for Images, and that <hi>Tarasius</hi> would not take
the Patriarchate till he had promise of a Council to restore them, and some
hopes of it.</p>
               <p>The Emperor here saith, that <hi>[he called and Congregated the Synod,</hi> and
that <hi>ex universo terrarum orbe, out of the whole earthly world;]</hi> and yet it was
only out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>§ 58. <hi>When the Bishops business was so well made known by the Woman
that called them, first three Bishops that had been lately forward speakers
against Images in the former General Council under</hi> Constantine, <hi>did humbly
confess their sin to the Council, and asked forgiveness; that is,</hi> Basil. Ancyrae,
Theodorus Myron, <hi>and</hi> Theodosius Amorii. <hi>And first</hi> Basil <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ancyra
<hi>gave them his Creed, in which he professed to</hi> 
                  <q>believe in the Trinity, and
to embrace the intercession of the Mother of God, and of the heavenly Powers,
and of all the Saints, and with all honour to receive and embrace their holy
Reliques, firmly believing that he may be made Partaker of their holiness:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60852:116"/>
Also that he embraceth the venerable Images, which<note n="*" place="margin">The Verb is left out.</note> the Oeconomy of our
Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the inviolate Virgin our Lady the Mother of
God, and of the holy Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, and all Saints; and giveth
them due honour: Rejecting and cursing with all his mind that called the
7th Synod<note n="(*)" place="margin">Where he was lately a Leader.</note>, that was gathered by a depraved mind and madness—a
false Council, as alien to all Piety and Religion, impiously barking against
Ecclesiastical Legislation—reproaching venerable Images, and commanding them
to be taken out of the Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And to shew his zeal, and lead others the way, he delivereth in nine Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or Anathemas. One against those that demolish Images. Another against
those that expound the Scripture words against Idols and <hi>Gentile</hi> Images, as
against Christians Images. Next he execrateth all that embrace not Images,
so it is now become necessary unto salvation.) Another Curse is against
those that favour them that are against Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Was not the Church
ill used by her Bishops, when they are sure to be cursed by them; one year
cursing all that be for Images, and another cursing all that be not for them?
Was it such a cursing Clergy, to make a cursed Church, that Christ ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?)
And that the Council might not suspect that this Bishop was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizer,
and changed his Opinion with the Times, first he professeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
all this, <hi>[With his whole Soul, Heart and Mind;]</hi> and next he wisheth,
<hi>[That if ever by any means he revolt again from Images, he may be alienated
from God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the Catholick Church.]</hi> And thus
he renounceth Repentance, cursing himself if ever he repent.</p>
               <p>§ 59. Tharasius <hi>and his Synod glorifie God for this excellent Confession:
And next cometh</hi> Theodore <hi>Bishop of</hi> Myros, <hi>and he doth the like, and is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
received: And next cometh</hi> Theodosius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Amorium, <hi>and he more
dolefully lamenteth, that</hi> [being a sinner, and seduced, he had blattered out
many evils untruly against venerable Images; and therefore confessing his fault,
he condemneth and curseth <hi>(or detesteth)</hi> himself, resolving hereafter to do the
same thing which he had cursed <hi>(or spoken ill of)</hi> and to teach it to the world,
and begging to be received among Christians, though unworthy. <hi>Next he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Libel, viz.</hi> 
                  <q>First I approve, receive, salute and venerate before all
things, the intemerate Image of our Lord Iesus Christ our true God, and the
blessed Mother Virgins, who brought him forth without seed<note n="*" place="margin">How was he then of her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note>; whose help, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and intercession I pray for night and day, that she may help me a sinner,
as having that power from him whom she brought into the world, Christ our
God. And I receive and venerate the Images of Saints, Apostles, Prophets,
Martyrs, Fathers, Eremites, not as Gods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And with all my mind I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
them to intercede with God for me, that I may find mercy in the day of
judgment. On the same account I venerate the Reliques of Saints,

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So he proceedeth also to his Curses, and</hi> 
                  <q>first he anathematizeth all that
venerate not Images: Then he curseth those that reproach them: And next,
that speak evil of them: And next he curseth those that do not from their

hearts teach Christian People the veneration of holy and honourable Images of
all Saints, which from the beginning pleased God.</q>

                  <hi>Tharasius</hi> joyfully received all this, and <hi>Constantine</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constance</hi> in

                  <hi>§ 60. But now cometh a Crowd more to do their Pennance;</hi> Hypatius
<hi>Bishop of</hi> Nice, Leo Rhodi, Gregory <hi>of</hi> Pisidia, Gregory <hi>of</hi> Pessinunt, Leo <hi>of</hi>

sure of them, he groweth more upon them, and will know of them,</hi> Whence
it was that in the last Council they did what they did against Images? whether
it was through meer Ignorance,<note place="margin">☞</note> or by any reason that drew them to it: If through
Ignorance, he bids them give a Reason how they came to be so ignorant: If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Reason, to tell what that Reason was, that it might be refuted.</p>
               <p>Leo, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rhode, answered, <q>[We have sinned before God, and before
the Church, and before this holy Synod; Ignorance made us fall from the
Truth, and we have nothing to say in our own defence.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tharasius</hi> would know what Reason now moveth and changeth them; some
say, because it is the Doctrine or Faith of the Apostles and Fathers. Another
alledgeth a saying as of the <hi>Antioch</hi> Council, and another as of <hi>Isidore Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
which the learned Reader examining, may see what proof it was that
Images were brought into Churches by; it's worth the noting. But another
alledgeth the Apostles and Prophets Tradition: But what's the proof? And
did not the Council at <hi>Constant,</hi> nor the Bishops in the Reign of the three
former Emperors know what Tradition was? Was it unknown till now?
How came it now known then?<note place="margin">☞</note> Or who told it this Council, when the last
knew it not? Or if the last were false Knaves, how shall we be sure that

               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60852:117"/>
Tharasius <hi>asketh one of the Bishops</hi> (Leo) <hi>How it came to pass that he
that had been ten or eight years a Bishop, never knew the Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for Images till just now? He answered,</hi> Because through many Ages,
(or Times) Malice endured, and so wicked Doctrine endured; and when this
persevered for our sins, it compelled us to go out of the way of Truth; but there
is hope with God of our salvation. <hi>But</hi> Constantine Cypr. <hi>answereth him,</hi> You
that are Bishops, and Teachers of others, should not have had need to be taught
your selves. Leo <hi>replied,</hi> If there were no expression of sin in the Law, there
would be no need of Grace. <hi>Another</hi> (Hypatius) <hi>replied with the rest,</hi> We
received ill Doctrine from ill Masters. <hi>Yea, but saith</hi> Tarasius, The Church
ought not to receive Priests from ill Teachers. Hypatius, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Nice, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,</hi>
[Custom hath so obtained.]</p>
               <p>§ 61. Hereupon the Synod desired to be informed on what terms Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
were to be received, when they returned: so the Canons were brought
and read. And though many Canons and Fathers have said, that no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for some Crimes must restore a Man to the Priesthood, though it must
to the Church; and there is an Epistle of <hi>Tarasius</hi> put by <hi>Crabbe</hi> before
this Council, in which he determineth that a Simoniack may be received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Repentance to Communion, but not to his Office; yet <hi>Tarasius</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desirous of their return, (knowing that these Penitents that renounced
the errors of their Education, and former practice, would draw others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with them) did resolutely answer all that was objected against their
reception.</p>
               <p>§ 62. <hi>Here (in</hi> Crab. p. 472.) <hi>a question fell in (upon their reading the
Proofs, that repenting Hereticks were by the Church to be restored to their
Bishopricks and Priesthood,)</hi> What Hereticks those were? <hi>And it was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they were</hi> Novatians, Encratists, <hi>and</hi> Arrians, <hi>and</hi> Manichees, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionists,
<hi>and</hi> Eutychians. <hi>And then one asketh,</hi> Whether this Heresie (against
Images) was greater or less than all those?<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>And</hi> Tharasius <hi>answereth, (like
a Stoick)</hi> 
                  <q>[Evil is always the same and equal, especially in matters Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,
in the Decrees of which both great and small, to err is the same
thing; for in both God's Law is violated.]</q>

Vicar of the Oriental Patriarch,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Note, Reader, how the Patriarchal Thrones did govern the Church and
this Council, and by what reasons <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Saints intercessions</hi> were set up.
<hi>Arrianism, Manicheism, Marcionism,</hi> no Heresie that denied the essentials of
Christianity, no evil was so bad with them as to deny Church-Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And so the late General Council, and Bishops, for three Emperors Reigns,
had been under the worst of Heresies and Evils, worse than <hi>Arrianism</hi>
itself.</p>

§ 63. But here <hi>Constantine</hi> the Notary of the <hi>Const.</hi> Patriarchate, happily
brought in so pertinent a Testimony, as much made for the pardon of the
penitent Bishops: He read out of the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> how the <hi>Oriental</hi>
and other Bishops that had lately set up <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus</hi> in the 2d
<hi>Ephesian</hi> Council,<note place="margin">☞</note> cryed at <hi>Calcedon, [We have all sinned, we all ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.]</hi>
And how <hi>Thalassius, Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Eustathius</hi> cryed, <hi>[We have all
erred, we all ask forgiveness.]</hi> And after them <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and after him the
<hi>Illyrican</hi> Bishops cryed, <hi>[We have all lapsed, we all ask pardon.]</hi> And so
the President was undeniable and effectual. These were not the first Bishops
that went one way in one Council under one Prince, and cryed <hi>peccavimus</hi>
for it, as Heresie, in the next.</p>
               <p>§ 64. But <hi>Sabas</hi> the Monk starts yet a greater doubt than this, and that
is, whether they had <hi>true Ordination,</hi> and so were <hi>true Bishops.</hi> For seeing
they were bred in the times of Heresie, which had prevailed under so many
Emperors, and had Heretical Teachers, it's like they had Heretick Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
seeing the late Council shewed what the Bishops then were. And the
Fact was confest, that they were Ordained by Bishops that were Hereticks,
(that is, against Church-Images, and praying to Saints for their intercession,
and using Reliques.<note place="margin">☞</note>) The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Vicars pleaded hard against
their Ordination; but <hi>Tarasius</hi> knew what a breach it would make in the
Church if a General Council, and all the Bishops that were at it, and all the
rest that consented to it, and were bred up in that Opinion, should be degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the new Conformity receive so great a stop; and what confusion it
would make among the People, (as they had seen in many former instances)
and therefore he is against their deposition. And first there are two passages
read in their favour out of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and somewhat of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius.</hi>
And then when <hi>Peter Vic. Rom.</hi> alledged the instance of <hi>Meletius</hi>
against it, <hi>Tarasius</hi> brought a notable expeditious Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
agree among themselves,<note place="margin">☞</note> and do not contradict one another: <hi>ergo</hi> the
rest consent to these that have been cited. Methinks I could make great use
of this Argumentation to save time, labour and difficulty in disputing. <hi>E. G.
Nazianzen</hi> wisht there were no difference of Bishops Seats (one above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other)
and said that he never saw Councils that did not more harm than
good. The Fathers differed not among themselves; <hi>ergo</hi> the rest of the
Fathers were of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s mind.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, they offered their Confessions, and were absolved.</p>
               <p>§ 65. In the 2d Action, the Rulers send in the Bishop of <hi>Neo-Caesarea</hi> to
do his Pennance; and he also cryeth for mercy, and confesseth that his errors
and sins were infinite, but now he believed as the Synod doth. <hi>Tharasius</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him whether he be not ashamed to have been ignorant so long, and
questioneth the sincerity of his Repentance, which he earnestly professeth,
condemning his Sin, and promising Conformity.</p>
               <p>Next a long Epistle of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s to the Emperor and Empress, and another
to <hi>Tharasius</hi> for Images are read: For Popes use not to travel to General

they be found no wiser than other Men, and their Infallibility be proved less
at hand, than at a distance, where they hear not the Debates. Here <hi>Adrian</hi>
to the Empress relateth the foresaid Vision of <hi>Constantine Mag.</hi> to be healed of
his Leprosie, a Fable fit to introduce Image-worship; and for an Infallible
Pope to use, fully confuted (as aforesaid) by <hi>Henry Fowlis</hi> (after many
others) of Popish Treasons.</p>
               <p>§ 66. <hi>Tharasius</hi> professeth his consent to <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Letters, yet professeth,
<hi>[That he giveth the Worship called</hi> Latria <hi>to God alone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Crab. p. 485.</note>

in him alone.]</hi> Contrary to <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his Followers, and other such <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Doctors. And the whole Council ecchoed their consent, and voted for
Images; so much can one Woman do in Power.</p>
               <p>§ 67. In the 3d Action, <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Neo-Caesarea</hi> is to receive his
Absolution fully, and <hi>Tharasius</hi> puts in an Objection, that it's said that some
Bishops in the late Persecution did scourge dissenting Bishops, and such were
not to be received: But <hi>Gregory</hi> protested that he scourged none. But he
is accused by others, to have been a Leader of the last Council against Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and so he is deferred. And the Epistle of <hi>Tharasius</hi> to the Eastern Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
is read, (and their Answers;) in which it is to be noted, that yet
Image-worship was not owned: For he professeth in his Creed to them, that
<hi>[We admit Pictures for no other use, but that they may the more perfectly be
exhibited to the sight and eyes; as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins
of the World,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>And the 4th Action containing all their Proofs from Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
plead but for the memorative and instructing use of Images, by which
they are to the eye, what words are to the ear: But they should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the danger of abuse, and foreseen how much further they were like
to be carried, as with the <hi>Papists</hi> they are.</p>
               <p>And in the fifth Action they proceed in reading more, to the same purpose,
for commemorative Images;<note place="margin">☜</note> till one read the <hi>Itinerary of the Apostles,</hi> which
they voted to be a <hi>cursed Book,</hi> and said it was that Book that the Synod
against Images made use of: whereupon <hi>Greg. Neo-Caes. &amp; Theodos. Amorii,</hi> are
asked whether that Book was read in the false Synod, and <hi>they sware by
God,</hi> that it was not, but only some recited words as out of it. <hi>Pretorius</hi>
a Nobleman said, <hi>[But they did all by the Royal Procuration.]</hi> And they
proceed to refell the Testimonies that were brought against Images. <hi>Cosmas
Cubicularius</hi> brought out an Old Testament with <hi>Scholia</hi> blotted out, where
was yet legible on the second Commandment, <q>
                     <hi>[If we make the Image of
Christ, truly we do not for the similitude adore it, but that the mind might
be raised upward by what is seen.</hi>]</q> The Expunction was said by <hi>Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
to be done by his Predecessors, <hi>Anastasius, Constantine, Victor,</hi> all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
And here they cursed Concealers and Cancellers of Writings. (Wo
then to <hi>Rome!)</hi> Other rased Books were read, and Curses added against the
Adversaries of Images, and those that communicate with them.</p>
               <p>§ 68. In the 6th Action, the words of the 7th Council against Images are
brought forth in a Book with a Confutation of them, which the Reader that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60852:119"/>
hath leisure may compare. <hi>Greg. Neo-Caesar.</hi> read the Councils words. <hi>Ioan.
Cancellarius</hi> read the Confutation. It fell out well that this Confutation was
undertaken, or else we had lost the Decrees of this Council; as the Acts, for
ought I know, are buried.</p>
               <p>In general every sober Reader may perceive a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the style of the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Answer. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
speaks with as much temper and gravity, as most of the best Councils
have done. The Answer aboundeth with such railings and reviling words,
as are meeter for a common Scold, than for Divines. The common language
of it, is to call the Bishops of the Council, Blinded, Ignorant, Fools, Wicked,
Deceivers, Blasphemers, and such like. And if all the Bishops on earth be
present, or represented in a General Council, what a Case then was the
Church in? And how shall we know what Council is to be believed, unless
the Pope make all the difference?</p>
               <p>§ 69. The number of the Bishops were<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>At</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</note> 338. They first shew how Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
hath brought in Idolatry. One of their chief Arguments against Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Christ, is, that they savor of <hi>Nestorianism,</hi> representing Christ by his
meer Manhood, when they cannot paint his Godhead; calling that Picture
Christ, and overthrowing the Oeconomy and Union of his Person. I meddle
not with the weight of their reason, but only recite it.</p>
               <p>§ 70<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It's again worth the noting, that the Answer to them saith, (For
their charging Images, as drawing down the mind to Creature-worship;
<hi>Latria) [O insanien'em linguam, quam instar machaerae acutae &amp; veneno
imbutae possident,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O mad tongue, which they possess like a sharp sword,
imbued with poyson,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> &amp;c. <hi>For no Christian ever gave</hi> Latriam <hi>to the Image of
those that are under Heaven; for this is the Fable of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and Devils
invention, and the aggression of Satanical Action.]—[Our</hi> Latria <hi>is in Spirit
and Truth.]</hi> Other passages forbid us to think that they juggle here, and
denying <hi>Latriam</hi> only to Creatures under Heaven, intend to give it to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Heaven; for they appropriate it elsewhere to God: by which they
greatly differ from <hi>Aquinas</hi> and such <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 71. Note also that (whether <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill)</hi> both these adverse Councils
curse Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> as an Heretick; see <hi>Crab. p.</hi> 560, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ 72. Another Argument which the first 7th Council (at <hi>Const.)</hi> useth
against Images in Churches, is, that Christ himself hath chosen and instituted
such an Image as he would be represented by, and that is the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>
in the Sacrament, and therefore we must not presume to make another, as if
he had not done it well. This sheweth that this General Council and the
Church then held that the <hi>Bread</hi> was not nullified, nor become Christ's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but was the Image or Representation of his broken Body, and so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Body of Christ,</hi> as we say of <hi>E. G. Caesar</hi>'s Image, <hi>This is
Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the adverse Council, or the Answer, raileth at this as an abominable
Speech,</hi> (Crab. p. 567.) <hi>as if the Sacrament might not be called,</hi> The Image
of Christ, <hi>(though</hi> de re <hi>they seem not at all to differ) saith the</hi> Constantine
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60852:119"/>

                  <q>That this use of Images began neither by the Tradition of Christ,<note place="margin">☜</note> nor of the
Apostles, nor of the Fathers:</q> 
                  <hi>And that the Answer saith, that</hi> 
                  <q>[The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Images was delivered with many other things without Scripture,
from the Apostles time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here note 1. How those <hi>Papists</hi> (in particular which I have elsewhere
answered) are confuted, who say that <hi>[Tradition is universal, sure, known,
constant, and no Churches pleaded Traditions against each other, at least in neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
things or Faith; but if we have not the right now, it must be because the
Councils went all to Bed in one mind, and rose in another.]</hi> You see here
that the 2d <hi>Nieene</hi> Council took the Doctrine of the former to be Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized
Heresie; and that 338 Bishops in one of the Councils, (and the
most under many Emperors) and 350 Bishops in the other Council, pleaded
Tradition against each other. But sure any Man that hath read the Fathers
of the first 300 or 400 years, will easily see which of them was in the right,
excepting the sign of the Cross.</p>
               <p>2. Note also that it is here confessed, that there is no Scriptural Tradition
of this use of Images.</p>
               <p>§ 74. In the Definitions of the <hi>Constantine</hi> Council it is to be noted,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That they are not so much against the intercession of the Virgin</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>or Saints, as the</hi> Protestants <hi>mostly are, nor as the</hi> Papists <hi>make them: For</hi>
(Crab. p. 589.) <hi>they say</hi> Defin. 15. [If any confess not holy <hi>Mary</hi> ever a

not seek their intercessions, as having liberty with God to intercede for the world

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>§ 75. That you may see that this Council were of one mind, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
they all say,</hi> Omnes se credimus; Omnes idem sapimus; Omnes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probando

Germanus, George, <hi>and</hi> Manzurus, <hi>(supposed to be</hi> Damascene) <hi>are found
among the Anathematized Dissenters,</hi> Crab. p. 592.</p>
               <p>§ 76. <hi>The 7th Action of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Synod, containeth their Definition,
in which they deny indeed</hi> Latria <hi>to Images, but yet say (more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)</hi>
                  <q>[That they that see the Pictures, may come to the memory and desire
of the Prototypes; as by the sight of the Cross, and by the holy Gospels, and
holy Oblations.—For the honour of the Image resulteth to the Prototype, and he

                  <hi>So that they

               <p>They all profess full consent, and curse all that bring Scripture against

Images, and all that <hi>salute them not in the Name of the Lord and his Saints,</hi>
and that <hi>care not for unwritten Tradition of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next they write an Epistle to the Empress, (and her Child) applauding
them, and adding, that</hi> 
                  <q>[Denying <hi>Latria</hi> to them, they judge them to be

minded, as to stick at and doubt of the Adoration of Images, and this as

is nothing else but separating them from Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Judge now what the use of such Councils was, <hi>[To curse Men, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them from Christ,]</hi> and that if they do but <hi>doubt of adoring Images.</hi>
Reader, if thou believe that in these Heretications, Separations and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of such, they were of Christ's mind, and did his work, and served not
his Enemy against him and his Church, I am not of thy mind, nor am ever
like to be.</p>

in the Synod, (whom the rest follow) copiously write a Confutation of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandus</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1. That they call Christ as to his Humanity, <hi>God's Adopted Son,</hi> (and his

               </list>
               <p>Alas for the Church, that must thus by Bishops be distracted for want of
skill in words! Is there no remedy? <hi>Binnius</hi> confesseth that some <hi>Papists</hi>
think that they meant right, as <hi>Durandus</hi> did, and that the difference was but
in words.</p>
               <p>The Council supposeth <hi>Elipandus</hi> and <hi>Faelix</hi> to use the word <hi>[Adoption]</hi>
exclusively, as to Christ's Filiation by <hi>Generation,</hi> as conceived by the Holy
Ghost: whereas it is far likelier that they took both Conjunct to be the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum
filiationis.</hi> God adopting, that is, of his good Will freely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Christ's Humane Nature, and uniting it to the Divine; called <hi>Adoption,</hi>
because it was God's free act of Love, and not a communication of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as the eternal Generation is. The Humanity is not God's Essence.
And I hope the name of <hi>[The Son of Man]</hi> used so oft by Christ of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is no Heresie. And there appeareth no reason to censure them as deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either the eternal or temporal Generation of Christ.</p>
               <p>But they argue against them,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That he is said to be <hi>Adopted,</hi> that is, not Generated.</item>

not Christ.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. These Objections seem to confess that the difference was but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomine;</hi>
and is the unapt use of such a word, an Heresie? How many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
then have most Councils, and Fathers, and all Authors?</p>
               <p>2. Must we needs understand God's Adoption, just in the measure as mans?</p>
               <p>3. We are Regenerate, and yet Adopted. Why then is it a Heresie, to
say, that Christ was <hi>Generated,</hi> and yet <hi>Adopted?</hi>

4. <hi>Grace</hi> is either that which is <hi>against the merit of evil,</hi> or only <hi>without
the merit of good.</hi> It's doubtless that the first was not by them imputed to
Christ: And it's undoubted to me, that it is consequentially Blasphemy, to
say that Christ's Humane Nature, or any Angel had not the later. For the very
being, and therewith all the good in the constitution and antecedent benefits
of a Creature must go before his merits. Merit is too low a word for the
Divine Nature as such before the Incarnation. And the Humane Nature did
not merit <hi>to be</hi> before <hi>it was, e. g.</hi> to be conceived by the Holy Ghost,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As free Benefits are called Grace, Christ's Humane Nature had
Grace.</p>
               <p>But they object, that the two Bishops did not distinguish between <hi>Christ's
Adoption,</hi> and ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We have not their Writings to see that.</p>
               <p>2. If they did not, it's like it was, because they thought it needless, being
understood by all. They believed the Creed, <hi>That Christ was conceived by
the Holy Ghost, and born of the</hi> Virgin Mary; and that the Godhead assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Humanity into personal Union. They knew that none dreamed that
it was so with us.</p>
               <p>The Council saith, <hi>That it's Heresie to use the name Adoption of Christ.</hi> The
two Bishops seemed to think, <hi>That God's free assuming of the Humanity into
personal Unity with the Word eternally generated by the Father, might be called
Adoption.</hi> If the improper use of the word be <hi>Heresie,</hi> I leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to judge which were the Hereticks: But I think neither.</p>
               <p>But another part of the Heresie was,<note place="margin">☞</note> to say <hi>that Christ was a Servant as
Man.</hi> And they think he was no Servant, because a Son. Some will think
confidently that the Council were here Hereticks, but I think they did but
strive about <hi>words.</hi> By <hi>[Servant]</hi> the Council seemeth to mean exclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>[One that is no Son.]</hi> But the other meant inclusively, <hi>[A Son and
Servant.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They take him for a Servant, <hi>that oweth Service and Obedience.</hi> And Christ
as Man owed Obedience to his Father on two accounts;</p>
               <p>1. As a reasonable Creature to his Maker.</p>
               <p>2. As one that had by voluntary Sponsion undertaken it. I might
add,</p>
               <p>3. As the special Law of Mediation was imposed on him, or given him,
as Man, by which it was made his special duty to die for Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He saith
when he cometh into the world, <hi>Here I am to do thy Will, O God; yea, thy
Law is in my heart.</hi> Did he not <hi>take upon him the form of a servant?</hi> Phil. 2. 7.
which was <hi>not a shew of that which is not, but of that which is.</hi> Is he not
called <hi>God's righteous Servant justifying many,</hi> Isa. 53. 11. Doth not God oft

The Council seemed to think that the Bishops thought that Christ was

                  </note> But there is no shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to impute this to them that professed to believe

eternal Generation of the second Person in the

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is not unlike that <hi>Nestorius</hi> himself for want of more skill in
speaking, was used as they were.</p>
               <p>2. Why should that be imputed to them which they deny? They are
told that as <hi>Nestorius craftily denied two Persons, and yet inferred two, so do
they.</hi> But is not this a vindication of <hi>Nestorius</hi> by a Council? (Who
knoweth what a man holdeth, better than himself?)</p>

would follow from as is called Heresie, I doubt not but every Council and
Bishop, and Christian were Hereticks; the saying of some great Divines being
true, <hi>That Truths of Faith and Morality are so connext, that he that holdeth the
least Error therein, doth by consequence subvert the foundation.</hi> You may say
that every man that tells a lye, or committeth any known sin, is an Atheist,
and that if he believed that there is a God, he would know that he must not
sin against him; he that sins before his Face, denieth his Omniscience, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

denieth God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At this rate all are Atheists and Hereticks.</p>
               <p>3. But may not one that saith, <hi>[Christ as the second Person in Trinity was
the Eternal Son of God; and as Man, was by Generation in thus made the Son
of God and Man:]</hi> truly mean that it is but one Person that in one respect
is the Eternal Son, and in another respect the Temporal Son? May he not
hold that the personal Unity maketh it unmeet to say, <hi>There are two Sons,</hi>
because <hi>that would imply two Persons,</hi> which they and <hi>Nestorius</hi> denied? But,
again I say, what if they had said that there might be two <hi>Filiations,</hi> or filial
<hi>Relations in one Person,</hi> resulting from two foundations, Eternal and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

suffered for our sins; his subjection to Poverty, Reproach, the Cross, and
many works, (as Fasting, being carried about by Satan, and tempted, <hi>Mat.

The Holiness and Obedience was good, and no Penalty: But the
matter of that Obedience was the Cross and Suffering, which is <hi>Malum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae.</hi>
And if this was no punishment (voluntarily accepted by his Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
how was Christ our Surety, bearing our Transgressions? how suffered
he for our sins? Is not suffering for sin, even of others, penal? Is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of Christ's penal Service and Suffering, a denial of his Satisfaction and
our Redemption? You see how easie it is to find Heresie and Infidelity itself
in unskilful words; and yet it's like the Speakers meant better than they
spake.</p>

which he bestowed upon Posts, Pillars, Altars, Walls, Floors, Utensils, it would

brought in thus by this Pope <hi>Leo:</hi> A handsom Woman kist his Hand, which

kist, and ordained that ever after the Pope's Foot should be kist instead of his

Bishops ready to do their Will?</p>
               <p>§ 100. <hi>Charles the Great</hi> making his Will, divided his Empire between
his three Sons, giving them Laws of Communion and Succession, (that if

               </p>
               <p>§ 102. CCXXXVII. <hi>An.</hi> 809. A Council was held at <hi>Aquisgrana,</hi> about
the Procession of the Holy Ghost, and the word <hi>[Filioque]</hi> in the Creed<note n="*" place="margin">A new Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</note>.
Of which they sent some Messengers to the Pope, who approved the thing,
but dissuaded them from adding it to be sung in the Creed; and after inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the Creed without <hi>Filioque</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> in two Silver Tables, to
shew that it should not be changed: which yet after it was by the Pope's
consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> French <hi>Annals say, that in this Council they treated of the</hi> state of the
Church, and conversation of the Clergy, but determined nothing for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the matter.</p>
               <p>§ 103. CCXXXVIII. <hi>An.</hi> 113. (Yet under <hi>Charles the Great)</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was held (by his Command) at <hi>Arles,</hi> where many very good Canons
were made for the Reformation of the Bishops and Priests.</p>
               <p>§ 104. CCXXXIX. The same year the same <hi>Charles</hi> had a Council at
<hi>Tours,</hi> which made 51 as honest Articles, as if <hi>Martin</hi> himself had been
amongst them;<note place="margin">☜</note> even against all kind of sin, and for all godly living. Among
others, the 37th Canon tells us, that the custom of not kneeling in Prayer
on any Lords-day, (no not at the Sacrament) nor on any Week-day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> was yet in force; on other days they required
humble kneeling.</p>
               <p>§ 105. CCXL. Yet another Council did <hi>Charles</hi> call the same year at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
(Cabillonense)</hi> in which he ordered Schools for the restoring of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(our <hi>Alcuin</hi> being his Persuader greatly esteemed by him) Learning
then being almost worn away, (and Ignorance taking place) till he greatly
revived it: no less than 67 Canons were here made, most very good ones;
but praying for the Souls of the Faithful departed, and anointing the Sick, are
there enjoined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§ 106. Among many good Canons, the 13th is against the</hi> Oath of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Bishop,<note place="margin">☜</note> and to the Church. <hi>The words Translated are these:</hi>
                  <q>[It is reported of some Brethren <hi>(Bishops)</hi> that they force them, that they
are about to ordain, to swear, that they are worthy, and will not do contrary
to the Canons, and will be obedient to the Bishop that ordaineth them, and to
the Church in which they are ordained; which Oath, because it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
we all ordain shall be forbidden.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§ 107. The 15th Canon saith,</hi> 
                  <q>[It is said that in some places the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons
exercise a certain domination over the Parish-Presbyters, and take Fees
of them; which is a matter of Tyranny, rather than of order of Rectitude:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60852:125"/>
For if the Bishops must not Lord it in the Clergy, but be Examples to the
Flocks, much less may these do it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 108. The 25th Canon complaining how the old Excommunicating and
Reconciling was grown out of use<note n="*" place="margin">Council-Curses for Opinions take place</note>, they desired the Emperor's help how
they should be restored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§</hi> 109. Can. 33. <hi>They say,</hi> 
                  <q>That Confession to God and Man are both
good; but that Confession made to God, purgeth sin; and that which is made
to the Priest, teacheth how their sins may be purged.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 110. The 45th Canon is against them, that by going to holy places,
<hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Tours,</hi> think to have their sins forgiven.</p>
               <p>§ 111. CCXLI. Yet another Council the same year 813, was held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Charles M.</hi> at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> to the like purpose, many godly Canons
being made.</p>
               <p>§ 112. CCXLII. Yet another under <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> for Instructing and
Catechising, and many good things, like the former.</p>
               <p>§ 113. CCXLIII. But we have not done with Images yet, <hi>An.</hi> 814. There
was a Council called at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which damned the Council of <hi>Nice 2.
Irene</hi> having set up Images, and murdered the Emperor her own Son, (as is
aforesaid) was deposed by <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> who Reigned near ten years, with
<hi>Stauratius</hi> his Son; he was no Friend to the Clergies power, and was killed in
Fight by the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> and his wounded Son Reigned a few months. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Curopalates</hi> succeeded, a Man of great Piety and Peace, but unfit for
War, who being overcome by the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> he consented to give up the
Empire to <hi>Leo Armenus,</hi> a better and prosperous Soldier. This <hi>Leo</hi> the 5th,
was of the mind of the former <hi>Leo's</hi> against Images, and his mind being
known, the Bishops conformed presently, insomuch that in his 2d year this
Council called by him, Anathematized the Bishops that would not renounce
the <hi>Nicene</hi> 2d Council; and when they lay prostrate on the earth, it's said
some trod on some of them, and they turned them at a Back-door out of the
Council: For the Patriarch <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> that was for Images, was deposed, and
<hi>Theodorus Melissenus</hi> that was against them put in his place, and led the rest.
Thus did Council against Council thunder Anathema's, and curse each other
by separating them from Christ, till few were left uncursed. The Rulers of
the Monasteries also were called in, and those that would not consent
against Images, were rejected. <hi>Nicetas &amp; Theodorus Studita</hi> were the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
for Images, and were both banished and imprisoned. <hi>Theodore</hi> wrote
to the Council for Images, and tells them that <q>
                     <hi>[To take away the venerable
Adoration of the Images of Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bin p. 470 Epist. Theod.</note> 
                     <hi>and of the Mother of God, and of all
the Saints, was to overthrow the Oeconomy of Christ.]</hi>
                  </q> And he continued
in Prison to preach and write for Images.</p>
               <p>Those Councils that pleased not the <hi>Papists,</hi> we have not the Acts of, as
we have of such as <hi>Nic.</hi> 2. that pleased them. Had we all the Speeches and
Arguments used in this and other Councils against Images, as largely as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60852:125"/>
those that were for them, we might better see which had the better manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>§ 114. CCXLIV. The Clergy had for many hundred years abrogated
God's Law, <hi>[He that sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed;]</hi>
and had put Pennance for the punishment instead of Death: But now at
last the murdering of one <hi>Iohn</hi> a Bishop <hi>(inhonestè &amp; inauditè mordridatus,</hi>
as they then spake) they were put to find some harder Penalty to save the
Clergies Lives: And so they set great Fines of Money on the Murderers;
and more than so, <hi>He that wilfully murdered a Bishop must eat no flesh, nor drink
any Wine as long as he lived.</hi> If Murder now had no greater a punishment,
Bishops would scarce be safe any more than others. This was at a Council
at a Village called <hi>Theorius,</hi> or <hi>Dietenhoven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 115. Next succeedeth Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> at <hi>Rome; Platina</hi> saith <hi>Stephen</hi> the
4th, <hi>Anastasius</hi> and <hi>Binnius</hi> say <hi>Stephen</hi> the 5th. <hi>Platina</hi> and others say that
he Reigned but seven months; <hi>Anastasius</hi> and others say seven years, and
seven months. <hi>Platina</hi> saith he was the Son of <hi>Iulius</hi> a <hi>Roman; Anastasius</hi>
saith he was the Son of <hi>Marinus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">It's like <hi>Iulius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> saith, was his name.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> dying, the Empire came to his Son <hi>Ludovicus</hi> called <hi>Pius,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

<hi>Bernard</hi> to rebel against him; but he was conquered, and put to death: as
also were the <hi>Saxon</hi> Rebels. <hi>Paschal</hi> first succeeding, <hi>Stephen</hi> is made Pope
without the Emperor's knowledge; for which he excused himself, as forced
by the People that chose him: The Emperor pardon'd it, but demanded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
as to their Elections for the time to come. <hi>Platina in vit. Paschal. l.</hi> 1.

new Rebellions.</p>
               <p>Some say that <hi>Bernard</hi> was but blinded: Among others banished for
Treason, were <hi>Anselm</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Theodulfe</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aurelia,

               <p>§ 116. CCXLV. <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> was so careful to reform the Bishops
and Clergy, that he raised their ill will against him, being too pious for them
that should have been the Teachers of Piety; yea, so slothful did they grow,
that though his Father and he had done extraordinary works for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Learning and Godliness, yet Learning in his days grew to such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
that Learned Men became the common contempt, and few of them
were to be found; but <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> were the study, care, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Bishops.</p>
               <p>Yet in his time at <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> there was a Council that wrote, instead of
Canons, the most excellent Treatise for the Teaching and Government of the
Teachers and Governors of the Church, (besides the regulation of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
that ever any Council did before them: Not in their own words, but
in the several Sermons, and passages of the chief Fathers, <hi>(Isidore, Hierom,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60852:126"/>
Gregory, Augustine</hi> and <hi>Prosper,)</hi> that had written to the Clergy heretofore,
which they collected into 145 Chapters and Canons.</p>
               <p>But you must know that the excellency of the Canons of Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in these Ages, did not shew the excellency of the
Bishops, so much as their Pravity and Necessity, as the Medicine doth the
Disease. For such Canons were ordinarily drawn up by the will of the King,
by some one or few choice Men, (such as <hi>Paulinus Aquileiensis</hi> in his time,)

               <p>
                  <hi>They cite</hi> Isidore'<hi>s words, that</hi> [Caeteri Apostoli cum <hi>Petro</hi> par consortium

               <p>§ 118. Yet I wonder that the Chap. 122 of this Council intimateth so
strange a proportion of Meat and Drink to be the daily Commons of the
Canonical Monks,<note place="margin">☜</note> I had thought they had lived in greater Abstinence. The
proportion of Alms or Commons allowed them was, <hi>[Every day four pound
of Bread,]</hi> (enough for me for near 4 weeks;) <hi>and five pounds of Wine,</hi>
(more than I drunk, I think, in 20 years, in Wine;) <hi>or else where Wine was
scarce, they had three pounds of Wine, and three of Beer; or in great scarcity,
one pound of Wine, and five of Beer.</hi> I think our ordinary Ministers drink
not so much Wine in a year, as these did in a day; I mean such as live in
the Countrey, and were of my Acquaintance. I wonder how any Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's

14 ounces of <hi>Panada,</hi> and as much Beer only in a day, without tasting any
other Meat,) and found no incommodity as to Health or Pleasure; but
should I eat four pound of Bread in two days, I do not think I should ever
eat more without a Vomit. And how can any Man drink five pound of any
ordinary Wine, and not be drunk, or dead? yea, or three Pints either. What
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60852:127"/>
Man's Belly will hold six pounds of Wine and Water every day, unless it
pass as <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters, without present Suffocation, or a Dropsie. I would
hope that I understand not this Chapter in the Council, but that these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
had some Beggars that were to partake with them, but that I find no
encouragement for my charity in the Text or History: But verily if it were
as it is written, I wonder how these abstemious Monks did escape death by
their Gluttony and Drunkenness one week or day without Physick; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the Council giveth you notice, <hi>cap. 122. lin. ult.</hi> that a pound
hath but 12 ounces.</p>
               <p>§ 119. We must not unthankfully omit what kindness <hi>Anastasius</hi> (saith
Pope <hi>Paschal)</hi> shewed to the <hi>English:</hi> By negligence their House at <hi>Rome</hi>
was burnt, and the Pope ran out bare-foot, and where he stood, the Fire

                  </note>; therefore he stood bare-foot there till morning, that the Fire might
be fully quenched. But this he did for the love of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whose Church
was in danger by the Fire.</p>
               <p>§ 120. The <hi>Papists</hi> here bring forth a Constitution out of their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
by which <hi>Ludovicus</hi> confirmeth to the Popes all that ever his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
gave them, and addeth so much, that he was then made (if this be
true) (as the <hi>Geographia Nubiensis</hi> calls him) <hi>the King of</hi> Rome <hi>indeed.</hi>
And they meerly feign that <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> made none of these
Laws of themselves, but by the Pope's advice, against plain evidence of
History.</p>
               <p>§ 121. A Convention of Abbots at <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> and another of Bishops,
and a Synod at <hi>Engelheim</hi> follow, and one at <hi>Attiniac,</hi> in which they say the
Emperor penitently lamented his severity against his Nephew <hi>Bernard,</hi> and
others, with open Confession and Penitence. And indeed his great endeavors
to promote Piety, and to reform the Clergy; his frequent Councils, (in which
it was he, by the advice of a few chief chosen Men, that did their business, and
governed all) with the rest of his Life described by the Writer of it, and
other Historians, do shew that he was justly called <hi>Pius,</hi> though Wars will
cause many actions to be repented of.</p>
               <p>§ 122. Platina <hi>saith, that</hi> Anastasius <hi>saith, that</hi> Ludovicus <hi>gave</hi> Paschal
the power of freely chusing Bishops, which before was not done without the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.
<hi>(The Peoples consent still supposed.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 123. The Pope being dead, two are chosen (which was the 11th
Schism) but <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 2d carried it, the Emperor sending his Son <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

of the chief Men had been committed in the Schism, and Mens Goods
taken away, and much confusion made.</p>
               <p>§ 124. In the East<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Party, that were against Images, prevailed ever
since <hi>Irene</hi> the Woman that set them up was deposed and dyed; her Son
<hi>Constantine,</hi> whom she murdered, being not for them before, nor <hi>Nicephorus</hi>
that deposed her after; But <hi>Leo 5 Armenus</hi> that succeeded <hi>Michael Curop.</hi>

earnest against them, and, as they called it, persecuted the Worshippers of
Images. A Prince confessed to be very profitable to the Empire; <hi>Michael
Balbus</hi> that is supposed the chief of them that murdered him, reigneth in his
stead: he set himself earnestly to have healed the Church-divisions of the East
about Images. To that end he sent Ambassadors to <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> into
<hi>France</hi> for his counsel, in the professing his great desire of Peace. <hi>Ludovicus</hi>
called together some that he most esteemed for Learning at <hi>Paris,</hi> (which
some call a Council, but were like to be more learned than the Majority in
Councils) to debate and consider the business. The <hi>Paris</hi> Divines in this
Debate drew up a Writing, in which they greatly sinned, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in
that they took on them to reprehend the Pope, and a General Council; (But
do not they themselves condemn many General Councils?) <hi>In which,</hi> saith
Bellarmine, <hi>they far exceeded the Author, who in the name of</hi> Carolus Mag. <hi>put
forth a Book against the worshiping of Images.</hi>

                  <hi>For he (which also the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the</hi> Frankford <hi>Council did) disallowed</hi> (or rejected) <hi>the 2d</hi> Nicene
<hi>Synod, because they thought it had been celebrated without the Pope's consent</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely thing.</note>:
<hi>But these Counsellors of the Emperor</hi> Lewis, <hi>confess the Council of</hi> Nice 2d <hi>for
the worshiping of Images to be called and approved by Pope</hi> Adrian, <hi>and yet
they did not fear to examine, judge, and reprehend both the Synod itself, and the
Epistle of</hi> Adrian <hi>to</hi> Constantine <hi>for the worship of Images, yea, and the defence
of that Synod sent by</hi> Adrian <hi>to</hi> Charles M. saying, <hi>[Indiscretè noscitur fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisse
in eo quod superstitiosè eas adorari jussit.] So</hi> (saith Bellarmine) <hi>they
were not ashamed to judge the Iudge of themselves, and of the whole
world, to feed the Pastor of all Christ's Sheep, and to teach the Teacher of all
men; than which temerity, no greater can be imagined.</hi> Thus far <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 125. Here I desire the Reader to take notice,</p>
               <p>1. That even then when the Pope was advanced to his Kingly greatness,
yet as the Eastern Empire was far from obeying him, so even that one Prince
that set him up, and defended him, with his Doctors and Counsellors, were
far from thinking <hi>him Infallible,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> but reproved him, and judged him as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
for Image-worship, and were not herein ruled by him.</p>
               <p>2. And judge whether most Bishops would not have judged accordingly,
if they had had but the same countenance from Princes, as the Bishops in the
East and these now had?</p>
               <p>3. And judge with what Face the Militant Doctors of <hi>Rome</hi> do pretend,
that all the world was then subject to the judgment of the Pope, and bid us
name any Churches that rejected it, when East and West so far rejected it as
is here confessed, even when they were grown so high, yea and Councils as
well as Popes?</p>
               <p>§ 126. Hereupon a Book was printed <hi>An.</hi> 1596. called, <hi>The Council of</hi>

1. <hi>The Emperor</hi> Michael'<hi>s Epistle,</hi> (by which, <hi>saith Bellarmine,</hi> one would
judge him one of the best Princes that ever was.)</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Paris <hi>Doctors Collection of Testimonies, proving, (in the middle
way)</hi> that Images should not be broken contemptuously, as some would have
them; nor be worshipped as the General <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and the Pope would
have them.</p>
               <p>3. An Epistle in the Pope's name, written, (saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi>
Doctors) to <hi>Michael</hi> the Emperor, shewing, <hi>that Images are neither to be
wronged disgracefully, nor adored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. An Epistle of the Emperor <hi>Ludovicus</hi> to the Pope, desiring him to

               <p>5. An Epistle of <hi>Ludovicus</hi> to the two Bishops whom he sent to <hi>Rome, [t
direct them how to carry themselves wisely, to get the Pope's consent.]</hi> Whether
this at <hi>Paris</hi> was a Council, or only a select Convention of Men chosen by the
Emperor, is a Controversie of no great moment. I take the latter to be the
more honourable sort of Assembly, as the world then went; and should reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
more the judgment of 20 or 12 Men, selected by such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Prince, than of the majority of the Bishops of all <hi>Europe:</hi> As I prefer
the judgment of those Men that by King <hi>Iames</hi> were appointed to Translate

               <p>§ 127. Our modern cheated <hi>English Papists,</hi> that are taught here in

               <p>§ 128. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is very loth that the Epistle here said to be written by
Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 2d, should be taken to be his, and supposeth that it was but
sent to him to be subscribed: By whom? If by the Emperor <hi>Ludovicus
Pius,</hi> and his Council of Divines, you may see of what reputation the Pope
was then in the Church. One great Argument against it is, <hi>That the Pope

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And 1. Did not even <hi>Gregory Mag.</hi> as much flatter a worse Man and
Murderer, <hi>Phocas?</hi> and his Successors him and many more?</p>
               <p>2. Did not many, if not most of the Emperors, Heathen and Christian,
come in by Murder, or Invasion, and Usurpation? And were Men therefore
disobliged from obeying them, when they were setled, by submissive implicite
consent?</p>
               <p>3. But the venom of the Cardinal Jesuite's answer is, that he taketh it to
be base Flattery,<note place="margin">☜</note> to say that Princes are by God's dispose the Governors of the
Church: For then what are the Bishops for? And must the world be ridden
and abused by such Men, that would turn Princes out of all Government of
the Church, and understand not that the Government of the same Church,
may belong to the Magistrate and the Pastors respectively, (as the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an Hospital to the King, and to the Physician?) May not one rule
and punish by the Sword, and another by the Word, by Teaching, and the
Church Keys? Is it not one thing to Fine, and Beat, and Banish, and Kill a
Man, and another to sentence him unmeet for Church-Communion? Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous,
that God permitteth the world to be deluded by such a blinded or
blinding Clergy, though as learned as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that would make these
things seem inconsistent, and separate what God hath conjoined!</p>
               <p>See here to what the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy would reduce Kings, they must be no
Governors of the Church.<note place="margin">☜</note> And if all the Kingdom be Christians, are they
not all the Church? And so the Christening of the Subjects deposeth the
King, and maketh the chief Priest King that Christeneth them.</p>
               <p>If he had said that Kings govern Churches, but not as Churches, but as
parts of the Kingdom, he had said falsly: For they govern <hi>them as Churches,</hi>
though not by the same sort of Government as the Pastors do; as they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
not Hospitals by the same sort of Government, as the Physicians.</p>
               <p>§ 129. In <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Epistle it is honestly and truly said, that <q>
                     <hi>[If there
had never been a painted or a forged Image, neither Faith, Hope nor Love,
by which Men come to the Eternal Kingdom, would have perished.]</hi>
                  </q> I am
of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s mind now, that this was none of the Pope's Epistle, (but the
honest Emperor's, and his Clergy Councils:) He thought it too bad for a
Pope, and I think it too good for a Pope. He thinks that the Pope must be
mad, if he would have so condemned his Predecessor <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Acts, as this
Epistle doth; and I doubt he was not so honest as to do it. But did not <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>

laid on one another?</p>

                  </q> The last means of Treason was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the base mercenary Bishops; a wicked Attempt that served these wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, and did the Feat. <hi>Ebbo</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> (of a base
original) and enow more such Prelates were not wanting. The Emperor
had before voluntarily lamented his putting out the eyes of his Kinsman <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
a Rebel, (of which he dyed) as too cruel, (when now no Prince
scrupleth Hanging, or Beheading open Rebels.) The Church had satisfaction
by his voluntary Penance, for that which few Men will think a Fault. And
what do these <hi>Bishops now,</hi> but become their <hi>Sovereign's Iudges,</hi> yea, and that
when he <hi>was absent,</hi> and <hi>condemn him unheard,</hi> for this former Fault. Note
the Case.</p>
               <p>1. They condemn their King to be deposed, who were Subjects.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, Clergy-men, that had least to do with State Affairs.</p>
               <p>3. Yea, and that for a Fault, which perhaps was but Justice, and no
Fault.</p>
               <p>4. Or if it were a Fault, was before judged and remitted. And did godly
<hi>Lewis</hi> cherish Christian Bishops so zealously, for this use, so basely and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously
to depose him?</p>

5. Yea, and to join in the horrid Rebellion of unnatural Sons, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their designs.</p>
               <p>6. And to tempt Princes to hate Religion, when <hi>in Nomine Domini,</hi> the
pretence of Religion shall do greater wickedness by Prelates, than the Rebels
Arms was able to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saith the Author of the Life of</hi> Ludovicus Pius, [This judgment some
few gain-sayed, more consented to it: the greatest part, as it useth to be in such
cases<note n="a" place="margin">O wicked use of Bishops!</note>, consented by word, for fear of offending their Leaders<note n="b" place="margin">Whom should they have feared more than God and their King?</note>. They
judged him, absent and unheard, neither confessing nor convict, before the Bodies
of St. <hi>Medard</hi> Confessor, and St. <hi>Sebastian</hi> Martyr, to lay down his Arms<note n="c" place="margin">Is this the use of Reliques?</note>,
and forced him to lay them before the Altar; and cloathing him in a black
garment, under a strict Guard, they thrust him into Prison. By this testimony,
<hi>saith Binnius,</hi> it is certainly proved that the whole business was done by force
and fear, and coloured with the false pigment of Religion. <hi>Thus was the
best of Princes, after all his services for the Prelates, and kindness to his Sons,
deposed, and basely used by both, against Nature and Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His first Restauration, when he had been before deposed, was by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
How he was restored the second time, I find not certainly; some
would give Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the honour of it. It is likeliest that the interest
which his goodness had got in the People, with the odiousness of his Sons and
Bishops Acts, did it: But fully restored, after all this, he was. And being
somewhat backward to forgive <hi>Lotharius,</hi> he filled <hi>France</hi> with new Wars, till
the Emperor for Peace did pardon all. But <hi>Ebbo,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
and <hi>Agobard,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> were deposed, as Leaders of the Treason; and
<hi>Ebbo</hi> banished, and restored by <hi>Lotharius</hi> when his Father dyed; yea, and
sent as a fit Man to convert the <hi>Normans</hi> by Pope <hi>Paschal</hi>'s mission, being
made Bishop of <hi>Hildesheim</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> by <hi>Ludovic</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> see

and humbly heard the said Prince<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lotharius</hi> accusing his Father</note>; And we took care, according to the
Ministry enjoined us, to manifest to him or his Nobles, the generality of all
the People, what is the Vigor, and Power, or Priestly Ministry, and with what
Sentence of Damnation he deserveth to be damned, who will not obey the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Priests<note n="a" place="margin">No doubt but you made this known too far.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And next both to the said Prince, <hi>(Lotharius)</hi> and to all the People, we
studied to denounce, that they should study most devoutly to please God, and
should not delay to appease him in whatever they had offended him: For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things were examined,<note n="b" place="margin">By what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</note>, which by negligence hapned in this Empire,
which manifestly tended to the scandal of the Church, and the ruine of the

                  <p>Among other things we mentioned, and remembred all Men, how by God
that Kingdom, by the administration of the most excellent Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> of
good memory, and the Valor of his Predecessors, was peaceable, and united, and
nobly enlarged, and committed to the Lord Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> by God in great
peace to be governed; and by God's protection remain'd so preserved, as long as
that Prince studied God, and used his Father's example, and was careful to
acquiesce in the counsels of good Men: And how in progress of time, as is
manifest to all, by his improvidence or negligence, it fell into so great ignominy
and baseness, that it became not only the grief of Friends, but the derision of
Enemies.</p>
                  <p>But because the said Prince hath negligently managed the Ministry commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

his Benefits, thought him worthy, that by the leave of the said Prince <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
we should send a Message to him by the Authority of this Sacred As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
to admonish him of his Guilts, that he might take sure advice for his
safety (or salvation.) That he might in his extremity study with all his
might, that being deprived of his earthly Power, according to God's Council,
and the Churches Authority, he might not also lose his Soul. To the counsels
of which Messengers, and their most wholsom warnings he willingly consented,
he took time, and set a day in which he would give an answer to their whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

                  <p>And when the day was at hand, the same Holy Assembly unanimously went
to the venerable Man, and took care to admonish him of all that he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

their wholsom Admonition, and their worthy and congruous Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
promised in all things to acquiesce in their wholsom counsel, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo

to be speedily present, that without delay, with his Nobles he might come, that
there might be a mutual reconciliation between them according to Christian
Doctrine, that if there were any blemishes or discords in their hearts, a pure and
humble begging of Pardon<note n="(i)" place="margin">Of a trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Son and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> might expiate them, and thereupon before all
the multitude, he might receive the judgment of the Priesthood as Penitents do,
which soon after was done.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Lord <hi>Ludovicus</hi> coming into the Church of Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> God's

unworthily used the Ministry committed to him, and in it many wayes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
God, and scandalized the Church of Christ, and many ways troubled
the People by his negligence: And therefore for the Publick and Ecclesiastick
Expiation of so great Guilts, he said he would desire Penance, that God being
merciful by their Ministry and Help, he might prosperously deserve (or obtain)
Absolution of so great Crimes, God having given them the power of Binding
and Loosing; whom also the Bishops, as spiritual Physicians, did wholsomly
admonish, telling him that true remission of Sin followeth pure and simple
Confession; that he should openly confess his Errors, in which he professed that
he most offended God, lest he should hide any thing within, or do any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully
before God, as it is known to all that he did heretofore in the Palace
at <hi>Compeigne,</hi> when he was by another Holy Assembly reproved before all the
Church: And that he come not to God now, as he did then, by dissembling
and craft, with a double heart, and provoke him to anger, rather than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
his sin<note n="l" place="margin">O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Traytors!</note>; for it is written, The dissemblers and crafty provoke the
wrath of God. And after this Admonition he professed that he had chiefly
sinned in all those things, whereupon he had been familiarly reproved by the
foresaid Priests, by word or writings; that being by due rebuke reproved of the
things they gave him a writing<note n="(m)" place="margin">They wrote him his Lesson, &amp; confessed his sins for him.</note> of, containing the sum of his Guilts, of
which they had specially reproved him; which he had in his hands, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> As in the same Paper is fullier contained, incurring the guilt of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Admonition and terrible Contestation made to him with Divine Invocation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Holy-Altar in presence of the Priests, and the greatest multitude of the
People; in that he had done violence to his Brethren and Kindred, and had
permitted his Nephew to be killed<note n="(n)" place="margin">A Traytor in open Rebellion</note>, whom he might have delivered;
and that being unmindful of his Vow, he after commanded the Sign of Holy

of the Sacraments, by unlawful Power he corrupted the Covenant which
was made between his Sons for the peace and unanimity of the Empire, and
tranquility of the Church, by common Council, and consent of all the faithful
People, and confirmed by the Sacrament: and in that he compelled his faithful
People in contrariety to the said first Covenant and Oath, to swear another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<note n="o" place="margin">O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oath.</note>, and so fell into the guilt of Perjury, by the violation of the
former Oaths. And how much this displeased God, is plain, in that the People
subject to him had afterward no peace, but were all led into perturbation, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the punishment of their sins, and by God's just judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>III.</hi> That against Christian Religion, against his Vow, without any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
profit or certain necessity<note n="(p)" place="margin">Against the Arms of his own Sons.</note>, deluded by evil counsel, he commanded a
general Expedition to be made in <hi>Lent,</hi> and in the extreme parts of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire

brought great oppression on the Poor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IV.</hi> That he brought violence on some of his faithful People, that for his

against the Lord's Priests, (or Bishops) and Monks, and condemned them
absent. And in this incurring the guilt of Murder, he was a violater of the
Laws of God and Man.</p>

by his Sons or People, he commanding and compelling them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he brought no small blot of sin on the People committed to him. He hereby
incurred the guilt of Perjury, because these are rightly charged on him as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
by whom they were compelled. But in the purging of Women, in unjust
Iudgments, in false Witnesses and Perjuries, which have been committed in his

to him, not only unprofitably, but also hurtfully without counsel and profit;
in which many and innumerable heinous Crimes were committed in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
People, in Murders and Perjuries, in Sacriledge and Adulteries, in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
in Burnings, either in the Churches of God, or divers other places, in Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings
and oppressing of the Poor, by miserable usage, and almost unheard of
among Christians; which all, as is aforesaid, reflect on the Author.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VII.</hi> In the divisions of the Empire rashly made by him, against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
peace, and the safety of the whole Empire, for his own will; and the
Oath which compelled all the people to swear, that they would act against his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60852:132"/>
Sons as Enemies, when he might have pacified them by Fatherly Authority, and
the counsel of his faithful People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VIII.</hi> That so many Mischiefs and Crimes committed in the Kingdom
committed to him, by his negligence and improvidence were not enough, which
yet cannot be numbred, by which the Kingdom was evidently disgraced and
endangered: but moreover to add to the heap of miseries, he lastly drew all the
People of his power to their common destruction, when he ought to have been
to his People the Captain of safety and of peace, when the Divine Piety had
decreed to have mercy of his People by an unheard of and invisible manner,
and by preaching in our ages.</p>
                  <p>For these things therefore, and in all these things which are before recited,
confessing himself guilty before the Priests, (or Bishops) or all the People, with
tears, and protesting that in all these things he sinned, he desired publick Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that so he might satisfie the Church by repenting, which he had scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
by sinning; and as he was a scandal by neglecting many things, so he
professed he would be an example by undergoing due Pennance.</p>
                  <p>And after this Confession he delivered to the Bishops the Paper of his Guilts
and Confession for future memorial, and they laid it on the Altar; and then
he put off his military Girdle and laid it on the Altar, and stripping himself of
his secular Habit, he took the Habit of a Penitent put on him by the hands of
the Bishops, that after so great and such Pennance<note n="*" place="margin">Here is a new sort of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Bishops hands, to depose a King so as never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored: But it failed.</note>, no Man after may return
to a secular Militia.</p>
                  <p>These things thus done, it pleased them that every Bishop should write in his
own Papers how the matter was done, and should strengthen it by his own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and offer it to Prince <hi>Lotharius,</hi> thus strengthened in memory of the
Fact. To conclude, it seemed good to us all that were present, to put the sum
of all the Papers, and of so great a business into one Breviate, and to roborate
it by the subscription of us all with our hands, as is hereafter demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.—</p>

               <p>Here you see the Tryal of the godly Emperor, the Articles exhibited against
him in the High Court of Episcopal Justice, and the use of Penance, and of
laying on of the Bishops hands, in investing him in the Garb of perpetual
Penance. What wonder if the Pope ascended to such power, when ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bishops in the best governed and instructed Countrey then in the world,
obtained such power; even by the name and abuse of the POWER OF

sufficiently minded the Power and Dignity of the Bishops to be upheld.</p>

and <hi>Charles,</hi> who conquered him, and put him to a shameful flight, <hi>An.</hi> 841.
in which Fight, say Historians, a greater slaughter was made of the <hi>French,</hi>
than was ever known in the memory of man. This was the man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his Father for the slaughter of the Subjects by his Wars against him.
The next year they fought again, and he was again overcome.</p>
               <p>§ 146. CCLII. <hi>It's easie then to conjecture which way the next Council
(which was at</hi> Aquisgrane) <hi>would go: The conquering Princes made the
Bishops their Counsellors, when they had made</hi> Lotharius <hi>flie out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
what they should do with his Kingdom; and, saith</hi> Binnius, <hi>they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the answer which Nithardus li.</hi> 1. describeth in these words, <q>['The
Bishops considering the deeds of <hi>Lotharius</hi> from the beginning, how he had
driven his Father out of his Kingdom; how he had made the Christian People
perjured by his Covetousness; how oft he had frustrated the Oath he made to
his Fathers, and his Brethren; how oft, since his Fathers death, he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to disinherit his Brethren; how many Murders, Adulteries, Burnings,
and all kind of heinous deeds the Universal Church suffered by his most wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Covetousness: And that he neither had any knowledge of governing the
Commonwealth, nor could men find any footsteps of goodness of will in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning.
For which causes deservedly, and by the just judgment of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
they said he fled first in Battel, and then from his Kingdom: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all (the Bishops) unanimously agree and consent, that for his wickedness
God hath cast him out, and hath delivered his Kingdom to his Brothers that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60852:133"/>
are better than he. But the Bishops did not give them this liberty, till they
openly asked them, whether they would govern it as their ejected Brother did,
or according to the will of God. They answered, that as far as God should
enable them, they would govern themselves and theirs according to God's will.
By God's Authority (say they) we warn, exhort and command, that you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it, and rule it according to the will of God.]</q> 
                  <hi>So far</hi> Nithard.</p>
               <p>§ 147. You see here that it is no wonder that the Pope took upon him to
set up and take down, to make and unmake Kings, when the subject Bishops
did it by their greatest Sovereigns. And you see here God's just judgment
on a rebellious Son, and the shameful mutability of a temporizing Clergy.
And how presumptuous Bishops have abused Religion, the use of the Keys and
the Name of God, to the confusions and calamities of the world. But <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi>
after this Deposition reigned.</p>
               <p>§ 148. All these times Images were cast out in the Eastern Empire, even
all the Reign of <hi>Leo</hi> the 5th, and of <hi>Michael Balbus,</hi> (however he recalled
<hi>Theodorus Studita</hi> from Prison) and of <hi>Theophilus</hi> that succeeded him; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius
li. 8. c.</hi> 9. saith, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> followed his Father in persecuting the
Worshipers of Images, but yet was a most strict requirer of Justice, and
reigning 12 years and three months,<note place="margin">In <hi>France Claudius Taurinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> set against Image-worship, and going to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.

the Rule of his Mother <hi>Theodora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 149. And now come up Images again by a Woman, which ever since a
Womans Reign almost had been cast out; she ruled 14 years, just as <hi>Irene</hi>
did, and sped as she; for when her Son came to age, he deposed her. In
this time <hi>Methodius</hi> first, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> after, were made Patriarchs of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
And <hi>Bardas</hi> (made <hi>Caesar)</hi> deposed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> because he would not
excommunicate <hi>Theodora</hi> when she was deposed, and set up the learned <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in his place, that came in as <hi>Nectarius</hi> had done from the Laity, by sudden
Ordination: one honoured even by the Papists for his great learning, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
for being against them.</p>
               <p>§ 150. CCLIII. <hi>An.</hi> 842. This Woman had presently so much power
on the mutable Bishops, as in a Council at <hi>Constant.</hi> to turn them to be again
for Images, and as <hi>Theophanes</hi> saith, <hi>[Suddenly changing their judgment, they
cursed those that opposed Images;]</hi> and so after 120 years rejection they were
restored, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> 2d Council owned without any great difficulty:
And here all that were for Images accounted it <hi>Godliness,</hi> and called them <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi>
that were against it, and this Woman <hi>Theodora</hi> is stiled for it a very
godly Woman, (though the other called it Idolatry;) and so while one side
was cryed down as <hi>Profane,</hi> and the other as <hi>Idolatrous;</hi> the poor Church felt
to its sorrow, that Images were not taken for <hi>things indifferent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theophanes <hi>railing at</hi> Iohn <hi>the Patriarch of</hi> Constant. <hi>saith, that</hi> [Seeing
so sudden and unexpected a change, he that ruled impiously was struck with such
a stupor and blindness of mind, that he was ready to have killed himself; and
being the head of all the wickedness, of an ungodly judgment, that had led the
Emperors by lyes, and thrust them into the hell of impiety, he was with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60852:133"/>
cast out, and good <hi>Methodius</hi> put in.] <hi>I recite the words, to shew you
what various Characters the interest of Images gave to men, and what God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Ungodliness, Good men and Bad men, are in the sense of many

Miracles, say they. 1. He conquered a Basilisk that killed men by his looks,
(as St. <hi>George</hi> conquered the Dragon.) 2. By the Cross he stopt a fire in the
City: But his good works contain a Volumn in <hi>Anastasius, viz.</hi> the many
Churches that he adorned, enriched, repaired; the silver Vessels and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that he gave, the Posts and Pillars, and Altars that he beautified, and the

came and spoiled St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in the Suburbs of <hi>Rome,</hi> he caused
the said Suburbs to be walled and fortified, as a new City, calling it <hi>Leonina</hi>
from his name: And he made two or three Prayers of six or seven lines long,
to desire God's protection of it, by the intercession of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a notable Homily, in which he comprizeth much of the Canons, teaching

ordereth, that every Priest do learn his Lesson; and that if any of them
be illiterate, (that cannot read) he shall be suspended till he amend, (learn

Order of the Emperour <hi>Ludovicus,</hi> for the Reformation of the corrupt Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60852:136"/>
where they ordered that the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People</hi> chuse the Bishops, and yet
that the Laity on pretence of their Electing Power, trample not on the Arch-Presbyter;
and that great Mens Chappels empty not the Churches: (with
other old Canons recited.)</p>
               <p>§ 11. <hi>Lotharius,</hi> that so mischievously sought for the Empire against his
Father and Brethren, grew weary of what he had, and divided his 3d part,
(which was the Empire of <hi>Italy,</hi> with <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,)</hi> into three
parts, and gave his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the Empire in <hi>Italy;</hi> and his Son <hi>Lotharius, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain;</hi>
and his Son <hi>Charles, Burgundy;</hi> and entered himself into a Monastery:
But <hi>Charles</hi> dying, the other two Brethren divided his Dominion, and <hi>Lyons,

               </p>
               <p>§ 12. We come now to the Reign of Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> according to a great
number of their own Historians; but <hi>David Blondel</hi> hath recited the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of multitudes on both sides, and after all impartially past his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
that the Story was not true; whose judgment I reverence, and think
most probable.</p>
               <p>Whether at that time there was a <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8th or none till him that some
call <hi>Iohn</hi> the 9th after <hi>Adrian</hi> the 2d, is uncertain.</p>
               <p>§ 13. <hi>Leo</hi> dying, (if there was no <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Ioane</hi> between) a Schism
was made; the People most chusing <hi>Benedict,</hi> and the Agents of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
with part of the People and Bishops, chusing one <hi>Anastasius</hi> a Cardinal
Presbyter, that had been Excommunicate by a former Pope. <hi>Anastasius</hi>
thought his choice so sure, that entering <hi>Leonina,</hi> (the <hi>Roman</hi> Suburbs) he
went into St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s own Church, and broke down and burnt the Images, and
with a Mattock cast down to the ground even the Image of Christ, and the
Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> They went on and imprisoned <hi>Benedict, (quem omnis Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Plebs eligerat,</hi> saith <hi>Anast. in Bin. p. 659.)</hi> But while the great Men and
Officers of the Emperor did their utmost to constrain the People to consent
to <hi>Anastasius,</hi> they could not prevail, and so they were fain to yield to the
multitude to end the Tumult and Confusion, and <hi>Benedict</hi> had the place.</p>
               <p>§ 14. By this Story it appeareth, 1. That this <hi>Anastasius</hi> was against Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and that was like enough to be part of the cause why he had five years
left his Church in <hi>Rome</hi> before, and refused to appear before Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
2. That when the Emperor and his Officers were so violent for his
choice, even after he had broken down the Images in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, it is
apparent that the Party even about <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the West, which was against
Images, was not small, though they made no stir.</p>
               <p>§ 15. This Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> was he that confirmed <hi>Hincmarus</hi>'s Council,
which nullified <hi>Ebbo</hi>'s Ordinations aforesaid, as is to be seen in his first Epist.

among all the multitude, (though those three stood in several places) that is,
one Priest that stood at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Altar, one Deacon that stood at St. <hi>Denis</hi>'s
Altar, and one Lay-man at St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Altar: And six others were struck al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

               <p>§ 17. Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> 1. is chosen by the Emperor <hi>Ludovicus</hi> consent, and
<hi>all the People.</hi> He greatly advanceth the <hi>Roman</hi> Seat by his activity, and
much by doing justice to the People that were oppressed by Tyrannical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.
He had a great conflict with <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> who long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
him, and denied him his subjection: But the Emperor took the Pope's
part, and so poor <hi>Iohn</hi> was fain to submit, and cry <hi>miseremini mei, peto mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reri
mei, Anast. in Bin. p.</hi> 667. and to take an Oath of subjection to the
Pope.</p>
               <p>§ 18. The great Schism now rose at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whether <hi>Ignatius</hi> or
<hi>Photius</hi> should be Patriarch; <hi>Michael</hi> the Emperor deposing <hi>Ignatius</hi> by the
counsel of his Uncle <hi>Bardas,</hi> and putting in <hi>Photius.</hi> The Pope kept up his
power by interposing, uncalled, into all such matters. He sent some Bishops
as Legates to counsel them by a Synod to decide the difference: When these
Bishops came thither, they consented to <hi>Photius</hi> against <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The Pope
said they were bribed, and false to their trust, and deposed them, (though he
thought he chose the best he had;) of which more anon.</p>
               <p>§ 19. Yet we have not done with worldly Prelates. King <hi>Lotharius</hi> was
weary of his Wife, and loved a Whore <hi>(Waldrada.)</hi> He openeth his case
to the Bishops. They call a Council, and approve of his Divorce, and his
Marriage with <hi>Waldrada.</hi> The two great Archbishops of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi>
are the Leaders. The Pope is against it, and accuseth the Bishops of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Adultery; They appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and he condemneth them of Impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
while (with some immodest words) they undertake to justifie the thing,
(of which more anon.) He chargeth the Bishops of heinous Villany, and
they despised him. He condemneth the <hi>Concilium Metense</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">At <hi>Metz.</hi>
                  </note>, in which the
Adultery was allowed.</p>
               <p>§ 20. This Pope falls out with <hi>Hincmarus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> justifying
against him the cause of <hi>Rothaldus,</hi> whom he had deposed.</p>
               <p>He sends Messengers to the King of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> converted in his days, whom
the Emperor's Officers stop and abuse. The Adversaries of Images were still
strong at <hi>Constantinople. Anast. &amp; Bin. p.</hi> 670, &amp;c.</p>

in the Image of his Works: Why then may we not make Images of the
Saints? (But why must Men be compelled to do it, or else be Hereticks?
and why must they be worshipped?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epist.</hi> 5. He is pitifully put to it, to justifie the Election of <hi>Nectarius</hi> and
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> and yet to condemn that of <hi>Photius</hi> for being a Lay-man. And

               </p>
               <p>§ 21. The 8th Epistle of this Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Michael,</hi> doth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60852:137"/>
shew that he had now shaken off the Imperial Power; and therefore charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Letters as full of Blasphemy,<note place="margin">☞</note> Injury, Madness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> partly for being so
sawcy as to bid the Pope, <hi>[Send some to him.]</hi> which he saith was far from
the godly Emperors. Partly for blaming the deeds of the Prelates, when he
saith, <hi>Their words must be regarded, and their authority, and not their deeds.</hi>
Partly for calling the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>Scythian,</hi> in comparison
of the <hi>Greek,</hi> which he saith is to reproach God that made it. Partly
for saying, that the Council that deposed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and set up <hi>Photius,</hi> was of
the same number of Bishops as the first Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> where this high
Pope's answer is worth the notice of our Papists, <hi>Bin. p. 689.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>[The small

                     <hi>where Piety aboundeth: Nor doth multitude profit, where
Impiety reigneth. Yea, by how much the more numerous is the Congregation of
the malignant, by so much the stronger are they to do mischief: Nor must men
glory in numbers, when they fight not against the Rulers of the darkness of
this world, and spiritual wickedness.—Glory not therefore in multitude, because
it is not the multitude but the cause, that justifieth or damneth.—Fear not little
Flocks,</hi> &amp;c.]</q> This Doctrine was then fittest for the Pope in his Minority:
But the Letter is a Book pleading for the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandure, and striving to
bring the Emperor with others under his power.</p>
               <p>§ 22. In his Answer and Laws to the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> he difliketh their Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
against one that had pretended to be a Priest, when he was not, and had
baptized many,<note place="margin">☞</note> concluding that he had saved many, and that they were not
to be re-baptized, <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 772. No, not though he were no Christian that
baptized them, as after <hi>Consul. Cap. 104. p.</hi> 782.</p>
               <p>To the Case: Who are <hi>Patriarchs?</hi> he saith properly they only that have
succeeded Apostles, which were only three, <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi>
but improperly only <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> (But why then are not
<hi>Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. Patriarchates?) And why had the rest of the
Apostles no Successors? Had they no Churches?</p>
               <p>§ 23. This Pope having Western security, threatned Excommunication
to the Emperor of the East, unless he would depose <hi>Photius,</hi> and restore <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi>
and threatned <hi>Lotharius,</hi> for the cause of his rejected Wife, and the
Marriage of another, as aforesaid; and swaggered against <hi>Hincmarus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensis,</hi>
for his deposing <hi>Rothaldus</hi> a Bishop, and forced him to yield, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
his Synod at <hi>Metz,</hi> and would have proved that Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> had
not confirmed it. He and other Popes did make the Contentions of Bishops
as well as of Princes a great means of their rising, taking the part of him that
appealed to <hi>Rome</hi> as injured, (and very oft of the truly injured.) By which
means they had one Party still for them, and all injured persons were ready to
flie to them for help.</p>
               <p>He Excommunicated the Bishops of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Triers.</hi> The poor Bishops
that would fain be on the stronger side, began now to be at a loss, to know
whether the Emperor or the Pope was the strongest. They followed the
Emperor, and resisted the Pope a while. The King and <hi>Hincmarus</hi> forbad
<hi>Rothaldus</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and imprisoned him: But the Pope wearied them
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60852:137"/>
out, by reason of the divisions of the Empire and Kingdom into so many
hands of the <hi>French</hi> Line, that being in continual suspicion of each other, they
needed the Pope's help.</p>

Did not other Apostles build Churches by the same Apostolick Commission as

Christ being the Head-corner Stone? Did not others build the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> did it? Did not <hi>Peter</hi> build other Churches

               <p>You see here to what power over Kings the common Bishops (as well
as the Pope) were got, by pretence of representing Christ, and of the
Power of the Keys.</p>
               <p>§ 33. CCLXVI. <hi>An.</hi> 859. A Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> condemned <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
and again confirmed <hi>Photius,</hi> who with the Emperor <hi>Michael</hi> sent
to the Pope to satisfie him of all, and profess enmity to Image-breakers.</p>

Kings of the <hi>French</hi> Line came to an agreement.</p>
               <p>§ 35. CCLXVIII. A General Council was held at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> An.
861. where 318 Bishops (the same number that was at the first <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council) deposed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and setled <hi>Photius,</hi> to which the Pope's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
also subscribed, (the Papists say through fear;) so that it was
Papally confirmed. And yet here was much done for Images.</p>
               <p>§ 36. CCLXIX. The Pope having condemned <hi>Iohn</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Revenna</hi> who despised him, till the Emperor forsook him, in a Council at
<hi>Rome</hi> he submitted himself to the Pope, and was reconciled.</p>
               <p>§ 37. CCLXX. <hi>An.</hi> 862. In another Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi>

               <p>§ 38. CCLXXI. <hi>An.</hi> 862. A Council is held at <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> in which
King <hi>Lotharius</hi> desireth counsel about his Wife <hi>Theutperge;</hi> the Bishops
pronounce it his duty to put her away, she having confessed Incest with
her own Brother, and allow him to marry <hi>Waldrade,</hi> he professing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unable to contain. The Pope condemneth the action and them:
The Papists say this was but a forged pretence. I only note 1. If they
would deliberately forge so heinous a thing on a Queen, what Heathens
could be worse than such Bishops? 2. Did the Bishops of that age think
that they were bound to obey the judgment of the Pope, who thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
him?</p>

subscribe to the King's Divorce, and to more, which the Pope had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

not to be opposed?) The Papists say that the Pope's Legates were

their Ministery, and used as they used <hi>Rhotaldus:</hi> But they did

               <p>And whereas the King had forbidden <hi>Rhotaldus</hi> to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
<hi>French</hi> Bishops pleaded this as a just restraint, the Pope answered, That

to the question, Whether the King or the Pope was King of <hi>France,</hi>

<hi>Bardas</hi> (who was for <hi>Photius)</hi> at last giving up himself to drunkenness
and other sins, by the perswasion of <hi>Basilius</hi> he killed <hi>Bardas,</hi> and made
<hi>Basilius</hi> Caesar: And after a while his vice gave <hi>Basilius</hi> the opportunity
to kill the Emperor when he was drunk. See <hi>Dion. Petavius</hi> Hist. li.
1. chap. 12. Yet this <hi>Basilius</hi> washed his hands and made many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
that he had no hand in his blood. This made for the Popes
advantage: Women and Rebels and Traytors and discordant Princes did
much in raising him. This Regicide Emperor, as a second <hi>Phocas</hi>
finds it useful to quiet his party by a change countenanced by the Bishop
of <hi>Rome:</hi> And so he sets himself against <hi>Photius</hi> and sets up <hi>Ignatius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and searching <hi>Photius</hi>'s servants, finds a book written of the Acts
of the late great Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was for him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> and a defence of that Council against the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
in which he dealt severely with the Pope. This Book the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
sends to the Pope, and there it is read, stampt upon, stab'd
with a knife, and openly burnt (and a miracle is said to be at the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, some drops of rain that fell, not quenching the fire, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing

and condemning the council that was for him, will hardly keep the
readers of his yet-preserved learned writings from suspecting that the
Popes cause was not unquestionable, or at least, that the Pope was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

regard him. No wonder then if the Acts of a great council when they

               <p>§ 53. Here also another difficulty arose (as there ever doth in ravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
works.) The Pope had been against <hi>Hincmarus</hi> and his Council
for deposing the Bishops ordained by <hi>Ebbo.</hi> And yet to subdue the
Greeks he was for the deposing of those ordained by <hi>Photius.</hi> This
made him seem contrary to himself: <hi>Anastasius Bibliothecarius</hi> (who
then lived and was employed at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in this matter) to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the contradiction, saith that <hi>Ebbo</hi> was a true Bishop, but <hi>Photius</hi> was
not, because he was a Lay-man before his consecration; and therefore
his ordinations are nullities. This nullifying of ordinations maketh
great disturbances in the Church. The present Bishops of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
those that were heretofore ordained by <hi>Parochial</hi> Pastors to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained,
and on this and such other accounts about 2000 were silenced
at one day <hi>(Aug. 24. 1662.)</hi> The silenced Nonconformists do some of
them say that the Bishops have much less than <hi>Photius</hi> to shew for their
authority to ordain. He had learning, he had the Emperors authority
for him: He had lawfull Bishops to ordain him; He had a great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
or two to approve him and confirm him: And though he was a lay-man
before, so is every one when he cometh to his first ordination.
And though he was made Bishop <hi>per saltum,</hi> so was <hi>Nectarius, Thala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,
Ambrose, &amp;c.</hi> And every Uncanonical irregularity nullifieth not
the ordination. It hath been ordinary for Deacons to be made Popes:

                     </gap>?</hi> But, say they, on this account 1. <hi>Romes</hi> succession is long
agoe interrupted: There having been far greater incapacities in Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
common Adulterers, Perjured, Rebels, Hereticks, Infidels, (as
Councils have judged.) 2. And (they say) that so the English Prelates
are no Bishops, being chosen by the King, and wanting that choice of
the Clergy and people, which the Canons have over and over again
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60852:140"/>
made necessary to the validity of ordinations, are more null than those
of <hi>Photius:</hi> And therefore we owe them (as such) no obedience nor
communion.] Thus our nullifyings and condemnings proceed till most
men have degraded if not unchristened one another. And he that is on
the stronger side carrieth it, till death or some other change confute his
claim, and then the other side gets up and condemneth him as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them. And thus hath the Church long suffered by damning
Divines, and domineering or censorious Judges.</p>
               <p>§ 54. By the restoring of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Pope got to himself the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of some Supremacy, and obliged a party to him; which however
it was not the greatest at the first, would be greatest when <hi>Ignatius</hi> his
supremacy had advanced it: And with them he got the reputation of
being just, indeed <hi>Photius</hi> seeming to possess the seat of one that was
injuriously deposed by the meer will of the Prince, without sufficient
cause.</p>

a General Council, when, if they please not the strongest, they are ruined:
And if they do, it's like enough the next age will damn them for it. 2.
How much more dangerous is it for a Council to be against the Pope,

that had followed <hi>Photius,</hi> took the old course, and when they saw
all turned cryed <hi>peccavimus</hi> and craved pardon, and themselves called
<hi>Photius, such a villain as there had never been the like. (Bin.</hi> p. 882,)
They said they <hi>sinned through fear</hi> and so were forgiven. Act. 3. Some
Bishops that had turned, who were ordained by <hi>Methodius,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to subscribe to a form proposed; But they told them that the
late times had so vexed men with heinous subscriptions, that they had
made a Covenant or Vow to make no more subscriptions but what they
had done already,<note place="margin">☞</note> and the profession of their faith (like Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists)
and desired to be received on such terms without their new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
Act. 4. The Bishops of <hi>Photius</hi>'s party ordained by him were
examined. And Act. 5. <hi>Photius</hi> himself, who would not enter till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
and then professed as in imitation of Christ to give them no
answer to what they asked him; and is in vain exhorted to repentance.
Act. 6. Many of the <hi>Photian</hi> Bishops repented and were pardoned:
Others pretended that they had subscribed and sworn to <hi>Photius,</hi> where
<hi>Zachar. Calcedon.</hi> shewed that the Canons were above the Patriarchs.
Here <hi>Basilius</hi> the Emperor made a notable speech to exhort the Bishops
to repentance, offering himself to lay by his honour and to lie on the

Act. 7. <hi>Photius</hi> is again brought in, (and his staff that he leaned on ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

them repent. The Bishops of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> &amp;c. rejected the Legates,

of great learning and diligence. But the old contention WHO SHOULD

               <p>I think it not in vain here to transcribe part of the summ of the life of
<hi>Ignatius</hi> as written by <hi>Nicetas, David, Paphlago</hi> who was devoted to
him, though somewhat said already be repeated. <hi>Ignatius</hi> (being of
the blood Royal) was in quiet possession, when denying entrance or

provoked that indignation in him which deposed him. <hi>Bardas</hi> first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

the Empire any longer to his Mother and Sisters. One <hi>Gebo</hi> then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be the Son of Queen <hi>Theodora,</hi> and claiming the Crown, and
many following him, <hi>Ignatius</hi> is accused as being then on <hi>Gebo</hi>'s side,
The Emperor commandeth <hi>Ignatius</hi> to shear his Mother and Sisters,
and put them into a Monastery: He refuseth: The Emperor is angry
and suspecting him, causeth it to be done by others, and sendeth <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Photius</hi> was silent at all this. Another Earthquake frightned them
again, the terriblest for a day and a night that had been there known.
Upon this one <hi>Basilius</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Thesalonica</hi> went boldly to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

this? What excess of Envy? What study of ambitious Dishonesty? Did
thy daily meditation and night-watches, and innumerable Books teach thee
this? Did thy frequent reading and disputation, and striving for the
praise of learning teach it thee? Did the knowledge of the Old Testament

               </p>
               <p>1. That contending who should be greatest was the sin of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,<note place="margin">☞</note>
and the plague of the Churches.</p>
               <p>2. And that then it was taken for granted, that the Pope deserving it
might be deposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The new Emperor <hi>Basil</hi> sent these Books to the Pope, who burnt them
as you have heard (Great reason: but I would we saw them!) <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
being restored, excommunicateth <hi>Photius,</hi> and all that were initiated
by him, and all that communicated with him. (It seems they were
much alike in the art of damning men, and separating them from
Christ.) Then is <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Council called, where 102 Bishops damn
<hi>Photius,</hi> depose him, and curse him from Christ; and the Bishops, to
shew their holiness and constancy, would not write his damnation with
Ink, but <hi>with Christ's own blood;</hi> (that is, the Sacramental Wine.)
(And yet ere long they set up <hi>Photius</hi> again.)<note place="margin">☞</note>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Nicetas</hi> blameth his
Condemners, that went not so far as to prevent his Restoration. But
how can Bishops rule God's Providence, or the mutable minds of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!
saith he, <q>
                     <hi>[Nam qui per reconciliatos erat ejectus, &amp; per hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas

                  </q> Alas! if
the Bishops will be perjured Weathercocks, and, as Hypocrites, cry <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavimus</hi>
one year, and go contrary again the next, and change as Princes
do, who can help it?</p>
               <p>He saith now, new Earthquakes and terrible Whirlwinds did again
afright men. He giveth us also many of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Miracles, especially
when he was dead. He saith <hi>Photius</hi> prosecuted him with malice when
he was dead. He next tells us how after the death of <hi>Ignatius, Photius</hi>
came to be restored; even by feigning a Pedegree of <hi>Basilius</hi> as from
the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> sound by his skill in Antiquities; and by his great
parts and elegancy winning upon him. He maketh <hi>Theophanes</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of the deceit. He won the hearts of all the Courtiers: so
that within three days of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s death he was restored. Hereupon
the Bishops turn round, and they that lately called him all that's naught,
now magnifie him,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>(Bin. p. 875.)</hi> But all that <hi>Nicetas</hi> calleth <hi>verè
Christianos,</hi> abhorred him.</p>
               <p>(This maketh me remember the words of <hi>Erasmus</hi> in the life of Dr.
<hi>Colet</hi> translated by <hi>Thomas Smyth,</hi> concerning the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> that

Sad Prelates that <hi>Nicetas</hi> (and <hi>Erasmus)</hi> could not call Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>But the ambition of <hi>Photius</hi> tempted them to their mutability: He
cast out the Bishops that were against him, and presently forgave and
restored them if they would but conform. Yea, he dared to re-ordain
those that <hi>Ignatius</hi> had ordained, supposing him no Bishop; but abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all that stopt him in it. But he proceeded to consecrate anew the
Church-Utensils, and say over certain Prayers <hi>(If,</hi> saith <hi>Nicetas, they
be not rather to be called Curses.] And</hi> (saith he) <hi>to make his sin out

               </p>
               <p>§ 64. And now Reader, I leave it to thy judgment, whether <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen</hi> knew not what he said, when he wisht there were no <hi>[higher</hi>
and <hi>lower]</hi> among Bishops; and when he spake so much of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
levity and temerity, and of the evil effects of their Councils in his
time. Whether Patriarchal dignity was not a great temptation, when
to the Son of a Prince on one side, and to the great and noble Secretary
of the Emperor on the other side, it seemed a prize worth the striving
for to the death? And whether it have not been the calamity of the
Church, when two such extraordinary men, far above the common rank
of Bishops, shall set an Empire and almost all the Christian Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Schism, Contention, mutual Persecution and Confusion, by so long
striving Who shall be greatest?<note place="margin">☜</note> and drawing so many hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
into Faction, Schism, Perjury, and shameful mutations with them?
And whether Christ did not (foreseeing such things) far otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
this question, <hi>Who shall be greatest?</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. But if <hi>Pride</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Angels</hi> into Devils, it is not much to be wondered, if it turn the
Angels of the Churches into the Ministers of the Prince of Pride and
Darkness, and turn many Churches into a Theatre of Contention, and a
Field of War.</p>
               <p>§ 65. Yet here is one thing further to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi> the foresaid
Contention that rose about the <hi>Bulgarians.</hi> These two great Patriarchs
of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were neither of them yet great enough, or
satisfied with their jurisdiction, their desires being more boundless than
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s for the Empire; nothing less than <hi>all the world</hi> will satisfie
one of them at least. <hi>Nicetas</hi> saith, it was by Famine, and a Treaty,
and kind words of the Emperor, that the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> turned Christians.
Some <hi>Papists</hi> would give the honour to the Pope, without proof, and
cannot tell us any thing how the Pope converted them. But when they
were converted, they sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for some Instructors: The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:60852:145"/>
them two, and they received them. But they put the case themselves
to the Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Whether they were to be under the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Constantinople?</hi> The matter held a great debate.
The Pope's Legates pleaded, that they had already received Bishops
from <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Greeks</hi> pleaded, that their Countrey was part of
the Empire, and under the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> till they conquered
it; and that they found there <hi>Greek</hi> Churches and Bishops, who were
still there, and the Conquest did not translate them from the Bishop of
<hi>Constant.</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> How the Controversie ended is hard to know:
Some say that the Council gave them to the Pope, and some say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But this is confessed, that this <hi>Roman</hi> ambition so greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
the new Emperor <hi>Basilius,</hi> that it turned him after against the
Pope, and inclined him the more to restore <hi>Photius,</hi> which he did when
<hi>Ignatius</hi> was dead.</p>
               <p>§ 66. Here I would call the Reader to consider, whether the Pope's
Universal Government was in those days believed? even by that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
which was supposed to be partial (by the Emperor's inducement)
on the Pope's side. What place else could there be for such a strife,
whether the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> were under the Government of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople;</hi> if all the World were under the Bishop of
<hi>Rome?</hi> They will say that it was only questioned, whose Diocess or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate
they were under?<note place="margin">☞</note> But <hi>Rome</hi> never pretended that they were
of that Diocess or Patriarchate as anciently divided. But the question
was, Whose Government they were now fallen under? And would any
dispute whether <hi>e. g. Westminster</hi> were under the Government of the
King, or of the Lord Mayor of <hi>London?</hi> when all the Kingdom is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the King. This Controversie clearly sheweth, that the Church then
took the Pope to have but the first Seat and Voice in Councils, but not
to be the Governor beyond his circuit.</p>
               <p>§ 67. It is here also to be noted, that <hi>Basil</hi> the Emperor's revolt from
the Pope was so great, that <hi>Hadrian</hi> is put to write sharply to him as
accusing the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and derogating from them, admonishing
him to repent; but we find not that this changed his mind.</p>
               <p>§ 68. Yet one thing more is here to be observed. In the life of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
the 2d <hi>(Bin. p. 882.)</hi> we find that the Pope taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Basil</hi>'s present state and mind, and the interest of <hi>Ignatius</hi> much
depending on him, sent a new Libel to be subscribed by all the Bishops,
before they should be permitted to sit in Council. The <hi>Greek</hi> Bishops
grudged at this, and complained to the Emperor, <q>[That the Church of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> by these offered Libels, was brought under the power of
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the doubtfulness of Subscriptions.]</q> But though <hi>flebiliter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queruntur,</hi>
they <hi>complain with tears,</hi> the Emperor was angry with them,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60852:145"/>
and would have it; and some Bishops <hi>non sine magno laboris periculo, libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los

saying, It was <hi>novum &amp; inauditum.</hi> The refusers <hi>extra Synodum
inglorii relicti sunt,</hi> were shut out till they conformed: (Oh! that <hi>Inglorii</hi>
was a cutting word.)</p>
               <p>§ 69. The Emperor hiding his anger against the Pope's Legates (for
the <hi>Bulgarian</hi> Usurpation) gave them great gifts, and sent them home.
But at Sea they fell into the hands of the <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> who stripped them
of their Riches, and the Subscriptions and Copy of the Council, and kept
them Prisoners, and threatned their Lives: But by the mediation of the
Emperor and Pope, they were delivered, and had some of their Writings
again.</p>

words of</hi> Binnius <hi>translated,</hi> 
                  <q>[When <hi>Hincmarus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> for the

on his behalf, and had notified it to <hi>Hincmarus Rhemensis,</hi> and to King
<hi>Charles;</hi> both of them, in hatred to the Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> decreed, That this
Synod, called <hi>Latrocinalis</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">By you.</note>, should be called. There presided in it, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migius
Lugdunensis</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">So great and holy a man also against the Pope.</note>, <hi>Ardovicus Vesontiensis, Bertulsus Trevirensis,</hi>
with their subject Bishops, Herein <hi>Hincmarus Rhemensis,</hi> with King
<hi>Charles,</hi> was the accuser of his Nephew <hi>Hincmarus,</hi> whom he had before
consecrated Bishop of <hi>Laon.</hi> The Action brought against him was, That
he had by Counter-writings defended the rights of the Apostolick Seat,
which the Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> did endeavor to impugn and overthrow<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luther</hi> was not the first.</note>.
And that, contrary to his Oath of Fidelity in which he was bound to the
King, he had accused King <hi>Charles</hi> to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had without
his licence sent forth writings against him. And when <hi>Hincmarus Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunensis,</hi>
at the Pope's command, was ready for his journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> he
was taken and spoiled by his Enemies, and brought into this false Council.
Having heard the foresaid Complaints against him, he offered a Libel for
his defence; but it was rejected, and not permitted to be read: of which
when he again appealed to the Apostolick Seat, they did not only not accept
of his Appeal, but also being prostrate on the ground, and pleading for leave
to defend himself, he was not heard. Passing Sentence on him, they depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him from his Bishoprick: and binding him in hard and iron bands, they
cast him into banishment: And at last, which passeth all cruelty, his eyes
pulled out; they perhaps blinded him that he might have no hope of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Bishoprick.]</q> 
                  <hi>So far</hi> Binnius. <hi>And is it credible that such great
and holy men as</hi> Remigius, <hi>and</hi> Hincmarus <hi>(even to his own Nephew
set up by him) would do such things as these for nothing? Or that the
Pope was then as high as since?</hi>

Therefore he appealed to the Pope again, who interposed for him, but
all would not do, nor serve his turn.</p>
               <p>§ 75. Here falls in again the great Controversie of Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> a
Woman, but it is too hard for me to decide. He that will see what is
said on each side, may read <hi>Blondel</hi> before cited. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8th is he
that now reigneth, whom some late Writers are willing to believe some
called Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> in scorn for his failings. But he is after <hi>Benedict</hi> the 3d,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60852:146"/>
                  <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and <hi>Hadrian</hi> the 2d; whereas the <hi>fere omnes,</hi> saith <hi>Platina,</hi> the

him <hi>Iohn</hi> the 9th, saith, that <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> being dead, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi>
laboured to have his Son <hi>Ludovicus</hi> succeed him; but the great men of
<hi>Rome</hi> were for <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> and therefore laid hold on the
Pope, and put him in Bonds in Prison (his Universal Sovereignty reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>France</hi> to the King, whom he unjustly pleaded for, <hi>(Ludovicus Balbus,)</hi>
and there anointed him.</p>
               <p>§ 76. Before this the Pope had anointed <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> Emperor,
unjustly confirming what the Bishops had unjustly done, as now he did
unjustly stand for his Son. This contention among Princes, was the
means of the Pope's power. Hear what <hi>Binnius</hi> himself saith of him,
pag. 920. <q>
                     <hi>[The</hi> Saracens <hi>now depopulated almost all</hi> Italy, <hi>and all humane
help failed in which the Pope trusted to expel them; and he was fain to
buy peace of them by a yearly Tribute: which seemed to come by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judgment of God, that he might know that by the ill persuasion of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

great men that imprisoned him, and to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and take <hi>Charles</hi>
for Emperor, after all. Yet is it noted as the rare Honour and Felicity
of this Pope, that he crowned three Emperors, though he did it for two
of them trayterously and unjustly, (the honour of a Pope!) <hi>Platina</hi>
saith, he crowned <hi>Charles</hi> the rightful Heir, <hi>Quo ei liberius in urbe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere

to keep up the honour of the Latine tongue (and his authority) he
commandeth that though the rest be done in the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> yet the

the <hi>Sclavonian.</hi>

and a great stir there was about that also.</p>
               <p>

not able to resist the <hi>Saracens,</hi> those that lay next them under
their power sought to save themselves by truce and tribute, by which
means the <hi>Saracens</hi> had leisure to come further near to <hi>Rome;</hi> and so the

perplexed between the Priests that strove who should be their Vice-Christ,
and King of Kings, that it seemed as hard to them to resolve
the doubt, as it before was to be Christians.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Epist.</hi> 307. sheweth, the Bishop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> being dead, that
yet the Roman usurpation was not grown so high as to take the choice
of the Bishop out of the People and Presbyters hands, except in long

               <p>Had not this Pope been kept under by Gods judgments, suffering the

had been like to have overthrown <hi>Rome</hi> by his usurpations, setting both
Princes and Prelates against him: But necessity made him a flatterer of
the two Emperors of the West, the Emperor of the <hi>East,</hi> the King of
<hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> and all that he
needed, as ambition made him still striving by <hi>Tibi dabo claves,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematizing</hi>
to affright the world to his obedience. I say not worse
of him than <hi>Baronius, Binnius,</hi> &amp;c. who have no other way to deny the
Histories of Pope <hi>Ioan,</hi> than by saying that this mans <hi>baser compliance
made him called Pope</hi> Joan.</p>

power to make Kings and unmake them. Accordingly this Pope when he
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60852:148"/>
durst stay from <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>France</hi> no longer, lest he lost all, (being impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned

him with the Augustal name, before he was anointed and crowned by him,

               <p>§ 86. CCXCV. Besides some petty Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> there was
<hi>an.</hi> 879. a General Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> of 385 Bishops where
<hi>Photius</hi> was confirmed, and the former General Council (called the 8th

and not for the abrogation of the former Council; and that <hi>Photius</hi>
corrupted his writing, and so they would make all writings uncertain.
They say that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi>'s epistle is by the wonderful providence of
God found yet without some clauses added by <hi>Photius,</hi> whom they call
the great architect of lyes: But the <hi>Greeks</hi> will no more believe the late
found <hi>Laterane</hi> or other <hi>Roman</hi> Copies, than the <hi>Romans</hi> will believe
the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies. And how shall we know which of them to believe?
(And how little doth it concern us?)</p>
               <p>§ 87. It must be a controversie also whether this Council must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Oecumenical:</hi> I have oft proved that there was never any truly such as
to all the world. There were 385 Bishops which is more than the
first Council at <hi>Nice</hi> had, or most others: The Popes Legates were
there;<note place="margin">☞</note> Oh but, saith <hi>Binnius, It was not they but Photius that did preside:
therefore it was not general. Ans.</hi> 1. Let the world know then what
maketh a general Council in the Papal sense: It doth not represent all
the Church unless the Popes Legates preside. So much doth it import
to know which Priest is the greatest.</p>
               <p>2. But did <hi>Binnius</hi> forget that he himself affirmeth that at the first
General Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Pope did not preside by himself or
any Legate. And yet that is one of the 4th. Councils equalled with
the four Gospels; and the Pope dare not deny it lest the <hi>Greeks</hi> further
hereticate or anathematize him.</p>
               <p>But saith <hi>Binnius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>It was no General Council because there was many
frauds and impostures. Ans.</hi> By that rule <hi>Trent</hi> had no General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
nor <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp;c. And so it is left to the judgment of all men to
nullifie such Councils which they can prove to have had frauds and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures.
And must we also nullifie the Papacie of them that have had
such frauds?</p>
               <p>§ 88. Is it a grand question whether Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> confirmed this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
The approbation is extant. But the Reprobaters say 1. that he
put in some terms of limitation (so far as his Legates went right) 2.
that he after <hi>ex umbone</hi> condemned <hi>Photius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But 1. Is it not a General Council if the Popes Legates consent till
he personally confirm it? Were all former Councils null, till the Popes
personal confirmation? what are his Legates for then? 2. As his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60852:149"/>
may mistake, so may he himself: Is it null then till he rectifie his
Error? 3. By this we see how impossible it is to know the new Gosple
of the Papists; which is Canonical from the Apocryphal. For (as Pope
<hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Conciliariter</hi> after, so) here and elswhere the Popes have so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguously
given their consent that no wit of man can tell what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to by them, and what not (as their controversies confessed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 89. At least whether the Pope consented or no, seeing in this
Council the former 8th. General Council was condemned, and the <hi>fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oque</hi>
expunged the Creed, we see how ridiculously our late Papists ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from the consent of Councils to prove the constant Tradition of the
Church,<note place="margin">☜</note> saying, <hi>Did the Council go to bed in one mind and rise in another?</hi>
Did these 385 <hi>Bishops</hi> do so? or did the former whom they condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
do so? Is this the smooth Current of Tradition? and may we know
by it what our Fathers held?</p>
               <p>§ 90. When the other Legates consented, <hi>Marinus,</hi> who was after
Pope, dissenting, he was laid in prison thirty dayes at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first Act of the Council, as <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Heraclea</hi> spake much against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he said was

and cure which this Council was called. Much also against Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi>
and <hi>Hadrian</hi> he spake, but for Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> as being for them. In
the 2d. Act was read an epistle of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to the
Emperor for abrogating the former 8th. Synod: And <hi>Thomas</hi> one of
the three Legates of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Patriarchs that consented to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Synod (the rest being dead) made his penitent recantation. Then
the epistles of the Patriarchs of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> for <hi>Photius</hi> are
read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the third Act, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi>'s letters were read, as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the peace of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church; which the Council took as
a busy pretending to more power than he had, and therefore said <hi>that</hi>
                  <q>

if <hi>Rome</hi> did still set the imperial Church in contention, and hinder peace.
The Emperor affirmed that he was no Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because he had
been ordained Bishop of another place. 2. He destroyeth what Pope

               <p>§. 10. <hi>But here the Authors calling us</hi> Novatores <hi>(as if such Popes were
of glorious</hi> Antiquity) <hi>are hard put to it to Vindicate against us the Popes
infallibility! And how do they do it? Why</hi> 1st. They say that all that
<hi>Stephen</hi> did against <hi>Formosus,</hi> a man stricken with Madness, did it fulfilling
the perswasion of his boyling Rage. But in the lawful use of his Papal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he defined nothing against Faith or good manners: For the Bishops that
were for this Cause called to the Council, and the Presbyters not unlike to
<hi>Stephen</hi> himself, did prosecute <hi>Formosus</hi> with the same hatred; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pronounced that Sentence against him, which they fore knew would be pleasing
to a man smitten with Fury: so that we confess violent Tyranny, but no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in Faith defined or approved by him, Lawfully using his Papal Authority:
And yet it were no prejudice to the Papal Seat, if we grant, that a false Pope,
not lawfully Chosen,<note place="margin">☜</note> but invading and obtruded, did err in asserting Articles
of Faith. <hi>Thus the Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. But if you grant this, is not your Succession interrupted? 2. And
was your Church a true Church, when an Essential part was Null? 3. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
was it the <hi>Holy Church</hi> when an essential Part was such a Villain?
4. Will not your Argument as well prove every Bishop, Priest, or man
Infallible? For no one of them all can define falsly against an Article of
Faith, as long as he lawfully useth his Power; For it is no lawful use of
power that so defineth and belieth God. 5. But is all your foundation of
Faith come to this? It is then but saying, when ever your Pope and
Church Erreth, <hi>that they did not use their Power lawfully:</hi> And what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
is that to the deceived? How shall we know when your Popes have
used it lawfully, and when not; and so what is true among you, and what
false? 6. And were your Roman Council of Bishops and Priests, all as
bad as this Villainous Pope, and ready to please him in their Decrees: And
was this a Holy Church, and like to be an Infallible Council: And must
the World follow them? 7. And how then shall we know that it was not
just so with many other former and following Councils; and that it will
not be so with you again! O miserable shifts against plain Truth!</p>

               <p>Next came <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. (or 10. as others) saith <hi>Platina. [He restored the
Cause of</hi> Pope-Formosus, <hi>many of the People being against it: whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
such a Sedition, that they hardly scaped a Battle. Baronius</hi> saith, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus
4.</hi> was deposed and blinded now by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who assumed the
Empire; and this Pope Crowned him, through fear! Yet after he was
gone, he called <hi>Lambert</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and with a Synod concuring with
him, declared the Coronations both of <hi>Berengarius</hi> and <hi>Arnulph</hi> to be
Null, as being extorted; and so took <hi>Lambert</hi> for King and Emperour:
Did not the Crowns of Princes sit very loose, when it was but a Popes
pretending that he Crowned them through Fear, and they were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Deposed? Would these Popes have been Martyrs, or were they
<hi>Christians</hi> or <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> that would sin, if they were but put in fear? And
would not fear have made them own a Heresy, as well as other sin? On
this occasion all was cast into Confusion: the Pope was fain to fly to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi>
for protection, to him whom he had Crowned.</p>
               <p>§. 16. CCCVI. This Pope called a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> (that called <hi>Ovetensis,</hi>
I pass by as of small moment) <hi>An.</hi> 904. in which he condemned the
fact of Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> decreeing that the Dead are not to be judged by
men. But what became of the Synod of Bishops that had joyned herein
with Pope <hi>Stephen?</hi> Why <hi>(Bin. p. 1049.)</hi> they turn'd with the times, and
did as such had used to do;<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>They asked forgiveness, and said, they did it for

and Councils Sin and Repent, and Sin again, and Repent again, as Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest

forbidden as unlawful.</p>
               <p>§. 17. <hi>CCCVII. Another Synod he called at</hi> Ravenna <hi>for the same use,
when he fled thither from</hi> Rome; <hi>of 74 Bishops.</hi> Baronius <hi>saith, He was
another</hi> Ieremias <hi>sent of God, to pluck up and pull down what Pope.</hi> Stephen
<hi>had done.</hi> Platina <hi>saith</hi> [I think this came to pass because Popes were departed

               <p>§. 23. This <hi>Pope</hi> undid again all that had been done for <hi>Formosus,</hi>

Enemies to <hi>Formosus,</hi> for setting up other powers against <hi>France,</hi> and
because his party was against <hi>Sergius:</hi> But I wonder that <hi>Platina</hi> tells
us, that both <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> took <hi>Formosus</hi> out of his Grave, and
the one cut off his three Fingers, and the other his Head; and both
cast into <hi>Tyber!</hi> If this be true, he was taken up again the first time,
and buried again. But I suppose that it was but his Fingers that were
cast in the first time, and the Corps after; or else he was found after
the first time. <hi>Platina</hi> saith, <hi>It is reported, but not of any certainty;
that some Fisher-men found the Corps, and buried it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that while it was doing, the Church <hi>Images bowed to it</hi> (It's well
<hi>Vncertainty</hi> was put into the Story:) and that some thought this
moved <hi>Sergius</hi> to envy; but that indeed it was, because <hi>Formosus</hi>
party were against his Papacy. It seems by this that the Fisher-men
found him after the first casting into <hi>Tyber;</hi> or else his burial by them could
not be called the occasion of <hi>Sergius</hi> fact. So little rest had this <hi>Popes</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass,
being twice buried, twice taken up, twice judged, and executed
after death, and twice cast into <hi>Tyber.</hi> But saith <hi>Platina, [Popes now
seeking and getting the Popedome by liberty and ambition, disregarding
Gods Worship, exercised enmity against one another; no otherwise than do
the cruellest Tyrants, glutting their own lusts the more securely, when there
are none left to restrain Vices.</hi> This wicked Man for almost seven Years
enjoyed the fruits of his iniquity.</p>

their Heads: But they are careful, <hi>[Nequis pusillanimus ex hoc facto
scandalum accipiat,</hi> lest weak minded persons should be scandalized by
this: And they tell us as a wonderful providence of God, <hi>That so
great was the reverence to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>that even when such Men

Apostatical than Apostolical; yet those that did but hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was</hi> Pope
(<hi>especially the Northern Countries that were far off) obeyed them: so that
any Man may understand by how great a providence God Governeth the
universal Church, which when it was set on Fire at the will of Whores,
and all mischiefs and scandals did increase, and it was feared it would
be divided by a great schisme; yet God defended it from all heresy and
schisme, all Nations persisted in one bond of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Covent of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.]</hi>
Indeed Gods providence is wonderful that saveth his true
Church from such wicked usurpers; and keepeth a Union of all in Christ:
But this is no honour to the wicked usurpers; when now fifteen schismes
had divided them, and many more afterward; nor was it any honour
or blessing, to them that gave up their Kingdoms to such usurpers.
If these were no <hi>Popes,</hi> but intruding Whore-mongers; was it a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

shameless Dream do you impose on us, under the Name of, <hi>Totus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
Terrarum?</hi> What had the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> yea, or the
<hi>Greek-Church,</hi> to do with Pope <hi>Iohn?</hi> Or, What was it to them, how
he was called, or what he was? Did not the <hi>Patriark</hi> of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
then write himself, the <hi>Vniversal Patriark?</hi> (even <hi>Tryphon,</hi> that
they said, could not write any thing else.) Where is your Proof of
this Universal Concession? Which way did the <hi>whole Catholick-Church</hi>
(or the Tenth or Hundredth Part of it) signify their Consent? 2. Who
taught you to feign the State and Necessity of such a Church, as must
have another Universal Head besides <hi>Christ?</hi> You know, that it is the
Being of such a Church or Head, (be he never so Good) that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
And you have never proved, nor can prove it. He only is the
Universal Head, who maketh Universal Laws, and undertaketh Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Teaching, and is an Universal Judge and Protector; none of which
any Mortal man can perform. The very Fiction of such a Head and Body,
is Monstrous, and your Capital Error. 3. How small a part of the
Christian World was subject to the <hi>Pope,</hi> at that time; though within
his reach, he was almost at the Heighth of his Presumption? 4. He
that wanteth what is Essential to a true Bishop, is no true Bishop: But
Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the Twelfth wanted what what was Essential to a true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:

the necessary <hi>Disposition of the Receptive Matter,</hi> and is not <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
Capax,</hi> wanteth that which is Essential to a true a Bishop: (For
the <hi>Materia Disposita</hi> is an Essential Constitutive Cause; a <hi>Subjectum

Things necessary to a lawful</hi> Pope, <hi>was not</hi> Subjectum Capax; <hi>but
wanted the necessary Disposition Receptive.</hi> But all these, you say your
selves, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> wanted: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. If then the Universal Church had so erred, as to take him for a
Bishop that was none; that Error would not make him a Bishop, no
more than it would make a dead Man alive, or an illiterate Man lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But this is the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> kind of Proof: You say your
selves, That a Whore, and a wicked Son of that Whore, got Power
enough to over-top the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> (yet too
like them) and to thrust a wicked uncapable Fellow into the Chair.

When that is done, it's known, all good Men dissent and abhor it.
But when he hath Possession, they must know that he hath Possession:
And, What can they do to help it? What Power have the <hi>Ethiopians,
Armenians, Syrians,</hi> or other Nations of the Earth, in choosing the <hi>Pope</hi>
of <hi>Rome?</hi> And if they have none in Choosing him, What Power have
they to examine the Choice, and Depose him? And if they have no
Power, Why or how should they signify their Consent or Dissent? If
they leave your own Matters to your selves, What is that to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Catholick-Church?</hi> But some men think, that big Words
to the Ignorant may serve for Proof, even of a Right to Govern at the
<hi>Antipodes,</hi> and all the World.</p>

<hi>John</hi> having notice of this, catcheth the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and cutteth of the Nose

and Deacons, and all the People answered, We wonder your Holy

or <hi>Indians.</hi> The Emperor required particular Accusations: Then <hi>Peter,</hi>
a Cardinal-Presbyter, said, That he saw him Celebrate Mass, and not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.
A Bishop, and a Cardinal-Deacon said, That they saw him
Ordain a Deacon in a Stable of Horses. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and many others said,
That he Ordained Bishops for Money; and Ordained a Boy of Ten Years
old, Bishop of <hi>Tudortine.</hi> Of Sacriledge, there needed no Witness but Eye-sight:
Of Adultery, they said, that they saw it not; but they certainly
knew, that he abused the Widow of <hi>Ragnerius,</hi> and his Father's Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
and <hi>Anne,</hi> a Widow, and her Neece; and made the Holy-Palace
a common Bawdy-House, and Stews. That he put out the Eyes of his

Houses, went Armed and Harnassed as a Souldier. They all (both Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Laity) cryed out, that he <hi>Drunk a Health of Wine to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
(Diaboli in Amorem.)</hi> That he at his Play at Dice, would crave
the Help of <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and other <hi>Demons,</hi> &amp;c. The Emperor said,
That Bad Men often accuse the Good; and lest Malice or Livor should
move them, he adjured them, as before <hi>God,</hi> to speak nothing untruly against
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and without certain Proof: His Adjurations were most Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Bishops, Deacons, Clergy, and all the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
as one Man, and said, [If both the Things read by <hi>Benedict</hi> the
Deacon, and filthier and greater Villainies were not committed by Pope
<hi>John,</hi> Let not St. <hi>Peter</hi> Absolve us from the Bond of our Sins: Let us
be found tyed with the Bonds of <hi>Anathema,</hi> (or Cursed from <hi>Christ);</hi>
and be set at <hi>Christ's</hi> Left-Hand, at the Last Day, with those that said

thy Wayes. If you believe not Vs, believe your Army that saw him, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
The Emperor being satisfyed by his Armies Witness also, the Council mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that Letters of Summons might be sent to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to appear and
answer for himself. A Leteer was written, as from the Emperor and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
telling him, That the things charged on him were such, as it would
be a Shame to hear of Stage-Players; which, if all were numb'red, the
Day would fail: That not a Few, but All, (both Clergy and Laity)
accused him of Murder, Perjury, Sacriledge, and of Incest with his own
Kindred, and with two of his own Sisters. They say also, (Horrid to hear!)
That you drunk Wine in Love to the <hi>Devil;</hi> ask't Help of <hi>Jupiter, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and other <hi>Demons,</hi> at your Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We crave you would come,
and answer for your self; and swear, nothing shall be done to you besides
the Canons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> reading this, sent this Answer; [We hear, that you will make
another <hi>Pope:</hi> If you do so, I Excommunicate you from <hi>God</hi> Almighty,
that you may have no License to Ordain any, nor to Celebrate Mass.]
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60852:159"/>
After this, more Bishops came out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and they write again to the
Pope, telling him, That if he will not appear and answer, they shall despise his
Excommunications, and turn it upon himself. He would not be found. The
Emperor seeing he would not appear; told the Council, how treacherously he
had dealt by him, intreating him to come, and help him; and after broke
his Oath, and joyned with his Enemies. The whole Clergy, Bishops, and all
the People, cry out, An un-heard-of Wound must be cured with an un-heard-of
Cautery; and declaring the Mischief he had done, craveth that
this Monster of incurable Vice, might be cast out of the <hi>Roman-Church;</hi>
and another put in his Place, that will go before them with good Example.
Then they all cryed up <hi>Leo</hi> the Proto-Soriniarius; which thrice repeating,
upon Consent, they Ordained him, and swore Fidelity to him.</p>
               <p>§. 54. If now <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> say, That the Clergies Consent
can make an uncapable Monster a true Bishop, let any one tell us:
1. Whether this Council did not prove, that the Church did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to <hi>Iohn?</hi> 2. Or, Whether his utter Incapacity, many express Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and the Bishops and Councils Consent, did not Eject him, and
Authorize <hi>Leo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 55. But here we come to the Core of all the <hi>Papists</hi> Cheats:
When they tell us themselves of all this Wickedness, they cry out, <hi>O
the happy Church of</hi> Rome! <hi>that though it fail in</hi> Manners, <hi>yet never
faileth in</hi> Faith. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If General Councils are sufficient Witnesses,
that judged <hi>Popes</hi> Hereticks, it hath failed in Faith. 2. Hath that Man
true Faith, that <hi>wanteth all things requisite to a Lawful Bishop, and that
drinketh to the</hi> Devil, <hi>and prayeth to</hi> Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Venus; <hi>and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in all Wickedness?</hi> What a thing is <hi>Popish</hi> Faith? 3. Did <hi>Christ</hi>
mean to pray only, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> might have such a Faith, as will
stand with Wickedness and Damnation? What the better is any Man
of a wicked Heart and Life, for a dead Opinion call'd <hi>Faith,</hi> that will
damn him the more deeply for sinning against it? 4. It is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but that serious true Belief of so great Things, as <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi>
and <hi>Glory,</hi> will bring a Man to serious Repentance and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>§. 56. Here <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> become this Monster's Advocate,
and say, <hi>[That there never was a Council of Orthodox Men, that sinned
more against the Canons and Traditions, than this false Council.]</hi> (How
false is a Devil-worshipping-<hi>Pope,</hi> a Murderer, and common Adulterer,
and incestuous Villainies, in comparison of all his Neighbor-Bishops?)
1. They say, They could not call a Council without him. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He
was no <hi>Pope.</hi> 2. It's a Trayterous Fiction to say, That an Emperor
may not call his Subject-Bishops together, to a Council. 3. VVhat
if Devilish Villains will make Murders, and Perjury, and Rebellions,
to pass for Duties, and never call Councils; Must the <hi>Devil</hi> therefore
be made Lord of the <hi>Catholick-Church,</hi> without Remedy? 4. VVho

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60852:160"/>
it from him: If <hi>Christ,</hi> prove it, or Shame be to him that yieldeth it.
5. That Man is so ignorant of Church-History, or Impudent, as not
to be worthy to be disputed with, that denyeth, That Princes have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Councils, even the Greatest, and most Honored.</p>
               <p>II. They say, <hi>There should be Seventy-Two Witnesses; and there was
scarce one, besides the Accusers.] Answ.</hi> 1. The whole Council, and
People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Army, are VVitnesses, under the most direful
Imprecations. 2. The <hi>Pope</hi> may go on safely, till <hi>God</hi> take him in Hand,
if he must pass for Innocent till he will lye with his own Sisters, or
murder Men, and cut off their <hi>Virilia, &amp;c.</hi> before Seventy-Two VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses!
O shameful <hi>Holy-Church,</hi> that is thus Essentiated!</p>
               <p>III. They say He should have been thrice cited. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What!
When he would not be found? 2. Is that necessary to the being of the
Sentence?</p>
               <p>IV. They say, No delay was granted! <hi>Ans.</hi> He was not to be found:
And to what was <hi>delay</hi> necessary, when the <hi>Babylonians, Iberians,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
had notice of his Diabolical Life.</p>
               <p>V. They say,<note place="margin">☞</note> contrary to all Councils, the Emperour Condemneth him,

               <p>VI. They say, Execution went instead of Sentence. <hi>Ans.</hi> Is not
a plain Sentence here expressed?</p>
               <p>VII. The <hi>Pope</hi> is exempt from all humane judgment: The whole

be sure that <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> are to be believed before all their own
Writers, whose common Sentence is against them, and that <hi>Romes</hi>
Succession from <hi>Iohn</hi> is good? 2. Remember this when you plead for your

was it!</p>
               <p>§. 62. The godly Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> was offended at these Villanies, and
brought an Army again to <hi>Rome: Benedictus</hi> made them stand out a

Emperour with Tears intreated the Bishop to have mercy on the

O how much Interest prevaileth with these Historians judgments.</p>
               <p>But alas, Reader, is it not a sad thing to read how fast Bishops and
People did thus Swear and Forswear, and do and undo, making Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils

this the honour of Prelacy, and their stability in governing the

Baronius <hi>and</hi> Binius <hi>the Succession was interrupted,</hi> Leo <hi>being no Pope
whom he Succeeded. But, alas, had it not been for the great Zeal of</hi>
Otho, <hi>that came so oft with Armies to defend them, and to cast out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Popes, what had become of the Roman Papacy? This</hi> Iohn
<hi>was a Bishop before, (as</hi> Formosus <hi>was) and so by the Canons his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was Null on that account. Almost as soon as he was setled, saith</hi>
Platina, <hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>having now got a Custome of Expelling their Popes,
(yet</hi> Baron, <hi>saith, the Universal Church owned them,) did by Seditions
tire out this also.</hi> By the help of <hi>Jofred</hi> Earl of <hi>Campany,</hi> they brake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the <hi>Laterane</hi> House, and took him, and first imprison him, and then

<hi>Jofred</hi> and his only Son; and delivered Pope <hi>John</hi> the Eleventh month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Banishment: And the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> again bringeth an Army to
<hi>Rome,</hi> with speed, and casts the Governour, the Consuls, and the Dearc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houes
into Fetters; The Consuls he sendeth into <hi>Germany</hi> banished; The
Dearchoues he Hanged: <hi>Peter</hi> the Praefect of the City, some write (saith
<hi>Platina.)</hi> that he delivered to the Pope to have his flesh torn off; his Beard
and Head being Shorn, and he hanged a while at the head of the Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian-Horse,
he was set on an Asse naked, with his face backward, his
hands tyed under the taile, and so whipt through the Streets till he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Dead, and then Banished into <hi>Germany.</hi> The Corps of <hi>Jofred</hi> and
his Son he caused to be taken up, and to be vilely cast away into divers
filthy places. <hi>Thus did the blind Zeal of a good Emperour Revenge and
defend Usurping Popes.</hi>

<hi>Plat.</hi> in the beginning of his Magistracy (for a Magistracy it thus was)
by the Conspiracy of the good Citizens, being forced to leave the City, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

where he stayed, till selling all that he had sacrilegiously got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
he got a great mass of Money, with which he returned to corrupt the
Citizens by Bribes. But good men resisted him, especially <hi>John</hi> a Cardinal-Deacon,
whom <hi>Boniface</hi> catcht and put out his Eyes: And the Sedition
increasing more and more, either for fear or remorse, he next made away
(or kill'd) himself: <hi>He was Pope 7 months and 5 days saith</hi> Platinus.
<hi>But</hi> Onuphrius <hi>saith (one year, one month and 12 days.) But other Popes
came in between before he died, and he got in again.</hi>

with the Popes; If so, 1. Why not many score also? 2. Where then is
their uninterrupted Succession? And where was their Church then?</p>

in the Tower of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> which was kept by men of his own faction;
and with great Tyranny kept him there four months, and as a violent and
sacrilegious Robber, at last Murdered him by Famine. And lest any hope
should be left to the Emperours Party, he exposed the Corps of the dead
Pope (for all the Citizens to behold) before the doores of the Prison: And
the People seeing the bare body of the Pope consumed by Hunger, buried him
with Sorrow. In the mean time, the Invader of the Seat, and the cruel
Murderer of two Popes, the odious Paricide, and turbulent thief <hi>Boniface</hi>

               <p>But this is a Controversy handled by so many, that I shall refer the
Reader to them: and whether the seven Electors only, or all the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datories
chose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> maintain, that all came from the Authority of
the <hi>Pope;</hi> that <hi>Greg. 5th.</hi> Ordained the choice of the Emperour to be
by all the Feudatories of the Empire; that the Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Innocent 4th.</hi> setled it upon Seven, but not all the same that are
now Electors; and that the Princes after setled it on these same Seven,
they know not who nor when.</p>
               <p>For the right understanding of many such matters; I only mind the
Reader of this one thing, that as the contention of Princes, and the
superstitious fear of <hi>Anathematizing</hi> had made the Papal, and Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Power then very great, in setting up, and taking down Princes;
so it was usual for their Assemblies,<note place="margin">☞</note> even those called Councils, to be
mixt of Men Secular and Clergy; Kings and Princes, and Lords being
present with the Bishops, as in our Parliaments; and usually the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Princes ruled all. Therefore, to ascribe all to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:60852:163"/>
that was done in such conventions, and thence to gather their power to
dispose of Empires and Kingdoms, is meer deceit.</p>

to pardon Simoniacal Bishops and Priests, because the Cry was, that
else almost all the Churches would be destitute, and the Church ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
omitted to the subversion of the Christian Religion, and the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of all the faithful. (Where was the holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now,
and its Succession, if the Canons for nullifying Simoniacal ordinations
hold good?)</p>
               <p>§ 115. CCCXXX. The Pope resolved to go to <hi>France,</hi> and Preside
in a Council, which he did, at <hi>Rhemes:</hi> But many Nobles and Bishops told
the King that it was an usurpation and a Novelty and would enslave his
Kingdom: The King forbad him, yet the Pope came whether the King
would or not; And the King went away about his military affairs, and
some Bishops with him, and others stayed.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and others were accused of heinous
Crimes: The Bishop of <hi>Laugres</hi> was charged with <q>
                     <hi>[entring by Simoniacal</hi>
heresies, selling orders, bearing Armes, Murder, Adultery, Tyranny to
his Clergy, and Sodomy: Many witnesses testified all this: One Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
witnessed, that while he was yet a Lay-man this Bishop violently
took his Wife from him, and when he had committed adultery with her,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60852:167"/>
he made her a Nun.] A Presbyter witnessed that this Bishop took
him and delivered him to his followers, who tormenting him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
torments, which is more wicked, did with sharp nails pierce his
generals, and by such violence forced him to give them ten pounds
of denaries: The Bishop hearing these accusations desired time and
Council, and going to the Arch-Bishops of <hi>Besanzon,</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
his secrets to them and desireth them to plead his cause. But
the man involved in the guilt of such villanies (who but the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had been the accuser of a faulty Brother, and seeing the mote in
anothers eye, had not seen the beam in his own, but moved for
the other mans damnation being himself deservedly to be condemned,)
was not only unable to excuse himself from the objected crimes, but
also the tongue of his advocate (the Arch-Bishop) was by God so si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
that he was not able to speak a word for his defence. For
the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Besanzon</hi> where he prepared himself to plead for
him and excuse his crimes, suddenly found himself disabled in his voice
by God. And when the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Besanzon</hi> found himself so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by miracles, he gave sings to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Lyons</hi> to speak
for this his Brother in his stead; who rising up said that the accused
Bishop doth confess that he sold Orders, and that he extorted the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from the said Priest, but that he did not do the tormenting acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
mentioned by him; other things he denyed, but before the next
day he fled from the Council. And another Bishop (of <hi>Nevers)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that his Parents bought his Place, and deposed himself: and
some other Bishops confessed Simoniacal entrance. The Pope excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
many that fled from the Council. He renewed some old
neglected Canons,<note place="margin">lindx;</note> as 1. <hi>That no man be promoted to Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

What a case was the Church in when Popery grew ripe? <hi>Pet. Damian.</hi>
mentioneth six Bishops deposed by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> for divers crimes.</p>
               <p>§ 10. By the way it is worthy enquiry whether <hi>Hildebrand</hi> being
neither Bishop, Priest, nor Deacon, but a sub-Deacon only, was any of
the Clergy or Church-Pastors to whom Christ gave the power of the
Keys (Yea,<note place="margin">lindx;</note> if he had been a Deacon.) And therefore whether he had
any power from Christ to preside before Arch-Bishops and Bishops in
in Councils, and to depose and excommunicate Bishops. If it be said that
he did it by the Pope's commission, the question recurreth, whether
God ever gave Pope or Prelate power to make new Church-officers
whom he never instituted <hi>de specie,</hi> that should have the power of the
Keys, yea, and be above the Bishops of the Church? And whether Popes
or Prelates may commit preaching or Sacraments to Lay-men? if not,
how can they commit the Keys of Church-Government to them, or to
any as little authorized by Christ? Indeed baptizing is but using the Key
of Church-entrance; And therefore he that may so let men into the
Church may baptize them (which Papists unhappily allow the Laity.)
And if <hi>per se</hi> or <hi>per alium</hi> will salve all, whether Priests may not preach,
pray, and give Sacraments by Lay-men: And so Lay-men at last put down
both Prelates and Priests as needless?</p>
               <p>§ 11. CCCXXXIX. <hi>An.</hi> 1055. They say that this great Subdeacon
<hi>Hildebrand</hi> (the grand advancer of the Roman Kingdom) did call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

it be true I know not.)</p>
               <p>§ 12. To this Council the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> sent his Agents to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the great, King of <hi>Castile,</hi> refused subjection to the
Emperor, and claimed some such title to himself, and (now ignorance, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
and interest having made the Clergy the Rulers of Kings and
Kingdoms) the Emperor desireth that King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> may be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unless he will submit and surcease, and all the Kingdom of
<hi>Spain</hi> be interdicted (or forbidden Gods worship.)<note place="margin">lindx;</note> The Prelates perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how they were set up by this motion, and made Kings of Kings, and
they thought the Emperor's motion reasonable, and without hearing
King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> made themselves judges and sent him word that he must
submit and obey or be excommunicated and bear the interdict. The King
took time to answer, and calling his own Bishops together found them
of the same mind and spirit, and so was forced to promise submission.
This <hi>Baronius, an.</hi> 1055. writes <hi>ex Io. Mariano;</hi> and <hi>Binnius p.</hi> 1126.</p>
               <p>§ 13. CCCXL. They say that the Emperor dying, left his Son <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
but five years old, and knew no better way to secure his succession
than to desire Pope <hi>Victor</hi> to take the care of it: who therefore called

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60852:169"/>
reformation, forbidding (alas! how oft) Bishops to sell orders,
and other acts of Simony, and Priests using their wives, and the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Incest and perjury of Bishops and Priests; bidding them that are
such, repent, and forbidding communion with men called hereticks.</p>
               <p>§ 15. CCCXLII. Though Adultery, Incest, Perjury and Simony of
Bishops was so hardly restrained, it seems they would pay for it by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition;<note place="margin">rindx;</note>
for a Council at <hi>Compostella</hi> decreed (saith <hi>Baron. ad an.
1056.)</hi> that 1. All Bishops and Priests should say Mass every day. 2.
That at fasts and Litanies (which were perambulations in penitence) they
should be cloathed in sackcloth.</p>
               <p>§ 16. <hi>Stephen</hi> the 9th. alias 10th. is next made Pope: In his time
saith <hi>Platina</hi> the Church of <hi>Milan</hi> was reconciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> that had
withdrawn itself from it two hundred years. Was all the world then
subject to the Pope when his Italian neighbours were not?</p>
               <p>§ 17. This Pope lived after his entrance but 6 or 7 months, and
they say made them promise him to choose none in his place till <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi>
came home to counsel them: (A great Subdeacon that <hi>Rome</hi> must
be ruled by.) But in the mean time the new Emperor being but five or
six years old, the great men of <hi>Italy</hi> turned to the old game and brought
in one by strength <hi>(Mincius)</hi> whom they called <hi>Benedict</hi> the 10th. <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
9th. a Bishop; he reigned 9 months, 20 dayes. But when <hi>Hildebrand</hi>
came home he got him cast out. This was the twenty first schism in the
Papacie.</p>
               <p>§ 18. <hi>Hildebrand</hi>'s crafty counsel was to send to the Emperor to
consent to <hi>Gerard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Florence</hi> whom they chose in <hi>Italy</hi> and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Nicholas</hi> the 2d.<note place="margin">An. 1059.</note> Lest <hi>Benedict</hi> should get the Emperor on his side;
and so <hi>Nicholas</hi> made <hi>Benedict</hi> renounce and banished him: But how shall
we be sure which was the true Pope?</p>
               <p>§ 19. This Pope's first epistle is to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
him to admonish the King of <hi>France</hi> for resisting the Pope.</p>

               </p>
               <p>§ 21. CCCXLIV. <hi>An.</hi> 1059. A Council of 113 Bishops at <hi>Rome,</hi>
they say, made <hi>Berengarius</hi> recant, but not repent; but as soon as he
came home he wrote against them and their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>§ 22. <hi>In this Council, saith</hi> Platina, <hi>the Pope made a decree very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Church of</hi> Rome. Bin. <hi>saith these were the words (translated)</hi>
                  <q>[p. 1666. First, God being the Inspector it is decreed that the election of the
Roman Bishop be in the power of the Cardinal Bishops: so that if any one be
inthroned in the Apostolick seat, without the foregoing concordant and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
election of them, and after the consent of the following religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Clerks and Laity,<note n="(*)" place="margin">But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent also was put in.</note> he be not accounted Apostolical but Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is much to be noted, 1. That this is a new foundation of the
Papacy (by <hi>Hildebrand</hi>'s Council) without which it was falling to utter
confusion. How then doth the Roman sect cry down Innovation and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60852:169"/>
boast of Antiquity? 2. Either the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be chosen as
the Bishop of that particular Church, and then the members of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church should choose him,<note place="margin">lindx;</note> or else as the Bishop of the universal
Church (pretendedly) and then the universal Church should choose him.
But the Cardinal Bishops of other particular Churches are neither the
particular Roman Church, nor the universal, nor their delegates: and
so have no just pretence of power.</p>
               <p>3. Either this decree was new, or old and in force before: If new,
their Church foundation is new and mutable, as is said: If old, all the
Popes that were otherwise chosen were no Popes.</p>
               <p>4. And if it be but necessary for the future, all that after were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
chosen were no Popes.</p>
               <p>5. If several wayes and parties or powers making Popes may all make
them true Popes, then who knoweth which and how many of those
there are and which is the true Pope if ten were made at once ten seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wayes?</p>
               <p>6. This confesseth that Christ hath appointed no way for choosing
Popes, nor given any sort of men power to choose them: else what
need Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> begin it now anew? And if so, it seemeth that Christ
never instituted the Papacy: For can we suppose him so Laxe a Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
as to say, a Pope shall be made, and never tell us who shall have
power to do it. Then <hi>England</hi> may choose one, and <hi>France</hi> another, and
<hi>Spain</hi> another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Bishops one, the Priests another, the Prince another,
and the Citizens another. But if Christ have setled a Pope-making power in
any, it is either the same as Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> did, in Cardinal Bishops, or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If not, the Pope changeth Christ's institution: If yea, then all those
were no Popes that were otherwise chosen, and so where is the Roman
Church and its succession.</p>
               <p>7. What power hath Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> to bind his successors? Have not
they as much power as he? and so to undo it all again? If the King
should decree that his Kingdom hereafter shall not be hereditary but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,
and that the Bishops should be the choosers of the King, were
this obligatory against the right of his heirs?</p>
               <p>8. By this decree, if the Laity and Clerks consent not after, he is
still no Pope.</p>
               <p>§ 23. In this same Council (saith <hi>Bin.</hi> ibid.) it was decreed <q>
                     <hi>[that

chose one that was great with him, <hi>Anselm</hi> Bishop of <hi>Luca:</hi> but the

him, and chose <hi>Cadolus Palavicinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Parma,</hi> called <hi>Honorius</hi>
the 2d.<note place="margin">rindx;</note> The Sword was to determinate who was the true Pope: <hi>Cadolus</hi>
came with an Army to <hi>Rome;</hi> the Romans, came out against him, and in

many of both sides f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll,</hi> but <hi>Cadolus</hi> was driven away. He shortly returned
with a great Army being called by a part of the Romans, that were
men of pleasure, and by force seized on the Suburbs and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Church: But the Souldiers of <hi>Gotifred</hi> put his Souldiers to flight; and he
himself narrowly scaped, the Prefect of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Son with him breaking
through the Romans got possession of the Tower, where they besieged
him till they forced him to yield, and buy his liberty of the besiegers for
300 pound of Silver. Then the Bishop of <hi>Colen</hi> having the education of
the young Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to rebuke <hi>Alexander</hi> as an Usurper,
but by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was so overcome (that the choice belonged not to
the Emperor) that he called a Council which confirmed <hi>Alexander</hi> and
deposed <hi>Honorius.</hi> The Emperor consented on condition that <hi>Cadolus</hi> be
pardoned, and <hi>Gibert</hi> (his promoter, Chancellor of <hi>Parma)</hi> made Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which the Pope consented to and did. Thus then
were Popes and Bishops made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How shall we be sure, for <hi>Cadolus</hi>'s five years, who was the Pope?</p>
               <p>§ 26. A woman called <hi>Mathildis</hi> a Countess was then the great Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Papacy, who furnished military <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (that did all) with
Souldiers to conquer several Great Men that opposed them, and to set
up <hi>Alexander</hi> and defend him.</p>

that he might fight for it and possess it. Thus did this Prelate give
Crowns and Kingdoms, as the supreme judge (made by himself.)</p>
               <p>He after required Rent <hi>(Peter-Pence)</hi> from <hi>England</hi> of <hi>William.</hi>

               <p>§ 28. He made some constitutions for his old Church at <hi>Milan.</hi>
Three thing are the summe of them and many other Councils. 1. Against
Simonie. 2. Against the Clergies fornication (no Canons cured them
of either of these.) 3. That no Lay-Man judge any Clerk for his crimes:
only if Priests live in fornication he alloweth Lay-Men to tell the Arch-Bishops,
and if they will do nothing, then to withhold their duties and
benefits till they amend. (But this <hi>Binnius</hi> noteth was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
extraordinary concession, for the hatred that this Pope had to
fornicating Clergy-Men.) But if they did but now and then lie with a
woman by chance, and did not obstinately still keep them, they must
not so trouble them.</p>

ought I find in the most probable History not guilty of the gross immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
or sensuality of many of his predecessors; but it's like blinded with
the opinion which the Papists Fifth-monarchy men have received (and

on earth consisteth in the Saints judging the world, that is, the Pope

greatest animosity set himself to execute his opinions. And withal, the
factions of <hi>Rome</hi> and tyranny of their petty Princes and Whores and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Citizens, having long made the Papacy the scorn of the world
and the lamentation of all sober Christians, constrained the better part
to beg help from the Emperors against debauched monstrous Popes and
their upholders: And by this means sometimes the choice fell into the
Emperors hands, and sometimes when they were far off, the City-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing-part
rebelled, and chose without them, or pulled down them
that the Emperors set up: And then the Emperors came and pulled
down the Anti-Popes, and chastised the City faction; and thus between
the <hi>Italian</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> powers the City was a field of war,<note place="margin">☞</note> and
the richer by bribes, and the stronger by the sword, how monstrous
villanies soever were set up. It was no wonder then if <hi>Hildebrand</hi> first
by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 2. and <hi>Alexander</hi> and then by himself did resolve to
run a desperate hazard, when he had two such great works at once to
do, as first to recover the debauched and shattered shamed Papacy from
this confusion, and then to <hi>subdue all Kings and Kingdoms</hi> within their
reach to such a <hi>Priest-King</hi> as was then under so great disgrace. And <hi>tibi
dabo claves</hi> must do all this.</p>
               <p>§ 43. <hi>Hildebrand</hi> however had the wit to settle himself at first by
seeking the Emperor's consent: And being settled he got <hi>Agnes</hi> the
Emperor's mother and Guardian mostly on his side. He then began to
claim <hi>presentations and investitures</hi> and to take the power over the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops
out of the Emperor's hands, and to threaten him as Simoniacal, and
for <hi>communicating with the excommunicate.</hi> The Emperor after some
treaty submitted, and was reconciled to the Pope; but the Pope said
<hi>he did not amend.</hi> The Pope calls a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
Simoniacks, openly saying that he would excommunicate the
Emperor unless he amended. <hi>Guibert</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> being there
accuseth the Pope for such threats against the Emperor, and got <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
the Prefect's Son to apprehend him <hi>and imprison him.</hi> The People

               <p>The Emperor wrote Letters to many Christian Princes and States to
acquaint them with the Papal Injuries; and the Pope wrote his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Emperor and his own Justification. The Empire was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all in Division. One part was for the Emperor, and another for the
Pope: Most of the Bishops of <hi>Germany</hi> obeyed the Emperor, and some
were against him, as excommunicate. Some Councils were for him, and
some against him. And, as <hi>Abbas Vrspurgensis</hi> said, they did so often
swear and forswear according as Power and Interest moved, one time for
the Emperor, and another against him, that Perjury was become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

the Pope forgiveness, if the Pope would come into <hi>Germany.</hi> The Pope

barefoot to confess his fault and ask forgiveness of the Pope. The Pope
would not suffer him to come in; He patiently stayed three daies in the

Compassion; At last the woman <hi>Mathildis,</hi> and <hi>Adelai</hi> a <hi>Savoy</hi> Earl;

               <p>I give you the words of <hi>Platina</hi> all along. And now whether <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi>
or <hi>Henry</hi> was the better man in common morals, I that knew
them not, must refer you to the Historians of that age, of whom some
extol the Pope and depreciate the Emperor, and others honour the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and deeply accuse the Pope; But if an Emperor that travelled so
far in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

waited three daies patiently in the Suburbs of a womans City barefoot
in a great frost, begging mercy and pardon of a Priest before he could
be let in, and after this sware obedience to him, I say, If this Prince did
not yet sufficiently submit, but deserve to be turned out of his Empire,
though at the cost of blood and desolation to the innocent Countries,<note place="margin">☞</note> it
will be hard to know when the Obedience and Submission of Kings is
enough to satisfie an ambitious Prelate.</p>
               <p>But the Popes Historians say that the Emperor brake his Covenant. It
is a hard thing for a King that promiseth Subjection and Obedience to a
Pope to be sure to keep his word, unless he foreknew what would be
commanded him: when he hath taken away his Power and Kingdom by
parts, he may command his life. It's a great doubt to me, when God
hath made Princes the Rulers of Prelates, and Procurators of his Church;
whether it be not a sin against God and their undertaken office, for these
Princes to cast off this trust and work, because a Pope or Prelate claimeth
it. The Pope still charged him with sacriledge. But I doubt he expounded
his meaning when he <hi>deposed him for diminishing the Majesty of the
Church,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed in the History: In the 3d. or 4th. battle it was that <hi>Rodulph</hi>
was slain; and It was the Popes denial to disown or excommunicate <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulph</hi>
after so low a submission of the Emperor, that enraged <hi>Henry,</hi> and
made him think of another remedy than to be a Prelates slave. The
Pope called all the Bishops that cleaved to the Emperor <hi>seditious:</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
<hi>Roland</hi> the German Legate and sendeth into <hi>Germany</hi> Legates

               <p>These are put by <hi>Bin.</hi> among <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Epistles, <hi>p.</hi> 1196. as the Popes
Dictates. If I had not translated them from such an unquestioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
that followeth <hi>Baronius,</hi> some would have thought they had been
but the forgeries of some Protestant accuser, and that the Popes have no
such tenents. What one is here that is not false? and how many of them
are horridly arrogant? The reading of them would tempt a doubting
man to think that the Pope is the Eldest Son of the Prince of Pride, exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself above all that is called God, and arrogating Christ's preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and therefore Antichrist. If any would know what Popery is; A great
part of the description is here given you by their greatest Pope himself,
and by their chief Historians.</p>
               <p>§ 45. Much of his 4th Book of Epistles is to require Princes, Prelates,
and People to forsake the Emperor and choose another, and to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all that will communicate with him: yet in his 11th. <hi>Epist.</hi>
he reciteth himself, how lamentably with tears, three dayes in
the frost barefoot, he begged for pardon, and how the compassionate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thought the Pope hard-hearted and tyrannical for not yielding; and
that at last two Ladyes and an Abbot overcame him to absolve him.</p>
               <p>§ 46. <hi>Lib. 4. Epist.</hi> 28. He tells the <hi>Spaniards</hi> also that their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

claim to particular Kingdoms? Would not his claim to all the world
serve turn for the particulars?</p>

               </p>
               <p>§ 47. <hi>That it may appear that the presumptuous usurpations of the
Pope were not consented to by many Bishops, he oft complaineth that
many Bishops of</hi> France, Italy, <hi>and</hi> Germany <hi>were against him: He
abundantly chideth and threatneth several particular Bishops for resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and disobeying him.</hi> Lib. 6. Epist. 4. <hi>he writeth thus to the Bishop
of</hi> Liege. <q>[Having read the Letters of your Brotherhood, we did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
wonder that you wrote that which became you not, in reverence of the
Apostolick seat: but that you did with biting invective reprehend me, for
absolving your Parishioner, that lately came to us; as if the Apostolick seat
had not authority to bind and absolve whomsoever we will and wheresoever

               </p>
               <p>Indeed one of the tricks of the Papal ambition was to be the Asylum
of all wicked fugitives that fled from Church justice in all Countries
near them; to shew favour to all condemned sinners that would but fly
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and appeal to them from the Justice of their Pastors, yea,
and of their Princes too, which made their friends to be rather many than
good.</p>

to be sure of success he lets him know, (how truly I know not) that

but (this righteous ruling Pope) denied leave to them all, till he
had tryed whether he would obey him, which if he would do, he would
not only deny them leave to invade him, but also protect him. Reader,
think here. 1. Whether Princes held not their kingdoms loosely when
they where to lose them if they obeyed not the Pope in so small a thing
as the shaving of a Priests Beard. 2. Whether it were not a hard thing for
the Catholick Church then to have concord, when so small a difference
as the <hi>shaving</hi> or <hi>not shaving</hi> of Beards were put into their terms of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

imposers of such laws and terms? 3. Is it not a high power that is claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Popes, when no Priest in all the Christian world may have so
much as his Beard in his own power, in which nature hath given him a
propriety? How much more might the Pope then command all mens
<hi>purses?</hi> 4. May way we not see here on what weighty reasons, these
men condemn God's word of insufficiency, and plead for traditions, and
a necessity of their additional Laws? When Scripture hath left out the
shaving of mens Beards, and we had never had such a Law, if such power
as the Papal had not made it? O what discord and disorder would there
be in the Church if we had not so necessary a government! and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
would toleration introduce, if mens Beards were left at liberty!
But if <hi>Paul</hi> called the heathen Phylosophy <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>[Science falsly so

calling them off from their great concernes, may we not say then that
this is <hi>vain Government and Order falsly so named,</hi> which thus calleth the
Church from its primitive purity, simplicity and unity, when Christians
were known by loving one another, to these childish games, that the
Prelates and Priests of the Catholick Church must be known by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without Beards? One would suspect this had its original from Pope
<hi>Ioane,</hi> if there were indeed such a person; and that it is a Symbol of the
Churches sex, as it is called <hi>Our Mother;</hi> or at least that <hi>Marozia</hi> or
<hi>Theodora</hi> instituted it. 5. And do you know which were the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
for silencing and persecuting the preachers of the Gospel? The
<hi>Iews</hi> that did it because they thought it took down Gods Law, and would
bring the Roman Power on them; Or the Roman heathens that thought
the Gospel destroyed the worship of their forefathers Gods; or the Roman
Papists, that silenced and persecuted men for wearing Beards? 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 16.</p>

               <p>§ 57. <hi>When the Pope sentenced the Emperor</hi> Henry <hi>to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
and deposed, and was charged to have done this without authority,
he wrote his</hi> 21 Epist. l. 8. <hi>to the Bishop of</hi> Metz <hi>to prove that he had
power to do it; and to absolve his Subjects from their Oaths of fidelity;
saying, that the</hi> Scriptures were full of certain documents <hi>to prove it. And
his certain documents are</hi> Tibi dabo Claves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Feed my Sheep; And
Kings are not excepted. They are <hi>St.</hi> Peter'<hi>s</hi> Sheep. <hi>Bin. p. 1262. he saith,
that</hi> the Head of Priests is at the right hand of God; but who knoweth not
that Kings and Dukes had their beginning from them that knew not God,
and affected by blind lust and intolerable presumption to domineer over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Devil the Prince of the world acting them, in Pride, Rapines,
Perfidiousness, Murders and all wickedness? who while they would have the
Priests of the LORD to stoop to their footsteps, are rightlyest compared to
him who is head of all the Sons of pride, who said even to Christ, All this will
I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Who doubteth but that the
Priests of Christ are the Fathers and Masters of Kings and Princes, and of
all the faithful? And is it not notorious miserable madness for a Scholar to
endeavour to subjugate his Master, and a Son his Father, and by wrongful
obligations to subject him to his power, by whom he believeth that he may be
bound or loosed both in Earth and Heaven? Did not Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperor? and Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> depose from his Kingdom
the King of <hi>France,</hi> not so much for his iniquities, as because he was not meet
for so great power; placed <hi>Pepin</hi> in his stead, and absolved all the French
from the Oath of fidelity? <hi>Ambrose</hi> sheweth that Gold is not so much more
pretious than Lead, as the Priestly Dignity is higher than the Kingly Power.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 1263. Yea even the exorcists have power over Devils: How much more
over those that are Subject to the Devils, and are his members? And if the
exorcist excel so much, how much more the Priests? And every King when he
cometh to his end, doth humbly and pitifully beg the Priests help, that he may
scape the prison of Hell, and Darkness, and at the judgment of God be found
absolved. But is there either Priest or Lay-man that when he is dying begs
help of the King for the saving of his soul? What King or Emperor can by his
Office, take a soul by baptism from the power of the Devil, and number him
with the Sons of God, and fortifie him with holy Chrism? And (which is the
greatest thing in the Christian Religion) can with his own mouth make Christs
body and blood? Or which of them can bind and loose in Heaven and earth? By
all which it may be plainly gathered by how great power the sacerdot al digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
excelleth. Which of them can ordain one Clerk in the holy Church? How
much less can they depose him for any fault? For in orders exclesiastical, to
depose is an act of greater power than to ordain: For Bishops may ordain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
but in no wise depose them without the authority of the Apostolick seat:
Who then that hath any knowledg can doubt but that Priests are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60852:176"/>
Kings? In a word, we must know that all good Christians are more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Kings than evil Princes: For these by seeking the Glory of God do strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
rule themselves: But the other seeking their own, and being enemies to
themselves do tyrannically oppress others: These (good Christians) are the body
of Christ. The other (bad Princes) are the body of the Devil. These so rule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as that they shall reign eternally with the highest Emperor. But the
power of the other brings them eternally to perish by eternal damnation, with
the Prince of darkness, who is King over all the Sons of Pride. And it is not
to be wondered at that<note n="(*)" place="margin">And are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates so bad too that rule the Church?</note> bad Prelates consent to an unrighteous King, whom
for their ill got preferments by him, they love and fear, who Simoniacally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
any, do for a base price sell even God himself. For as the elect are insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
united to their head, so the reprobate are pertinaciously confederate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the good with him that is head of their militia.<note n="(*)" place="margin">Was it a mark of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pope?</note> Let Emperors and
Kings see then how much the Imperial and Kingly dignity is to be feared, in
which very few are saved<note n="b" place="margin">And are there more Popes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</note> and those that by Gods mercy come to salvation
are not made so good (or eminent) as many of the poor, the Spirit of God being
judge: For from the beginning of the world to these times of ours, we find not
in all the authentick Scripture any Emperors or Kings whose lives were so ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with great<note n="c" place="margin">How few Popes ever wrought miracles?</note> virtue and miracles, as were an innumerable multitude of
the contemners of the World; though I believe that by Gods mercy many of them
have been saved: For to say nothing of the Apostles and Martyrs, what Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or King, was ever famous for miracles, like <hi>Martin, Anthony,</hi> or <hi>Benedict?</hi>
what Emperor or King did raise the dead? cleanse the Lepers? illuminate the
Blind? <hi>Constantine</hi> of pious memory, <hi>Theodosius, Honorius, Charles, Lewis,</hi>
propagators of Christian Religion, defenders of the Church, are praised and
honoured by the Church, but not noted to have shined with such glory of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
Moreover to what Kings or Emperors names<note n="d" place="margin">It's worth the enquiry what is the reason that we have no holy days, Churches, or Masses named for the honor of Kings save a few of late that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Pope.</note> are Churches or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
dedicated? or hath the Holy Church appointed Masses to be celebrated?
Let Kings and other Princes fear lest by how much in this life they would be
preferred before other men, by so much the more liable they be to eternal bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
As it is written: Wisd. c. 6. Great men shall be greatly tormented.
For they have as many men to be accountable for, as were Subject to them.
(<note n="*" place="margin">Ah poor Pope then! that must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for all the world or Church, even for those at the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they sometime cry <hi>Meâ Culpâ</hi> for killing many, yet are glad at the heart for
the extension of their honour, and are not sorry that they did what is done, nor
that they have driven their Brethren into Hell.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Epistle exhorteth Kings to avoid Pride and Tyranny: As
I cite it historically to shew you the Spirit of Papacy, so <hi>fas est et ab hoste
doceri.</hi> There is somewhat in it <hi>worthy</hi> the remembering, that greatness
prove not pernicious to themselves and others, for want of goodness.</p>
               <p>§ 58. But sure these Papal arguments savour not of infallibility:
May not a mean wit discern, 1. That goodness giveth not right to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60852:177"/>
of Government without a call, else the best man must be always
King: And then what Pope had Title to his Seat? Right to Heaven, will
not prove a right to Kingdoms: Nor, <hi>è contra,</hi> Power to cast out Devils
will not prove that the exorcist may cast out the King,<note place="margin">But you use to say that Kings are not for souls but for the body.</note> nor give him Laws.
2. What though the King be a Scholar to a Grammarian, a Musician, a
Physician? Is it therefore absurd that he be King over these Masters? What
though he must obey his <hi>Physician</hi> for his life? May he not command
that Physician for the common peace? What though he cannot do that
which a Physician, a Musician <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can do? May he not rule them for all
that? 3. What a discontented mind have such holy Prelates, that cannot
be satisfied with their Title to Heaven, their Miracles, Sanctity, Church-Keys
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> unless they may also be above Kings, and have the secular
power also? 4. And what cause have Kings and States to look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that are under such Priests, where every Clergy man is their
Master? And how many superiors then hath every Popish King? Even
as many as he hath Prelates, Priests or exorcists. Yet I will confess that
if Princes had been as bad still as some of them have been, and as such
Popes pretended; and Popes and Prelates, and Priests had been as <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Holy, Wise</hi> and <hi>Peaceable as they have pretended,</hi> and had not proved
the shame of Religion and Incendiaries of the Christian World, in so
many generations, it would have tempted men strongly for the interest of
Religion and mankind, to wish that all power had been committed to the
Clergy, and that <hi>Campanella</hi>'s <hi>Regnum Dei,</hi> or <hi>Fift-Monarchy,</hi> by <hi>Priestly
Government</hi> of the World, had taken place. But when their own histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
make fourty Popes together Monsters of wickedness, and piety at
the same time to be translated to the Princes, this turneth our thoughts
another way: Especially when we find still that a proud, worldly, wicked
Clergy, are the great confounders of the World.</p>

               <p>Ep. 1. Append. (Bin. p. 1278) <hi>he tells</hi> Lanfrank <hi>Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury,
<hi>how far the Church was from purity in his days;</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> [The <hi>Bishops

Glory of the World, <hi>and the</hi> pleasures of the flesh. And do not only themselves
confound all things that are holy and religious, but by their example draw their
Subjects to all wickedness; And that to let them alone is unlawful, and to resist
them how difficult!</p>

Wives: The Arch-Bishop of</hi> Mentz <hi>trying to do the same in</hi> Germany,
<hi>the</hi> whole party of the Clergy <hi>(saith</hi> Lambert, an. 1074) <hi>raged against it, and
called the Pope a</hi> downright <hi>Heretick</hi> that opposed Christs Law, who <hi>forbad

two Heresies: The first was the Royalist Heresie of Loyalty, called the <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians,</hi>
from <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, who thought that the Pope and Prelates had
not authority to depose Kings and Emperors, but were to be Subjects to them.
An Heresie, if such, that most Kings are very much inclined to, as taught them
by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. and by St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself. You see, O Princes, if you
will be the Popes and Prelates Executioners, that you must come at last to the
Stake your selves, and fall under the Law <hi>de Hereticis comburendis,</hi> unless you
will be Servants your selves, or trust to some peculiar chalibeate remedies.</p>
               <p>The great argument of the Pope was <hi>[The Disciple is not above his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
One <hi>Gunibert</hi> undertook to prove, <hi>That the Pope had no such power, but
what he had usurped, and taken to himself, but might be judged.</hi> But the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Argument struck all dead. But might not these Prelates have understood,
1. That the Pope himself may have a Master in Philosophy, Physick, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
And is he not for all that, <hi>Above his Master?</hi> 2. Is the King above no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that teacheth him in any Art or Science? 3. Are not Christ's words plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be understood, of <hi>Superiority</hi> and <hi>Inferiority in eodem genere?</hi> The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
as such is not above his Master; but as a King he may: or else Princes
give up their Kingdoms to every Schoolmaster that they choose. 4. This
Doctrine sets not only Popes and Prelates, but every <hi>teaching Priest</hi> or <hi>Preacher</hi>
above the King; for <hi>to such</hi> the King may be a <hi>Disciple.</hi> 5. This tendeth
therefore to tempt Princes to be utterly ignorant and brutish;<note place="margin">☜</note> for fear lest by
learning any thing of any Master, they should give away their Kingdoms.
And if Children be Kings by inheritance, what a snare is here laid to undo
them? 6. Doth not the Holy Ghost say, <hi>Let every Soul be subject;</hi> and were
not <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apostles some of these Souls? Did not Christ himself and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
pay Tribute?</p>
               <p>But remember again you that are Subjects to such Councils and Prelates,
that it is by them judged <hi>Heresie</hi> to be <hi>Loyal,</hi> and to plead for the Clergies
subjection to Kings.</p>
               <p>§ 88. The <hi>Heresie</hi> of <hi>Wecilo</hi> was here also condemned, that said (as they
report him) <hi>That when the secular Men were spoiled of their Estates and Goods,</hi>
(it's like by the Ecclesiasticks) <hi>they were not bound to obey the Ecclesiasticks,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60852:180"/>

decreed,<note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>[That whoever was Excommunicate by his Bishop, that Bishop not
being himself Excommunicate, or deprived of his Office, though it were unjustly
done, should by no means be received to Communion (by any other) unless ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in the Ecclesiastical manner.]</hi> And so God must be disobeyed, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the Faithful to worship him in Sacramental Communion, whenever
any proud, malicious or drunken Prelate will forbid him: And must so live and
die, unless his Masters will repent of their injuries. When as it is usual for
one injury to engage a Man to more, or to continue it, for the justification of
the first.</p>

called by the Emperor at <hi>Mentz,</hi> where the deposition of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the
substitution of <hi>Clement</hi> (whose Legates were present) was confirmed, and
the Condemners again condemned.</p>
               <p>And so we have done with the <hi>Life, Letters and Councils of Hildebrand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 91. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> dying, <hi>Clement</hi> alone was Pope one year, and then the
<hi>Italians</hi> chose <hi>Desiderius</hi> an Abbot, called <hi>Victor</hi> the 3d. This was the 23d
Schism, or two Popes at once. <hi>Victor</hi> lived but a year and three months, and
24 days. Historians tell us of Famines, and dreadful Prodigies in those days.
In that little time he raised an Army which beat the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi>

               <p>§ 92. CCCLXXII. A Council at <hi>Capua</hi> chose this <hi>Victor, An.</hi> 1087. and
when he was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> they found Pope <hi>Clement</hi> in possession, and
keeping it by Arms: but when they had fought, <hi>Victor</hi>'s Soldiers proved
Victors, and his Title to be best.</p>
               <p>§ 93. <hi>CCCLXXIII.</hi> Victor <hi>had a Council at</hi> Benevent, <hi>where he damned
Pope</hi> Clement <hi>and his Bishops,</hi> An. 1087. <hi>The grand Controversie of those
times of the Pope against the Emperor and other Princes was, about Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Bishopricks, or Investitures, which the Pope said, belonged to no Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
Victor'<hi>s Council again judged such Presentations or Collation of Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks
to be Sacriledge, and such Simoniacs that used them: And here it's
worth the noting that they decree,</hi> (Bin. p. 1293.) That Penance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
may be received from none but a Catholick: And if no Catholick Priest
be there, it is righter to persist without visible Communion, and to communicate
invisibly with the Lord, than by taking it from a Heretick to be separated from
God. For there is no Communion of Christ and <hi>Belial;</hi> nor of a Believer with
an Infidel: But every Heretick is an Infidel: And a Simoniac because an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
is an Infidel: For though Catholicks because of the Hereticks being over them,
cannot have visible and corporal Communion, yet while in mind they are joined to
Christ, they invisibly receive his Communion.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:60852:180"/>
Let it be here noted, 1. That this Council confesseth that the Sacrament
and visible Communion is not of necessity to salvation: And why not the
same of visible Baptism,<note place="margin">☜</note> when it cannot be had on lawful terms? 2. That
therefore it is no sinful Separation to refuse such Church-Communion as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had on lawful terms, or but from Hereticks, Simoniacs, or Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
3. That this sheweth that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath their Succession

can overcome the dead. No wonder if the Church and Nations be confounded
by you, that cannot let each others Carkasses rest in their Graves; but will
dig up the bones of the Prelates of many Kingdoms, even the greatest part.
How many Princes and Prelates now Papists, are guilty of the <hi>Henrician He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie?</hi>
Should not their bones also be burnt if you durst?</p>

Anti-Popes by the Emperor's party; but all of them one after another over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Army, which he frequently had on foot. In his time <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the
Cities about, were won by <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> his Brother-<hi>Baldwin, Boemund,

up the Emperor's Son <hi>Henry</hi> against his own Father,<note place="margin">☜</note> as excommunicate and
deposed; who being chosen in his stead by the Papal Faction, overcame him,

know not) at <hi>Liege.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 115. Yet was the Pope deceived of his hopes: For this <hi>Henry</hi> also was
of the <hi>Henrician Heresie,</hi> and having by the Pope's order kept his Fathers
Corps five years unburied, because Excommunicate, he came with an Army
after to <hi>Rome</hi> to be crowned Emperor, and getting into the City, (the Pope's
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:60852:182"/>
Historians say by perfidiousness, and others lay the perfidiousness on the Pope)
he took the Pope and Cardinals (that were for him) Prisoners, for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to confirm the Bishops which the Emperor had promoted; and he kept
him till he made him confirm them, and grant him Investitures under his hand
and seal, and promise: But when the Emperor was gone, the Pope took his
promise to be null, and brake it, (he that can dispense with others, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with himself.)</p>
               <p>§ 116. <hi>Binnius,</hi> after many such others, doth not only justifie the Pope's
deposing of the Emperor; but shamelesly saith, that even the <hi>Novatores Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retici,</hi>
(as he calleth the Loyal and Orthodox) will not deny but that he was
justly deposed, because (saith he) in a Letter to <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> he said himself
<hi>he might justly be deposed if he fell from the Faith; and he was deposed for
Heresie,</hi> viz. <hi>for defending Priests Marriage, selling Benefices, contemning the Popes
Excommunication, and saying that he ought not to regard it.</hi>

it?</p>
               <p>3. Was it to the Pope that he forfeited his Crown? How prove you
that?</p>

they be so deposed?</p>
               <p>§ 117.<note place="margin">☞</note> But one thing I desire may be noted of this <hi>Henrician Heresie,</hi> that
the Emperor did not take away the old liberty of the Clergy and People in
chusing their Bishops: Investiture was not <hi>Election,</hi> or any determining <hi>Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
but like our <hi>Inductions</hi> an <hi>after-consent,</hi> and a delivery of possession by a
<hi>Staff and Ring,</hi> as may be seen in the form of Pope <hi>Pasohal</hi>'s Grant in <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerus,</hi>
Gen. 38. p. 738. <hi>[We grant and confirm to you, that you may bestow
Investiture by a Staff and Ring to the Bishops and Abbots in your Dominion,
FREELY ELECTED WITHOUT FORCE AND SIMONY.]</hi> And it med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

claim an Heresie, (as Councils had before named it, <hi>The Henrician
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:60852:183"/>
Heresie)</hi> could not here disclaim and revoke his Act, without confessing his
fault, in granting that power to the Emperor, and confirming it by Covenant
and Oath. He tells them that he is but a Man, and so a Sinner, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his sin, begs their prayers to God for pardon, and then anathematizeth all
that he had written, and desireth them to do the like. Hereupon a crafty
Bishop <hi>(Bruno Signinus)</hi> said, <hi>Let us give thanks to God, that we our selves
have heard the Pope condemn that Priviledge that containeth Pravity and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note>
                  <hi>And if that Priviledge contain Heresie, then he that made it was an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.]</hi>
This put them all to their shifts; and <hi>Ioh. Cajetan</hi> angerly said, <hi>[Dost
thou call the Pope an Heretick here, and in our hearing? The writing that our
Lord the Pope made was Evil, but not Heresie.</hi> Another Bishop said, <hi>[Nay
it ought not to be called Evil; For to deliver the People of God is good, by the
authority of the Gospel, which commandeth us</hi> animas ponere, <hi>to lay down our
Souls for the Brethren: And that which the Pope did, was to deliver the People

hold at the charge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but after great expectations, he told them that
<hi>[That Church had never had Heresie: yea, the same Church had quelled all
Heresies—And</hi> Ego rogavi pro te, Petre, <hi>secureth it.</hi> As much as to say, <hi>Though
I confest an Heresie before I was aware, now I tell you, the same thing is an</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician

denying a Boy of ten years old, to succeed his Father as Prefect of the City;
the Pope being forced to remove: That the Emperor came with an Army
again to <hi>Rome,</hi> where a Bishop crowned him again, the Pope being in <hi>Apulia,</hi>
who after returned and dyed.</p>

But a <hi>French</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rouen</hi> pleaded for the King, that no Canon allowed

                  <hi>And some lesser, as</hi> 1. That attenuating mans merits, he said None merited
but Christ. 2. Evacuating the Sacraments of the Church, he said None were
truly baptized, but those that were to be saved: <hi>And such like other things.
The Pope and the Prelates heard the Charge: Two Masters are brought out
against him, who sware that they heard some of these things from his mouth;
many wondering that learned Men used Oaths instead of Arguments, (saith</hi>
Otto Frising.) <hi>After many Charges and Urgencies, he said,</hi> [Audacter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteor
Patrem alio esse Patrem, alio Deum, nec tamen esse hoc &amp; hoc.] <hi>that is,</hi>
it is one thing to be God, and another to be the Father, <hi>(or the words are not
of the same signification)</hi> and yet God is not one thing, and the Father another
thing.] <hi>The hardness of these words seeming a prophane Novelty, provoked
the Bishop of</hi> Soissons <hi>to say,</hi> [What say you, That the Being of God is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?]
<hi>having not read or understood</hi> Austin, <hi>that saith,</hi> [Sic aliud est Deo
esse, aliud subsistere; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icut aliud Deo esse, aliud Patrem esse, vel Dominum esse:
Quod enim est ad se dicitur: Pater autem ad Filium, &amp; Dominus ad servien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
creaturam.]</p>
               <p>The Bishop of <hi>Soissons</hi> misusing a saying, <hi>[Cum quis diceret,</hi> Socratem <hi>esse
nihil diceret.]</hi> He turned the Auditory against himself; and they asked <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retane</hi>
to open why he so distinguished the Persons; who answered, <hi>[Quia
omnis persona est per se una.]</hi> which puzled or amazed them, and ended that
days work.</p>
               <p>The next day he was accused of Novelty, for saying that <hi>[The three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were tria singularia.]</hi> The Archbishop of <hi>Rouen</hi> aggravating it, said that
<hi>[God should rather be called unum singulare, than tria singularia.]</hi> At which
many were offended, because <hi>Hilary</hi> saith, <hi>[Sicut duos Deos dicere profanum
est, ita singularem &amp; solitarium dicere sacrilegum est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-Et nihil solitarium ex
divinis Sacramentis ad suspicionem audientium &amp; occasionem blasphemantium
proferamus.]</hi> But <hi>Porretane</hi> told them, that by <hi>singular,</hi> he meant nothing but
<hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>incomparable.</hi> In this manner <hi>Porretane,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi>
was examined, and modestly answered them many days; till the Pope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that these School-niceties being too hard for him, durst not determine
them, nor gratifie <hi>Bernard</hi> (though his Friend) and the Hereticating Bishops
and Clergy, but craftily put it off to a General Council. This is all out of
<hi>Otto Frising.</hi> recited by <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 1332.</p>
               <p>You may see here what work Hereticating Prelates and Councils were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinated
to make. If all the Schoolmens subtile Assertions (sound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound)
must thus be tryed in General Councils, and all that was disliked, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Heresies, though it would have shamed the Prelates ignorance, it would
have afrighted daring Wits from their presumption; and since I have seen the
tendency of <hi>Cartesianism, Gassendianism,</hi> and other Epicurean Follies, I did not
care much if we had some such ignorant Prelates to afright these bold Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
also.</p>
               <p>I have oft marvelled why General Councils that understood not the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:60852:187"/>
Tongue, (nor the Pope's Western Councils the <hi>Greek)</hi> have no more
exercised themselves in Councils to judge of <hi>Scripture, Copies,</hi> and <hi>Translations.</hi>
And I have thought in what words and manner they would have prosecuted
such debates: sure falsifying Scripture is of as dangerous consequence as these
School presumptions. Some will think it is well that the Councils for above
1000 years had so few that understood the original language, or else they
would have so tost and torn, and sensed and nonsensed the Scripture, that they
would have made it quite another thing.</p>
               <p>§ 171. CCCCXIX. Yet we have not done with Heresies. A Council at
<hi>Rhemes,</hi> called by the banished Pope, tryed a mad man, an illiterate Rustick,
called <hi>Eum,</hi> one unworthy to be called an Heretick, saith <hi>Otto Frising,</hi> who said
he was the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom they sent to Prison, where he dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the same Council</hi> Gib. Porretane, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Poictiers, <hi>is again called, where
their Subtilties were disputed over again; and</hi> Bernard <hi>Abbot</hi> Clareval. <hi>being
his chief Adversary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon</hi> Porretane'<hi>s exception to some of his words, saying,</hi>
Scribantur, <hi>went and drew up some Articles of Faith, seeming contrary to</hi>
Porretanes, <hi>and got many Bishops to subscribe them. The</hi> Roman <hi>Cardinals
took this heinously, and came all together to the Pope, and told him,</hi> That it
was they that of a private Man made him Pope, and that he must know that it
was they that were the <hi>Cardines,</hi> on which the Axis of the whole Church did
turn, and that he must not now be his own, but theirs, and not prefer private and
new Friends before his old common ones. And that his Abbot <hi>Bernard</hi> with
the Gallicane Bishops, had audaciously presumed to lift up their Necks against the
primacy and top of the <hi>Roman</hi> Seat, which only doth shut and no man opens, and
opens and no man shuts; which only may discuss matters of Faith: And even
when absent, may not receive prejudice of this honour from any. But, behold
these French-men, contemning our faces, (or presence) have presumed to write
their Belief, without consulting us, as if they would pass a definitive Sentence on
the matters that have been handled before us: which had it been done at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had been void—How then durst these usurp in our presence—
We will therefore that you presently rise up against thus temerarious Novity, and
delay not to punish their Contumacy.] <hi>And so they had like to have run into a
Schism: But the Pope and</hi> Bernard <hi>spake them fair, and</hi> Bernard <hi>said,</hi> They
wrote not as Determiners, but to give account of their own Faith, when provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
<hi>and so pacified the Cardinals. But this Tumult hindered the deciding
of the Case:</hi> But, <hi>saith Otto,</hi> whether <hi>Bernard</hi> was decived by humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
or <hi>Porretane</hi> escaped by hiding any thing by his great learning, I must not
determine.</p>
               <p>§ 172. CCCCXX. Another Council <hi>An.</hi> 1150. the banished Pope held
at <hi>Trevers,</hi> where <hi>Bernard</hi> told him of the Revelations of a Woman Abbess
called <hi>Hildegardis:</hi> The Pope sent some to her; she returns him a writing of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:60852:187"/>
her Revelations, which he read, admired, and by <hi>Bernard</hi>'s persuasion honored
her with a Letter: But what they were is not mentioned.</p>
               <p>§ 173. <hi>Conradus;</hi> called <hi>Anastasius</hi> the 4th, is next Pope, and dyeth after a
year, four months, and 24 days. The glory of his time is said to be <hi>Ricar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
de Sancto Victore,</hi> a famous Writer, specially <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,
Lombard,</hi> and <hi>Comestor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 174. <hi>Hadrian</hi> the 4th, an English man, is next Pope. The <hi>Romans</hi> by
request and threats, importune him to permit their Consuls to govern them as
heretofore. He resolutely denieth them. They wound one of his Cardinals.
He Excommunicateth and Curseth them.<note place="margin">☜</note> (Quaere, <hi>Whether</hi> Rome <hi>was the
Catholick Church when it was Excommunicate?)</hi> They had before desired
him to come to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> which he refused, till they should turn out one
<hi>Arnoldus Brixianus,</hi> called by him a Heretick and Disciple of <hi>Abailard.</hi> The
People (saith <hi>Platina)</hi> took this ill, and so hurt the said Cardinal (I doubt
the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves were for Hereticks.) The Pope curseth <hi>William</hi> of
<hi>Sicily</hi> for invading the Church-lands. The Greek Emperor offereth to help
the Pope, and to give him much Gold also, if he shall but have three Maritime
Cities in <hi>Apulia,</hi> where he hath won them. This afrighteth <hi>William</hi> to offer
the Pope all again, if he may but he called King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
it. <hi>William</hi> angry, over-runneth <hi>Italy.</hi> The Pope repenting, granteth
him his desire. The new Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> also coming with an Army into
<hi>Italy,</hi> took some Cities belonging to the Church, and gave them up to the
Pope: But when he came into the City to be crowned, the Citizens enraged
at the Pope for denying them their Civil Government, shut the Gates (the
Emperor's Army being without) and fell on many of the Pope's Followers,
and the <hi>Germans,</hi> beat some, and killed many. The Emperor hereby provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
got in his Army, and killed many of the Citizens, and had done more,
but that the Pope dissuaded him: Yet was the Pope and he fain to go round
about to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> to avoid another Battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platina</hi> mentioneth the Pope's Cursing <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and absolving his
Subjects from their Oaths that they might Rebel, but saith nothing of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
after-quarrel with the Pope, occasioned by a Letter of the Pope's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
him, for not helping the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> saith <hi>Binnius,</hi> and refusing
an offered Bishop of <hi>Ravenna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope's Epistles against the Emperor, <hi>&amp;c. Binnius</hi> leaveth out. At
last the <hi>Romans</hi> again rising against him, he goeth to <hi>Anagria,</hi> and dyeth.</p>
               <p>§ 175. <hi>An. 1160. Roland</hi> is made Pope, called <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3d; and
<hi>Octavian,</hi> called <hi>Victor</hi> the 4th, is made Pope by others, and sate four years,
and seven months. This is, saith <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> the 27th Schism, or double Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:60852:188"/>
Three more succeeded <hi>Clement,</hi> to keep up the duplicate before
<hi>Alexander</hi> dyed, of whom one Reigned five years, and another seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> addresseth himself to the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> to heal the Schism;
who therefore bids both the Popes come to him, that he may hear the Case:
But <hi>Alexander</hi> himself refuseth, and gets away. The Emperor sendeth two
Bishops to him to summon him to a Council; <hi>Alexander</hi> refuseth to appear.
The Bishops go to <hi>Octavian (Victor)</hi> and the Emperor calleth a Council,
and this Council with the Emperor make <hi>Octavian</hi> the confirmed Pope. (Quer.
<hi>Whether this was not as good Authority as</hi> Alexander's <hi>greater number of the
Cardinals?)</hi> Hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> curseth the Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> and the Emperor,
and sendeth Letters to Christian, Princes to tell them that he did it justly:
(Wonderful! that Empires and Kingdoms could be then disposed of by <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing!)</hi>
The Emperor seizeth on many of the Church-Cities. <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth
to <hi>Rome,</hi> but findeth so many against him that he durst not stay there,
but flieth into <hi>France,</hi> invited by King <hi>Philip;</hi> and there again at a Council,
curseth the Emperor. The Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> destroyeth <hi>Milan,</hi> and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
thence to <hi>Colen</hi> the supposed Bodies of the <hi>Magi,</hi> or three wise men that
came to <hi>Bethlehem!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> (Is it not strange what brought them to <hi>Milan?</hi> and
how they came all to dye there together? and how all their Bodies came to
be known? O the wisdom of <hi>Rome!)</hi> The rest of the <hi>Italian</hi> Cities and
States raise an Army against him; he sendeth to the King of <hi>France</hi> to end
the Schism, by bringing Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> with him to a Council, where he
would meet him with <hi>Victor. Divo</hi> is the appointed place between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Germany:</hi> The Emperor with <hi>Victor</hi> and some Kings cometh to the
Council; <hi>Alexander</hi> refuseth, because he call'd it not, and calls another at
<hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The Emperor angry returneth to <hi>Germany,</hi> and sendeth
<hi>Victor</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he dyeth, and <hi>Guido,</hi> called <hi>Paschal</hi> the 3d, is chosen
after him. The <hi>Romans</hi> chose Consuls that were <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Friends, and send
for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and receive him. The <hi>Italians</hi> then arm against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
who cometh with an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> and taketh <hi>Ancona.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi>
Emperor is drawn to promise the Pope a great Army against <hi>Frederick,</hi> so he
would unite the Empire and Churches again. This afrighteth the Emperor.
The <hi>Tusculanes</hi> and the <hi>Abanes</hi> had a War with the <hi>Romans</hi> that oppressed
them with Tribute, and gave the <hi>Romans</hi> a grievous overthrow. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
besiegeth <hi>Rome; William</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> sends help to the Pope. The People
of <hi>Rome</hi> intreat the Emperor for Peace, which he promiseth, on condition the
worthier Pope may be chosen, and the Schism ended. The Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
hearing of this, flieth secretly by Ship. The Plague driveth the Emperor
from <hi>Rome;</hi> he goeth into <hi>Germany.</hi> The Pope's Friends in <hi>Italy</hi> get strength.
The Greek Emperor <hi>Emanuel</hi> sendeth yet larger offers to the Pope, if he
would restore him the Western Empire by Re-union. Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> dyeth.
The <hi>Tusculane</hi> Cardinal, called <hi>Calistus</hi> the 3d, is chosen in his stead, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
seven years, (saith <hi>Onuphr.)</hi> But the <hi>Tusculanes</hi> refusing him, he goeth to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60852:188"/>
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> and resigneth to him all his right in <hi>Tusculum.</hi> Whereupon the
<hi>Tusculanes</hi> receive <hi>Alexander,</hi> who there heard the Ambassador of <hi>Henry</hi> King
of <hi>England,</hi> purging him of the guilt of the death of <hi>Tho. Becket;</hi> and sent
into <hi>England</hi> two Cardinals with power to examine all the matter; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on the King, though swearing he was innocent, that for Penance he
should maintain Soldiers for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and for three years should have an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and defend the Church-liberties in his Land, and
not hinder Appeals to <hi>Rome;</hi> All which he sware: <hi>[By which,</hi> saith <hi>Platina,
he merited that the Title of the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>should be transferred on
him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>and his Heirs, by the Pope's consent: whence it is observed that all the Kings
of</hi> England <hi>do recognize</hi> (or acknowledge) <hi>the Rights of the Kingdom from
the Pope of</hi> Rome.] A just Reward for their serving the Titular Servant of
Servants in his pestilent Ambition! That he should thence take them for his
Vassals, and take himself for the disposer of their Crowns; stooping to such
Priests, doth make them Kings of Kings.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Alexander</hi> hath not got possession of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, so far was he from
being received by all the world; and so low did he condescend as to offer the
Citizens, <hi>[That if they would receive him, he would come in peace, and meddle
with nothing but Divine matters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>leaving to them the care of secular things:
And when they would not grant him this much, he went to</hi> Signia.] Was this
man truly the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that had no more of the Citizens consent so
much as to dwell among them? There he Canonizeth the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury, Tho. Becket,</hi> for a Saint. The Emperor entereth <hi>Italy,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
many Cities, but the <hi>Venetians</hi> owning the Pope, and he being wearied
with Wars, at <hi>Papia</hi> treateth of a Peace. But this not taking, the Emperor
shortly returned with another Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> but was so hard put to it by
the <hi>Millanois</hi> and others in one fight, that he narrowly escaped death himself.
This one loss made the Nobles that followed him say, <hi>That they suffered this,
because they fought unlawfully against the Church; and if he made not his peace
presently with the Pope, they would go home:</hi> So that the Emperor was forced
to submit to the Pope, for fear of being forsaken by his Subjects and Soldiers.
At <hi>Venice</hi> they met, and the Emperor kissing the Pope's feet, credible Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
say,<note place="margin">☜</note> That the Pope trod on his Neck scornfully, and profanely repeating
the words of the Psalm, <hi>[Thou shalt tread on the Lion and Adder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ps. 91. 13.)</hi>
But <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binnius</hi> will not believe this, though as <hi>Fowlis</hi> noteth, <hi>p.</hi> 261.
it is recorded by <hi>Ciaconius, Masson.</hi> and abundance more of their own Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
and preserved in the Archives of the Library at <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Picture
of the Story hang'd publickly in the Senate House.</p>
               <p>The Emperor's severity against them of <hi>Milan</hi> was not for nothing: They
not only brake their Oath by Rebellion, but when his wife <hi>Beatrix</hi> came to see
the City,<note place="margin">☜</note> set her on a Mule backward with the tail in her hand, and so led her
in scorn from one Gate out at the other: What may not such provocation do

The stir that there was about the Emperor's holding the Stirrup to Pope
<hi>Urban,</hi> is recorded by divers Historians: And how the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> did the like by <hi>Alexander;</hi> And how this on debate was said to be
their due.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the Papists Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> themselves are beholden to the
Protestants, for redeeming them from Servitude, and their Kingdoms from the
meer will and mercy of the Pope.</p>
               <p>§ 176. The Pope having conquered the Emperor by Cursing, is past doubt
now of Conquering <hi>Rome,</hi> (for such Men were Bishops by Conquest, and not
by Consent.) To <hi>Tusculum</hi> he goeth, and now demandeth of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
that they abrogate the Office of the Consuls: But finding this too hard a
task to be done at once, he maketh a bargain with them, that none should by
the People be chosen Consuls, till they had taken an Oath of Fidelity to the
Pope, in his own proposed words, and that they would never do any thing
against his dignity. And so <hi>Alexander</hi> goeth the third time to <hi>Rome,</hi> and calls
a Council; but quickly dyeth, when after twenty years contention, he thought
he was new setled in peace, <hi>An.</hi> 1185.</p>
               <p>§ 177. <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> after <hi>Radavicus Frising. Ioan. Cremon. Abb. Ursperg.</hi> &amp;c.
saith that it was this Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> that first ordained that the Clergy and
People being excluded from the Election of the Pope, (and so he was no
true Bishop) the choice should be in the Cardinals shut up in Conclave, and
go by two third parts of their Votes, to avoid Schisms for the time to come.
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> saith, that he had the writing of Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> the 3d, that saith, he
was the first that was chosen by the Cardinals scrutiny, (though the Cardinals
in a looser way were lately made Electors before.)</p>
               <p>He that is no Bishop, is no Universal Bishop or Pope:<note place="margin">☞</note> But he that is not
chosen by the Clergy or People of that Church, is no Bishop. The <hi>Minor</hi> is
proved by the Canons of many Councils.</p>

against Princes, that <hi>Binnius</hi> thought it best to omit them, and give you but
the Titles: But those that concern <hi>England</hi> are in <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> whom <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

left all to their judgments: And that it was there proved by the Oaths of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Clergy, and some Cardinals, and that, twelve days before <hi>Roland</hi> was chosen;
and that <hi>Roland</hi> was present and contradicted not, but bid them obey him
that was chosen: And that after being Chancellor he stole out of the City,
and the major part of the Cardinals having before the death of the last Pope
entered a Confederacy, to choose none but one of themselves that confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

them Parliaments, and some Councils; And as <hi>Spelman</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 529. The
same Assemblies were indeed mixt, and partly Civil or Royal (as he calleth
them, because called by the King) and partly Ecclesiastical. But among the
<hi>Romanists,</hi> Councils are greatly advanced by this ascribing to them the Acts
and Power of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the Parliament at <hi>Clarendon</hi> is called a Council by <hi>Binnius,</hi>
(CCCCXXVI) by the reproachful name of <hi>Conciliabulum,</hi> because they set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Rights of the King as Ruler of the Clergy, and would not let the
Pope be King of <hi>England,</hi> (which is the <hi>Henrician,</hi> or Royal Heresie, to be
punished by Fire or other death on Kings themselves, when the Pope is big
enough to do it.) In this Council or Parliament, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
the rest of the Bishops concurred with the rest (for fear.) But <hi>Thomas</hi> when
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60852:190"/>
he came home repented, and imposed so strict Penance on himself, that the
Pope hearing of it, was sain in absolve him.</p>
               <p>§ 180. CCCCXXVII. <hi>An. 1171. Binnius</hi> saith, that <hi>Ireland</hi> being given
to the Pope as soon as they became Christians, the Pope gave it to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the 2d, as soon as he had conquered it; and a Council at <hi>Cassel</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for Reformation.</p>
               <p>Note here, 1. That the Pope hath great reason to seek the Conversion of the
Kingdoms of the world, if they are his when they are converted.</p>
               <p>2. That it is no wonder if five parts of six of the world be still Infidels,<note place="margin">☞</note>
or at least that they are unwilling to yield to Popish Christianity, when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and Infidel Kings must lose their Kingdoms, and become Subjects to the
Pope, if they turn to Popish Christianity.</p>
               <p>3. That it hath long been a cunning way of Bounty with Popes, to give
Princes their own Kingdoms and Conquests, when they cannot take them from
them.</p>
               <p>CCCCXXVIII. <hi>An.</hi> 1179. was the Synod at <hi>Venice</hi> for reconciliation.</p>
               <p>§ 181. CCCCXXIX. <hi>An. 1180. Alexander</hi> being at peace, called a
Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> which they call General, or the 11th General Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
at <hi>Lateran:</hi> In which are many reforming Canons, and many for the
Papal power. The first is (as aforesaid) to confine the power of Pope-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to two third parts of the Cardinals only. Another to degrade those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the three Anti-Popes. Another that no one have many Churches,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the last against some called <hi>Cathari, Patrini,</hi> or <hi>Publicani</hi> as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
giving those Indulgences that will fight against them, and absolving all
Inferiors from all Fidelity and Duty to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some think that these were
the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> some the <hi>Albigenses.</hi> But I have elsewhere shewed (against Mr.
<hi>Danvers)</hi> that there were several sorts then in those Countries, some <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee</hi>
Hereticks, and some good Christians called <hi>Waldense!,</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> but
against the Pope and his Superstitions, whom the Papists would jumble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to disgrace the best: who were, as some of their own Writers <hi>(e.g.
Sanders lib. 7. de vis. Monar.)</hi> say, <hi>A portion of the Henricians,</hi> that is, of the
Emperor <hi>Henry</hi>'s Heresie, that held the Pope's false usurping Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were to be contemned (not as from <hi>Henry</hi> their Teacher) that is, they
were Royalists, and against the Pope's ruling the abused world by the <hi>Cursing

               <p>§ 182. <hi>To this Council,</hi> Crab <hi>and</hi> Binnius <hi>have annexed a voluminous
Appendix of Decrees, of which many are notable. As</hi> that no Bishop may

               <p>§ 183. <hi>Alexander</hi> dying, <hi>Lucius</hi> the 3d is the first chosen by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
according to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, (as is aforesaid.) And to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Papacy, having got the choice of the Bishop out of the hands of the
Clergy and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Flatterers next persuade him to put down
the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Senators,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> which attempting, his Party by the Cities
insurrection had their eyes put out, and the Pope forced to leave the City;

<hi>Asia,</hi> he dyed.</p>
               <p>§ 184. CCCCXXX. One Council this Pope had at <hi>Verona,</hi> as they say,
where the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> met him, and sollicited him to restore all the
Bishops and Clergy deposed that had adhered to him and the Anti-Popes. The
Pope consented, but said he could not do it without another Council: (By
which it appeareth, that this at <hi>Verona</hi> was no true Council.)</p>
               <p>§ 185. <hi>Urbanus</hi> the 3d is next Pope, called <hi>Turbanus,</hi> as an Incendiary, by
<hi>Ab. Ursspergens.</hi> but better spoken of by <hi>Platina;</hi> he sate above one year. It's

the long War between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the Pope, granting them their Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

called him from attempting the Siege of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and how he was taken
Prisoner by the way home, many Histories acquaint you.</p>
               <p>§ 190. <hi>Binnius</hi> out of <hi>Urspergens.</hi> tells us, how this Pope that had sent the
King of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Palestine,</hi> for his repudiating his Wife after, interdicted

of <hi>France</hi> grievously punished his Clergy for the Fact. For it was done by
the Pope's Legat and the Bishops at a Council at <hi>Divion:</hi> (the CCCCXXXII.
here.)</p>
               <p>§ 191. Next cometh the great Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d, (a young man of

the 6th. But <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Suevia</hi> is his Competitor, and the King of <hi>France</hi> was
for <hi>Philip (Henry</hi>'s Brother) and the Pope for <hi>Otho,</hi> hating <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Line.
Some say <hi>Philip</hi> conquered and deposed <hi>Otho,</hi> but <hi>Petavius,</hi> after divers others,

But seeking to possess <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> by Arms, and not obeying the Pope's

till he give due satisfaction. And let no Clergyman give such pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
persons the ecclesiastical Sacraments, nor presume to give them
Christian burial, nor receive their alms or offerings: otherwise let
them be deprived of their offices, and never be thereto restored with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>And we moreover add, that every Arch-bishop or Bishop by himself
or his Arch-Deacon, or fit honest persons shall twice or once in a year,
go about his parish where Fame saith that Hereticks dwell, and shall
there compel two or three men of good testimony, or if he see fit, the
whole neighbourhood to swear,<note place="margin">☜</note> that if they know any Hereticks there
or any that seek secret conventicles, or that differ in life or manners
from the common conversation of the faithful, he will study to tell
them to the Bishop. And let the Bishop himself call the accused to his
presence, who unless they purge themselves of the guilt objected, or
if after purgation made, they relapse into the former perfidie shall be
Canonically punished. And if any of them refusing by damnable obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
the bond of an oath, will not swear, let them be for this very

                     <p>We will therefore and command,<note place="margin">☜</note> and stritcly command in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of obedience, that the Bishop do watch diligently through their
Diocess, for the effectual execution of these things, if they will Escape
Canonical revenge. And if any Bishop be found negligent and remiss
in purging his Diocess from the leaven of Heretical pravity, when
this appeareth by certain signs, let him be deposed from his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
office, and another fit man be substituted in his place, who will and
can confound heretical pravity.</p>

               <p>The 13. <hi>Cap.</hi> was to forbid making any more new Religions, there

               <p>The 17. <hi>Cap.</hi> was against Bishops that sate up feasting, drinking, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>§ 196. In this Council besides the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and Abbot <hi>Ioachim, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maricus</hi>
a learned man was condemned; they say he said that <q>

by the Iews with him: that Christ's body was no more in the sacrament than
in another thing: That Incense as offered in the Church is Idolatry: That
every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of Christ: That if</hi>
Adam <hi>had not sinned there should have been no generating in Paradise nor
difference of sexes.]</hi>
                  </q> We must take these things on the report of such as
<hi>Sanders,</hi> with some other that they charge on him; for which when they
had killed him with grief, they dig'd up his corps and burnt it, as they
were then burning multitudes of the living.</p>
               <p>§ 197. In this Council <hi>Stephen Laughton</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
was deposed for taking part with the Barons of <hi>England</hi> against King
<hi>Iohn;</hi> whose case was now become the Pope's when he had given him
his Kingdom: in so much that when the Arch-Bishop confessed and
begged absolution, his Holiness answered <q>
                     <hi>[By St. Peter, Brother, thou
shalt not so easily get absolution, who hast done so many and so great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

               <p>§ 198. Let the Reader note, that 1. General Councils are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
religion. 2. That this is one of their greatest approved General
Councils. 3. That therefore by their Law and Religion, they are bound
to exterminate all Protestants, and that all Princes must be deposed that
will not execute it, and their dominion given to others that will. 4. That
all Protestants and others called Hereticks are dead men in Law and want
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60852:193"/>
but judgment and execution where their Law is in force.<note place="margin">☜</note> 5. That the
<hi>Henrician heresie</hi> is one that is judged such by their Councils. 6. That
therefore not only all Protestant Kings, but all Papists that are for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and power of Kings against the Popes pretended power of condemning
and deposing them, are Hereticks to be exterminated and burnt (by many
Canons.) 7. Therefore Kings are beholden to the Protestant reformation
(disabling the Pope to execute his Laws and Religion) for their Crowns
and lives. 8. That when ever any King or others set up Popery and the
power of their Laws and Councils in a Kingdom that is reformed, the
subjects are presently dead men in Law, being to be destroyed as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
(though Policy or want of power may hinder the execution.)
9. <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether it be lawful for any King (or in his authority) so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
his Kingdom, or to make all (or the generality of) his subjects
dead men in Law? 10. Whether by these Laws the Pope and his consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bishops have not published themselves to be <hi>hostes Regum et Regno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
if not <hi>humani generis;</hi> and are not so to be esteemed?</p>
               <p>§ 199. Note also that D. <hi>Heylin,</hi> in his <hi>Certamen Epistolare</hi> against me,
answereth, that it is not Kings but <hi>temporal Lords</hi> that are mentioned
in this Council; and that he and Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi> and
Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> in their dispute published by <hi>Terret</hi> or <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and others
before them, have maintained that these Canons were but proposed by
Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> and not consented to and passed by the Council. But to
the first It is clear 1. that by <hi>Domini Temporales</hi> Councils ordinarily mean
Emperors and Kings as well as any others. 2. That the words of the
Council are express <q>

               <p>And to the 2d. I answer 1. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> actually taketh this for
one of their approved General Councils, and will not be beholden to our
Bishops for their friendly favour and excuse: And therefore it is all one to
us whether the Council consented or not. 2. Mr. <hi>Henry Dodwel</hi> in his

(as <hi>Terret</hi> did in part before;) and hath added abundant proof that these
Canons were passed in that Council. 1. From the Council at <hi>Oxford</hi> where
<hi>Stephen Laughton</hi> himself was. 2. From <hi>Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paris</hi> who is alledged for

               <p>So that as the Papists will not accept of this Charity of our Bishops in
excusing their Religion from this part of guilt, so there is little place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for an excuse.</p>
               <p>§ 200. The Papists themselves though they have many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and instances to prove the Popes Claim and Practice of deposing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet will not let go this as being a famous General Council: But
when here in <hi>England</hi> they would excuse their Religion from Rebellion,
they use to say, that this being not an <q>Article of Faith, but a Canon of
Practice</q> they are not bound to take it as <hi>infallible.</hi> To which the said
Mr. <hi>Henry Dodwell</hi> ibid. pag. 185. hath largely answered, to which I refer
the Reader; adding only, that That which must be <hi>Believed to be of God is
not alway matter of practice, yet what must be done as by the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must alwaies be, first the matter of faith: we must believe that it is God's
will before we can obey it as his will.</hi> The full answer see as aforecited.</p>
               <p>§ 201. In the performance of the Laws of this Council multitudes
called hereticks were burnt: Their St. <hi>Dominick</hi> preaching to the people

that the Pope was banished; But a plague ended it that left scarce the
tenth man alive. Again the Senators and the Pope agree not about Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation,
and the Pope is fain to be gone again, and gets the Emperor
to promise him that their conjunct forces should assault the Romans. The
Emperor faileth, and bids his Souldiers help the Romans, himself depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the Pope by mony bireth them to help him, and recovereth <hi>Rome.</hi>
He sendeth preachers abroad to call men to the holy War: He Sainteth

The <hi>Venetians</hi> help the Pope. The Emperor afflicteth them: The <hi>Italians</hi>

and the name of <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> filled <hi>Italy</hi> with confusion. The
Romans were again falling off from the Pope, but he went among them
<hi>Carrying the heads of the Apostles</hi> (you must believe it,) and by supplication
and speeches moved the People to pity him, and got them to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Emperor; which cost them and others of the Church party

(to kill one man twice.) But the Emperor way-layeth them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
many Cardinals and Bishops, and Imprisons them by the <hi>Pisanes</hi>

                  <hi>This Bishop was one of the famousest men in the whole world for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
piety and justice: The Pope had sent him an order (as saith</hi> Matth.
Paris, <hi>he often did to him and other English Bishops) to do somewhat which
the Bishop judged to be unjust. It was not so bad as an interdict to silence
Christs Ministers; but whether it was the promoting of bad Ministers, or hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or excommunicating good men, some such thing it was as you may see by
what followeth: The Bishop writeth a Letter to the Pope and Cardinals
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:60852:196"/>
in which he tells them</hi> 
                  <q>[That he would obey the Apostolical precepts: but
that was not Apostolical which was contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles;<note place="margin">☞</note>
Christ saying, he that is not with us is against us: And that cannot be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
that is against Christ: as the Tenour of the Popes Letters were:
His <hi>non obstante</hi> so often repeated, shewed his inconstancy and his blotting the
purity of the Christian Religion, and perturbing the peace and quiet of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties;
a torrent of audaciousness, procacity, immodesty, lying, deceiving, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believing or trusting any one; on which innumerable vices follow. And
next after the sin of Lucifer, which in the end of time will be that also of
Antichrist, the son of perdition, whom the Lord will destroy with the Spirit
of his mouth, there neither is nor can be any other sort of sin, so adverse and
contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and the Gospel,<note place="margin">☞</note> and so hateful, dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
and abominable, as to kill and destroy souls by defrauding men of the
care of the Pastoral office and Ministry: which sin those men are known by
the most evident testimonies of the sacred Scripture to commit, who being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in power of pastoral care,<note place="margin">☞</note> do get the salary of the pastoral office and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
out of the milk and the fleece of the sheep of Christ, who are to be quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
and saved, but administer not to them their dues: For the very not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
of the Pastoral ministeries, is by the testimony of Scripture, the killing
<hi>and destroying</hi> of the sheep: And that these two sorts of sins, though unexpectedly
are the very worst, and beyond all comparison exceed all other sort of sin, is manifest by
this, that they are, in the two existent fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

directly contrary to the best things: And that is the worst, which is contrary
to the best: And as for these sins, as much as in them lieth, one of them is the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Godhead it self, which is superessentially and supernaturally best: and the
other is the destruction of that conformity and dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ication <hi>(of souls)</hi> by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
participation of the Divine beams, which is the best thing essentially and
naturally. And as in good things, the cause of good is better than the effect,
so in evils, the cause of evil is worse than the effect is manifest, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducers
in the Church of God, of such most mischievous destroyers of <hi>(holy)</hi>
formation and deification in the sheep of Christ, are worse than the destroyers
<hi>(or murderers)</hi> themselves; the nearer to Lucifer and Antichrist, and in the
greater degree of mischief (or priority) by how much the more superexcelling,
and by the greater and diviner power, given by God for edification and not for
destruction, they were the more bound to exclude and extirpate such most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
murderers <hi>(or destroyers)</hi> from the Church of God: It cannot be
therefore, that a holy Apostolick Seat, to which all power is given by our
Lord Iesus Christ the holy of holies, for Edification, and not for destruction
as the Apostle testified, should command, or require any thing that bordereth on
or tendeth towards so hateful, detestable, aud abominable a thing to Iesus Christ
and so utterly pernitious to mankind, or by any way endeavour any thing that
tendeth thereunto. For this were either a defection or a corruption or an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of Christs own power, which is evidently most holy and most full; or it
were an absolute elongation from the Throne of the Glory of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and the next sitting together of the two foresaid Princes of darkness,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60852:196"/>
and of hellish punishments, in the chair of pestilence. Nor can any one with
unspotted and sincere obedience (who is a subject and faithful to that same
Seat, and not by schism cut off from Christ, and that holy Seat) obey the
said mandates and precepts, or any endeavours whatever, and whensoever
they come, yea though it were from the highest order of Angels, but must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
contradict them and rebel with all his strength <hi>(or power):</hi> And
therefore Reverend Lords, from the duty of obedience and fidelity, in which I
am bound to both the parents of the holy Apostolick Seat, and from the Love
which I have to Vnion in the body of Christ with it; I do only, filially and
obediently disobey, contradict and rebel, to the things which in the foresaid
Letter are contained, and specially, because as is before touched, they do most
evidently tend to that sin which is most abominable to our Lord Iesus Christ,
and most pernitious to mankind, and which are altogether adverse to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of the holy Apostolick Seat; and are contrary to the Catholick Faith. Nor
can you discretion for this hint conclude <hi>(or decree)</hi> any hard thing against
me; because all my contradiction and action, in this matter, is neither contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
nor rebellion, but the filial honour due to the Divine Father, and of
you. Briefly recollecting all I say; the sanctity of the Apostick Seat can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what tendeth to edification and not to destruction: For this is the
plenitude of power, to be able to do all to edification: But these things which
they call provisions, are not to edification, but to most manifest destruction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the blessed Seat of the Apostle cannot accept them, because flesh and blood
hath revealed them which possess not the things that are of God, and not the
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who is in Heaven.</q>

him. He is a Catholick; Yea a most holy man; more religious than we are
more holy and excellent than we, and of a more excellent life; so that it is

pricking him in the side with a violent thrust with the point of his pastoral
staffe which he carried, and said; miserable Pope <hi>Senebald!</hi> Dost thou purpose in
disgrace of me, and the Church of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to cast my bones out of the Church,
Whence did this timerity befal thee. It were better that thou, advanced and
honoured by God, should honour those which are zealous for God; even when
they are dead: Henceforth God will give thee no more power over me: I wrote
to thee in the spirit of humility and love; that thou shouldst correct thy many
errours: But with a proud eye and a bewitching heart thou hast despised
wholesome warnings: Wo to thee that despispest: Shalt thou not be despised.]
And the Bishop <hi>Robert</hi> departing, striking as with a lance, the Pope, who when
as is said he was pricked, groaned aloud, he left him half dead, and with a
mournful voice groaning with sighs; His Chamberlains hearing him, being asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
asked him, what the matter was. The Pope answering with sighs and
groans, said; The terrours of the night, have vehemently troubled me; nor shall
I ever be well again as I was! Oh, alas, how great is the pain of my side!
A ghost hath pierced me with a lance: An he neither eat nor drank that day,
feigning that he was inflamed with feavours that streightened his breath; And
Gods revenge and wrath did not so leave him.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Not long after the Pope, not sensible of Gods warnings by his Servants, but
setting about warlike and secular matters, he prospered not in them, though he

the King <hi>Hen. 3d.</hi> as false and oppressive, and pillaging Churches and
People to maintain his profuseness, the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> laid a Plot
which the King accepted, that getting the hands and seals of a few Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
he would go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and get power from the Pope to gather the
King as much money as he needed. So to <hi>Rome</hi> he went, and there found
the Pope in great grief and care himself for money, to pay vast debts that
his Wars had cost him: The Bishop told him that the King who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
his Kingdom to be forfeited, if he paid not the Popes debts, would
help him to money if he would be ruled by him, and write to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

The Pope gladly gave leave to the Bishop to write what he would; And
home he went, and <hi>Eustandus</hi> a Legate was sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to see all done:
saith, <hi>M. Paris, p. 911. anno 1255. The Legate was prepared and ready in all
things to the destruction of all</hi> England <hi>to obey the will of the King which was
tyrannical, and to bind the oppressed contradictors in the bonds of Anathema.
Rustandus</hi> cometh with the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of
<hi>Hereford</hi> is empowred by the Pope to gather moneys, for the Pope or King:
A Parliament is called at <hi>Westminster:</hi> They refuse and go home. The
Popes Letters press the Collection: A Council of Bishops is called at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
so much money is demanded, saith <hi>M. Paris,</hi> as would have <hi>enslaved or
undone all the Kingdome.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> protested he would lose his
head rather than consent: The Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> said he would be hang'd
first: The rest follow them. The King is angry and threatneth. The
Earl <hi>Marshal</hi> in anger, when the King called him Traytor, answered, <hi>thou
liest, I never was a Traytor nor will be:</hi> The King threatned to send men to thresh
out his corn and fell it to humble him: The Earl told him, if he did so he
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:60852:199"/>
would cut off the threshers heads and send them him: some interposed
for the time: The Lords refused to meddle with the Kingdomes business,
or to impoverish themselves, and were dissolved.</p>
               <p>Rustandus <hi>again Congregateth the Bishops at</hi> London. <hi>They did nothing
again: saith</hi> M. Paris, <hi>too boldly,</hi> p. 917. <q>[Si enim sive juste sive injuste per

               <p>§ 242. CCCCLVII. But the great Council called by them the <hi>15th.</hi>
General Council approved, was at <hi>Vienna</hi> near <hi>France,</hi> on this occasion. King
<hi>Philip</hi> having got the Popedome, for <hi>Clem.</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> made him promise to
condemn Pope <hi>Bonif.</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> and all his Acts: When he had possession, he
found himself in a streight, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pratensis</hi> advised him
to please the King with the hopes that a General Council would do it
most effectually, and to get the Council out of his Country and power:
which being done the Council frustrated the Kings expectations: The
King accused Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> of Simony, Heresie, and Perjury, in forty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:60852:202"/>
His crimes were not denyed, but they justified him to be a true Pope,
and found him not an Heretick.</p>
               <p>In this Council the Templars were condemned and put down, and their
Lands given to the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Hospitalers, or Knights of <hi>Rhodes</hi> (which they
say King <hi>Philip</hi> thought to have got) some say the Templars were falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of Heresies (and the Masters and others burnt): Others say, truely.
The most probable, is that some particular Men of them (no new thing
among Soldiers) committed many Villainies, and the rest suffered for their
sakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Council the Heresies of</hi> Petrus Ioan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is <hi>a Disciple of Abbot</hi> Ioachim,
<hi>were condemned, which were three.</hi> 1. That the rational Soul, as rational,
is not the form of humane bodies. 2. That habitual grace is not infused in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
<hi>(that is alwayes and to Infants).</hi> 3. That Christs side was pierced with
the Launce before he was dead.</p>
               <p>In this Council the Fratricelli and Dulcinists were Condemned, and also
eight Heresies of the Beguines and Beguards; which were these (all for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
which Quakers and some Fryars now seem to be too much for in
profession, as we all are in desire) 

<q>
                     <p>1. That man in this life, may get such a
degree of perfection, as that he may become impeccable (or sinless) and <hi>so</hi>
to <hi>rise</hi> to no higher a degree of grace: Else, say they, if one might still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
he might grow better than Christ.</p>
                     <p>2. That when one hath atteined that degree, he ought not to fast or
pray: Because then sensuality is perfectly subject to the Spirit and reason,
so that a man may then freely grant his body what pleaseth him.</p>
                     <p>3. That they that have got this degree of perfection and the Spirit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
are not subject to humane obedience, nor bound to any precepts of
the Church, for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
                     <p>4. That thus a man may get final beatitude in all degrees in this life, as
well as in that to come.</p>
                     <p>5. That every intellectual nature is naturally blessed in it self, and the
soul needeth not the light of glory for the seeing and enjoying of God.</p>
                     <p>6. That to exercise virtues is a note of imperfection.</p>
                     <p>7. That to kisse a Woman is sin, because nature needs it not; but copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is not, because nature requireth it, when one is tempted.</p>
                     <p>8. That one ought not to rise and to reverence at the elevation of Christs
body, because he must not descend from the altitude of his contemplations
so as to to think of the Sacrament or Christs humane body.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It seems these were such fanatiks as some Fryers are.</p>
               <p>In this Council the decrees called Clementines were passed; in which
are specially noted by <hi>Binius,</hi> some things <hi>de fide,</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">I. That it is heresie to call in doubt, or assent that the substance of the
rational or intellective soul is not truly and perfect the form of mans body.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That whereas Divines differ about the effect of Baptisme, some say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that to Infants sin is remitted, but not Grace conferred; others saying that
the fault is remitted and virtues or informing Grace infused as to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60852:202"/>
though not yet for use, we attending the general Efficacy of Christs
death, which by Baptisme is equally applyed to all, judge the second opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more probable and agreeable to the sayings of the Saints and modern
Doctors of <hi>Theologie,</hi> the sacred Council approving this, which saith, that
both to adult and infants in baptisme informing grace and virtues are
given.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If any one fall into this errour that as pertinaciously to affirm that
<hi>Vsury is no sin,</hi> we decree that he be punished as an Heretike, and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and inquisitors for heresie may proceed against such as against hereticks.</p>
                  <p>IV. And it is decreed that if any Communities or Officers shall presume
to write or dictate that usury should be paid, or being paid should not be
fully and freely restored, let them be excommunicate, and they shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
the same sentence that do not as far as they can blot out such statutes
out of the bookes of the said Companies, that shall keep such customes.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Also that Usurers be compelled to shew their books of accounts.</p>
               <p>§ 243. Here the <hi>Pope and the Bishops in a General Council</hi> have judged
divers points to be heresie, and consequently their contraries to be Articles
of faith: And for Heresie they curse, burn and damne men.</p>
               <p>1. I overpassed their Article that Christ was dead before his side was
pierced, which is true: But whether an Article of our Creed necessary to
be understood to Salvation, let the Church Creed be witness.</p>
               <p>2. Its well, that the possibility of sinless perfection is made a heresie by
them (for we must daily pray for pardon): But why then do they talk so
much of the possibility of keeping all Gods Law, that is of never sinning;
and talk of perfection, and works of Supererogation?</p>
               <p>3. Do not they make an Article of Faith of a Logical Arbitrary Notion
<hi>(that intellectual Souls being the Bodies form)</hi> who knows not how ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the word <hi>form</hi> is? An <hi>Aristotle</hi> supposeth a <hi>Corpus organicum,</hi> besides the

                  </gap>will so far venture on their heretication as to say,
that <hi>forma Corporis, forma Animae,</hi> and <hi>forma Hominis,</hi> are divers: That <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus

which is not the Soul: That the Soul being a <hi>substance</hi> hath its <hi>proper
from</hi> which denominateth it, and which it retaineth, when separated from
the Body: And that the <hi>intellectual Soul</hi> is <hi>forma Hominis,</hi> but improperly
called <hi>forma Corporis:</hi> I will venture on their Heretication, to tell them my
opinion, and I think their Errour and Presumption to thrust such things
on Men under the penalties of cursing, burning, and damnation,</p>
               <p>4. Their Article of Faith about the effect of Baptism <hi>(That all that are

Grace,</hi> I take for unproved, and have elsewhere proved it to be false in all
probability, as <hi>universally</hi> taken.</p>
               <p>5. The Article of Faith, That <hi>Vsury is a Sin,</hi> doth hereticate many great
Divines, more <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>most Cities, Corporations,</hi> and <hi>Companies</hi> in the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60852:203"/>
World: No doubt, but all Usury is a sin that is against either <hi>Mercy</hi> or
<hi>Iustice:</hi> But that some Usury may be an Act of <hi>great Charity,</hi> many wise
men think past doubt: We have known some get estates of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds a year by trading with money taken upon Usury, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some that Leant that money, had nothing but the Use to buy them
bread and course cloathing, and keep them from perishing. How many
thousand Great Men, Lawyers and Citizens are to be cursed, burnt, and
damned by this Canon, for holding some Usury to be Lawful: Nay, how
many for <hi>not restoring</hi> it when taken; when perhaps, an Orphan took
it of a rich man to save them from famine. This is the benefit of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticators.</p>

say, that the utter confusion of their imperial Successions by murders and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations,
and the continued confusions of their Church affairs ever since the
divisions of the Orthodox Nestorians, Entychians, Monothelites, <hi>&amp;c</hi> maketh
it both a hard and unpleasant task to give any exact account of their
Bishops, Synods and manifold contentions, which furthered the ruine of
the Empire. Their divisions gave the Latines opportunity to take <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople
1204.</hi> which they kept 58 years, and then lost it. <hi>Baldwin</hi> was

               <p>§ 258. <hi>Anno</hi> 1362. Another French man is made Pope, called <hi>Vrban</hi>
the <hi>5th.</hi> He sent <hi>Aegidius</hi> to fight for him in <hi>Italy</hi> (still broil'd in Wars,)
and died.</p>
               <p>§ 259. <hi>Anno 1370. Petrus Bellfortis</hi> that was made Cardinal before he
was 17 years old is made Pope of <hi>Avignion,</hi> and called <hi>Greg.</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi>
So far was all the world from obeying the Pope, that <hi>Italy</hi> still fought
against him: Thither he sends an Army, bloodshed and misery overspread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Country. The Pope at last saw that his absence gave his Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
advantage, and not daring to let the <hi>French</hi> know lest they should
have stopt him, he slipt away to <hi>Rome,</hi> and thither removed his Seat,
that had been at <hi>Avignion</hi> 70 years, to the great joy of the City, impoverished
by the absence of the Court.</p>
               <p>§ 260. <hi>Anno 1378. Gregory</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> being dead, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> flock
to the Cardinals, and cry to them to choose no more Frenchmen least the
Seat be again removed, but an Italian, and the best man that could be
found, least all should run to utter confusion. Thirteen Cardinals were
Frenchmen and four Italians: The French were for a French Pope; but
they fell out among themselves, while part of the French were for one, and
part for another, by which it fell out that <hi>Barthol. Episc. Barensis,</hi> a Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane
was chosen, an extraordinary good Pope. The Cardinals cryed out
that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had by tumult, force, and arms constrained them
to the choice of this man <hi>(Vrban 6.)</hi> and they fled to strong holds; but at
last came to <hi>Rome</hi> and owned the Pope: But when he told them, that he
would not go to <hi>France,</hi> and reproved their wickedness, and told them how
severely he resolved to punish them if they amended not, they got away and
declared, that <hi>Vrban</hi> was a false Pope, chosen by the Peoples tumults and
force, where the Cardinals were not free, and that the Seat was void, and
they chose another (Cardinal <hi>Gebennensis)</hi> and called him <hi>Clement 7th;</hi>
And so whereas for seventy years there had been a Pope at <hi>Avignion,</hi> and
none at <hi>Rome,</hi> now for forty years more there were two, one at <hi>Avignion,</hi>
and one at <hi>Rome</hi> (and sometimes three). And indeed it passeth my skill
to know how the <hi>Avignion</hi> Popes were Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who never saw
<hi>Rome,</hi> nor any of the People, any more than he is a true Schoolmaster that
never saw the School or Scholars.</p>
               <p>And now the two Popes fall to fighting for it; and the French Pope send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Army of Britons against the Italian Pope; at first they beat the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
but next were so destroyed by them, that few scaped home to bring
the news.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> bloody Wars still continue, especially between the <hi>Venetians</hi>
and <hi>Geno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:60852:205"/>
also were ruined by Wars, their Queen siding with one Pope <hi>(Clement)</hi> was
destroyed by <hi>Charles</hi> that was for the other (justly strangled, as she had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her own Husband). The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> also came with a great Army
into <hi>Italy</hi> from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> to destroy Pope <hi>Vrban;</hi> but the General died,
and the Souldiers scattered and returned home: The Pope then desired of
King <hi>Charles</hi> that his Nephew might be Prince of <hi>Naples;</hi> and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
threatned <hi>Charles,</hi> and cited him to <hi>Nucena,</hi> who came at his Summons,
but with an Army: The Pope escaped to <hi>Genoa;</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> upon
his Fathers death called home to <hi>Hungary,</hi> was murdered.</p>
               <p>The Pope putteth seven of his old Cardinals in five Sacks,<note place="margin">☞</note> and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them in the Sea: But to be strong enough, he maketh no fewer than
twenty nine new ones in one day. He went to <hi>Naples,</hi> thinking to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and deject the Kings two Sons, but was defeated. <hi>Italy</hi> still flamed
with War: He made 54 Cardinals, of which he killed five, and deposed
seven, and died, saith <hi>Platina,</hi> little lamented, as his Epitaph sheweth, as
being rustick and inexorable, though one of their best: He died after eleven
years, <hi>An.</hi> 1389.</p>

dead in <hi>France, Pet. de Luna</hi> is chosen there, called <hi>Benedict</hi> 13. The <hi>Italians</hi>
were still the furthest from Unity and peace, all the Cities almost in war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
each other: so far were they from Eminency in Religious love and
concord, that they had not the common quietness of Heathens. The Pope
went to <hi>Perusium</hi> to reconcile them there; where to shew what his power
was over them, the people killed fourscore of the Nobles before the Popes
face, which he took ill, and departed. He got possession of the Government
of <hi>Rome;</hi> he required Annals, that is, half a years value of every Benefice
of him that received it: All, saith <hi>Platina,</hi> save the <hi>English</hi> granted it, and
they would yield it of no Benefices but Bishopricks. Had the Pope indeed
been Head of all the World, Annals would have come to a considerable
Rent: But going so far as the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to gather it, would have made it
come shorter home than the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gold and Silver doth from the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Instead of winning men by Preaching, the Popes Arms now subdue <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusium</hi>
and many <hi>Italian</hi> Cities to him: <hi>Platina</hi> saith, that his own Father
that saw the man, told him, that a Priest cloathed in white, carrying a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,
with certain Hymns to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> came from the <hi>Alps</hi> with a
grave and pious look, so preaching, that all the people followed him, even
Nobles as well as others; and that he pretended that he went to visit the
Holy Fathers at <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> but the Pope suspected that he meant to be Pope, or
get too much interest, and sent Souldiers and took him, and burnt him
to death; some saying that he had some errour, others saying no such
thing was ever proved by him, but it was reported by the Pope to hide
his cruelty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:60852:205"/>

                  <hi>Platina</hi> saith he was not only
slothful, but could not endure to be told of his duty. The Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi>
petitioned him to endeavour the ending of the Schisme, the King of <hi>France</hi>

his Nephew <hi>Ludovicus</hi> to be murdered, who presently killed eleven that

of <hi>France</hi> had made their Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> 13. take the like Oath: The
Princes and Cardinals ashamed of two Popes, and two Churches, prest them
both to summon a Council; they cunningly would not agree of the place,

               <p>The Council forbad his Books, and condemned them to be burnt, and

against the Pope are read, which were proved; which were in sum
as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 1. That the Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> from his Youth was of a naughty dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
impudent a lyar, rebellious against his Parents, given to most Vices,
and so was, and still is accounted of all that know him; Cardinals, Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> witness it.</p>
               <p>2. He gathered riches by Symony, and wicked means.</p>
               <p>3. By these Symoniacal riches he purchased a Cardinals place at great
rates.</p>
               <p>4. Possessing <hi>Bononia</hi> as Legate by tyranny and cruel exactions, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
and impiously he ruined the people, without all Justice or Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Getting thus to be Pope, like a Pagan he contemned all Divine Offices.</p>
               <p>6. That he is the oppressor of the poor, the persecutor of Justice, the
Pillar of the unjust, the Statue of Simoniacks, the servant of the Flesh,
the dregs of Vices, a stranger to Virtue, flying publick Consistories, wholly
given to sleep, and other fleshly desires; wholly contrary to Christ in life and
manners, the Glass of Infamy, and the profound Inventer of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
(or malice) so scandalous to the Church, that among faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that knew him, he was commonly called <hi>THE DEVIL IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CARNATE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. That as a Vessel of all sins, he repulsed the worthy, and gave all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
Benefices and Church-promotions to the bad that would give most
Money for them.<note n="*" place="margin">What was the Church then. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>8. Hereby the whole Church, Clergy and People, fell under infamy and
scandal.</p>
               <p>9. That of all these he was oft admonished and humbly intreated.</p>
               <p>10. That he was worse after than before, laying all pretence of Justice,
and openly selling all to the worst that would give him money.</p>
               <p>11. That growing yet stronger in Vices, he made divers Officers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to manage his Simony (as his Bailiffs) for all fat Cathedrals, Abbeys
Monasteries, Priorles, and vacant Benefices reserved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. That he charged his Registers to receive all the money before they
granted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. That he appointed certain Merchants to put vacant Benefices in the
Balance, and grant their Petitions that offered most for them.</p>
               <p>14. He ordered that no Petition for a Benefice be offered him, till it were
signed by the Refundary, who then was to pay it out of his own Estate if he
took too little.</p>
               <p>15. That against God and his Conscience he oft sold his Bulls to Eminent
men, in which he wrote, that they that had Benefices had resigned them to
him, and that by lying forged Resignation, which never was made, sold
them again for great sums, and beggar'd many.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:60852:208"/>
16. By this it came to pass, that without all difficulty he that gave most,
carried it: And the same course was held in Sacraments, Indulgences, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations,
and other Ecclesiastical and Spiritual Gifts.</p>
               <p>17. That he usually sold the same Benefice divers times over to divers
persons, or to the same, silencing Claims of Right; whereby the <hi>whole
Church</hi> was defiled with Simony,<note n="*" place="margin">Which Councils have judged Heresie.</note> filled with the unworthy, both in
higher and lower Prelacies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. That he refused to Confirm those that were Canonically Elected,
unless even to satiety they glutted him with Money, putting the unworthy
in their stead, and translated men against their wills from their Churches,
that he might sell them dearer.</p>
               <p>19. That promising Church-Reformation in the Council at <hi>Pisa,</hi> he
called one at <hi>Rome,</hi> and being there publickly admonished, being incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
by the Devils instinct, did worse.</p>
               <p>20. That he sold for Money Indulgences at the hour of death, the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Cross, Absolutions from fault and punishment, Concessions
of Churches and portable Altars, Consecrations of Bishops, Benedictions of
Abbots, Relicks of Saints, Holy Orders, power in Confession to absolve
from sins, and Acts that may be ministred only by the Operations of the
Holy Ghost for Grace.</p>
               <p>21. That one <hi>Nic. Pistorius,</hi> a <hi>Florence</hi> Merchant, and the Popes Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a Lay married man, was made by the Pope his Legate Apostolical, sent
into <hi>Brabant</hi> to exact and receive a Subsidy, which was the tenth part of
the fruit of all Benefices in divers Cities and Diocesses, and to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the refusers by a certain deputed Sublegate,<note n="†" place="margin">Like a Lay Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour and his Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</note> and suspend Colledges,
Covents, Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. That he authorized this <hi>Nicholas</hi> to grant to all persons, of each
Sex, for Money to choose their Confessors, that might absolve from fault
and punishment, by which the Merchant got vast sums of Money, seducing
the people.</p>
               <p>23. That all the Premises are known, true, proved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24. That <hi>Anno</hi> 1412. Ambassadors from the King, Bishops, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of <hi>France,</hi> admonished him charitably of this scandalous, infamous
Simony.</p>
               <p>25. That he amended not by it, but did worse.</p>
               <p>26. That he is defamed of all this in all Kingdomes of the Christian
World.</p>
               <p>27. That he abused <hi>Rome</hi> and the Churches Patrimony, exhausting the
people, and imbursing it himself, by Taxes, Gabels, <hi>&amp;c. Many instances are
added.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. For these things many Crimes, Sacriledges, Adulteries, Murders,
Spoils, Rapine and Thefts were committed in <hi>Rome,</hi> through his fault.</p>
               <p>29. It is the common voice, opinion, assertion and belief, that in these,
and innumerable other evils, he is the greatest Dilapidator and Dissipator
of the Church Affairs that ever was, scandalous to the Universal Church, a
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60852:209"/>
Witch, a Murderer, a Killer of his Brethren, Incontinent, in all things
serving the Vices of the flesh, of infinite crimes, called infamously <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30. That all this is notorious by common fame, repute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. That he hath sold the goods of Cardinals, Bishopricks, Parishes, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
Priories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. And this not only in the City about (many instances named.)</p>
               <p>33. That he destroyed University Studies, by taking the Salaries to
himself.</p>
               <p>34. Besides, he laid such burdens on the Parsons, as forced them to sell
the Church-goods, Ornaments, and Books.</p>
               <p>35. That hereby the whole Church was notoriously scandalized.</p>
               <p>36. The Infamy was so great, that Princes and the Emperour besought
him to amend.</p>
               <p>37. Hereupon he promised to amend, and to call this Council.</p>
               <p>38. But he went on, and did worse than before.</p>
               <p>39. He forbad the righting of the injured in judgment.</p>
               <p>40. That the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Embassadours, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
him to amend, and he gave them ill words, and threatned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
them.</p>
               <p>41. That at <hi>Constance</hi> he swore to resign for Peace.</p>
               <p>42. And he promised to submit to the judgment of the Council.</p>
               <p>43. He bid all say what they would against him.</p>
               <p>44. He was humbly intreated by the Council to perform his word.</p>
               <p>45. Yet thought by hiding himself to evade.</p>
               <p>46. Yet he professed before that he intended not to depart.</p>
               <p>47. And when the Church longed for peace, by the Council he plotted
to dissolve the Council, and so fled in a disguized habit.</p>
               <p>48. He fled to <hi>Schafhausen,</hi> and commanded some Cardinals and Bishops
to come to him.</p>
               <p>49. Thence he fled to <hi>Lauffenberge,</hi> and towards <hi>Brisac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50. The Council desired his return.</p>
               <p>51. He denied to answer, but fled to <hi>Nurenburg</hi> to frustrate the Council.</p>
               <p>52. He is an obdurate sinner, and incorrigible Fautor of Schism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>53. That all this is notorious, and the common repute of men.</p>
               <p>54. And all the premises are the common fame and voice. Here some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
is left out.</p>
               <p>And they begin as anew; 1. Declaring his wickedness from his Youth.</p>

crimes of Incontinence.</p>
               <p>3. That he Simonaically sold six Parish Churches in <hi>Bononia</hi> to Lay men,

               <p>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:60852:209"/>
4. That for Money he sold the Mastership of the Order of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>

with the fruits of Vacancies, and spoils of the last Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That he would not recall this, but on condition.</p>
               <p>1. That the K. of <hi>Cyprus</hi> should be paid (by them that succeeded) all the
Money back which he gave to the Pope.</p>
               <p>2. That the Pope should have more, six thousand Florins of Gold,
which the Prior of <hi>Rhodes</hi> paid, and for which the Hospitallers are yet
in debt.</p>
               <p>3. He reserved for the said Bastard the Magistral Chamber, worth two

               <p>4. That the said Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> gave Fryar <hi>Iacobus de Vitriaco,</hi> an ancient
man, and expresly professing the Hospitallers Religion, an Absolution from
his Vows, Rule and habit of Religion, and reduced him to a Secular life,
and Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for six hundred Ducats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many other Articles I pass by, as tedious to be repeated: One was,</hi> That
he was a notorious Simoniack, and a pertinacious Heretick: <hi>Another was,</hi> That
often before divers Prelates, and other honest men, by the Devils perswasion be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously
said, asserted, dogmatized, and maintained, that there is no Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
nor any after this: And he said, and pertinaciously believed, that mans Soul
dieth with the body, and is extinct, as are the Bruits: And be said, that the Dead
rise not, contrary to the Article of the Resurrection, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He sent an Epistle to the Emperour to beg mercy <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>Sess. 12. The Articles being shewed the Pope, his Answer is recited:
Viz.</hi> That he repented of his filthy departure, and ratified all the Councils Process
against him, and would give no other Answer to their Charge, affirming, that the
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> was most holy, and could not err; and was the <hi>Pisane</hi>
Council continued, and he would never contradict the Council, but publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that he had no right in the Papacy: That he would be much pleased that the
Sentence against him might be quickly passed, and sent him, which with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
he would receive, and as much as in him lay confirm, ratifie, approve, and
divulge; and did then ratifie, approve, and confirm all their Process against him,
and promise never to gainsay them.</p>
               <p>The Council decreed, that when the Papacy was void, none should be
chosen without them, and they that attempted it should be punished, and
the Election be void.</p>
               <p>Next the Definitive Sentence of Deposition was past against him.</p>
               <p>Next they decreed, that none of the three present Popes should ever be
elected again.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Sess. 13. The Council decreed, <q>that though Christ after Supper
instituted, and to his Disciples administred the Sacrament in both kinds,
Bread and Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though in the Primitive Church the faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it in both kinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the contrary custome of the Church should
be a Law, which may not be reprobated without the Churches Authority,
or changed: And to say that this is sacrilegious and unlawful, is erroneous,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60852:210"/>
and the pertinacious Assertors to be proceeded against as Hereticks (that
is, burnt.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they take power to change Christs Sacrament, and that when they
suppose it to be his very blood that they deny men, and make it Heresie
and death to obey God before them. This was the Reforming Council.</p>
               <p>Next they decree, that any Priest that giveth the Sacrament in both
kinds shall be excommunicated, and used as a Heretick, even by Secular
Power, that is, burnt.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Sess. 14. <hi>Carolus de Malatestis</hi> recited in the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> 12.
his Renunciation of the Papacy, and <hi>Greg.</hi> approved the Council. The
Council absolveth all men from his obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> confirm some of his
Acts, require the third Pope to resign, and declare him, if he refuse, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Schismatick, and pertinacious Heretick.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Sess. 15. After a severe Decree for silence, and no contradiction,
the Articles of Heresie charged on <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> were read, the sum of many
is as followeth.</p>
               <p>1. As Christ is both God and Man, so the consecrated Host is the Body of
Christ, at least in Figure, and true Bread in Nature.</p>
               <p>2. That he declareth to the heretical lyars about the consecrated Host, that they
can never declare or understand an accident without a subject.</p>
               <p>3. This is my body, is such a figurative speech, as <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The madness of feigning an accident without a subject, blasphemeth God,
scandalizeth the Saints, and deceiveth the Church.</p>
               <p>5. Its foolish and presumptuous to desine, that the Infants of the faithful are
not saved, dying without the Sacrament of Baptism.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>light</hi> and <hi>brief Confirmation</hi> by Bishops, solemnized only by the
Rites said over, was introduced by the Devil, and to delude the people in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Church, and that the solemnity and necessity of Bishops may be the <hi>more
believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Against Oyl, anointing Children, and the Linnen Cloth, as a light Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Vocal Confession made to a Priest, introduced by <hi>Innocent,</hi> is not so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
as he defineth: He that by thought, word or deed offendeth his Brother, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
him to repent by thought, word or deed.</p>
               <p>9. The Priest hearing Confession as the <hi>Latines</hi> do, is grievous and groundless,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>A good life is a good sign of a true Minister.</p>
               <p>The ill life of a Prelate substracteth the Subjects acceptation of Orders, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sacraments; and yet in case of necessity they may receive of such, piously
praying that God will make up himself by these his Diabolical Ministers, the work
or end of the Office which they are sworn to.</p>
               <p>Ancient persons that despair of children may lawfully marry for temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,

The Pope that falsly calls himself the servant of the servants of God, is in no
degree of Evangelical service, but worldly; and if he be in any order, it is in
that of Devils, serving God more culpably by sin.</p>
               <p>The Pope dispenseth not with Simony, being the Capital Simonist, vowing rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to keep a most damnable state.</p>
               <p>That the Pope is <hi>summus Pontifex</hi> is ridiculous: Christ never approved such
a Dignity in <hi>Peter,</hi> or in any other.</p>
               <p>The Pope is the Patron of Antichrist; not only that single person, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Popes from the time of the Churches Donation, the Cardinals, Bishops,
and other their Complices, is the compounded monstrous person of Antichrist: And
yet <hi>Gregory,</hi> and other Popes that did good in their lives fruitfully repented at
last: <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> and other helpers in the Faith, were not Popes, but
Gods helpers to edifie the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>That this Papal Preeminence had its rise from the Gospel, is as false, as that
all Errour arose from the first Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are twelve Procurators and Disciples of Antichrists, the</hi> Pope, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
Patriarchs, Arch-bishops, Bishops, Arch-deacons, Officials, Deans,
Monks, <hi>forked</hi> Canons, <hi>false</hi> Fryars, <hi>and</hi> Questors.</p>
               <p>Its as clear as the light, that he is greatest, and next Christ in the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
that is most humble, most serviceable, and most loveth the Church in the love of
Christ.</p>
               <p>He that unjustly possesseth any good thing of God, taketh anothers by theft.</p>
               <p>Grace is necessary to dominion: (He meaneth, 1. Not of right before men, but
God. 2. Nor of special grace only, I suppose,</p>
               <p>Without the Law of Christ inwarldly, Charters and Papers give not ability
and justice.</p>
               <p>We must not by gifts cherish a known sinner, being a Traytor to God.</p>
               <p>Divers are against temporal power or right in wicked men in mortal sin: But I

are not of God, and some Philosophical Opinions; which how far
<hi>Huss</hi> held them, I take this Catalogue for no proof without his words, the
Context and Explication.</p>
               <p>All these are mentioned as taken out of <hi>Wickliff;</hi> but <hi>Huss</hi> is condemned
for these following Articles.</p>
               <p>§. 13. 1. That there is one holy Vniversal Church of all the Predestinate.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Paul</hi> was never a Member of the Devil.</p>
               <p>3. That Reprobates are not parts of the Church, for no part of it finally fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
away, Predestinating Love never forsaking him.</p>
               <p>4. Two Natures, the Divinity and Humanity, are one Christ.</p>
               <p>5. The same as afore.</p>
               <p>6. Taking the Church for the Predestinate, it is an Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Peter</hi> was not, nor is the Head of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:60852:211"/>
8. Priests of wicked lives polute the Priestly power.</p>
               <p>9. The Papal dignity arose from the Emperour, and the Popes prefecture and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
flowed from <hi>Caesars</hi> power.<note place="margin">☞</note>
               </p>
               <p>Divers of Popes and Priests that live wickedly are not the Apostles Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
               <p>Delivering men to Secular powers (because excommunicate) is to imitate the
Scribes and Pharisees above Christ.</p>
               <p>Ecclesiastical obedience is obedience after the Priests invention without any
express authority of Scripture.</p>
               <p>All humane Acts are distinguished into virtuous and vicious.</p>
               <p>A Priest of Christ living after his Law and understanding the Scripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to Edifie the people, ought not to obey the Pope or any Prelate that forbids
him to preach, and excommunicateth him.</p>
               <p>Every one made a Priest hath a command to preach and must obey it,<note place="margin">☞</note> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
excommunication.</p>
               <p>By Church Censures of excommunication, suspension and interdict, the Clergy
keeps the Laity under their feet for their own exaltation, and multiply avarice,
protect malice, and prepare the way to Antichrist; It is an evident sign that such
Censure, proceed from Antichrist, in which the Clergy principally proceed against
those that open the nakedness of Antichrists wickedness, which the Clergy will
for themselves usurp.</p>
               <p>If the Popes be wicked men and reprobates, then as <hi>Judas</hi> an Apostle was a thief
and traitor and son of perdition, so they are no heads of the Church, when they are
no members.</p>
               <p>The grace of predestination is the bond of the Churches union with the head.</p>
               <p>A wicked and reprobate Pope and Prelate is equivocally a Pastor, and truly a
thief and robber.</p>
               <p>The Pope should not be called most holy.</p>

<hi>Flor.</hi> Council. The Wars still continued round about him: The Council
at <hi>Basil</hi> deposed <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and made <hi>Amadeus</hi> D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> (a Pious man)
Pope, called <hi>Faelix 5. Eugenius</hi> held on and yielded not; Blood and Murders

               <p>§. 24. CCCCLXXII. This great Council at <hi>Basil</hi> began 1431. and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
1442. the History of it is too large to be much recited. The <hi>Bohemians</hi>
exasperated by the <hi>burning of their Teachers,</hi> and the <hi>Popes Excommunications,</hi>
and the <hi>Decrees to burn them,</hi> defended themselves by Arms under <hi>Zisca,</hi>
and were usually victorious: They were therefore invited to the Synod,
which they received with tears of joy; but for the sake of the case of <hi>Huss</hi>
and <hi>Hierome,</hi> durst not trust their safe Conduct, till after the promise of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Princes, and the Synod. They sent fifteen; the <hi>Bohemians</hi> four daies
pleaded their four Articles: <q>1. For the Sacrament in both kinds.<note place="margin">☜</note> 2. For
correcting and eliminating publick sins, or crimes. 3. For liberty to preach
Gods Word. 4. Of the Civil Power of the Clergy.</q>

(many daies upon one point) answered the rest; and dispute begat
dispute, and so some motioned a reconciling Conference: But they could
not agree, and the <hi>Bohemians</hi> returned, and the Council sent many of
their Members with them to <hi>Prague,</hi> whom the City received civilly, and
heard them, exhorting them to their Opinions; but they still desired sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in their four Articles. Many Debates there were, and by explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the terms they came to understand each other, and a fair beginning
of reconciliation was made; but the first Article of the Sacrament in both
kinds stuck so, that they could not get over it, though the Council confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that they had power to dispense in it. But though there be reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

unless made the Magistrates Officers) yet such reasonable things
are hardlier obtained than more disputable matters; because flesh and
blood, worldly interest, and the Devil, is most against them: And of this
great famous Council of Bishops, after Petitions, and some good words,
and hopeful approaches, they could <hi>never one of them be obtained,</hi> but tricks
were devised to elude their hopes, and inconveniences pleaded that would
follow such Concessions; (the ordinary way of the carnal Clergies hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

               <p>§. 25. The first Session being for introduction, to shew their lawfulness,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60852:213"/>
in the second Session they decreed, as did that at <hi>Constance,</hi> that a General
Council is above the Pope, in matters of Faith, Schisme, and Reformation:
And Sess. 3. that the Council may not be dissolved: And they admonish
the Pope to retract his Revocation, and to own and assist the Council.</p>
               <p>After they declare, that the Pope may not make Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> during

that only the Elect, and not all the Justified, are Members of Christ;
that besides the Union of Love, there must be another Union with Christ;
that the Humane Nature in Christ is truly Christ, and the Person of Christ,
and the Person of the Word; that Christ loveth his Humane Nature as
much as his Divine; that the two Natures are equally lovely; that the
Soul of Christ seeth God as clearly as the Godhead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus worketh the
temerarious mind of man.</p>
               <p>§. 27. Sess. 24. There is a Treaty for a more General Council and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and the place assigned at <hi>Basil, Avignion,</hi> or <hi>Savoy;</hi> and
to defray the charges, money to be gathered of Christians, who, if they give
as much as will keep their houses a Week,<note place="margin">☞</note> are rewarded with the pardon of
all their sins, where the liberality of their Pardons is expounded; <hi>viz.</hi> it
is only the pardon of such sins <hi>de quibus corde contriti, &amp; ore confessi fuerint,
which their hearts are contrite for, and their mouths confess;</hi> and these are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
on a further condition, that besides this money given, they do for a
year fast one day every Week more than else they were obliged to do by the
Church; and if they be Clerks, say every such day seven Psalms, or a Mass;

been for the Bishops, might not a <hi>contrite Confessor</hi> have been certainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
without such formalities.</p>
               <p>§. 28. In divers following Sessions they prosecute Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Council at <hi>Ferrary</hi> to be but a Schismatical Conventicle, and they
establish these <hi>Catholick Verities,</hi> or Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sess.</hi> 33. 1. That a General Council representeth the whole Church,<note place="margin">☞</note> and hath
its power immediately from Christ, and that over the Pope, and every other person;
and that this is a truth of Catholick Faith.</p>
               <p>2. That such a Council lawfully congregate, may not without their own consent
be dissolved, prorogued, or transferred; and that this is an Article of Catholick
Faith.</p>
               <p>3. That a pertinacious repugner of these Verities is to be judged a Heretick.</p>
               <p>§. 29. <hi>Sess. 34. They depose Pope</hi> Eugenius <hi>as a sentenced,</hi> notorious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate

§. 30. Here I would crave the Readers consideration:<note place="margin">☜</note> 1. If this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Great Council erred in all these matters of fact, whether the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Council be a good proof of the Papists sort of Tradition?</p>
               <p>2. If they erred in these Articles of Faith, whether it weaken not both
their Tradition and grounds of their faith; and whether such an heretical
perjured Popes consent would have made them Infallible?</p>
               <p>3. Whether their General Councils be not contradictory <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4. Whether a great part of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their last named
Councils, be not Hereticks in the judgment of this Council?</p>
               <p>5. Seeing Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> continued when the Council had deposed him

               <p>§. 31. Sess. 36. They decreed the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> as a point of Faith; and yet many of their Doctors take it yet as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined,
and many still are of the contrary mind.</p>
               <p>§. 32. After this follow Decrees about Election of a Pope, and they make
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> Pope, <hi>Faelix</hi> 5. and so we have two Popes again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onuphrius</hi> calls this the thirtieth Schisme: He continued Pope above
nine years, and then resigned to <hi>Eugenius</hi> for Peace. Sess. last: They recite
the Heresies of Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as against the foresaid Verities.</p>
               <p>§. 33. Next is added the Bull of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 5. approving the
Acts and deeds of the Council at <hi>Basil:</hi> And then are divers Synodical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
and Answers, specially proving Councils above the Pope, and against
his Crimes, and of the justness of his deposition, very large; as also against
his Conventicle Council, and against his Adherents, that is, most of their
Church since, with Answers to his Invectives, and Monitories to draw men
from his obedience. In the <hi>Appendix</hi> are many more Epistles and Orations,
and a Treatise of the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to prove the Pope above Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.
There are many Epistles of the Pope against the Council, and of the
Emperour to the Council, and of many other Princes.</p>
               <p>§. 34. <hi>The</hi> Bohemians <hi>Epistles place their main cause upon the four fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Articles:</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>I.</hi> The Sacrament in both kinds. <hi>II.</hi> That the Word of
God may be freely, publickly, and truly preached by those that it belongeth to.
<hi>(for they were silenced,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>III.</hi> That Civil Dominion <hi>they mean not all
Propriety, but</hi> Power of the Sword, <hi>or force over mens Estates and persons,
which is the Magistrates)</hi> as a deadly poyson be taken from the Clergy, <hi>(they
spake from feeling.</hi>) <hi>IV.</hi> That publick, and great or heynous sins, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated
from among the vulgar of the faithful by lawful Powers.</q> 
                  <hi>This was
the Religion of the</hi> Bohemians, <hi>and the denying of these was the cause of
all their cruel Persecutions, and the blood there shed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 35. In confutation of these Demands are adjoyned four Treatises of
the four Preachers that spake against them: What Cause so great or plain,
that men cannot talk against with many and confident words. I. <hi>Ioh.
Ragusius</hi> acknowledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the regulating sufficiency of the Scripture,<note place="margin">☜</note> hath
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:60852:214"/>
hath an Oration (a Treatise) against the Sacrament in both kinds.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Aegidius Carberius Decanus Cameracensis</hi> hath a Treatise (four days O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
against their request, for <hi>correcting heynous publick sins;</hi> where
much learning and reading is poured out, to save sin: And in particular
it is maintained,<note place="margin">☞</note> that the Clergy may not be punished by the Laity (some
few cases excepted) not being therein their Subjects. (It seems the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
would have had wicked Priests punished) And it is specially pleaded,
that no wickedness of Clergy or Laity will warrant any Nation to separate
from their Unity (that is, <hi>Roman</hi> Government;) and to that end, the
badness of the Church Militant to be endured is described.</p>
               <p>When he cometh to the Popes pardons, he denieth that Pardons <hi>à culpâ
&amp; poena</hi> are usually the Popes stile; whereas I have before cited their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words so speaking often:<note place="margin">☞</note> And he honestly maintaineth out of the
School-men,<note place="margin">Bin <hi>pag.</hi> 319.</note> that God only can give pardon <hi>à culpâ,</hi> save as any Priest as
<hi>instrumentum animatum</hi> may <hi>vi clavium</hi> dispose the receiver, and declare <hi>Gods
pardon, and remit part of the temporal punishment; but sometimes the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
part of the Church-penances, and so it is that Priests are said to forgive
sins.</hi> (Mark this, against our present Papists, that reproach the Protestants
for this Doctrine.)</p>
               <p>III. Next is <hi>Henr. Kalteisen,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Inquisitors Oration against the
<hi>free preaching of Gods Word by Ministers:</hi> (for this would have undone the
Pope and his Clergy:)<note place="margin">☞</note> The <hi>Bohemians,</hi> whom he confuteth, maintained:
<q>1. That Gods Word is so perfect,<note place="margin">See the old Reformers Doctrine.</note> that nothing should be added or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
2. That the wickedness of Priests is the great cause of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ruine. 3. Against Venial sin as against Gods Counsels differing from
Laws. 4. That every Priest and Deacon is bound to preach Gods Word
freely, or else sins mortally; and after Ordination he should not cease
(that is, when he was forbidden by silencing Bishops, or others) no not
when excommunicated, because he must obey God rather than man; and
that Bishops are bound to preach as well as Presbyters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Answer first noteth, that <hi>Papa non est nomen Ordinis sed Iurisdictionis;</hi>
that Gods Word is <hi>Incarnate, inspired,</hi> written; that it is expounded by the
same Spirit that inspired it: (But hath the Pope the same gifts of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?)
That the <hi>Inspired Word</hi> is publick or private; that the Bishops De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
in Councils are Gods <hi>publick inspired Word:</hi> (see here the Enthusiastical
pretence of Episcopal Inspiration, is the ground of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and tyrannies, and deposition of Princes) to them he applieth, <hi>He
that heareth you, heareth me;</hi> whence he gathereth the danger of disobeying
that Council (and so the Popes Heresie.) The rest is worth the reading, but
too long for me to repeat:<note place="margin">☞</note> Much of it is to shew, that Reading and Massing
is more needful than Preaching, and that every Priest that Masseth is not
bound to Preach; there needeth many Mass-Priests, and not so many
Preachers; and that silenced excommunicated Priests are bound to cease
preaching, and obey the Prelates: But he had the wit to add <hi>(if silenced for
a reasonable cause)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> and to confess that <hi>Sententia injuste lata à suo judice si er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:60852:214"/>
inducat, vel poceatum mortale afferet, nec timenda est nec tenenda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 364. He denieth that it is any Precept of Christ: 1. To receive the
Cup, 2. Or that Priests Preach, 3. Orto abolish all mortal sin, 4. Or for the
Clergy not to be Civil Governours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<hi>Lordships</hi> and <hi>great wealth.</hi>

               <p>§. 36. The Papists confess that this Council was <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and rightly
called and confirmed; but they pretend that it was <hi>partly reprobate</hi> by the
Popes removal of the Council, and that Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 5. approved it but in

               <p>Here note, that there were two <hi>General Councils</hi> at once; and how could
they both (or either of them) be truly Universal:<note place="margin">☜</note> The Papists call it the

(having made twenty seven Cardinals (against the Council of <hi>Basils</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees)
from whom is their succession) and <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 5. succeeded him:
<hi>Italy</hi> still continued in bloody Wars; Pope <hi>Faelix</hi> at last resigned; and so
there was once more but one Pope. And that you may see still how far the
Pope was from governing all the World, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was again seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to recover their Liberties,<note place="margin">☜</note> and had a Plot against him, one <hi>Steph. Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
being the Chief, and the Pope secured himself by hanging many of
them.</p>
               <p>§ 40 The Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and those Bishops that pretended
a Union with <hi>Rome,</hi> in hope of help, found the people and Clergy there ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
averse to come under the Pope, and they had no help from him, nor
any of their desired successes; for now the <hi>Turks</hi> took the City, and killed

of all the Popes, especially an Orator: He was against the Pope for the
superiority of Councils at</hi> Basil; <hi>but when he was made Pope, he recant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. In his Epistle to his Father he excuseth himself for having a Bastard,
and for fornication, (particularly with an</hi> English <hi>Woman that lodged in

subject to the higher power; and it is manifest that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is placed in
the top (or Crown) of the Church, from which <hi>(his power of Government)</hi> we
know that no Sheep of Christ at all is exempted.</p>
               <p>O then how much worse is the case of the <hi>Abassines, Armenians, Greeks,
Protestants,</hi> even three fourth parts of the Christian World, than of the
Heathens, being all certainly damned for not believing in the Pope: How
much more necessary to Salvation is it to please and honour the Pope, than
any Angel or Saint in Heaven? But how false is it that the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>

§. 45. <hi>Paulus</hi> 2. succeedeth <hi>Pius,</hi> a man just and clement, saith <hi>Platina</hi>
himself; yet, saith he, before he was Pope, he could get what he would by
begging, even with tears, of the Pope and great men: And when he was
Pope, all about him sounded with Wars, and Benefices were theirs that
would give most for them; and in his fears some-body muttering, that one
<hi>Callimachus</hi> had a Plot against him, he set all on tumult to find out the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
when there was no such thing: He had before cast out of their
places all the Colledge of <hi>Abbreviates</hi> that had bought their places under
<hi>Pius,</hi> of whom <hi>Platina</hi> being one, and not getting Audience and relief,
wrote him a Letter, that <hi>they would go to Princes, and get a Council called to
relieve them:</hi> For this he was accused of Treason, and laid in Irons by a
long imprisonment: And after his release, upon this Dream of a Plot, he
and many more were not only imprisoned, but tortured and tormented to
force them to confess that which never was: Many died of the torments,
even of the worthiest young men of the City. After a long time poor <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
with a broken body is delivered, but the Prisoners at last were accused
of Heresie, that they might not seem to have suffered for nothing: <hi>Platina</hi>'s
Heresie was, that he had praised <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Learning, and had
disputed about the Godhead, which was a questioning it; and the Pope
himself was so much against Learning, that he used to call studious men He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and to perswade men that their Sons must learn no more than to
read and write. Here <hi>Platin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bloodshed: Wonderful! that our late Papists think that all the Christian
World hath still obeyed the Pope, when none have so much fought against
him as the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Italians: Onuphrius</hi> (who here beginneth

War against the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and interdicteth them all publick worship:
(the Popes ordinary profane Usurpation, forbidding whole Cities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
all such publick worship of God, which <hi>Robert Groshead</hi> said was the
part of Antichrist, and the Devil.) The wisdome of <hi>Laurence Medices</hi> ended
the War when it seemed near the consuming flames; and the <hi>Turks</hi> invading

<hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> one of the Popes Bastards, being a Cardinal, laid by his
holy Order, and set himself to conquer all the Princes of <hi>Italy:</hi> Historians

of Cities, basest treachery, too long to be by me recited: He mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

his Army, and the Pope flattered them with confident promises into
a Peace, till they foolishly trusting him, he got them into his power, and
murdered them: Some Cardinals the Pope commanded to drink poyson,
and at last having more great men to dispatch, Cardinals and Citizens at
a purposed Feast, the Pope ordered his Butler to prepare poysoned Wine for
them, and mistaking the Cup, he gave it to the Pope, and his Son <hi>Caesar:</hi>
The Pope died of it; but <hi>Caesar</hi> being young, and diluting his Wine, was
recovered, but his Army hereby scattered. If you would see the History of

for all the numerous Bishops of <hi>Italy,</hi> this General Council had but 114.
Bishops: <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether any of them came from <hi>Abassia, Egypt, Armenia,

This great Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, after long Wars, and many Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and sharp Persecutions, was at last weary of all, and resigned his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,<note place="margin">See the History of <hi>Charles,</hi> Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and betook himself to a private life in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he died, strongly
suspected of repentance and inclination to the Reformed Doctrine himself:
He bequeathed nothing (as was usual) to any Religious House, or Order:
There were found papers about him for the Protestant Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
his Confessor, and another Doctor that attended him, were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
suspected of Heresie, and one persecuted, and the other put to death
by the Inquisition. Thus errour, sin, and worldly violence are never true
to themselves, but must be repented of at last, and none can stand to them
when the light prevaileth.</p>

but not without suspition of poyson. The same <hi>Onuphrius</hi> (whom I

Ceremonies, but he was profusely given to Voluptuousness, Hunting, Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Luxury, splendid Feastings, Musick, and to get money sold Cardinalships,
invented Offices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and yet was the most liberal of all the Popes that ever had
lived to that day, excessively loving Musick,</hi> &amp;c.) This was Papal Piety, by
which he merited a Monument inscribed <hi>OPTIMO PRINCIPI

which began his fall: <hi>Verily they have their reward,</hi> saith Christ of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,

               <p>§. 61. It is to be noted, that as the great ignorance and wicked lives of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy were the great advantage to <hi>Luthers</hi> success,<note place="margin">☞</note> (as the gross
idolatry and wickedness of Heathens was to Christianity of old) and the
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of the Reformers were the means of their common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance;
so hereupon the Papacy perceived a necessity of greater Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and some Reformation, for its own defence from utter ruine: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
many were awakened, and addicted to seek Learning, and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councils made some Canons for amending the Clergies lives; so that
their encrease of Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some amendment of manners, was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by the Protestants; yea, the Popes themselves have since then been far
less vicious and turbulent than before.</p>

much less troubled with Papal terrours and wars, than heretofore; and all
is for fear lest if the Pope should anger them, the rest of the Princes should
forsake him. Heretofore if one Kingdome stood up against the Pope, the
rest were ready blindly to obey his Commands, to fall upon them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them: But now the Reformed Nations have more strength to defend
themselves, and those that shall joyn with them: The truth is, <hi>it is Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

refused it; and being asked whom he thought most eligible, he said
none but <hi>Charles</hi> was fit. For this noble mind, he was offered 30000 Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
of money, which he constantly rejected: And when they urged him
that 10000 might be given to his servants, he said, let them that will take
it, but he that taketh any shall not stay to morrow with me, and taking horse
went his waies, lest they further troubled him: Thus saith <hi>Erasmus, Epist. l</hi> 13.

Chronol. p.</hi> 533.</p>
               <p>§ 65. The Reformation forced the <hi>German</hi> Bishops to make many reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Canons, at <hi>Colen, &amp;c.</hi> Among those of an <hi>Augustine</hi> Synod our own
strife about communicating maketh me think of no loss of time to recite
their Catalogue of persons that were to be denied the Sacrament of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<hi>viz.</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <p>1. Heathens, Infidels and Hereticks. 2. The Excommunicate. 3. All
men at a time of common Interdict. 4. Men that go from their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
for it. 5. Those that are under age: And distracted, possessed, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deots.
6. Those that are troubled with crudity of stomacks (till cured.)
7. Infamous persons, as Juglers, Players, Jesters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 8. Women that
wear Mens apparel. 9. Separatists and Conventiclers. 10. The Sect of
the Beggars of <hi>Lyons.</hi> 11. The superstitious. 12. Those that have not
contrition and confession, living in sin. 13. That live in notorious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as Adultery, Usury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till their actual reformation. 14. Deserters
of Marriage unallowed. 15. Those that play much at Dice. 16. That are
given to drunkenness, gluttony, comessations, spend daies in Taverns; And
if they amend not they are to be put to death. 17. That detain other
mens goods. 18. That break and spoil Temples. 19. That encroach on
others lands and grounds. 20. Servants that being corrected refuse their
duty to their Master after it. 21. They that use false weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
22. That pay not Tythes. 23. That delay to execute Testaments.
24. That obstinately despise the Customes of the Church, and meet else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
25. That disturb the Preachers, or go out of Church contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
26. That will not hear Mass and stay the end. 27. That use un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
labour on the Lords day or holy daies. 28. That marry secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
29. That slothfully or contemptuously refuse to learn the Lords prayer,
and Creed. 30. That blaspheme or prophanely swear. 31. That reproach
and dishonour Priests. 32. Murderers, Enemies, revengeful and oppressors.
33. That preserve not carefully their Childrens Lives. 34. That make
Laws against Church Liberties, or Judge by such Laws, or lay burdens and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
on Churchmens persons or goods. 35. Those that judge that money
received on Usury is not to be restored.</p>
               <p>§ 66. The Reformers accusations of the Popish Clergy had this effect, to
make them confess many of their faults, especially drunkenness, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as being the cause of the peoples distaste and desertion; see the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
at the Councils of <hi>Augusta,</hi> and <hi>Trevers;</hi> and the Council at <hi>Trevers</hi>
made strict Canons against them, especially for removing Concubines from
the Priests. And one at <hi>Colen</hi> 1549. is large for some reformation; but
especially careful to keep out true Reformation, forbidding the books of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
by name. Among other things they forbid baptizing Children in
private houses, except Kings Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And another Council at <hi>Mentz</hi>
hath the whole sum of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine and Discipline at the best, save
the matters of the Papacy; and these late provincial Councils made Canons
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:60852:219"/>
in the frame of them, not much of our <hi>English</hi> Canons and our Articles of
Religion set together. And another Council at <hi>Trevers</hi> repeateth their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinary
Canons in part, and addeth more.</p>
               <p>§ 67. The History and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are sufficiently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Oath conjoyned; so that I need not speak of that
which I intend not to make any part of the matter of this Epitome, which
extendeth but to the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation.</p>
               <p>68. Even after the Reformation, the Pope could not live in <hi>Italy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fighting: Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> fought with <hi>Octavius Farnesius</hi> at <hi>Parma;</hi>
Pope <hi>Paul</hi> sought with the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> but was beaten: He set sixteen
Cardinals over the Inquisition (the defence of his Kingdome): He impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
Cardinal <hi>Morrovius</hi> suspected of heresie, absolved after by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the
<hi>4th.</hi> who yet strangled <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and beheaded Cardinal <hi>Leonard,</hi> Count
<hi>Montarius, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 69. Cardinal <hi>Charles Borrhomeus</hi> (sainted by them) at divers Millane
Councils shewed a great deal of Reforming, and some deforming zeal. In
the first Council I shall note that they decreed that men once admitted to
the Communion, and returning to their sin, be no more admitted till the
Priest see that they have actually reformed their lives. And that before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
young persons first receive, they shall some dayes be <hi>examined,</hi> and taught
the use and reason of the Sacrament, Priests notoriously criminal must not
say Mass till they amend their lives. No Physician must give physick to
any after four dayes sickness that is not confest to the Priest (on pain of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication).
Bishops are forbidden to stand when Princes sit, no not
for saying Grace at meat: nor otherwise to depress and abject themselves
to Princes. Parish Priests must have a book of the Names, Sex, Age, and
State of every Parishioner. Whores are to dwell in their assigned places, and
to be known by their apparel from others. Dancing, Playes, Dice, Selling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
forbidden on the Lords dayes and holy dayes. Indeed the <hi>Roman</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was never set out with greater advantage of piety and reformation
than in the copious Decrees of <hi>Carolus Borrhomeus</hi> in the <hi>Milan</hi> Councils:
To which a Council at <hi>Aquileia</hi> added, endeth <hi>Binnius</hi> his History of
Councils.</p>
               <p>§ 70. In all this History of Councils, Bishops and Patriarchs it appeareth
that <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima;</hi> As the sacred Ministry in pious humble
wise, peaceable and sincere men, hath been Gods great means of planting,
ordering, preserving and encreasing his Church, and converting, edifying,
and saving Souls, and such to this day are as <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Timothy</hi> (not the
Church) <hi>(A Pillar and Basis of the truth in the Church, which is the House of
the Living God)</hi> the Husbandmen that still cultivate the Vineyard of the
Lord, while with self-denial, and faith, and heavenly minds, they labour
to promote holy WISDOME, LOVE, SPIRITUALITY and PEACE,
abhorring pride and worldly designs, and being mostly little noted in the
Histories of the Church, as not appearing in the turbulent and publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the world: so contrarily <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>worldliness,</hi> seeking Dominion,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:60852:220"/>
favour and wealth, to feed also sensuality with fleshly pleasure, by Satans
great diligence have corrupted sacred Societies, Doctrine, Worship, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Conversation, and when the Prince of pride and darkness, the
God of this World, could not directly expugne Christianity, he hath under
pretence of Government, Unity, and Advancement to the Church, set his
Malignant Ministers in the Chairs and Pulpits of the Church to do his
work, and fight down piety, love and peace in the name of Christ, and as
it were by his Authority; and instead of persecuting Heathens, Satan hath
set up <hi>contentions, dividing,</hi> and <hi>silencing,</hi> and <hi>persecuting Prelates,</hi> to smite
the true Shepherds, and scatter the Flocks; and as for <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> to
tread down the true life of <hi>Faith, Love</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and to be the Capital E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Church, while they would make themselves its Heads, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers
and Defenders; so that the <hi>chief good</hi> and the <hi>chief mischief</hi> hath
come to the Church by the means of the Pastors: And no Schismes, no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
no Persecutions have been more grievous, than those that have been
caused by a tyrannical and contentious Clergy; witness all the Conciliary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Schismes, Wars, and Bloodshed mentioned in this Collection; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the many hundred thousand <hi>Albigenses, Waldenses,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
as for the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Church;</hi> witness the 30000. or 40000. at once
murdered at the <hi>French</hi> Massacre; witness the horrid cruelties of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
witness the Volumes of burned and otherwise murdered Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;
and witness the <hi>Irish</hi> Zeal stirr'd up by their Clergy, that murdered
two hundred thousand in so narrow a room as that small Country, and in
so few Weeks: And whoever is the Antichrist, certainly in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Militant Tyrannical Church-Clergy is found <hi>the blood of the Saints,</hi> and
Martyrs of Jesus; and as proud <hi>contentious Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> ruined
Religion and the Empire in the <hi>East,</hi> and gave it up to <hi>Mahometan</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and cruelty, so have they under the name of Christianity impugned the

                  <l>His grave aspect had more of Heaven than Hell;</l>
                  <l>Only there was a handsome picture by,</l>
                  <l>To which he lent a corner of his eye:</l>
                  <l>As Sin in <hi>Greece</hi> a Prophet was before,</l>

                  <l>The rather since his scattered juglings were</l>

Religion, Church or Ministry I adde two papers which I long agoe

sorts.</head>
                  <p>AS mans first felicity was attended with the malice of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
so is the wonderful work of his Restauration. The promise
of Reconciliation by the seed of the woman, is joyned with a proclamation
of open war with the Serpent and his seed. The enmity was hottest in the
Devil and his seed against Christ himself, who bare and overcame it; and is
become the Captain of our salvation, that his Church may overcome by
his Cross and Strength, and Conduct; The next degree of malice is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his officers: the most eminent, the General Officers had the hottest
assault; and his ordinary Officers bear the next: That we shall be hated
of all men for the name of Christ, <hi>(Mat. 10. 22.)</hi> is still verified to our
experience. Not only the openly prophane abhor us for our work sake,
but false-hearted professors that turn from the truth, do presently turn
Malignants against the Ministry; and many weak ones that are better
minded, are dangerously seduced into a guilt of the sedition. To all these
I here proclaim in the name and word of the Lord, <hi>Numb. 16. 26. [Depart
I pray you from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest
ye be consumed in all their sins.]</hi> Which I shall now open to you.</p>
                  <p>1. The office of the Ministry is an undoubted Ordinance of God, to
continue in the Church to the end of the world. No man can pretend
that they ceased with the Apostles, for it is Gods will that ordinary fixed
Presbyters shall be ordained in every Church, <hi>Acts. 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5. 1
Tim. 3. 1. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2. And Pastors and Teachers are appointed for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, and edifying of the
body of Christ, till we all come to a perfect man, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. A
Ministry authorized to Disciple the Nations, baptize and teach them, is
instituted by Christ as King and Saviour, and have his Promise to be with
them alway to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. The same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and work continueth; still souls are born and bred in darkness, and
how shall they be saved without believing, or believe without hearing,
or hear without preaching, or we preach without sending? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:60852:221"/>
14, 15. There is a clearer word in the Gospel for the Ministry then the
Magistracy; though enough for both. Our own call I shall sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ak of
anon.</p>
                  <p>2. These Malignants set themselves against the Principal members of
the body of Christ, that are in it as the eyes and hands to the natural body,
1 <hi>Cor. 12. 16, 19, 27, 29. Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 15. The Ministers of Christ, and
Stewards of the Mysteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. The Over-seers of the
flock that is purchased with Christs blood, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 28. They are the
chief members, 1. in office, 2. ordinarily in gifts for edification of the
body: 3. and in grace. Now a wound in the stomack or liver is more
mortal to the body, then in the hand: and the loss of an eye or hand is
worse then the loss of an ear.</p>
                  <p>3. These Malignants are therefore principally enemies to the Church
it self. They take on them to be only against the Ministers, but it will
prove most against the people and whole Church. If they smite the
Shepherds, the sheep will be scattered. How can they more surely ruine
Christs family, then by casting out the Stewards, that must rule, and
give the children their meat in due season, even milk to the babes, and
stronger meat to them of full age, <hi>Heb. 5. 12, 13, 14. Luke. 12. 42. Mat.</hi>
24. 45. What readyer way to ruine the Schools of Christ, then by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the Teachers that he hath appointed under him? Or to ruine his
Kingdome, then to reject his officers? Or to wrong the body, then to cut
off the hand, and pull out the eyes, or to destroy the principal parts?
Was it not Ministers that planted the Churches, and converted the world
and have ever born off the assaults of enemies? Where was there ever
Church on earth that continued without a Ministry? The great Kingdom
of <hi>Nubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> fell from Christianity for want of Preachers. The Nations
that have the weakest and fewest Ministers, have the least of Christianity;
and those that have the most and ablest Ministers, have the most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
state of Religion. All over the world the Church doth rise or fall
with the Ministry: Cut down the Pillers, and the building falls. He is
blind that sees not what would become of the Church, were it not for
the Ministry? Who should teach the ignorant, or rebuke the obstinate,
explain the word of truth, and stop the mouths of proud gain sayers?
What work would heresies, and division, and prophaneness make, if
these banks were cut down; when all that can be done is still too little.
It must needs therefore be meer enmity against the Church, that makes
men malignant against the Ministry.</p>
                  <p>4. The design of the maligners of the Ministry is plainly against the
Gospel and Christianity it self. They take the readyest way in the world
to bring in Heathenism, Infidelity and Atheism, which Christianity hath
so far banished, For it is the Ministry that Christ useth to bring in light,
and drive and keep out this damnable darkness, <hi>Acts 26: 17, 18. [I send
thee to open their eyes, and turn them from darkness to light, &amp;c.]</hi> Why are
so many Nations Infidels, Mahometans, and Idolaters, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t for want of
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:60852:222"/>
Ministers to preach the Gospel to them? These Malignants therefore
would take down the Sun, and banish Christianity out of the
world.</p>
                  <p>5. And they hinder the Conversion of particular souls, and so are
the cruellest wretches on earth. Though an Angel must be sent to <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
it is not to be instead of a Preacher, but to send him to a Preacher,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. Though Christ would wonderfully appear to <hi>Saul,</hi> it is to send
him to <hi>Ananias</hi> for instruction, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Though the Jaylor must feel an
Earth-quake, and see Miracles, it is but to prepare him for the Ministers
words, <hi>Acts 16. Philip</hi> must be carried by an Angel to expound to an
Eunuch the Word that must convert him. The Ministry is Gods institut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
settled way, by which he will convert and save the world, as truly
as the light is the natural way by which he will corporally enlighten them
<hi>Acts 2. 18. 1 Tim. 4. 16. Mat. 5. 14. Rom.</hi> 10. 14. Do you think so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
souls would be converted if the Ministry were down? Do you not
see that the very contempt of them, that the scorns of the ungodly, and
opposition of Malignant Apostates have occasioned, doth hinder most of
the ignorant and prophane from receiving the saving benefit of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
How many millions of souls would these wretches sweep away to
Hell, if they had their will? While thousands are in damnation for want
of the light, they would take it from you, that you might go there also.
Do you not understand the meaning of these words, against Christs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
Why the meaning is this: They make a motion to the people of the
Land, to go to Hell with one consent, and to hate those that are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to keep them out of it. They would take the bread of life from your
mouthes. They are attempting an hundred times more cruelty on you,
than <hi>Herod</hi> on the Jews when he killed the Children, or the Irish that
murdered the Protestants by thousands; as the soul is of greater worth
then the body.</p>
                  <p>6. These Malignants against the Ministry are the flat enemies of Christ
himself, and so he will take them and use them. He that would root out
the inferiour Magistrates, is an enemy to the Soveraign; and he that is
against the officers of the Army, is an enemy to the General; Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to stay visibly on earth, and to Teach and Rule the world
immediately in person; but he that is the King will Rule by his Officers;
and he that is Prophet will Teach us by his Officers; and therefore he
hath plainly told us, <hi>[He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that dispiseth you,
despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me, Luke 10. 16.]</hi>
O fearful case of miserable Malignants! Durst thou despise the Lord thy
Maker and Redeemer, if he appeared to thee in his glory! to whom the
Sun it self is as darkness, and all the world as dust and nothing? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when thou next speakest against his Officers, or hearest others speak
against them, that their words are spoken against the face of Christ, and
of the Father. I would not be sound in the case of one of these Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
when Christ shall come to judge his enemies, for a thousand worlds.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:60852:222"/>
He that hath said, <hi>[Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm;
and hath rebuked Kings for their sakes, Psal.</hi> 105. 15. will <hi>deride</hi> all those
that would <hi>break his bands,</hi> and will <hi>break them as with a rod of iron, and
dash them in pieces as a potters vessel, Psal.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 9. And as he hath told
them plainly, <hi>[Who so despiseth the Word shall be destroyed, Prov. 13. 13.]</hi>
And <hi>[he that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 8. So he hath
told us that <hi>it shall be easier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then for such, Mat.</hi> 10. 15. Many a thousand prouder enemies then
you hath Christ broken; and look to your selves, for your day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If you had but <hi>stumbled on this stone, it would have broken you in pieces;</hi>
but seeing you will strive against it, it will <hi>fall on you, and gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pouder, Mat.</hi> 21. 44. And then you shall see that he that made them his
Embassadors, will bear them out and say, <hi>[In as much as you did it
to these, you did it to me.]</hi> And you shall then say, <hi>Blessed are they that
trust in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. It is apparent that these enemies of the Ministers are playing the
Papists game. Because the just disgrace of <hi>their</hi> Ministry, was the ruine
of <hi>their</hi> Kingdom; therefore they hope to win of <hi>us</hi> at the same game.
They know that if the people were brought into a hatred or suspition of
their guides, they might the easier be won to them. They tell us in
their writings, that not one of ten of our people but taketh his faith on
trust from their Teachers, and therefore take them o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f from them and
they will fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l: but they delude themselves in this: For though the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
among us have no true faith of their own, and the Godly must
lean on the hand of their supporters, yet there is in them a living prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and we do not as the Papists priests, teach our people to see with
our eyes, and no matter for their own: but we help to clear their own
eye-sight. Doubt not but the most of the sects in the Land that fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Ministry, are knowingly or ignorantly the agents of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
For the principal work of a Papist is to cry down the Ministry and
the Scripture, and to set all they can on the same work.</p>
                  <p>8. These sects that are against the Ministry do all the same work as
the Drunkards, Whore-mongers, Covetous, and all ungodly persons in
our Parishes do: And therefore it seems they are guided by the same
spirit. It is the work of Drunkards and all these wicked wretches to hate,
and despise, and revile the Ministers, and to teach others to say as they.
And just so do Quakers, Seekers, Papists and all other Malignants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the same Ministers: And yet the blind wretches will not see that
the same Spirit moveth them.</p>
                  <p>9. It is apparent that it is the Devils game they play, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and Kingdom which they promote. Who fights against Christs Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Army, but the General of the contrary Army? What greater
service could all the world do for the Devils, then to cast out the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ? and what more would the Devil himself desire, to
set up his Kingdom and suppress the Church? Wretches! you shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

see your Master, and he will pay you your wages contrary to your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Read Gods word to a Malignant, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>10. These Enemies do reproach as faithful a Ministry as the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth,
and their malice hath so little footing, as that the result must be
their own shame. Among the Papists indeed there are Mass-Priests that
can but read a Mass, whose Office is to turn a piece of Bread into a God:
And yet these the Malignants either let alone, or liken us to them. The
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and most of the Christian World, have a Ministry
that seldome or never preach to them, but read Common-prayer, and Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
The most of the Protestant Churches have a learned Ministry that is
so taken up with Controversies, that they are much less in the powerful
preaching and practise of godliness: Above all Nations under Heaven, the
<hi>English</hi> are set upon Practical Divinity and Holiness, and yet even they are
by Malignity chosen out for reproach. Alas, scandals in the Ministry, (as
drunkenness, swearing, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> among other Nations are but too common:
but in <hi>England</hi> Magistrates and Ministers combine against them. Ministers
are still spurring on the Magistrates to cast out the insufficient, negligent
and scandalous; and desire and use more severity with men of their own
profession, than with Magistrates, or any others in the Land. In nothing
are they more zealous, than to sweep out all the remnant of the scandalous:
And for themselves, they are devoted to the work of the Lord, and think
nothing too much that they are able to perform, but preach in season and
out of season, with all long-suffering and Doctrine; and yet Malignants
make them their reproach.</p>
                  <p>11. It is abundance of pride and impudency, that these Malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are guilty of. They are most of them persons of lamentable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and yet they dare revile at the Teachers, and think themselves wise
enough to rebuke and teach them: Many of them are men of wicked
lives; and yet they can tell the world how bad the Ministers are. A Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
a Drunkard, a covetous Worldling, an ignorant Sot, is the likest person
to fall upon the Minister; and the Owl will call the Lark a Night-bird.
Alas, when we come to try them, what dark wretches do we find them! and
should be glad if they were but teachable: And yet they have learnt the
Devils first Lesson, to despise their Teachers.</p>
                  <p>12. And O what barbarous ingratitude are these Malignant Enemies of
the Ministry guilty of! For whom do we watch, but for them and others?
Can they be so blind as to think a painful Minister doth make it his design
to seek himself, or to look after great matters in the world? Would not the
time, and labour, and cost that they are at in the Schools and Universities,
have fitted them for a more gainful trade? Do not Lawyers, Physitians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
live a far easier, and in the world a more honourable plentiful life? Have
not the Ministers themselves been the principal Instruments of taking down
Bishops, Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons, Prebends, and all means of
preferment? And what have they got by it, or ever endeavoured? Speak
malice, and spare not. Is it any thing but what they had before? Even the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:60852:223"/>
maintenance due to their particular charge. Unthankful wretches! It is
for your sakes and souls that they study, and pray, and watch, and fast, and
exhort, and labour, to the consuming of their strength; and when they
have done, are made the Drunkards Song, and the scorn of all the
wicked of the Country; and when they spend, and are spent, the more
they love, the less they are beloved. In the times of this greatest prosperity
of the Church, they live under constant hatred and scorn, from those that
they would save, and will not let alone in sin. And what do they endure
all this for but Gods honour, and your salvation? Would we be Ministers
for any lower ends? Let shame from God and man be on the face of such a
Minister! I profess, were it not for the belief of the greatness, and necessity,
and excellency of the Truths that I am to preach, and for the will of God,
and the good of Souls, I would be a Plow-man, or the meanest Trade, if
not a Sweep Chimney, rather than a Minister. Must we break our health,
and lay by all our worldly interest for <hi>you,</hi> even for <hi>you,</hi> and think not our
lives and labours too good or too dear to further your Salvation; and must
we by <hi>you,</hi> even by <hi>you,</hi> be reproached after all? God will be Judge between
you and us, whether this be not inhumane ingratitude; and whether we
deserve it at your hands?</p>
                  <p>13. Yea, it is <hi>Injustice</hi> also that you are guilty of. <hi>The labourer,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>is worthy of his hire, Luke</hi> 10. 7. (Mark that, you that call them
<hi>Hirelings) The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 17.
<hi>Especially they that labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> And will you throw
stones at their heads for endeavouring to save your souls? Will you spit in
their faces for seeking with all their might to keep you from Hell? Is that
their wages that you owe them? But blessed be the Lord, with whom is
our reward, though you be not gathered, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 5. But as you love your
selves, take heed of that Curse, <hi>Ier. 18. 20. [Shall evil be recompenced for
good? for they have digged a pit for my soul: Remember that I stood before thee
to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them, &amp;c.]</hi> O how
many a time have we besought the Lord for you! that he would convert
you, and forgive you, and turn away the evil that was over you: And
when all these our prayers, and groans, and tears shall be remembred against
you, O miserable souls, how dear will you pay for all!</p>
                  <p>14. And is it not a wonder that these Malignants do not see what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
light of Scripture they contradict; and how many great express
Commands they violate? They break the fifth Commandment, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
honour as well to spiritual Ecclesiastical Parents, as to Civil and
Natural. And he that curseth Father and Mother, his Lamp shall be put
out in darkness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 20. The eye that mocketh at his Father, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley shall pick it out, and
the young Eagles shall eat it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 17. Did these wretches never read,
1 Thes. 5. 12. <hi>We beseech you brethren, to know them which labour among you,
and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in
love for their work sake, and to be at peace among your selves.]</hi> And Heb. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:60852:224"/>
[<hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch

them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the Word of God.]</hi> And
so <hi>ver.</hi> 24. And 1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>The Elders that rule well are worthy of double

feel these fly in your faces when you oppose the Ministers of Christ? Doth
a Thief or Murderer sin against plainer light than you?</p>
                  <p>15. These Malignants sin against the consent and experience of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church of Christ till this day. The whole Church hath been for the
Ministry, and instructed by them; and as the Child doth seek the Breast,
so did new-born Christians, in all Ages, seek the Word from the Ministers,
that they might live and grow thereby. And all the Nations of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World are for the Ministry to this day! Or else they could not be for
Christ, and for the Church, and Gospel. Is it not plain therefore that these

                  <p>16. Moreover they sin against the experience of all, or almost all the
true Christians in the world. For they have all experience, that Ministers
are either their Fathers, or Nurses in the Lord: And that by their means
they have had their life, and strength, and comforts; their sins killed, their
graces quickned, their doubts resolved; the taste of the good Word of
God, and of the powers of the world to come? May we not challenge you
as <hi>Paul</hi> oft doth his Flock, Whether you did not receive the illuminating
sanctifying Spirit by the Ministry, if ever you received it? I tell you, it is
as much against the new and holy nature of the Saints to despise the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ, as it is unnatural for a Child to spit in the face of his Father
or Mother. And the experience of sound Christians will keep them clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
and help them much against this inhumanity, what ever Hypocrites
may do.</p>
                  <p>17. And if these Malignants had not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, they would sure
have considered, that the experience of all Ages tells them, that still the
most wicked have been the Enemies of the Ministry, and the most godly
have most obeyed and honoured them in the Lord; and that this Enmity
hath been the common Brand of the rebellious, and the fore-runner of
the heavy wrath of God; and that it hath gone worst with the Enemies,
and best with the Friends of a godly Ministry. Do I need to prove this,
which is so much of the substance of the Old Testament, and the New?
Was it the Friends or Enemies of all the Prophets, Apostles and Ministers
of Christ, that Scripture and all good Writers do commend? Do not the
names of all Malignants against the godly Ministry stink above ground, as
the shame of mankind, except those that are buried out of hearing, or
those that were converted?</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Nay such as are noted for the</hi> highest <hi>sort of the wicked upon Earth;
worse than Drunkards, Whorem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:60852:224"/>
of Gods Ministers have been ever taken as walking Devils: And
the hottest of Gods wrath hath faln upon them. Take two instances;
1. When the</hi> Iews <hi>went into Captivity, this was the very cause,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.
15, 16. [But they mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his words, and
misused his Prophets, till the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there
was no remedy. 2. <hi>And when the</hi> Iews <hi>were cut quite off from the Church,
and made Vagabonds on the Earth, this was the very cause,</hi> Acts 28. 28.
Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and that they will hear it.] 1 Thes. 2. 15, 16. <hi>These Jews</hi> [both killed the Lord
Iesus, and their own Prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God, and
are contrary to all men, forbidding us to speak to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they might be
saved to fill up their sin alway; for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.]</p>
                  <p>19. It is the Devils own part that these Malignants act: For it is he that
is the great Enemy of Christ, and the Saints, and he that is <hi>the Accuser of
the Brethren, which accuseth them before God day and night:</hi> And is not this
the work of Quakers, Drunkards, Papists, and all Malignants? But the
Lord will rebuke them, and be the glory of his servants, <hi>Zach. 3. 1, 2. [He
shewed me</hi> Joshua <hi>the High-Priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said unto Satan; The
Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen</hi> Jerusalem.]</p>
                  <p>20. These Malignants do most of them condemn themselves; for they
honour the Ancient Ministers of Christ that are dead, even while they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and hate the present that are living, who are the nearest Imitators of
their Doctrine and life that are on Earth! The name of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> they honour, and some of them keep Holy-days for them; and at the
same time hate and reproach those that preach the same Doctrine, and
that because they tread in their steps. They honour the names of <hi>Austin,</hi>
and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> and other Ancients; and hate those that preach
and live as they did. They speak honourably of the Martyrs that were
burned to death for the Doctrine of Christ; and at the same time they hate
us for doing as they did. What difference between the Calling, Doctrine
and lives of those Martyred Ministers, and these that are now alive? O
wretched Hypocrites! do you not know that these Apostles, Fathers, and
other Ministers did suffer in their time from such as you, as we now do, and
more? Hear what Christ saith to such as you, <hi>Mat. 23. 29, 30, 31. [Woe to
you Scribes, Pharisees, Hypocrites; because ye build the Tombs of the Prophets,
and garnish the Sepulchres of the Righteous, and say, If we had been in the days
of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
Prophets: Ye are witnesses to your selves, that ye are the children of them which
killed the Prophets: fill ye up then the measure of your Fathers: Ye Serpents, ye
Generation of Vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell?]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Moreover, these Malignants do harden themselves against the fresh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st
of the Judgments of God, which some of their own hands have executed;
and justifie the Presecutors, and succeed them in their fury. Have you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
what God hath done here against the Papal Enemies of the Gospel
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:60852:225"/>
and Ministry, in 88. and the Powder-plot, and many other times? Have
you already forgotten how the persecutors of a godly Ministry have sped
within these sixteen years in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> And dare you now
stand up in their room and make your selves the heirs of their sin, and
punishment, and justifie them in all their Malignity? What do you but
justifie them, when you rave against and revile the same sort of Ministers,
and many of the same persons, whom the former Malignants persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
and oppose the same sort of Ministers that the Papists burned? And
would not you do the like by them if you had Power in your hands? Can
any wise man doubt of it, Whether Papists, and Quakers, and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
that now make it their work to make the Ministry odious, would not
soon dispatch them if they could? Blessed be the great Protector of the
Church, for were it not for him, our lives would soon be a prey to your
cruelty.</p>
                  <p>22. And indeed if these Malignants had their wills, they would undo
themselves, and cut down the bough they stand upon, and destroy the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hope and help that is yet le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t for their miserable souls: It is for the
sake of Gods servants among them that judgements are so long kept off
them. And as long as the Gospel and Ministers remains, salvation is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them: the voice of mercy is calling after them, <hi>Repent and live.</hi>
They have the light shining in their eyes, which may at last convince
them, as <hi>Paul</hi> was convinced of his persecution: the voice which they
despise may possibly awake them. Though they have less hope then
others; yet there is some, But if they had their will, and were rid of
the Ministry, alas what would the forlorn wretches do? Then they might
damn themselves without disturbance, and go quietly to hell, and no body
stop them, and say, <hi>[Why do you so?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. And I pray you consider what it is that these men would have?
What if the Ministers were all cast out? would they have any to do Gods
work in their stead, or none? If <hi>none,</hi> you may see what they are doing:
If <hi>any,</hi> Who, and where are they? Is it not horrible Pride if all these sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
souls do think that they can do it better themselves? And what else
do Quakers and all these sects that are the enemies of the Ministry? Do
they not go up and down the Land, and say to the wisest holyest Teachers,
as if they took them by the sleeve, <hi>[Come down and let me preach that can do
it better: Come down thou deceiver and ignorant man, and let me come up that
am wiser, and better, and known more: Out with these proud Lordly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and let us be your Teachers, that are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re holy, and humble, and self-denying
then they.]</hi> Is not this the loud language of their actions? And
can you not hear the Devil in these words of highest Pride and Arrogancy?
But really Sirs, do you think that these men would teach you better? And
is there enow that are wiser and better then we to fill up our rooms, if
we were out? Do but prove that, and you shall have my consent to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all the Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> to some place that hath greater need of
their labour, that they may no more trouble you that have no need of them,
and keep out better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="469" facs="tcp:60852:225"/>
24. Lastly, consider on what sensless pretences all this enmity against
the Ministry doth vent it self. You shall hear the worst that they have
to say against us, (though but briefly) and then judge.</p>
                  <p>1. The Quakers say, We are <hi>idle drones that labour not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should not eat. Answ.</hi> The worst I wish you, is, that you had but
my ease instead of your labour. I have reason to take my self for the least
of Saints, and yet I fear not to tell the accuser, that I take the labour of
most Tradesmen in the Town to be a pleasure to the body in comparison
of mine; (though for the ends and the pleasure of my mind, I would
not change it with the greatest Prince) Their labour <hi>preserveth</hi> health, and
mine <hi>consumeth</hi> it: They work in ease, and I in continual pain: They
have hours and dayes of recreation: I have scarce time to eat and drink:
No body molesteth them for their labour; but the more I do, the more
hatred and trouble I draw upon me. If a Quaker ask me, what all
this labour is, let him come and see, or do as I do, and he shall
know.</p>
                  <p>2. They accuse us of <hi>covetousness and oppression, because we take tithes or
hire,</hi> (as they call it.) <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Is it not malice or sacrilegious covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that frameth this accusation? <hi>Whose</hi> are the Tithes? are they <hi>ours</hi> or
<hi>theirs?</hi> The same Law of the Land that makes the nine parts theirs, doth
make the tenth ours. If we have no title to the tenth, they have none
to the rest. We ask none of our people for a farthing. They <hi>give</hi> it not
to us: It was never <hi>theirs.</hi> When they buy or take leases of their Land,
it is only the nine parts that they pay for, and if the tenths were sold
them, they should pay themselves a tenth part more. And would these
men make all the people thieves and covetous, to take or desire that which
never was their own? Nay would they have them rob God, to whom
for his service the Tithes were devoted? Read, <hi>Mal. 3 8, 9, 10. Rom. 2.
22. Gen. 14. 20. Heb.</hi> 7. 6, 9. And whether Tithe it self be of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
still, is more then they are able to disprove. Sure I am, when
Christ told them of <hi>tithing mint and cummin,</hi> he saith, <hi>These ought you to have
done, and not to leave the other undone, Mat.</hi> 23. 23. 2. But most certain I am
that God hath made it our duty to <hi>meditate</hi> on his word, and <hi>give our selves
wholly thereto, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 15. and that we may <hi>[Forbear working, and not go
on warfare at our own charge; and sowing to men spiritual things, should reap
their carnal things: Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things,
live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at the Altar, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
with the Alter? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach
the Gospel should live of the Gospel.] 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 3. And know
you not that the primitive Christians gave not only the tenths, but all
that they had, and laid it at the Apostoles feet? to shew that the Gospel
teacheth more clearly then the Law, the necessity of Dedicating our
selves and all that we have to God. 4. And yet I must say, that we are
<hi>content with food and rayment.</hi> Most Minist in <hi>England</hi> would be glad to
give you all their tithes, if you will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but allow them food and raim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:60852:226"/>
for themselves and families, and such education for their children as
is fittest to make them serviceable to God. And I hope it is no sin to have
mouths that must be fed, or backs that must be cloathed. What! must
Gods Ministers above all others be grudged <hi>food and rayment,</hi> and that
of the Lords portion, which none of you pay for? I fear not to imitate
<hi>Paul</hi> stopping the mouths of malicious accusers, and to tell you, that the
Ministers, whose expences I am acquainted with, do give 500. pence, for
50. that they receive by gift from their people: and that they take all that
they have as Christs, and not their own, and if they have never so much
they devote it wholly to him, and know he's not beholden to them for
it: and some of them lay out in charitable uses, much more then all the
tithes that they receive for their Ministerial maintenance. And if the
Quakers that accuse them of covetousness, would cast up accounts with
them, I doubt not but it will be found that they receive more by gift
then Preachers, and give not the fourth part so much when they have
done.</p>
                  <p>3. Another accusation is, that we <hi>preach false Doctrine, and deceive the
people. Answ.</hi> It's easie to say so of any man in the world: But when
they come to prove it, you will see who are the deceivers.</p>
                  <p>4. Another is, that we are <hi>persecutors, and like the Priests of old, and so
all the reproofs of them and the Pharisees belong to us. Answ.</hi> This is soon
said too: but where's the proof? For themselves we have no mind to be
troubled with them. Let them let us alone, as long as we will let them
alone. But yet they shall be taught one day to know, that if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
stop the mouths of such railers and abusers of God and men, he
doth no more persecute them, then he persecuteth a thief when he hangeth
him; or then <hi>Paul</hi> persecuted <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> when he delivered
them up to Satan; or <hi>Elymas, Acts</hi> 13. 11. or then <hi>Peter</hi> persecuted <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira, Acts</hi> 5. or then God would have had the Churches
be persecutors against the woman <hi>Iezebel</hi> that was suffered to teach and
seduce the people, or against the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans which God
hated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 15, 20. If <hi>hindering sin,</hi> be <hi>persecuting,</hi> the <hi>calling</hi> of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>
is to be a persecutor, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and all parents m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

own children.</p>
                  <p>5. Another accusation is, that we are <hi>against the preaching of any but our
selves. Answ.</hi> Who doth not desire that all the Lords people were Prophets?
But yet we know all are not Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 29. nor Teachers. We
would have none of Gods gifts in our people buried, but all improved to
the uttermost for his glory. But we would not have men turn Ordinary
Teachers, that are neither sound, nor able, nor sent; nor every self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
ignorant man, have leave to abuse the name and word of God, and
the souls of men. What would you have more then is granted you?
When any unordained man that is judged competent by the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of Approbation (of whom some are Souldiers) may be a constant
preacher, and have fullest maintenance, as well as Presbyters?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:60852:226"/>
6. Another Charge is, that <hi>we are some weak, and some scandalous.
Answ.</hi> We do all that we are able to cast out such; and I think never more
was done. The Magistrate sets his Guard at the door, and lets in none but
whom he please: and sure if he knew where to have better than those that
are in, he would put them in, or else he is too blame: If he do not know,
will you blame him for using the best that he can get? But if you will come
and help us to cast out any that are vicious and unworthy, we will give
you thanks.</p>
                  <p>7. Another Accusation is, that <hi>we differ among our selves, and one saith one
thing, and another another thing. Answ.</hi> 1. And are all these Sects that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us better agreed among themselves? Enquire and judge. 2. Do not
all preach one Gospel, and the same Essentials of the Christian Faith? And
we expect not perfect Unity, till we have perfect Knowledge and Holiness;
which we dare not boast of, whatever <hi>Quakers</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>8. Another Accusation is, that <hi>we are not true Ministers.</hi> And why so?
Because we have not an uninterrupted succession of lawful Ordination.
<hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection is the Papists, who have little reason to use it, while
it is so easie a matter to prove so many interruptions of their Papal succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
At large and often have we answered them, and are still ready to deal
with any of them herein, and to prove; 1. That an uninterrupted successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of right Ordination, is not of necessity to the being of the Ministry.
2. And if it were, we have more to shew for it than they. If others stick
on this, let me tell them, that Magistracy is as truly from God as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry:
And let ever a King on Earth shew me an uninterrupted succession
giving him Title to his Crown, and I will shew him a more undoubted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or Title to my Ministry. But here's no room to discuss this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                  <p>9. Object. <hi>But you are Parish Priests, and no true Ministers, because you have
not true Churches. Answ.</hi> All the Christians in our Parishes that consent are
our Flock: And we undertake to prove the truth of such Churches, not
only against scorn, but against all the Arguments that can be brought.</p>
                  <p>10. Object. <hi>But you have not the Spirit, and therefore are no true Ministers.
Answ:</hi> And how prove you that we have not the Spirit? The approvers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
none but such as they think have the Spirit. He that is sanctified hath
the Spirit: Prove us unsanctified, and we will resign our Office. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<hi>You read your Sermons out of a Paper; therefore you have not the Spirit.
Answ.</hi> A strong Argument! I pray you take seven years time to prove the
consequence. As wisely do the <hi>Quakers</hi> argue, that because we use Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or Hour-glasses, and Pulpits, we have not the Spirit. It is not want of
your abilities that makes Ministers use Notes; but it's a regard to the
work, and the good of the Hearers. I use Notes as much as any man, when
I take pains; and as little as any man when I am lazy, or busie, and have
not leisure to prepare. It's easier to us to preach three Sermons without
Notes, than one with them. He is a simple Preacher that is not able to
preach all day without preparation, if his strength would serve; especially
if he preach at your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:60852:227"/>
11. <hi>Object.</hi> But the true Ministry is persecuted; but so are not you, but
are Persecutors of others. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. For our persecuting others, be so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
as to prove it to us, that we may lament it. If punishing wicked men
and Seducers be persecuting, not only <hi>Paul</hi> was such, that wished <hi>they were
cut off that troubled the</hi> Galatians; but God himself would be the greatest
of all persecutors, that will lay you in Hell without repentance, and then
you will wish your old persecution again. And if we be not persecuted,
what means the reproaches of you and all the Drunkards and Malignants
about us? But I pray you envy us not our lives and liberties, and a little
breathing time. Do you not read that <hi>[The Churches had rest throughout all</hi>
Judea, <hi>and</hi> Galilee, <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>and were edified, and walking in the fear of
the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied? Acts 9. 31.]</hi>
Envy not a little prosperity to the Church. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> pray that the
Gospel <hi>may run and be glorified, and that we may be delivered from unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
wicked men, 2 Thes.</hi> 3. 1. Sometimes you can say that more glorious
days are promised, and that the Saints shall rule the world. Unmerciful
men! It is but a while ago since we had our share of sufferings! Since that
the Sword hath hunted after us! Many of our Brethren are yet in <hi>America,</hi>
that were driven thither: at this time in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and
<hi>Savoy:</hi> Alas, what do our Brethren suffer in the same Cause and Calling that
we are in! And do you reproach us with our mercies, if we be out of the
Furnace but a little while, in one corner of the world?</p>
                  <p>Object. 12. <hi>You work no Miracles to confirm your Doctrine. Answ.</hi> It is
true; nor do we need: It is confirmed by Miracles long ago. If we
brought a new Gospel, or as the Papists, gave you not our Doctrine on the
credit of Scripture, but Scripture and all on our own credit, then you
might justly call for Miracles to prove it: But not when we have nothing
to do but expound and apply a Doctrine sealed by Miracles already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, I say,</hi> Let any Prince on Earth that questions our Calling, shew his Title
to his Crown, or any Iudge or Magistrate to his Office; and if I shew not as good
a Title to mine, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe corruption of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church being most in the Errours and
Vices of the Priests, which made men abhor the offering of the Lord

much prepare men to hearken to the Reformers: The observing of this,

the Papists to bend their force against the Ministers of the Reformed

make them seem ignorant, unworthy, or no Ministers to the people. On
this Errand they send abroad their Agents; this is the saving Gospel that

Doctrine we are preaching, the Opposers work is to call us Deceivers, and
ask, How we prove our selves true Ministers? My work therefore at this
time, for the sake of the ignorant in our Assemblies, shall be, to acquaint
them with our answer to this demand. And I shall give it you in order, in
certain Propositions.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 1. <hi>Both in the Old and New Testament there is mention of two distinct
sort of Ministers of Gods appointment.</hi> First, such as received some <hi>new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
(either a Law, or a particular Message) <hi>immediately from God;</hi> so that
the people could not be sure that their Doctrine was true, till they were
sure that the men were sent of God. These were called <hi>Prophets</hi> in the Old
Testament, and <hi>Apostles, Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. in the New. So <hi>Moses</hi> received the
Law from God; and the following Prophets their particular Messages. So
the Apostles received the Gospel from Christ; and so did the Seventy, and
other Disciples that conversed with him; and other Prophets and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
had it by immediate inspiration. All these were necessarily by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or some Infallible Evidence to prove their own Call, before the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
could receive their Doctrine: for this was their Message; <hi>[The Lord
hath commanded me to say thus or thus to you]</hi> or <hi>[The word which the Lord
spake to me is thus or thus]</hi> This sort of Ministers the Papists and Seekers
do confess.</p>
                  <p>But besides these, there is a second sort of true Ministers, whose Office is
not to receive from God any new Doctrine, Law, or Message; but to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Laws already delivered,</hi> and <hi>teach men the Doctrine already revealed,</hi> and
to <hi>oversee and govern the Churches of Christ</hi> according to his Laws, and to go
before the people in the worship of God: The Prophets and Apostles did
both these; both reveal the Doctrine which they received from Christ, and
teach and guide the Church by it when they had done; but the latter sort
of Ministers do but the latter sort of the work. The Papists and Seekers
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:60852:228"/>
cheat men by jumbling all together, as if there were no Ministers of Gods
appointment, but those of the former sort; and therefore they call for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to prove our Ministry. Here therefore I shall first prove, that the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
sort</hi> of Ministers are of Gods Institution. 2. That such need not prove
their Calling by Miracles, though yet God may work Miracles by them if he
please. 3. That <hi>we are true Ministers of Christ, of this sort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Christ found such Ministers under the Law, that were to teach and
rule by the Law before received, and not to receive new Laws or Massages,
I mean the ordinary <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> as distinguished from <hi>Prophets.</hi>
These Priests were to keep the Law, and teach it the people, and the people
were to seek it at their mouth, and by it they were to judge mens Causes:
and also they were to stand between the people and God in publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as is exprest, <hi>Deut: 31. 26. Iosh. 23. 6. Neh.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3, 8, 18. &amp; 9. 3. <hi>Levit.
1.</hi> &amp; 2. &amp; 4. &amp; 5. &amp; 7. &amp; 13. &amp; 14. throughout, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 12.
<hi>Mal. 2. 7. Ier.</hi> 18 18. The Prophet had Visions; but the Priest had the Law,
<hi>Ezek 7. 26. Isa. 8. 16, 20. Hag. 2. 11, 12. Num. 1. 50 1 Chron.</hi> 9. 26. &amp; 16. 4.
2 <hi>Chron</hi> 19. 11. &amp; 20. 19. &amp; 30. 17, 22. He was called, <hi>A Teaching Priest,
2 Chron. 15. 3. Lev. 10. 10, 11. Deut. 24. 8. 2 Chron 17. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. Ezek. 44. 23.
2 Chron.</hi> 35. 3. And Christ himself sends the cleansed to the Priest, and
commandeth <hi>them to hear the</hi> Pharises <hi>that sat in</hi> Moses <hi>Chair,</hi> though they
were no Prophets: so that besides the Prophets that had their message im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God, there were Priests that were called the <hi>Ministers of the
Lord,</hi> Joel 1. 9. 2. 17. and Levites that were not to bring new Revelations,
but to <hi>teach,</hi> and <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> him according to the old. <hi>For</hi> Moses <hi>of old
time hath in every City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every
Sabbath day,</hi> Acts 15. 21. The <hi>Iews</hi> rejected Christ because they <hi>knew him
not; nor the voice of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath day,</hi> Acts 13. 27.
<hi>And even unto this day, when</hi> Moses <hi>is read, the Vail is on their heart,</hi> 2 Cor.
3. 15. And they that <hi>would not believe</hi> Moses, <hi>and the Prophets</hi> (thus read and
preached) <hi>neither will they be perswaded, though one rose from the dead,</hi> Luke 16.
29, 31.</p>
                  <p>2. And as Priests and Levites were distinct from Prophets before Christ,
so Christ appointed besides the Apostles and Prophetical Revealers of his
Gospel, a standing sort of Ministers, to 1. Teach, 2. Rule, 3. And worship
according to the Gospel which the former had revealed, and attested, and
proved to the world. These were called <hi>Overseers,</hi> or <hi>Bishops, Presbyters,</hi> or
<hi>Elders, Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> and also the <hi>Deacons</hi> were joyned to assist them,
<hi>Acts 14 23. They ordained them Elders</hi> (not Prophets or Apostles) <hi>in every
Church,</hi> Tit. 1. 5 <hi>Titus</hi> was to <hi>ordain Elders in every City: Timothy</hi> hath full
direction for the ordaining of Bishops, or Elders and Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That their work was not to bring new Doctrine, but to teach, rule, and
worship according to that received, I now prove, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2. The things
that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful
men, who shall be able to teach others also] <hi>Mark, that its the</hi> same, <hi>and not
a</hi> new <hi>Doctrine; and that as</hi> heard from <hi>Paul</hi> among many witnesses, <hi>and not
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:60852:228"/>
as received immediately from God: and others were thus to receive it
down from</hi> Timothy. <hi>And v.</hi> 15. Study to shew thy self approved unto God, a
workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.] <hi>It is
not to bring new Truths, but rightly to divide the old. And</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13.
Hold fast the form of words which thou hast heard of me <hi>(not which thou hadst
immediately from God)</hi> in faith and love which is in Christ Iesus; that good
thing which was committed unto thee, keep, by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in
us. <hi>The Holy Ghost is to help us in keeping that which is committed to us,
and not to reveal more,</hi> 2 Tim 6. 13, 14. [I give thee charge in the sight of
God, that thou keep this Commandment without spot, unrebukable, till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>There was a</hi> form of Doctrine delivered to the
Church of Rome, <hi>Rom. 6. 17. And</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 17. The Elders that rule well are
worthy of double honour, especially they that labour in the Word and Doctrine.
<hi>You see their work was to rule and labour in the Word and Doctrine,
1 Tim.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16. Till I come, give attendance to Reading, to Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to Doctrine; meditate upon these things: give thy self wholly to them,
that thy profiting may appear to all: Take heed unto thy self, and unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
continue in them; for in doing this, thou shalt both save thy self and them
that hear thee.] 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. [If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these
things, thou shalt be a good Minister of Iesus Christ, nourished up in the words
of faith, and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.] <hi>Mark here the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of a good Minister of Christ; one that's nourished up in the words
of faith, and good doctrine, (which is the use of Schools and Universities)
and having attained it, makes it his work to teach it, and put others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of it,</hi> Tit. 1. 7, 9, 10, 11. For a Bishop must be blameless, as the
Steward of God—holding f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast the faithful word as he hath been taught, <hi>(mark
that)</hi> that he may be able by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers:
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, whose mouths
must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not,
&amp;c.] <hi>So</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1, 5. <hi>The Office of a Bishop is to</hi> rule and take care of the
Church of God:] To take heed to themselves, and to all the Flock, and feed the
Church of God; <hi>and to</hi> watch hereunto, <hi>according to the</hi> word of Gods grace,
<hi>which is</hi> fully <hi>and wholly delivered by his Apostles, and</hi> is able to build us
up, and give us an inheritance among the sanctified: <hi>as</hi> Act. 20. 28, 20, 27,
35, 32. 1 Thes. 5. 12, 13. We beseech you brethren to know them which labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you <hi>(this is their Office)</hi>
and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake <hi>(and not revile them
as the servants of Satan do)</hi> and be at peace among your selves, <hi>Heb. 13. 7,
17,</hi> 24. Remember them which have the rule over you, which have spoken to you
the word of God: Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves,
for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it
with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. Salute all them
that have the Rule over you: The Elders of the Church <hi>are to</hi> pray <hi>with, and
for the</hi> sick <hi>Jam. 5. 14. They must</hi> feed the Flock of God among them, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the oversight of it, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 1, 2. Thus you see their Office and work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:60852:229"/>
2. <hi>And that they were not to bring any</hi> new Doctrine, <hi>further appears, in
that they have a charge to</hi> Preach no other doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 3. Nor</hi> to be
tossed as children with every wind of doctrine, <hi>Eph. 4. 14. Nor</hi> carried about with
divers and strange doctrines, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Yea, if any</hi> man bring not the doctrine of Christ, we must not receive him
into our houses, or bid him God speed, lest we be partakers of his evil deeds, for
he that abideth not in this doctrine hath not God, 2 <hi>John 9. 10, 11. Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 9.
[Though we or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel to you, then that
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so
say I now again: If any man preach any other Gospel to you then that ye have
received, let him be accursed.] <hi>And</hi> Rom. 16. 17, 18. Now I beseech you Brethren,
mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye
have learned, and avoid them] 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. If any man teach otherwise, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not to wholsome words, the words of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which is according to Godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—]</p>
                  <p>4. And if all Ministers must be receivers of new Doctrines, the Church
would never know when it hath all, but would be still obeying an imperfect
Law. 5. And it would be an oppression to the Church instead of a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to be so overwhelmed with new Doctrines and Precepts. 6. And it
would accuse Christ, the Lawgiver, of such mutability, as wise Princes are
not guilty of; to be still changing or adding to his Laws. 7. There was
great occasion for the New Testament or Gospel, upon the great work of
our Redemption: but there is no such cause for alterations since. 8. The
Priests before Christ were not to receive new Laws, as is said. 9. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of the Apostles that wrought Miracles, had not all new Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but did it to seal up this Gospel. 10. What need we more then actual
experience, that God doth not give New Revelations to the world, and
none since the Scripture times, have sealed any other by Miracles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thus I have proved to you the two sorts of Ministers: as</hi> Paul <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguisheth them,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 10, 11, 12. Eph 2. 20. <hi>There are</hi> Planters <hi>and</hi>
Waterers, Master builders that lay the foundation, and others that build thereon:
Other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid: but every man that
buildeth hay or stuble <hi>and loseth his work, doth not nullifie the Ministry.</hi>
We are built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ being
the head corner-stone: <hi>but we are not built on the</hi> foundation <hi>of every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
Teacher, Elder, Bishop or Deacon: Though both in their places (A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers) are given for the</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the Edifying of the body of
Christ, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12. That we might be one united Body, having one fixed
standing doctrine,</hi> ver. 14, 15, 16. <hi>And</hi> how shall we escape if we neglect so
great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto us by them that heard him: <hi>(mark whence the Church receiveth
it)</hi> God also bearing them witness <hi>(but not every Elder or Teacher)</hi> both
with signs and wonders, and with divers Miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost
according to his own will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="469" facs="tcp:60852:229"/>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. And now that <hi>these later Ministers need not prove their calling by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi>
I prove thus: 1. God never imposed such a task upon them, nor
commanded the people to require such a proof, and not to believe any but
worker of Miracles. 2. God gave not all the gift of Miracles, that were
employed in his work even in the Apostles daies: <hi>Are all workers of Miracles?</hi>
saith <hi>Paul;</hi> some had by the Spirit, the <hi>word of wisedom, and of knowledge,</hi>
and others <hi>Tongues,</hi> and others <hi>Interpretation,</hi> and others <hi>Miracles,</hi> 1 Cor.
12 29, 7, 8, 9, 10. 3. They that have the Holy Ghost are owned by Christ; and
so have many without working Miracles. See <hi>Rom. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 12. 3. Gal. 5.
18, 22, 23, 24. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Eph.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 5. 9, 18. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2, 22. Rom. 15. 13, 16.
Tit.</hi> 3. 5. 4. The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was kept and taught by Priests and Levites
that wrought not Miracles. 5. If the Laws of all Nations may be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Miracles, so may the Laws of Christ. 6. If humane writings are kept
without Miracles, (as <hi>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, Livy,</hi> &amp;c.) so may the
Laws of God much more, as being the daily subject of the belief, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
conference, preaching, controversies, devotions of Christians through
the world, and translated into so many Tongues. 7. There is nothing in
the Nature of the thing that requireth ordinary Miracles. Cannot men
sufficiently prove without Miracles, that there have been such men as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
Pompey, Aristotle,</hi> or which be <hi>Calvins</hi> or <hi>Bellarmines</hi> writings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much
more evidently may they prove what doctrine is essential to Christianity,
and the Scripture that contains the whole. 8. Else Parents could not teach
their children, nor <hi>bring them up in the Nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi>
Eph. 6. 4. Nor teach them with <hi>Timothy, from a child to know the Scriptures,
which are able to make men wise to salvation through faith in Christ,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.
15. Must no Parents teach their Children to know Christ, but such as can
work Miracles? 9. The Doctrine which we preach is fully confirmed by
Miracles already, by Christ and his Apostles: There needs no greater then
Christs own Resurrection, nor more then were done; which Universal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
History and Tradition hath brought down to our hands. 10. It
is a ridiculous expectation, that every person should see the Miracles before
they do believe. Then if Christ had done Miracles before all <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> save
one man, that one man should not be bound to believe: Or if I could do
miracles in this Town or Country, none must believe me ever the more
but those that see it. And so you may as well say, I should not believe that
there is any Sea or Land, City or Kingdom, <hi>France, Spain, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. but
what I see. Are these men worthy to be talkt with? that believe no body,
and confess themselves such Lyars that they would have no body believe
them. It was not <hi>all</hi> that saw <hi>Christs Miracles</hi> or <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or the Apostles
miracles! It seems the rest were not bound to be Christians? Even as <hi>Clem:
Writer</hi> told me, that <hi>no man is bound to believe that Christ did Rise again, or
the rest of Christianity, that seeth not Miracles himself to prove it:</hi> adding
withall, that <hi>indeed Antichrist may do Miracles;</hi> and so it seems for all the talk,
miracles themselves would not serve if they saw them. 11. Is it not to put
a scorn on God Almighty, to lay that the Glory of all his most miraculous
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:60852:230"/>
works should be buried to all that saw them not; and that Parents should
not tell them to their Children, or Children should not believe them if they
do? 12. Its injurious to Posterity, that the knowledge of the most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
works of God shall be only for the good of them that see them,
and that all ages after shall be never the better. 13. It tends to make men
mad and as Ideots, that must know and believe no more then they see: what
kind of folks must these be, that know not that there is either Prince or
Parliament, City or Countrey, or any folks in the world but those they
have seen? This will stand with trading, converse, Subjection, Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and its doubtful whether such are capable of managing estates; or
should not be put under others as Ideots? 14. Children cannot learn to
read nor speak without some kind of belief of them that teach them: nor
can they obey their parents nor learn any trade, nor obey Physitians: so
that this conceit of incredulity is against the Nature, livelihood, and life of
man. 15. And they would tie God to be at the beck of every unreasonable
Infidel; that shall say, <hi>[Though all the Town have seen thy Miracles, yet I will
see my self, or else I will not believe.]</hi> 16. They expect that God should
overturn the course of Nature: for if Miracles be as ordinary as the
operations of Nature, they are confounded. 17. And by this they
would cross themselves, and make Miracles uneffectual: For if they
were ordinary; few would be moved by them <hi>as</hi> any proof of a Divine
Testimony: were it as ordinary for the Sun to go backward as forward, who
would take it for a Miracle? To this <hi>Clem: Writer</hi> answers me, that <hi>[Miracles
were convincing in the first Age when they were common] Answ.</hi> How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?
Not as natural operations: Nor so as for all Countreys or persons
to see them; 500 saw Christ at once after his Resurrection: 5000. were
once miraculously fed: but as this was not every days work, so what was
this to others? And in that it was but for an age, and rarely in after ages,
shews that they were not for every mans eyes. 18. What need we more
proof then actual experience, that God doth not often now work miracles!
And he that saith the Gospel, and Christian faith, and Church, and Ministry
are therefore ceased, its like will not take it ill to be taken himself for an
Heathen or Infidel. 19. And we have experience of millions that still do
actually and stedfastly believe in Christ without Miracles: and many have
laid down their lives on that belief: therefore without miracles men may
believe. But to this <hi>Clem: Writer</hi> saith to me, <hi>[These believers of all sorts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
each other as Hereticks.] Answ.</hi> But not as <hi>Infidels.</hi> None but the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
or passionate condemn all other sorts as Hereticks. The sober do
not. And it is not enough to prove you a bastard, if an angry Brother call
you so. 20. Because this sheet alloweth me not room, I intreat the Reader
to peruse these Texts, which tell him aloud that the word and works of
God must be believed by Tradition, though without Miracles, <hi>Exod. 10. 1,

and did not cease when the extraordinary Ministry ceased.</hi> I prove it, <hi>Matth.

and most eminent part, as it is a <hi>Community.</hi> And therefore if the Ministry
be extinct, the <hi>Gates of Hell have prevailed</hi> against the Church: And then
Christ is overcome, or hath broke his promise; and then he were not
Christ: So that if Christ be Christ, the Church and Ministry continue. So

His being with them, is to support and help them in his work: And will you
feign Christ to promise them help on condition they do it without? The
further Cavils against this Text and others, the <hi>London</hi> Ministers in their

Teachers</hi> are given to the Church <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints for the work
of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity
of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man,</hi> &amp;c.] Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and ordinary Officers are here conjoyned, who between them
are to perfect the building, the first <hi>laying the foundation,</hi> and the others
<hi>building thereon,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 13, 14. <hi>I give thee charge in the sight of God—
that thou keep this Commandment without spot, unrebukable, unto the appearing of
our Lord Iesus Christ]</hi> which must needs extend to his Successors. The
<hi>faithful and wise Stewards that give the children their meat in due season, will be
found so doing by the Lord at his coming,</hi> Luke 12. 42, 43. And it is not till
the last day that Christ will <hi>give up the Kingdome to the Father,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 25.
2. The Apostles actually setled an ordinary Ministry in their time, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
3. There are Commands for setling Successors of these, as 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2.
Tit.</hi> 1. 5. as is proved. 4. These Ministers are described, and the way of
their Ordination setled by Canons, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. We had the several
Angels of the Churches in their places, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. and promises to some
of them for the future, with a Command <hi>[Hold fast till I come, 2. 23.]</hi> and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:60852:231"/>
3. 10. [<hi>I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come on all the
world: Behold, I come quickly.]</hi> 6. Christ hath commanded the Ministerial
<hi>work</hi> to continue to the end: As the <hi>Preaching of the Word</hi> must be to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and every Creature, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Mark</hi> 16. 15. And these most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
men would have all the Preachers give over their work, and leave the
world to perish in Infidelity. So for the <hi>assembling of our selves together,</hi>
and <hi>exhorting one another,</hi> we are commanded <hi>not to forsake it, as is the manner
of some;</hi> and so much <hi>the more, as we see the day approaching,</hi> Heb. 10. 23,
24, 25. So that the nearer we are to Christs coming, the closer must we
stick to Church-Communion, and holy Assemblies; considering, that its but
<hi>a little while, and he that comes will come, and shall not tarry,</hi> ver. 37. God doth
on purpose forbear his coming, because he is <hi>long-suffering,</hi> and will continue
the means to call men to <hi>repentance,</hi> and then the day of the Lord will come
suddenly, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 9, 10. [The Word of the Lord endureth for ever: and this is
the word which by the Gospel is preached to you,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 25. The Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is Instituted to be used to <hi>shew the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26.
Church-government or Discipline is a fixed Ordinance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17.
And if the <hi>work</hi> continue, the <hi>workmen</hi> must continue. 7. The mercy of
God, and the Efficacy of Christs Blood, and the necessities of the Church
continue: we still need a Teaching Ministry, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. and for <hi>our need</hi> it
is Instituted till the Church be perfect, that we be not as children toss'd up
and down, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13, 14. What enemies to us, and to the love and mercy of
God are they that would perswade men, that he so quickly withdrew so
great a mercy, when the <hi>gifts and calling of God are without repentance?</hi>
8. The Law and its Priesthood was not removed but by the glory of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Law and Ministry: And Christ is the Mediator of a <hi>better Covenant</hi> and
<hi>Promises,</hi> Heb. 7. 22. &amp; 8. 7, 8. Therefore he will not deal so much worse.
9. Christ telleth us that a wise man will consider whether he can go through
with it, before he build or make War: Therefore he would not himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to build his Church, and enter himself the Captain of our Salvation,
and presently let his Enterprize fall. 10. If the Ministry continue not, then
the Church continueth not; for as the Head, Liver, and Stomack, or Lungs
are to the Body, so is the Ministry to the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 13, 19, 20, 28,
29.</hi> They <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>water it,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 6. and <hi>build it,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>For how shall
we believe on him of whom we have not heard? and how shall we hear without a
Preacher? and hew shall they preach unless they be sent?</hi> Rom. 10. 14. But
the Church doth continue: for first, else Christ were no longer the <hi>Head</hi>
of it, the <hi>King, Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Priest,</hi> and so not Christ: But he is a <hi>Priest for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
abiding continually: he continueth ever, and hath an unchangeable Priesthood;
he ever liveth to make intercession for those that come to God by him,</hi> Heb. 7. 3.
22, 24, 25. 2. Those that deny the Church, must needs deny themselves
Christians and Members of that Church. 3. There is no Salvation promised
but to the Church, <hi>Eph. 5. 23, 25, 26, 27. Mark 16. 16. 4. Blindness is on
the</hi> Jews <hi>but till the fulness of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come in, and so all</hi> Israel <hi>shall be
saved:</hi> Therefore it is most evident that the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church shall not cease
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:60852:231"/>
till the fulness have prepared for the re-ingraffing of the <hi>Iews, Rom. 11.
25,</hi> 26. 5. It is an <hi>everlasting Kingdome, which cannot be moved, and the City
of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>whereof even the Angels and perfected
Spirits of the Iust are a part,</hi> to which <hi>we come by Faith:</hi> therefore it ceaseth
not, <hi>Heb. 12. 22, 23, 28. 6. When that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 10. but not before. 7. If
<hi>nothing can separate us from the love of God,</hi> no not any distress or tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then are not all the Ministers and Church cut off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. to 39.
Yea, those that in all Ages suffer for his sake, are not cut off from him; but
so many faithful Ministers do. 8. But what should I say any more against
that Assertion which carrieth stark Heathenism or Infidelity in its Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
reproaching Christ as no Christ, and teaching men that they are not
bound to be Christians, and believe the Gospel, and perswading the world
to despise Christs Messengers and Ordinances; and Ministers to cast off
their Masters work; which in two words is, to turn Infidels, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.
I must refer you for my fuller answer to such men, to my Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 4. <hi>God hath in his Law appointed a standing way for the calling of
these ordinary Teaching, Ruling, worshipping Ministers, in all Ages; and doth
himself call them in this way.</hi> 1. He instituteth the Office. 2. He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that fit persons be ordained to this Office. 3. He describeth them by
their necessary Qualifications. All this is at large, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Tit. 1. Act. 20.
1 Pet. 5. &amp;c.</hi> This is his work by his standing Law: By which also he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the people to chuse, consent to, or accept the fit, and to hear and
obey them, <hi>Act. 14. 23. 2 Thes. 5. 12. Act. 6. 3, 5. Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. And then
by Providence, 1. He giveth them those gifts of the Spirit that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
qualifie them for their Office. 2. He assisteth the Chusers and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers
to discern those Qualifications, and do their duties. 3. He causeth
some special fitness of a Minister to the special Province or Charge which he
is to undertake, and special inviting occasions and opportunities, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
causeth Necessity to make the choice. 4. He boweth the heart of the
person called to consent, and usually to desire the work (for the right ends.)
5. And if he be called to be the Pastor of a particular Church, he moveth
the people to consent or accept him. And thus God according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Order doth call his Ministers: Besides which, he afterward
1. Helps them in his work: 2. And procureth them liberty, and often fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
from Christian Magistrates. 3. And giveth them success.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proposition</hi> 5. The faithful Pastors of the Reformed Churches, are these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Ministers of Christ, approved by him, and given in great mercy to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are bound to know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honour, and obey them in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I exclude not all others, but I now prove that <hi>these are true Ministers.</hi>
Argument 1. <hi>They that have all that is essential to true Ministers are true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters:
But such are these Pastors of the Reformed Churches;</hi> as I prove thus:
If the Office it self be of Gods Institution, and their Qualifications compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and their entrance right in every point of flat Necessity, then they
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:60852:232"/>
have all that is essential to true Ministers: But the former is true, as I shall
prove in the three several parts. 1. That the <hi>Office</hi> it self is of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
is proved fully before, and confessed by all Christians that ever
I knew, <hi>Acts 14. 23. 1 Tim. 3. Tit. 1. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 1 Thes. 5. 12. Heb. 13. 7,
17, 24. Acts</hi> 20. 28. 2. For <hi>Qualifications,</hi> they have 1. competent <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
2.</hi> and <hi>Vtterance,</hi> 3. and <hi>Godliness:</hi> and these are the Qualifications
that God accepteth. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 8. 1 Tim. 2. 15. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Mark the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. They must be 1. <hi>Faithful men, 2. Able
to teach others:</hi> But such are those in question, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. A Bishop must be
blameless</hi> (that is, not scandalous) <hi>the husband of one Wife, vigilant, sober, of
good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to Wine, no striker, not
greedy of filthy lucre, but patient, not a brawler, not covetous, one that ruleth well
his own house having his children in subjection, with all gravity.]</hi> To which is
added, <hi>Tit. 1. 8, 9. A lover of good men, sober, just, holy temperate, holding fast
the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound Doctrine
both to exhort, and to convince the gain-sayers.]</hi> Let all here note: 1. That
here is not only the mention of the Vertues necessary to the <hi>Being,</hi> but to
the <hi>well-being</hi> also of a Minister: 2. And yet through the great mercy of
God, all these are the qualifications of multitudes of the Pastors of the
Reformed Churches, as malice it self must be forced to confess: But if any
deny it of any particular men, as that is nothing to the rest; so an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
accusation is not by honest men to be believed. The world knows that
the Act for rejecting scandalous, insufficient, negligent Ministers is very
strict, and Commissioners in each County forward to execute it, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
have enemies enough to search out their faults, and yet none are more
forward than Ministers themselves to have the Act put in execution; so
that their standing justifies them before the world: Or, if any will yet deny
them the necessary Qualifications, I here challenge and provoke them to
accuse all that are guilty, and cast them out; or else to confess themselves
meer slanderers, and back-biters, and learn more truth and modesty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
3. And for the third point, <hi>their entrance into the Office: They have all
that God hath made necessary to a just entrance,</hi> as I prove: <hi>They that have a true
Ordination, and the Peoples consent, and the Magistrates allowance, have all that
God hath made necessary to a just entrance, and more than all: But the said Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the Reformed Churches have true Ordination, and the Peoples consent, and
the Magistrates allowance:</hi> That they have <hi>true Ordination,</hi> I shall shew anone
in answering all that can be said against it. The <hi>Peoples consent,</hi> by <hi>Electing,</hi>
or <hi>Accepting,</hi> is known by the <hi>fact;</hi> and so is the <hi>Magistrates</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> and
<hi>fact:</hi> I put in all this, though <hi>more</hi> than <hi>necessary,</hi> that all Objections may
be satisfied at once: So that the Enumerations being unquestionable, the
Conclusion is so to. In short; <hi>All those are true Ministers, that are in an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Gods own Institution, and are competently fitted for that Office by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Godliness, and Vtterance, and have all, and more than all that God hath
made necessary to a right entrance or admission, even true Ordination, consent of the
Flock, and the Magistrates allowance.</hi> But <hi>such are the said Pastors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, therefore they are true Ministers of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:60852:232"/>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 2. Those that have not only the Essentials, but excel all other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
on Earth <hi>(that are known to the world)</hi> are certainly the true Ministers
of Christ. But such are the Ministers before-mentioned of the Reformed Churches;
Ergo. <hi>This will be proved at once with the next, which is,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Argument 3. <hi>Either these Pastors of the Reformed Churches are the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ, or else there are none such visible in the world: But there are such
visibly and certainly in the world, as</hi> was proved; else there is no Church,
no Ordinances, no Christianity, no Christ: For he can be no King without
Subjects and Laws; no Master without a School and Scholars; no Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
without Patients; no Husband without his Spouse; no Head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Body; no Intercessor without a Church to intercede for. And to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the holy Catholick Church, and the Communion of Saints,</hi> is part of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
and therefore the Christian Faith is gone, if these be gone: And that
either <hi>we,</hi> or <hi>None</hi> are Christs true Ministers, I prove thus: 1. We challenge
the Adversary to name us the true Church and Ministry; if these be none of
them, where be they, and who are they? speak out, or give up your wicked
Cause. If you know not who they be, or where, then how know you that
there are any such? True Ministers are like a <hi>light that shineth to all the
house,</hi> even <hi>the lights of the world, and like a City on a Hill that cannot be hid,
Mat.</hi> 5. 14, 15, 16. 2. But let us try the particulars: 1. The <hi>Seekers</hi> have no
Church or Ministry. 2. The <hi>Quakers</hi> have no Ordination, that we know of,
and are every way so unworthy, and had no being in the world till a few
years ago, that he is either no Christian, or of a crazed brain, that thinks
Christ hath no Church or Ministry but them. 3. The <hi>Anabaptists, Socinians,
Swenlfeldians, Familists, Paracelsians, Weigelians,</hi> and such like, have no more
to shew for their Ministry and Churches than we, but their Errours; and
are so few, and so lately sprung up, that of them also I may say, that he
that takes them for the only Church, or Ministers, is either out of the
Faith, or much out of his wits. 4. The Eastern and Southern Churches have
no more to shew for their Ministry and Churches than we; but are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more ignorant, and erroneous: few of them doing more than read
their Liturgies and Homilies, and so administer the Sacraments. 5. All the
Controversie therefore lieth between us and the Papists; either they are
true Ministers, and a Church, or not; if <hi>not,</hi> then its left to <hi>us:</hi> if <hi>they are,</hi>
then <hi>we</hi> are so <hi>much more;</hi> for we have <hi>much more</hi> unquestionable Evidence
of our Title. 1. The Office of a Teaching, Guiding, worshipping Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which we are in, is beyond all question, and yielded by themselves to
be of Divine Institution. But the office of a Mass-Priest, to make a God of
a piece of Bread, and turn Bread into Flesh, so that there shall be quantity,
colour, taste, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without bread, or any subject; and a mans eyes, taste, or
feeling, shall not know that its bread or wine, when we see, taste, and feel
it; as also to celebrate publick worship in an unknown tongue; this office
is more questionable than ours. 2. It remaineth a great doubt, whether the
Pope be not the Antichrist: but of our Ministry there's no such doubt.
3. For Knowledge, Godliness and Utterance, and all true Ministerial abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:60852:233"/>
as its well known what an ignorant Rabble their common secular
Mass Priests are; so those Military Fryars and Jesuites that are chosen of
purpose to play their Game among us, and credit their Cause, if they have
any relicks of truth or modesty, will confess, that the generality of our
Ministers are much beyond theirs for Parts and Piety; or at least, that we
cannot be denied to be true Ministers for want of necessary abilities: We
should rejoyce if their Ministers, Priests or Jesuites were near of such Piety
as those of the Reformed Churches. Some of their Jesuites and Fryars are
learned men; in which also we have those that equal the best of them: but
for the learning, ability, or Piety of the common Ministers on both sides,
there is no comparison to be made. 4. All the question then is of the way of
entrance: And there 1. The Papists seek not the <hi>Peoples consent</hi> so much as
we do. 2. They despise the <hi>Magistrates consent,</hi> in comparison of us.
3. And for <hi>Ordination,</hi> which is it that all the stress must be laid on, we
<hi>have it,</hi> and nearer the <hi>Rule</hi> of God than they. Are they ordained with
Fasting, Prayer, and Imposition of Hands? so are we. Must it be by one of
a Superiour Order? Who then shall Ordain or Consecrate the Pope? And
yet a multitude of our Ministers are ordained by Bishops, if that be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
But the great Objection is, that we have not an <hi>uninterrupted succession</hi>
from the Apostles, and so those that ordained us had no power; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not give it to us.</p>
                  <p>Proposition 6. <hi>The want of an uninterrupted succession; and so of Power in
the Ordainers, doth not disable our Title to the Ministry, or set us in a worse
condition than the Papists.</hi> For if it be only the <hi>succession of possession of the
Office,</hi> there is no man of brains can deny, but <hi>we</hi> have an <hi>uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
down from the Apostles.</hi> But if it be a <hi>succession of Right Ordination</hi>
that is questioned, 1. The Papists have none such themselves. 2. We have
more of it than they. 3. It is not necessary that this be uninterrupted. All
these I prove: 1. The Popes themselves, from whom their power flows,
have been Hereticks, denied the Immortality of the Soul, Whoremongers,
Sodomites, Simonists, Murderers; so that for many of them successively,
the Papists confess they were Apostatical, and not Apostolical. See in their
own Writers the Lives of <hi>Sylvest. 2. Alexand,</hi> 3. &amp; 6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. &amp; 22. &amp; 23.
<hi>Greg. 7. Vrban</hi> 7. and abundance more, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was proved in Council to
have ravished Maids and Wives at the Apostolick doors, murdered many,
drunk to the Devil, askt help at Dice of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and was kill'd in
the act of Adultery. Read the proofs in my Book against Popery, pag. 269,
270, 255, 101. The Council at <hi>Pisa</hi> deposed two Popes at once, called them
Hereticks departed from the Faith. The Council at <hi>Constance</hi> deposed <hi>Ioh.
23.</hi> as holding that there was <hi>no Eternal Life, Immortality of the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:</hi>
The Council at <hi>Basil</hi> deposed <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. as a <hi>Simonist and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
wretch, a Schismatick, and obstinate Heretick.</hi> Now these men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of the Ministry, as an Infidel is, for want of Essential Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
As Copper is no currant Coyn, though the stamp of the Prince against
his will be put upon it: Undisposed matter cannot receive the form: A fit
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:60852:233"/>
man unordained is nearer the Ministry, than such a man ordained: So that
here was a Nullity. 2. And all the following Popes were the Successors
of <hi>Eugenius</hi> that was deposed, and thus judged by a General Council; but
by force brought them to submit, and held the place. 3. Either the <hi>Election,
Ordination,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> is it that giveth them the Essence of their Papacy: If
<hi>Election,</hi> then there hath been a long interruption: for some-while the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
chose, and in other Ages the <hi>Emperours</hi> chose, and in these times the
<hi>Cardinals;</hi> and therefore some of them had no lawful choice: And for <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi>
or <hi>Consecration;</hi> 1. There have been three or four Popes at once, and
<hi>all</hi> were <hi>Consecrated,</hi> that yet are now confessed to have been no true Popes.
2. <hi>Inferiours</hi> only Consecrated. 3. And such as had no power themselves.
Besides that, the See hath been very many years vacant, and some score
years the Pope hath been at <hi>Avignion,</hi> and had but the name of P. of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And when three or four have been Pope at once, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth,
learned men knew not which was the Right, yea, General Councils knew
not. The Council at <hi>Basil</hi> thought <hi>Faelix</hi> the fifth was the right Pope, but
it proved otherwise; so that many palpable Intercisions have been made
at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Our <hi>Ordination</hi> hath been less interrupted than theirs.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But you are not ordained by Bishops. Answ.</hi> 1. Almost all in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
are till of late, if that will serve. 2. <hi>Presbyters</hi> may ordain in case of
necessity, as the generality of the Old Episcopal men grant, and their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
is not null. 3. <hi>Presbyters</hi> have power to Ordain, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
only from the <hi>exercise</hi> by <hi>humane Laws,</hi> as many of the Schoolmen
confess. 4. <hi>Presbyters have still ordained</hi> with the Bishop; therefore they had
<hi>Authority</hi> to it, and the work is not Alien to their Function. 5. Our Parish
<hi>Presbyters</hi> are Bishops, having some of them Assistants, and Deacons under
them; or as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes, at least they are so, as being the chief Guides
of that Church: Their own Rule is, that every City should have a Bishop;
and every Corporation is truly a City, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and therefore must have a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
6. The <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of Prelacy is <hi>lis subjudice.</hi> 7. Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>
maintaining to me the validity of the Ordination of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> without
a Bishop, told me how he answered King <hi>C.</hi> who askt him for an instance
in Church-History, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Hierom ad Evag. tells us of more; that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>till the days of</hi> Heroclas <hi>and</hi> Dionysius, <hi>took one from
among themselves, and made him Bishop;</hi> therefore they may make a Presbyter,
which is less. 8. Its at last confessed, that in Scripture-times there were no
<hi>Presbyters</hi> under Bishops, but the single Churches had single Pastors. 9. No
man can prove Ordination by fixed Bishops over many Churches (now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Diocesan)</hi> in the first Age: The fixed Bishops had no more at first but
single Churches. Object. <hi>But you never received power from the Bishop to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
and therefore cannot have that which was never given your Answ.</hi> If they
put men into that <hi>Office,</hi> to which God hath affixed the <hi>power</hi> of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then they do their part to convey the power. As if you marry a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and express not the mans authority over the woman, yet he hath it
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:60852:234"/>
nevertheless by being made her Husband. So he that is made a Pastor in
City or Country, may do the work of a Pastor, though each particular was
not named.</p>
                  <p>Proposition 7. <hi>Ordination is ordinarily necessary as a means of our right en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
but not absolutely necessary to the Being of our Office or Power.</hi> For 1. <hi>God</hi>
having already setled the <hi>Office, Duty,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and what <hi>Qualifications</hi>
shall be necessary, and <hi>giving</hi> these Qualifications to men, he hath left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to man but mutual <hi>consent,</hi> and to <hi>judge</hi> of the person qualified, and
<hi>solemnly introduce</hi> him. 2. God hath not tyed himself or us absolutely to the
judgment of Ordainers. If a Bishop ordain a Heathen, or any man void of
Essential Qualifications, its null, as being against a flat Command of God:
And if Bishops <hi>refuse</hi> to ordain us Pastors, the people must take them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
because the <hi>Command of Preaching, Hearing, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> is greater
than that of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>before</hi> it. Positives yield to Natural Morals, and
matters of <hi>Order</hi> to the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of the Duty ordered. See my
<hi>Christian Concord,</hi> pag. 82, 83, 84. 3. <hi>Ordination</hi> is no more necessary to the
<hi>Ministry,</hi> than <hi>Baptism</hi> to <hi>Christianity:</hi> As those that are first Princes by Title
must be Crowned, and those that are Souldiers by Contract, must be listed,
and take Colours, and those that are Husband and Wife by Contract, must
be solemnly Married, which are celebrating, perfecting actions; so they
that are first heart-Christians by believing, or by Parents dedicating them
to God, must be solemnly entred under the hand of the Minister: And those
that are by approbation and consent initially Ministers, must by solemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have the Office publickly delivered them by the Ministers of Christ.
So that as a man is a Christian indeed before Baptism initially, and is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
initially before, and in case of necessity may be saved without it (the
Papists confessing that the Vow will serve) so is it in the case of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Ministry.</p>
                  <p>Proposition 8. <hi>It is only Christ, and not the Ordainers, People or Magistrates,
that give us our Office and Power:</hi> Only the people and approvers design the
person which shall receive it from Christ; and our own consent, and the
peoples, is of necessity thereto (and our own as much as theirs) and the
Ordainers do instrumentally invest us in it; but the Power and Duty arise
directly from Gods Institution, when the person is designed. Now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to prove our Calling.</p>
                  <p>Argument 4. <hi>We have a far clearer Call than the Priests before Christ had
to the Priesthood:</hi> For they were not of the true Line; they bought the
Priesthood; they corrupted Doctrine and worship, and were of wicked lives.
And yet Christ commanded submission to their Ministry: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Argument 5. <hi>If we have as clear a Call to our Office as any Magistrates on
Earth have to theirs, then we are true Ministers of Christ:</hi> For they are true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates;
and God is the Fountain of their Power too; and its impossible
they should have any but from him: Or from him but by his means: Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
have no power but from the Soveraign. The Prince was at first cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by God immediately, as well as the Apostles were by Christ, yet no
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:60852:234"/>
Prince can plead an uninterrupted succession thence; and if <hi>they</hi> may <hi>Reign</hi>
without it, <hi>we</hi> may be Pastors without it: and yet I cannot say that we are
without it, though Princes be. Kings were formerly anointed by inspired
Prophets, and were Prophets themselves: And as the continuance of this is
not necessary to them, so neither to us. The differences between <hi>their power</hi>
and <hi>ours,</hi> makes nothing against this Argument: If <hi>Conquest,</hi> or the <hi>peoples
consent,</hi> or <hi>Birth,</hi> or <hi>directing Providences</hi> can prove their Title, then <hi>Consent,
Ordination, Providence,</hi> with <hi>due Qualifications,</hi> will sure prove ours: were it
not for fear, they should soon hear the Arguments more set home against
themselves, that are now bent against the Ministers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 6. If besides all this God own us by such a blessing on our labours,
that he maketh us the means of propagating and continuing his Gospel and
Church, and brings most of his chosen to Vnion with Christ, Reconciliation, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and to Heaven by our Ministry, then certainly we are his true Ministers:
<hi>But experience assureth us of the former: therefore—so much for Argument.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Proposition 9. <hi>If a Minister be in quiet possession of the place, and fit for it,
the people are bound to obey him as a Minister, without knowing that he was justly
ordained or called. Argum.</hi> 1. We must obey a <hi>Magistrate</hi> without assurance
of his Call and Title, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. therefore a <hi>Minister.</hi> 2. Christ commanded
hearing and obeying them that were not called as God appointed, because
they were Priests, or sat in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, and taught the truth, <hi>Luke 16. 29.
Matth. 23. 2. Luke 5. 14. Matth. 8. 4. Mark</hi> 1. 44. 3. Else the people are
put upon impossibilities: Can all the poor people tell before they submit to
a Minister, what is Essential to his Call, and whether he have all that is so,
and whether his Orders be true or forged, and whether they that ordained
him were truly ordained, or chosen themselves: Not one of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
knows all this by their Pastors.</p>
                  <p>Proposition 10. <hi>The Ordinances are valid to the people when the Minister is
uncalled and unordained, if they know it not: He that hath no just Call, shall
answer for what he doth as an Intruder; but the people shall have for all that
the fruit of his Ministration;</hi> and Preaching, and Baptism, and other acts,
shall not be null to them. 1. The Papists themselves confess this. 2. Else
scarce a man could tell whether he be baptized, or may use any Ordinance,
because he cannot have an exact account of the Ministers Call, no nor know
that he is indeed a Christian. I knew divers in the Bishops days that forged
themselves Orders, and acted long before it was discovered. 3. It is the
<hi>Office</hi> which is <hi>Gods Ordinance</hi> that is blest, and valid to the people, and not
his Call only. 4. It is he that sinneth that must suffer, and not the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
therefore his sin depriveth them not of their due. 5. As an usurping
Magistrate oweth us protection, though he shall answer for his Usurpation;
so an usurping Minister oweth us his labour; so that the people are <hi>bound</hi> to
<hi>hear</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> men, when they are uncertain of their due Call, if they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
the place; and shall have the blessing of such Administrations: For
we are sure the Office and work is of God.</p>
                  <p>Proposition 11. <hi>The truth of our Doctrine depends not on our Calling.</hi> Were
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:60852:235"/>
we no Ministers, we can prove the Gospel true which we deliver. And any
man must be believed, that brings a truth that concerneth our peace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let Quakers, and Seekers, and Papists first disprove our Doctrine if
they can; and not cheat the people, by perswading them, that our Calling
must first be proved; as a Prophets must be.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But you have your learning only from Books, and Vniversities, and so
have not true Ministers. Answ.</hi> We have it from God in the use of his means,
even by prayer, reading, study and learning his works and word of our
Teachers, whether at Universities, or elsewhere. And we are commanded
to <hi>study</hi> and <hi>meditate on these things, and give our selves wholly to them, and to
meditate on Gods Law day and night, Psal. 1. 2. 2 Tim. 2. 15. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 13, 15.
Christs Ministers must be Teachers or Tutors to others, and <hi>commit the things
which they have heard to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also,</hi>
2 Tim. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Good Ministers of Christ are nourished up in the words of faith and
good Doctrine, and so attain to it,</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim. 4. 6. All should learn according to
their <hi>time</hi> of teaching, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 14. We study nothing but the <hi>Word,</hi>
and works of God: And is not that a Wretch, and not a man, that will
reproach us as no Ministers, for doing that which we have our Reason for,
and which must be the work of our lives: Poor Christians, as you love
God and your Souls, and would not cast off Christ and Heaven, let not
Deceivers draw you to cast off the Ministry, Scripture, or the Ordinances
of God.</p>
