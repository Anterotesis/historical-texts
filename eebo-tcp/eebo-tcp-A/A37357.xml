         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>We being miſ-repreſented to the Nation,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>As ſuch, as are oppoſite to Magistracy.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That we would deſtroy the Publick Miniſtry of the Nation, who differ from us in ſome things about Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That we do countenance the people called Quakers, in their irregular Practiſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That we endeavour a Toleration of all miſcarriages in things Eccleſiastical and Civil, under pretence of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>That we deſign to murder and deſtroy thoſe that differ from us in matters of Religion, thereby endeavouring to make us odious to ſome People fearing God, And alſo to incenſe the rude Multitude againſt us, to provoke them (if poſſible) to deſtroy us.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt: Though we cannot anſwer in juſtification of every individual perſon that is of our Profeſſion in matters of Religion, yet we can ſay this, and prove it to all the world, that it hath been our profeſſion, and is our real practiſe, to be obedient to Magiſtracy in all things Civil, and willing to live peaceably, under whatever Government is, and ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this Nation: for we do believe, and declare, Magiſtracy to be an Ordinance of God, and ought to be obeyed in all lawful things.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond: As for the publick Miniſters of the Nation, who differ from us in the matter of Baptizing Infants, and ſome things in Church-Government; We are ſo far from endeavouring to deſtroy them, that we judge, they ought to have the Liberty of their Conſciences therein; and that it is our duty to ſtand by them, and preſerve them (ſo much as in us lies) from all injury and violence.</p>
            <p>To the third: Concerning the people called Quakers, it is well known to all, (that are not wilfully ignorant) there are none more oppoſite to their irregular practices then we are: nor are there any, that they have expreſt more Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to, (in matters of Religion) then againſt us; though their provocation therein, hath not put us (in the leaſt) on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, of depriving them of their juſt Liberty, while they live morally honeſt, and peaceable in the Nation.</p>
            <p>To the fourth: Whereas we are further charged with endeavouring an univerſal Toleration of all miſcarriages, both in things Religious and Civil, under pretence of Liberty of Conſcience; it is in both reſpects notoriouſly falſe. And we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that ſhall judge both quick and dead, yea, before Angels and men, declare our utter deteſtation of ſuch a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration; for in matters Civil, we deſire there may not be the leaſt Toleration of miſcarriage in any, much leſs in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Nor do we deſire, in matters of Religion, that Popery ſhould be tolerated, the bloud of many thouſands of the people of God, having been barbarouſly ſhed, by the Profeſſours thereof; or any perſons tolerated, that worſhip a falſe god; nor any that ſpeak contemptuouſly and reproachfully of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; nor any that deny the holy Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, to be the Word of God: And yet, we are not againſt tolerating of Epiſcopacy, Presbytery, or any ſtinted form, provided they do not compel any others to a compliance therewith, or a conformity thereunto: for whatever Compoſers of any form of worſhip, may poſſibly erre; it is derogating from God, and his holy Word, and injurious to men, to compel any to the practice thereof.</p>
            <p>To the laſt: For as much as we are charged, with deſigns, to murder or deſtroy thoſe that differ from us in matters of Religion; We do not only abhor and deteſt it, as a curſed practice; but we hope, have approved our ſelves, both in this City and the Nation, to the contrary; notwithſtanding the great provocation of ſome, who have endeavoured our ruine: for all we deſire, is juſt liberty to men, as men; that every man may be preſerved in his own juſt rights, and that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be preſerved as Chriſtians, though of different Apprehenſions in ſome things of Religion; in the proſecution whereof, our lives ſhall not be dear unto us, when we are thereunto lawfully called. The deſigns of our Adverſaries in theſe Calumnies, are, to miſ-repreſent us to ſome people fearing God, and alſo, to incenſe the rude Multitude againſt us, purpoſely to provoke them (if poſſible) to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>We hope, hereby, it will appear to them that fear God, that we are no ſuch perſons, as our Adverſaries have repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us. And for their incenſing the rude Multitude againſt us, it is no more, then ſome others did to our Maſter; and it is not do we expect, they ſhould fayour us: it is enough to us, we have his Promiſe, that if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This, we think meet to Declare, to undeceive thoſe, who through the unchriſtian actions and expreſſions of ſome perſons, have been, and are, prejudiced againſt us.</hi>
