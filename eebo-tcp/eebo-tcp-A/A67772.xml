         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The pain of the body, is but the body of pain, the anguiſh of the ſoul, is the ſoul of anguiſh: For ſhould we firſt burn off one hand, then another, after that each arm, and ſo all the parts of the body, it would be deemed intolerable, and no man would endure it for all the profits and pleaſures this world can afford; and yet it is nothing to the burning of body and ſoul in hell.

               <p>Firſt, If the Sun, which is but a <hi>Creature,</hi> be ſo bright and glorious, that no mortal eye can look upon the brightneſs of it, how glorious then is the <hi>Creator</hi> himſelf? Or that light from whence it receives its light? if the <hi>frame of the heavens</hi> and <hi>globe of the earth</hi> be ſo glorious, which is but the <hi>lower houſe,</hi> or rather the <hi>foot-ſtool of the Almighty,</hi> as the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> phraſeth it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 35. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 49. How glorious and wonderful is the <hi>Maker</hi> thereof, and the <hi>City</hi> where he keeps his <hi>Court?</hi> Or if ſinners, even the worſt of wicked men, and <hi>Gods</hi> enemies, have here in this earthly Pilgrimage, ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of enjoyments to pleaſe their very ſenſes, as who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the pleaſurable variety of <hi>Objects</hi> for the <hi>ſight;</hi> of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> to ſatisfie and delight the <hi>taſte,</hi> of <hi>voyces</hi> and melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>ſounds,</hi> to recreate the <hi>hearing;</hi> of <hi>ſcents</hi> and <hi>perfumes,</hi> provided to accommodate our very <hi>ſmellings,</hi> of <hi>recreations</hi> and <hi>ſports,</hi> to <hi>bewitch</hi> the whole <hi>man:</hi> And the like of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> which are <hi>Idols</hi> that carnal men do mightily <hi>dote upon,</hi> and take pleaſure in: (though theſe earthly and bodily joyes are but the body, or rather the dregs of true joy) what think we muſt be the ſoul thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe delights and pleaſures, that are reſerved for the <hi>glorified Saints,</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> deareſt <hi>darlings</hi> in <hi>heaven?</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If natural men find ſuch pleaſure and ſweetneſs in <hi>ſecular wiſdom, lip-learning,</hi> and <hi>brain-knowledge;</hi> For even <hi>mundane</hi> knowledge hath ſuch a ſhew of excellency in it, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37119:11"/>
it is highly <hi>affected</hi> both by the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad;</hi> As, <hi>O the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> that rational men take therein! It being ſo <hi>fair a Virgin</hi> that every <hi>clear eye</hi> is in love with her; ſo <hi>rich a Pearl,</hi> that none but <hi>Swine</hi> do <hi>deſpiſe it:</hi> yea, among all the <hi>Trees</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> none ſo takes with rational men as the <hi>Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> (as <hi>Satan</hi> well knew, when he ſet upon our <hi>firſt Parents)</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Plato</hi> thinks, in caſe <hi>wiſdom</hi> could but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf unto the <hi>eyes,</hi> it would ſet the <hi>heart</hi> on <hi>fire</hi> with the love of it. And others affirm, That there is no leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Learned</hi> and the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> than there is between the living and the dead, or between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beaſts.</hi> And yet the pleaſure which natural and moral men take in ſecular and mundane knowledge and learning, is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that pleaſure, that an <hi>experimental Chriſtian</hi> finds in the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural knowledge of Gods Word:</hi> Which makes <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> prefer <hi>it before the hony and the hony-comb</hi> for ſweetneſs: and to value it <hi>above thouſands of gold and ſilver;</hi> yea, before <hi>pearls and all precious ſtones</hi> for worth. How ſweet then ſhall our knowledge in <hi>heaven</hi> be? For <hi>here we ſee but darkly, and as it were in a glaſs,</hi> or by moon-light; <hi>but there we ſhall know, even as we are known, and ſee God and Chriſt in the face,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If meer Naturians have been ſo taken with the love of <hi>Vertue,</hi> that they thought if a <hi>vertuous ſoul</hi> could but be <hi>ſeen with temporal eyes,</hi> it would <hi>raviſh</hi> all men <hi>with love and admiration</hi> thereof; yea, if the very worſt of men, <hi>drunkards, blaſphemers,</hi> and the like; though they moſt ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſcoff at, and back-bite the people of <hi>God;</hi> yet when they know a man <hi>ſincere, upright,</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> cannot chooſe but <hi>love, commend,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> him in their <hi>hearts;</hi> as it fared with <hi>Herod</hi> touching <hi>John,</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa</hi> touching <hi>Paul.</hi>

Firſt, if we were never to receive any reward for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37119:11"/>
thoſe ſmall labours of love, and duties we do to the glory of God, and profit of others, we might think our ſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently recompenſed in this life, with the calm and quietneſs of a good conſcience, the honeſty of a vertuous and holy life; That we can do and ſuffer ſomething for the love of Chriſt, who hath done and ſuffered ſo much to ſave us; That by our works the Majeſty of God is magnified, to whom all homage is due, and all ſervice too little. For <hi>godlineſs</hi> in every <hi>ſickneſs</hi> is a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> in every <hi>contention</hi> an <hi>Advocate,</hi> in every <hi>doubt</hi> a <hi>Schoolman,</hi> in all <hi>heavineſs</hi> a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and a <hi>Comforter</hi> unto whatſoever eſtate it comes, making the whole life as it were a perpetual <hi>Hallelujah.</hi> Yea, <hi>God ſo ſheds his love abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> that we are in heaven before we come thither. Inſomuch, that as the <hi>fire</hi> flieth to his <hi>ſphere,</hi> the <hi>ſtone</hi> haſtens to the <hi>center,</hi> the <hi>river</hi> to the <hi>ſea,</hi> as to their end and reſt, and are violently detained in all other places; ſo are the hearts of Gods people, without their <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> their laſt end and eternal reſt and quietneſs, never at reſt: like the <hi>Needle touched with the Loadſtone,</hi> which ever <hi>ſtands</hi> quivering and trembling until it enjoys the full and direct <hi>aſpect of the Northern Pole.</hi> But more particularly:</p>
               <p>How doth the aſſurance of the <hi>pardon of ſin alone,</hi> clear and calm all ſtorms of the mind, making any condition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and the worſt and greateſt miſery to be no miſery?</p>
               <p>To be <hi>delivered</hi> of a <hi>child,</hi> is no ſmall <hi>joy</hi> to the <hi>mother:</hi> but to be <hi>delivered</hi> from <hi>ſin,</hi> is a far greater <hi>joy</hi> to the <hi>ſoul.</hi> But to this we may add the <hi>joy</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>the peace of God which paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Theſe are priviledges that make <hi>Paul</hi> happier in his <hi>chain of iron,</hi> than <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his <hi>chain of gold:</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> more merry under <hi>ſtripes,</hi> than <hi>Caiaphas</hi> upon the <hi>Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat;</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> the like under that <hi>ſhower of ſtones.</hi> Pleaſures are ours, if we be Chriſts: whence thoſe expreſſions of the <hi>holy Ghoſt, The Lord hath done great things for us, wherefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoyce ye righteous, and ſhout for joy all ye that are upright in heart. Let all that put their truſt in thee rejoyce, let them even ſhout for joy. Rejoyce evermore; and again I ſay, rejoyce. Rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:37119:12"/>
                  <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience. Your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man take from you, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is a ſhame for the <hi>faithful,</hi> not to be <hi>joyful;</hi> and they ſin if they rejoyce not, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their condition be. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> no ſooner felt the pardon of ſin, upon his being baptized into the Faith of Chriſt, but he went on his way <hi>rejoycing, Acts</hi> 8. 39. He then found more ſolid Joy, than ever he had done in his riches, honours, and great places under <hi>Candace, Queen of the Aethiopians.</hi> At the ſame time when the Diſciples were perſecuted, they are ſaid to be <hi>filled with joy, and with the holy Ghost, Acts</hi> 13. 52. And <hi>as their afflictions do abound, ſo their conſolations do abound alſo,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. For theſe are comforts that will ſupport and refreſh a child of God in the very midſt of the flames, as the Martyrs found: for maugre all their perſecutors could do, their peace and joy did exceed their pain; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them manifeſted to all that ſaw them ſuffer.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Where obſerve, before we go any further, what Sots they are, that cry out, <hi>It is in vain to ſerve God, and unprofitable to keep his Commandments,</hi> as it is in <hi>Malachy</hi> 3. 14. For had theſe Fools but taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſweet comforts that are in the very works of piety, and that Heaven upon Earth, the Feaſt of a good Conſcience, and joy of the inward man, they could not ſo ſpeak. Yea, then would they ſay, There is no life to the life of a Chriſtian. For as the Prieſts of <hi>Mercury,</hi> when they are their Figs and Hony, cryed out, <hi>Oh how ſweet is truth!</hi> So if the worſt of a Believers life in this world be ſo ſweet, how ſweet ſhall his life be in that <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>holy City,</hi> where God himſelf dwelleth, and where we ſhall reign with Chriſt our Bridegroom, and be the Lambs wife? Which <hi>City is of pure gold, like unto clear glaſs; the walls of Jaſper, having twelve foundations garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones; the first foundation being Jaſper, the ſecond Saphir, the third a Calcedony, the fourth an Emerald, the fifth a Sardonyx, the ſixth a Sardius, the ſeventh a Chryſolite, the eighth a Beryl, the ninth a Topaz, the tenth a Chryſopraſus, the eleventh a Jacynth, the twelfth an Amethyſt: Having twelve gates of twelve pearls, the ſtreets thereof of pure gold, as it were tranſparent glaſs: In the midſt of which City, is a pure River of the water of life, clear as Chryſtal, and of either ſide the Tree of Life; which bears twelve manner of fruits, yielding her fruit every moneth; the leaves whereof ſerve to heal the Nations: Where is the Throne of</hi> God <hi>and of the</hi> Lamb; <hi>whom we his ſervants ſhall for ever ſerve, and ſee his face, and have his Name written in our Foreheads. And there ſhall be no night, neither is there need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it: for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. Into which nothing that defileth ſhall enter; but they alone which are written in the Lambs Book of life;</hi> As is expreſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. and 22. Chap. The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> ſpeaking <hi>after the manner of men,</hi> and according to our ſlender capacity, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no words can in any meaſure expreſs the tranſcendency of that place of pleaſure. Only here we have a taſte, or earneſt-penny, one drop of thoſe divine dainties, of thoſe ſpiritual, ſupernatural, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſures, reſerved for the <hi>Citizens</hi> of that <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem;</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37119:12"/>
ſome ſmall ſmack whereof we have even in the barren deſert of this perillous peregrination. <hi>God</hi> letting out as it were, a certain kind of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which in ſome ſort refreſheth his thirſty people, in this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> as with moſt ſweet <hi>hony,</hi> or water diſtilled from out of the <hi>Rock.</hi> As what elſe are thoſe Jubilees of the heart; thoſe ſecret and inward joys which proceed from a good conſcience, grounded upon a confident hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſalvation? As what elſe do theſe great <hi>cluſters of grapes</hi> ſignifie, but the fertility of the future <hi>Land of Promiſe.</hi>

As <hi>none could learn the Virgins Song, but them that ſang it, Rev.</hi> 14. 3. No man can <hi>know the peace of a good Conſcience,</hi> but he that <hi>keeps a good Conſcience.</hi> No man <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>hid Manna,</hi> and <hi>white Stone, with a new name written in it, but they that receive the ſame, Rev.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>The world can ſee a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> outſide, but the raptures of his Soul, the raviſhing delights of the inward man, and joy of the Spirit for the remiſſion of his ſins, and the infuſion of grace, with ſuch like ſpiritual Priviledges more glorious than the <hi>States of Kingdoms;</hi> are as a covered meſs to men of the World.</p>
               <p>But I may appeal to any mans conſcience, that hath been ſoftned with the unction of grace, and truly taſted <hi>the powers of the World to come;</hi> To him that hath <hi>the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart by the holy Ghoſt;</hi> in whoſe Soul the light of grace ſhines, whether his whole life be not a perpetual <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> in compariſon of his natural condition?

Whether he finds not more joy in goodneſs, than worldlings can do, <hi>when their wheat, wine, and oyl aboundeth, Pſalm</hi> 4. 7. and 53. 17. Yea, he can ſpeak it out of experience, that as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane joy, even in laughter the heart is ſorrowful: ſo in godly ſorrow, even in weeping, the heart is light and chearful. The face may be pale, yet the heart may be calm and quiet. So St. <hi>Paul, as ſorrowing, yet always rejoycing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. Our cheeks may run down with tears, and yet our mouth ſing forth praiſes. And ſo on the contrary,</p>

               <p>Well may a careleſs worldling laugh more, as what will ſooner make a man laugh than a <hi>witty jeſt,</hi> but to hear of an <hi>Inheritance</hi> of an hundred pounds a year, that is faln to a man, will make him more ſolidly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within. <hi>Light is ſown to the righteous, and joy for the upright, Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. <hi>My ſervant,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>ſhall ſing and rejoyce: but they ſhall weep, &amp;c.

               <p>Indeed we are not <hi>merry enough,</hi> becauſe we are not <hi>Chriſtians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> becauſe ſin is a cooler of our joy, as <hi>water</hi> is of <hi>fire.</hi> And like the <hi>worm of Jonah his gourd,</hi> bites the very root of our joy, and makes it wither: Yea, ſin like a damp, puts out all the lights of our pleaſure, and deprives us of the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> as it did <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 51. 12. and 4. 6. So that the fault is either; Firſt, in the too much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37119:13"/>
ſenſuality of a Chriſtian, that will not forego the pleaſures of ſin, or the more muddy joyes and pleaſures of this world, which are <hi>poyſons to the ſoul,</hi> and drown our joyes, as Bees are drowned in honey, but live in vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Men would have ſpiritual joy, but withal they would not part with their carnal joy: Yet this is an infallible Concluſion, <hi>There is no enjoying</hi> a <hi>worldly Paradiſe here, and another hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, The fault is in the taſte, not in the meat; in the folly of the judgment, not in the Pearl, when a Grain of Corn is preferred before it. To taſte ſpiritual joyes, a man muſt be ſpiritual; for the <hi>Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth the things of the spirit;</hi> and like loveth his like. Between a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man, and ſpiritual joyes, there is as mighty an appetite and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as between <hi>fleſhly meat,</hi> and a <hi>carnal ſtomack.</hi> Therefore the want of this taſte and apprehenſion condemneth the world to be carnal, but mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the joyes ſpiritual, as being above her carnal apprehenſion. Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Herein lies the fault; few feel theſe joyes in this life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not <hi>crack the ſhell,</hi> to <hi>get the kernel:</hi> they will not <hi>pare the fruit,</hi> to <hi>eat the pulp?</hi> nor <hi>till the ground,</hi> to <hi>reap the Harveſt.</hi> They fly the Wars, and thereby loſe the glory of the Victory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They will not dig the craggy Mountain to find the Mine of Gold: nor prune the Vine, therefore enjoy not the fruit. They fly Mortification, and therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not the ſweet ſpiritual Conſolation, which ever attends the ſame. And ſo much for the Reaſons. The Uſe may be manifold.</p>

How is it that we are not more affected therewith?</p>
               <p>The only reaſon is, moſt men are ſo far from believing the <hi>Word of God</hi> in this point, that they do not believe there is a God. <hi>The Fool,</hi> ſays <hi>David, hath ſaid in his heart there is no God, Pſalm</hi> 53. 1. <hi>They,</hi> meaning the wicked, <hi>think always there is no God, Pſalm</hi> 10. 4. to 14. And the reaſon follows, <hi>His ways always proſper, Pſalm</hi> 73. 3. to 21. And hence it is, that they <hi>live like beaſts,</hi> becauſe they think they ſhall <hi>die like beasts,</hi> without any anſwer for what they have either acted or left undone; and accordingly reſolve, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt hath acquainted us with their inmoſt thoughts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37119:13"/>
or the procuring of the other. As, oh the madneſs of theſe men! that cannot be hired to hold their finger for one minute in the weak flame of a farthing candle, and yet for trifles will plunge themſelves body and ſoul into thoſe endleſs and infinitely ſcorching flames of Hell-fire.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>King</hi> but threatens a <hi>Malefactor</hi> to the Dungeon, to the Rack, to the Wheel, his bones tremble, a terrible palſie runs through all his joynts: but let <hi>God</hi> threaten the unſufferable Torments of <hi>burning Tophet,</hi> we ſtand unmoved, undaunted.

And that whatſoever wicked men enjoy here, it is but as in a dream; their plenty is but like a drop of pleaſure, before a River of ſorrow and diſpleaſure: And whatſoever the godly feel, but as a drop of miſery before a River of mercy and glory. That though Thou, the great and juſt Judge of all the World, comeſt ſlowly to Judgment, yet Thou wilt come ſurely.

That Heaven is a Treaſure worthy our hearts, a Purchaſe worthy our lives: That when all is done, how to be ſaved is the beſt plot. That there is no mention of one in the whole Bible that ever ſinned without repentance, but he was puniſhed without mercy. For then there would not <hi>be a Fornicator,</hi> or <hi>prophane perſon, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for a portion of meat ſold his inheritance, Heb.</hi> 12. 16. Then they would not be of the number of thoſe, that ſo doted upon <hi>Purchaſes,</hi> and <hi>Farms,</hi> and <hi>Oxen, that they made light of going to the Lords Supper, Luke</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20.

               <p>Sect. 2. SEcondly, Are the Joys of Heaven ſo unſpeakable and glorious? How then ſhould we admire the love and bounty of God, and bleſs his Name, who for the performance of ſo ſmall a work, hath propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great a Reward? And for the obtaining of ſuch an happy ſtate, hath impoſed ſuch an eaſie Task. Yea more, is Heaven ſo unſpeakably ſweet and delectable, is Hell ſo unutterably doleful? Then let nothing be thought too much that we can either do or ſuffer for Chriſt, who hath <hi>freed us from the one, and purchaſed for us the other.</hi> Though indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we are able to do or ſuffer here, can be compared with thoſe woes we have deſerved in Hell, or thoſe joys we are reſerved to in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And indeed, that we are now out of Hell, there to fry in flames of fire and brimſtone, never to be freed; that we have the free offer of Grace here, and everlaſting glory hereafter in Heaven, we are only behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. We are all by nature, <hi>as Traytors, condemned to ſuffer eternal torments in Hell-fire,</hi> being only <hi>reprieved</hi> for a time: But from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and eternity of torment, <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath freed and delivered us.</p>
               <p>O think then! yea, be ever thinking of it, how rich the mercy of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> was in freeing us; and that by laying down his own life to redeem us. Yea, how can we be thankful enough for ſo great a bleſſing? It was a mercy beſtowed, and a way found out, that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonish all the ſons of men on Earth, and Angels in Heaven. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37119:15"/>
ſo, let us ſtudy to be as thankful as we can. Hath Chriſt done ſo much for us, and ſhall we deny him any thing he requireth of us? Nor can any one in common reaſon meditate ſo unbottomed a love, and not ſtudy and ſtrive for an anſwerable and thankful demeanour. If a Friend had given us but a thouſandth part of what God and Chriſt hath, we ſhould heartily love him all our lives, and think no thanks ſufficient: What price then ſhould we ſet upon Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Life of our lives, and the Soul of our Souls? Do we then for Chriſts ſake, what we would do for a Friends ſake. Yea, let us abhor our ſelves for our former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs, and our wonderful provoking of him. Hearken we unto Chriſts voice, in all that he ſaith unto us, without being ſwayed one way or another, as the moſt are? Let us whom Chriſt hath redeemed, expreſs our thankfulneſs, by obeying all that he ſaith unto us, whatever it coſts us, ſince nothing can be too much to endure for thoſe pleaſures which ſhall endure for ever. As, Who would not obtain Heaven at any rate, at any coſt or trouble whatſoever?</p>
               <p>In Heaven is a Crown laid up for all ſuch as ſuffer for Righteouſneſs, even a Crown without cares, without rivals, without envy, without end; And is not this reward enough for all that Men or Devils can do againſt us? Who would not ſerve a ſhort Apprenticeſhip in Gods ſervice here, to be made for ever free in glory? Yea, who would not be a <hi>Philpot</hi> for a month, or a <hi>Lazarus</hi> for a day, or a <hi>Stephen</hi> for an hour, that he might be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome for ever? Nothing can be too much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, for thoſe pleaſures that endure for ever. Yea, what pain can we think too much to ſuffer? What little enough to do, to obtain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? For this incorruptible Crown of Glory in Heaven? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. where we ſhall have all tears wiped from our eyes; where we ſhall ceaſe to ſorrow, ceaſe to ſuffer, ceaſe to ſin, where God ſhall turn all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our afflictions, into the pure wine of endleſs and unexpreſſible comfort.</p>
               <p>You ſhall ſometimes ſee an hired ſervant, venture his life for his new Maſter, that will ſcarce pay him his wages at the years end; and can we ſuffer too much for our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> who giveth every one that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him, not Fields and Vineyards, as <hi>Saul</hi> pretended, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor Towns and Cities, as <hi>Cicero</hi> is pleaſed to boaſt of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but even an hundred-fold more than we part withal here in this life, and eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Heaven hereafter, <hi>John</hi> 14. 2.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, cauſeth us a far more excellent and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Wherefore, as you ever expect or hope for <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as you would eſcape the <hi>tormenting flames of Hell-fire, ceaſe to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, learn to do well.</hi> For <hi>Sanctification</hi> is the <hi>way to Glorification, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> to <hi>eternal happineſs.</hi> If we would have <hi>God to glorifie our bodies in Heaven,</hi> we alſo muſt <hi>glorifie God in our bodies here on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for concluſion: Are the <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> ſo unſpeakable and glorious? the <hi>torments of Hell</hi> ſo woful and dolorous? Then it behoves all <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of Families, to ſee to their <hi>Childrens and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſouls,</hi> and that they miſcarry not through their neglect. As tell me, Will not their blood be required at your hands, if they periſh through your neglect? Will it not be ſad to have <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> riſe up in judgment againſt you, and to bring in Evidence at the great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Chriſt? ſaying, Lord, my Father never minded me, my Maſter never regarded me; I might ſin, he never reproved me; I might go to Hell, it was all one to him. Will not this be ſad?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If it be ſo, let <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> conſider, that 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>have luſt reſtrained, than ſatisfied:</hi> 'tis better to be held in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from ſin, than to have a wicked liberty. Be not angry with thoſe <hi>who will not ſee you damn your ſouls, and let you alone:</hi> they are your beſt Friends. <hi>Fear the strokes of Gods anger,</hi> be they ſpiritual or eternal, <hi>more than the ſtrokes of men.</hi> What's a <hi>Fetter</hi> to a <hi>Dungeon? a Gallows</hi> to <hi>Hell-fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give not way to imaginary, ſpeculative, heart-ſins: <hi>Murther in the heart, uncleanneſs in the eye, and thoughts given way to,</hi> will come to <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al murther,</hi> and <hi>bodily uncleanneſs</hi> at laſt. <hi>Keep Satan at a Diſtance;</hi> if he get but in, he will be too hard for you. And let ſo much ſerve to have been ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Upon <hi>the one</hi> I have ſtood the longer, that ſo I might, if <hi>God</hi> ſo pleaſe, be a means to ſave ſome with fear, <hi>plucking them out of the fire of Gods wrath,</hi> under which, without <hi>repentance,</hi> they muſt lye everlaſtingly.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>the other,</hi> I have, like the <hi>Searchers of Canaan,</hi> brought you a cluſter of Grapes, to give the <hi>Reader a taſte</hi> thereby, of the plentiful <hi>vintage</hi> we may expect, and look for in the <hi>heavenly Canaan.</hi>
