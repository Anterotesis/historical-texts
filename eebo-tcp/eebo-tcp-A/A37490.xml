            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong all the Cities in <hi>Hungary</hi> is <hi>Offen</hi> the pleasantest, best Scituated and Metropolis; having been the only Seat and residence of the Kings of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Some derive its name from the many Ovens or Pits wherein formerly Lime hath been burnt. <hi>Solomon Schweiger</hi> derives its name from King <hi>Ovo,</hi> who reigned in the time of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the III.</p>
            <p>By the Latines it was called <hi>Buda,</hi> from <hi>Buda</hi> King <hi>Attillas</hi> Brother, who re-edified or inlarged it. Yet others say, <hi>Buda</hi> is corruptly so called from <hi>Bada,</hi> Baths; and takes its name from the renowned Warm Baths in it. Of some it was formerly called <hi>Etzel Burgh</hi> (viz. <hi>Ass-hill</hi>) or <hi>Attilias Burgh; Etzel</hi> signifying in the <hi>German</hi> Language Ass.</p>
            <p>This City being 32 German miles distant from <hi>Vienna,</hi> admits of six divisions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Castle marked D. 2. <hi>The Over Town</hi> at E. 3. The long Subburbs towards the South, by which the Block-House in St. <hi>Gerrards</hi> Fields Stands marked F. 4. The Water Town, or Jews Town, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Danow,</hi> and its Walls butting and joyning to it, marked H. 5. The Subburbs adjoyning to the Jews Town; and in them a small four angled Pallace. 6. <hi>Pest</hi> marked B. on the other side of the <hi>Danow</hi>; and hath a Bridge standing on 36 Ships between it and <hi>Offen.</hi> The <hi>Danow</hi> is here about an <hi>English</hi> Mile broad.</p>
            <p>The Walls and Bulwarks of this City are very strong; and the Buildings of the whole City have formerly been very exquisite and Curious, as is yet to be seen in the Castle.</p>
            <p>From this City did the <hi>Turks</hi> the last year furnish their Leaguer before <hi>Vienna,</hi> with all necessaries: It having excellent Grain brought thither from Old <hi>Offen</hi>: It hath many Hot Baths in it; and in them plenty of good Fish, which presently die if they are put into cold Water.</p>
            <p>Here are among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> Christians allowed, as well Romanists as Protestants, each having particularly a good School. The Church of our Lady belongs to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and is for them a Burying place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rascians</hi> (a false deceitful People) dwell here in great numbers, who exercise all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of these parts (by perversion) under the notion of Christianity.</p>
            <p>Here are many ruines of fair Buildings, formerly erected by the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Kings; particularly by <hi>Matthias Corvinus</hi> in whose Pallace the <hi>Visier</hi> keeps his residence: As also of many curious <hi>Turkish Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, Caravan Serais,</hi> and eight stately Baths, of which the Bath of <hi>Vili-bie</hi> is the fairest: Being much amended by <hi>Soliman.</hi> Here are now <hi>Turkish</hi> Convents and Cloisters.</p>
            <p>The most inhabitants are Soldiers, and Grants <hi>Turks,</hi> who live (though meanly) in the fairest Houses.</p>
            <p>Here King <hi>Mat. Corvinus</hi> did about 200 years ago furnish a curious Library, which afterwards the <hi>Turks</hi> demolisht; but yet a good part of it was collected into the Imperial Library of <hi>Vienna,</hi> the rest destroyed by Fire.</p>
            <p>Near this Metropolis; stands <hi>Old Offen,</hi> in a very unhealthy Soyl which of the Ancients was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Sicambria,</hi> where the <hi>Siambrian</hi> Soldiers in the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> kept their Quarters, whose Monuments of Antiquity are yet found here.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding the affairs of <hi>Offen,</hi> you must know that Sultan <hi>Soliman, Anno</hi> 1526. came with a great Army personally before this City, and <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. Mastered it; pardon'd the <hi>Germans,</hi> but destroyed and captivated the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> their Wives and Children. The <hi>Jews</hi> Town held out yet, so that the Sultan lost 2500 Men before it; who at last gained it, and revenged their obstinacy, so, as that of 3500 of them no more than 20 remained alive.</p>
            <p>In the following year King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> regained the City <hi>Offen.</hi> But in <hi>Anno</hi> 1529 <hi>Soliman</hi> with a mighty Power came again before it; and having gained the Castle, entered it with 1000 Turks (says our Author) against one Christian; Yet was he in three Storms repulsed. So that (says our Author) the thought the Castle was full of Devils. And now the besieged being tyred out, and not reasonably hoping for any relief, Capitulated, and agreed to march out in their full Arms: But when they did the <hi>Turks</hi> fell upon them, contrary to their Parol, and slaughtered them; so that not above 16 of them escaped alive. Only their former Commander <hi>Thomas Radasti</hi> and his Souldiers had their liberties: <hi>Soliman</hi> trusting to their Capitulations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1541. came the Imperial General <hi>Willem</hi> van <hi>Roggendorff</hi> with 40000 men and 40 Cannon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City, but <hi>Izabel,</hi> Widow of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to whom the Sultan deputed the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Crown after the defeat of King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Zips,</hi> called in the <hi>Turks</hi> to their assistance. So that the Christians were forced to quit the Siege, with the loss of many <hi>Hungarians</hi>: And the <hi>Germans</hi> who were possest of <hi>Gerrards Berg</hi> were overcome by the Janisaries. <hi>Anno</hi> 1542. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and his Brother King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> sent a great Army under the Command of <hi>Joachim</hi> Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> before this City, who made many Stormings, with the loss of many Men: But the besieged defended themselves with great resolution; and diseases hapning in the Camp, the besiegers were forced to draw off, and quit the Siege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. The Heer Van <hi>Schwartzenburg</hi> attempted to take the City by Surprize; and with 10000 men came before it: But the attempt miscarried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1602, <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. came the Christians again, with a strong Army before this City, and with fire Engines burnt the long Bridge of Boats; by which many Turks were destroy'd, and the Fore and Water Towns gained by Storm. They gain'd <hi>Pest</hi> also, and the Block-house on <hi>Gerrards-hill</hi>: So that this City was closely blockt up on all sides. But the Besieged making strong and often Sallies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Provisions by Water; the Christians were at last forc'd to raise the Siege: Yet first, by a great Breach their Batteries had made, they made a very vigorous Storm, <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. on the Over-Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at 3 a clock afternoon, and continued it till midnight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. The greatest part of this City was by Fire laid in Ashes, many Cannons burnt on the Bulwarks, several thousands of Souls lost, and a great deal of rich Merchandize consum'd and spoil'd in in these Flames.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. Another Fire hapned, which did as much mischief as the former. This hapned by Lightning, and laid 2000 Houses in Ashes.</p>
            <p>Since <hi>Anno</hi> 1529. <hi>Offen</hi> has remained 155 years in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Power. But this present year 1684. the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> General for the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, having first gain'd <hi>Vice-Grad, Vacchia</hi> and <hi>Pest,</hi> on <hi>July</hi> 4. (being the day in the former year the <hi>Turks</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Vienna</hi>) came before the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as being of so great concern, that on the gaining of it the whole Conquest of <hi>Hungary</hi> depended. He having 40000 men, begirt it close on all sides with well fortified Works, and raised several Batteries against it; making many efforts for the regaining it. But many of his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being lost by the desperate Sallies of the <hi>Turks</hi>; To his assistance came not only his Highness the Elector Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with 12000 men, but several Troops of the <hi>Suabian</hi> Circle, about 4000 more.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, The <hi>Turks</hi> had so well fortify'd the City, having 16000 resolute Janisaries in it, besides Citizens, and others, and all Provisions necessary for its defence, indured the Siege very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and made many Couragious and desperate Sallies out of the City, upon the Christians, of whom they have made great slaughter, though with the loss of many of themselves; even till they were reduced from 16000 (as aforesaid) to 4000 Janisaries. And besides the <hi>Serasquier</hi> Bassa with (at first) but 16000 men, came hovering about the Siege, to devert the Christian Army from their more vigorous attempts upon the City: And though the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops were lodged between the River <hi>Danow</hi> and the City, yet did the <hi>Serasquier</hi> by Water frequently put Succors of Men and Provisions into it, which so strengthned and incouraged the defendents, that now the Winter coming on, and their Principal Mine discovered by a Renegado, who got into the City, and other Mines fill'd by Springs and overflowings of the River, and the <hi>Serasquiers</hi> numbers increased to 40000 men, The Christians in a Council of War <hi>Oct.</hi> 29. resolved to put the Emperours Orders for raising the Seige, in execution: And accordingly, having first sent all their sick and wounded men away with the Baggage, the Canon was drawn off from the Batteries, and planted for the defence of the Troops in their retreat to the Isle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where the whole Army consisting of about 30000 Men passed the <hi>Danube, Nov.</hi> 1. on a Bridge of Boats: The Cavalry facing the Enemy while the Foot marched off, without the loss of one man in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
