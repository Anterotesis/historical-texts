            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Two things I have to deliver to thine eare, which this figure cannot convey unto thine eye. First, what it intendeth: Next, how thou maiest correct the Picture, if it need amending.</p>
            <p>For the first; it intendeth to acquaint thee with this story. In the Countie of <hi>Devon,</hi> and in the Parish of the famous Towne of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> there is a Village called <hi>Stone-house; Viculum Piscatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> I may justly terme it, a pretty little Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne, for it consisteth mostly of men that live by the Sea, and gaine their livelihood by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this village there dwelleth one <hi>Iohn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:20809:3"/>
a Fisherman, whose wife having fulfilled the usuall moneths and weekes of womens burdens, upon the twentieth day of this present moneth <hi>October</hi> fell in travell, and by the helpe of a second Mid wife (through Gods mercy and goodnesse) was the poore mother (after the wearie travell of thirteene or foureteene painefull houres) safely delivered of the burden. A Birth not more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Mother (tho very painefull doubtlesse beeing still-borne,) then strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to all the beholders. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, with admiration: and, as it falleth out in such a case, soone is the fame thereof spread all abroad. Towne and Countrey commeth in to see, that hereafter they might (as I for my part must) say; At such a time, in such a place, I saw the strangest birth in all respects, that ever I saw or heard before. Two heads, and neckes, two backes, and sets of ribbes, foure armes and hands, foure thighes and legges: in a word, from head to heele (so farre as the eye could discerne) two compleat and perfect bodies, but concorporate and ioyned together from breast to belly, two in one.</p>
            <p>For the second thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> how to correct the picture, if it need amendment; take this. When I first cast mine eye upon them lying on the table, I said, surely if those children had bin living, Art might have caused a just separation of them, for I conceived them to bee no other than two bodies joyned together in one common skin. But I soone perceived mine Errour, when put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20809:3"/>
my finger to feele the Collar the Cannell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone (I meane that place where you see them<note place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ae.</note> begin to joyne together) I found that they had but one breast-bone common to them both, and by it, as by a partition wall, were their two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (as two chambers) both joyned &amp; separated: joyned together in respect of the externall bulke, separated in respect of the internall contents. This concorporation lasted downe to the Navell or a little beneath, which also was in common to them both, I still speak of what the eye could see, happily so soone as that string of the umbilicall vessels, by which the mothers wombe supplied food and nourishment to the birth had passed the skinne, it might dispart it selfe. But outwardly it was one in common. Whence also it was conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, that though these twinnes might have several hearts, and lungs answerable to their severall heads and neckes, yet but one common Liver to them both. The truth of this conjecture I leave to the Colledge of Physitians to discover, that is not my profession, nor will I presume to determine any thing in anothers Art, onely this Obiection I have against it: that supposing one common Liver, it must either gird them round or be misplaced in one of them: for turning brest to brest, and belly to belly, you ioyne the left side of the one body to the right side of the other: so that I say, except the liver do compasse it round, it shall be misplaced in the one.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the story. These two twins were not more neerely ioyned in the bulk of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20809:4"/>
than they were in all parts and proportions like to one another where they were disparted; so that two the likest twins that ever you saw were not more like: nay the glasse cannot (I thinke) give a truer answer to the face than these were each to other. Which I doe the more boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, because having satisfyed mine eye with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them on the one side as they lay, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the women to turne the other side, and laying them as before (face to face, and foot to foot) I could perceive no difference in them at all from what I had seene before. One thing I forgot, till it was too late: which if I had remembred, I verily perswade my selfe, might have been done, <hi>viz.</hi> To lay them one upon another. The which I mention, lest happily any might conceive that the ioyncture of their bodies might leane to one side more than to another. I was about to aske the women whether the mother felt them living in the wombe; when presently I corrected my selfe, seeing each part and limbe, yea, and the whole body of either growne (as indeed it was) to a iust maturity: each by himselfe, had they beene sundered, had been a iust birth; having haire on the heads, nailes on their hands and toes, nay which is more (except the women were much deceived they had some teeth in their head: and to confesse the truth, I thought so too, till others that had more skil and experience perswaded me to the contrary. Howsoever, the children were each of them as compleat and perfect as Births use to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:20809:4"/>Vpon these grounds I corrected my selfe in my former intended question: for how should they grow to that perfection of stature, had they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life? But the mid-wife and the women told me, that they were living and lively some few houres before they were borne: So that in all likely-hood, had a skilfull hand been made use of at the first, they might have lived to see the light, if not to inioy it. But God that gave them a life and beeing in the wombe, knowing that life upon earth would have beene a burden to them, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded better for them, and tooke them to himselfe.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given a true, and I thinke a full narration of this worke of wonder which God hath shewed here amongst us. And with it, I am content to send abroad some few notes prepared for the confluence of people, met together, when this birth was layed into the earth. Something me thought was fitting to be commended to them that saw it, while the thing was fresh in mind; and that something such as it is: loe here it is. Rather would I shame my selfe in being over-busie, than be wanting in what I conceit may not be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the countrey wherein I live. Read then these notes, And if thou count not this halfe houre ill bestowed, thou wilt I trust (I desire thou wouldest) pray for him, who if thou love the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> in sincerity, prayeth for thee, that thou maiest prosper and be in health, even as thy soule prospereth.</p>

               </gap>ights to make a gaine by them? Whether the Births being once dead, may be kept from the grave for the former ends? Whether the parents of such births may sel them to another. For<note place="margin">These two also are mentioned by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes. <hi>Cap. De Monstris.</hi>
               </note> my part I would be loth to prejudice the better and morall judgements of any. But to speak plainly, I do make scruple of the first, and therfore much more of the two later cases. For if not living they are to be prostituted to the covetousnesse of any; much lesse being dead, when the grave calls for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all Christian births: the grave, I say, wherein they are to be laid up: that therein they may lay downe the present dishonor, and thence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20809:8"/>
be raised againe in glory. And if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may not doe this; how much lesse may they deliver it over to another? But you will say to mee, suppose them living, why may they not be used to this end, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit for none im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are these. Our delight is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by our desires, nor doe I see it lawfull to delight in what may not be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And who would desire a mishapen Birth, to be the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of his owne body? Adde this, all Crosses call for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: and where that is expected, I see not how there can bee place either for profit or pleasure to bee thought upon:</p>
            <p>But to returne againe to what wee had in hand. These Births (as I said) though dead, yet speake and preach to the world the present hand of God in the wombe of the mother.</p>

               </note> In all these accidents and occasions the Philosophers (and physitians also who build upon the ground of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, nor can well subsist without them) they I say would attribute all these impeditions and alterations of Nature to secondary causes: either internall, as the defectivenesse or excesse of seminall materialls; or externall, as the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the formative facultie, or indisposednesse of the Vessells, or strength of Conceit or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20809:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Astrologer may adde another cause, powerfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his opinion, to pervert and overthrow the good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, <hi>sc.</hi> the constellations of the planets, and configuration of their aspects. And happily they may pitch upon some reasons for the coalition of these two twinnes into one: nor doe we deny but the Philosopher may bee allowed in these his conjectures: nor may hee seeme to shoot beside the marke, that should ascribe it to some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, colliding and dashing these two new-formed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryons in the wombe, casting them so one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that the contiguity and overmuch closenesse of their bodies caused the aforesaid coalition: so have wee seene two trees over closely leaning one upon another grow into one, and covered with one barke. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, I say, may seeme to speake reason (not so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer, at least in mine Opinion.) Onely he and others must bee intreated to looke higher, and to take notice of the speciall hand of God, whose worke alone it is to sort and compound the activities of secondary causes; that what by the blessing of God might have beene otherwise, is now thus disposed of for ends best knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>This is the conclusion which Religion teacheth: and which it becommeth mee as a Divine to put you in minde of. The Astrologer is taught to say, <hi>Astraregunt homines.</hi> The influence of the Starres doe rule the Actions of the sonnes of men. But the Christian knoweth that <hi>regit astra Deus,</hi> God over-ruleth the starres. So that if wee should grant an influence in the planets, and a power in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations: yet farre be it from us to account it fatall, and inalterable: No we know that God sitteth in the Heavens, and doth whatsoever hee will. <hi>David</hi> in the Psalmes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth to his hand the framing of his body and members in the wombet. <hi>Thine hands have made me and fashioned</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:20809:9"/>
               <hi>me. Thou hast covered mee in my mothers wombe. Thine eyes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 119. 73. Psa. 139. 13 16.</note> (saith hee) <hi>did see my substance yet beeing unperfect, and in thy booke all my members were written, which in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance were fashioned:</hi> or (as it is in the Margent) <hi>all of them written, what dayes they should be fashioned,</hi> when as yet there was none of them. To him therefore belongeth the disposing of the materialls and shaping of the Birth: Now then, is God so tyed to his materialls, that if there be too much for one, or too little for two complete and perfect features, hee can neither detract nor multiply? Must his worke bee cut off with what the Philosopher <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let no man therefore taxe me of any excesse in religious thoughts, or count it overmuch curiositie, if I propound to you an observation or two, grounded upon this and the like occasions. Each Comet (as experience hath taught men) is in its kinde Doctrinal, and blaseth forth something or other worthy our observation. <hi>Nec in vanum toties ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sere Cometae:</hi> seldome are those super-terrestriall blazes kindled in vaine. Men do commonly count them <hi>praenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios</hi>

            <p>I shall not therefore I hope, transcend the limits of my calling, nor wrong the providence of God, if I take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to say, touching this strange-birth, which God hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to blaze here amongst us, and from us, to the whole Countrey, to say of it, as the Apostle saith of the bloud of <hi>Abel;</hi> being dead, it yet speaketh. What did or doth the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> speake, but the irreversible wrath of God against Cain, &amp; in him against all wilfull and malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours of religious persons? I doe not say, this speaketh
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20809:9"/>
so bitter things; but yet it speaketh something in common with the rest of strange and mishapen Births: and if I deceive not my selfe over-much, something in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar by it selfe: so then it speaketh two things, perhaps more, but two I pitch upon, not averring them both spoken with the same evidence, but both truly: and which is more, seasonably.</p>
            <p>First then this, and all monstrous &amp; misfeatured Births,<note place="margin">Observa. 1.</note> speake this: That it is a singular Mercie of God, when the Births of the Wombe are not mis-formed: when they receive their faire and perfect feature. A Lesson truly worth the noting in this forgetfull Age: Mercies that are ordinarie wee swallow; and take small notice of them: Such a worke as this causeth us to see what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is bet wixt comlinesse and deformity: betwixt Perfection and Imperfection in the Body. Doth any make scruple of what I say? Let that man consider the discomfort of Deformitie: How lyable it is daily to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration through the evill custome of wicked men, more ready to cast it in the teeth, than condole or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate, if God hath stampt a deformity upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p>Know wee not that the members of the Bodie are the Organs and Instruments of the Soul, in the Service of God and man? Defect or excesse must needs breed griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it createth trouble. Consider wee this birth, thus double-membred, to have seene them lying upon the table, to see them deciphered upon the paper might happily be thought a sight not much unpleasant: But let your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination give them life, and tell mee how uncomfortable, yea burthensome must they be to others, yea and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: when as though two, yet so neere incorporated, that the one cannot helpe the other. How should they eat, sleep, walke, sit, or satisfie nature, but with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20809:10"/>
Is it then discomfort to have a marke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or dis-advantage cast upon the Births of the Womb? And is it not a singular Mercie to have them born compleat in shape and feature? Doubtlesse it is.</p>
            <p>All reason therefore is that this Mercie of God unto us in the issue of our Loins should be acknowledged with all thankefulnesse. If other Mercies, why not this? The Husbandman, when hee hath his Corne and Wine increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, when housed: The Merchant, when his Venture is returned: The Owner when his Ship is arrived, and both have made a good voiage: If there be any religion dwelling in their brests, will in a solemne manner confesse before the Sonnes of men the loving kindnesse of the Lord. When women have received safe deliverance from the great paines and perills of Child-birth, the Church doth call them (and surely it had need to call them) to give hearty thanks to God: And ought not this also to be remembred, That the Children borne give hope of Comfort to their Parents? Hope I say, that a faire and well-featured Body may be the comfortable house and habitation of an Holy soule? Doubtlesse it ought: Doth not David intimate so much in the afore-mentioned Psalme, when hee saith, I<note place="margin">

            <p>Know wee not that God hath just cause to blast every birth of ours, if he would be extreme? Partly, in respect of the abuse of the Bed; which, though hee hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the use of man by the benediction of the Church, that so in the sober use thereof every one should possesse his Vessell in sanctification and honour; yet is it too often riotously and wantonly abused. Partly, I say, for these Abuses, but specially in respect of that Originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which cleaveth to the Fruit of the womb, even from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20809:10"/>
the first conception, as the Psalmist sheweth. From this gilt and filth not one of all the Race of Adam is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 5.</note> No sooner doe we receave a Being, but it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with sinfulnesse: In which respect, who can denie, but God might justly blast the body with deformity? Which if hee doe not when hee might, is it not a favour, and so to be acknowledged? Wee acknowledge it a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favour to the Soule (as it is reason wee should) that God doth exempt any from that common damnation, which is due to all by Adams transgression: And is it not to be confessed a Mercie to the body? For why? VVhen the body doth want its perfect feature, when the Soule doth want the exercise of wit and reason, more or lesse: Is not this an effect of Sinne, and so to bee accounted: Doth God in this any thing more than what Iustice doth allow? Shall wee say it is an act of his absolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? I trow not: VVhat is justly done to some, is it not mercie, not to doe to others? Yes (my Dearely beloved) it is Mercie, free and undeserved Mercie: O that in this also, as in other things, I say, O that men would therfore praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and for his wonderfull VVorks to the Sonnes of men!</p>
            <p>Contrarily, when the Hand of Iustice hath found any out, when any birth of ours is brought into the world misformed, and mis-featured: If God hath (as it were) spit in the face, and laid the black-finger of Deformity upon the body, ought it not to bee entertained with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Heart, and Humiliation? Hath God written in great Letters the guilt of Sin, and in a deformed body drawn a resemblance of the Soules deformity; drawn it (I say) so; that others may see and know, that wee also are defiled in his sight? and shall wee not blush to heare it, to see it thus cast in our teeth, and laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:20809:11"/>This for the Parties: but is this all? Is it nothing to you all that passe by, or that come to see? Mee thinkes It should: Can you, any of you, wash your hands in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie? are not you also Sinners in the sight of God? VVhat can you alledge, why this might not have beene yours? Did you prevent it by prayer? I trust you will hereafter: and acknowledge the justnesse of their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who remember women with child: but happily you have not hitherto thought upon it: If so; If God might have throwne the tower of Siloam upon your heads also, if set a marke of his displeasure upon your births, and yet hath not done it; will you not see and say, The Lord hath done great things for us? Lord, what am I, that thou hast spared mee? am I more holy, lesse sinfull than my neighbour? No, no: It is thy free Mercie and undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Favour, Oh inlarge my heart to praise thy Name.</p>
            <p>Heere then see and bewaile the iniquity and irreligion of this our Age, at least of numbers in the same. The common sort make no further use of these Brodigies and Strange-births, than as a matter of wonder and table-talk: looke upon them with none other eyes, than with which they would behold an African monster, a mishapen beast. It was not thus in the better Ages of the world. VVee reade in the ninth Chapter of Saint Iohn: that the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when they saw the man that was borne blind, they come to our blessed Savior, with <hi>Quis peccavit?</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Who hath sinned? See the Religion of those times: They lookt upon sinne as the cause of defective or redundant births. Truth indeed, our Saviour answereth: Neither this man, nor his parents. By which Speech of Christ, wee must not thinke that they are excused from all sinne: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse his parents had sinned; and conceived him in sinne, else had not this beene cast upon him: No place for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and deformities in the state of Innocence. But why

God should take the forfeiture in this, rather than in his Neighbour, this was meerely <hi>Ex Dei bene-placit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> the good pleasure of God, who had in this a purpose to prepare and make way for the glory of Christ in curing the man.</p>
            <p>The same happily might bee said in these occasions whereof wee speake: To the Question, <hi>Quis pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit;</hi> Who hath sioned? happily Christ (who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Counsels of his Father) might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>Neque hic, neque parentes,</hi> Neither he, nor his Parents: Not to exempt them from sinne altogether, but to teach us, that some other end &amp; purpose God had beside the visitation of their sin: (though that also we find somtimes to bemanifested, when God by such occasions doth awaken the coscience to confesse secret and unbewailed sins) beside, I say, the visitation of sin: Somtimes to discover the Atheism, Irreligion of many, perhaps also their Covetousnesse, who would rather make a benefit of such births, &amp; instead of Humiliation for a Crosse, teach the parents to account such births for blessings, which doe prove so profitable. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to prompt unto the Ministerie a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation needfull for the present state of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: A meditation which happily his text would not afford him. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> This Lesson, as you see, is by this occasion prompted to me, presented to you: That you remember hereafter, to acknowledge it as a Mercie: when Children come into the world well-featured, the members of their body in a due proportion apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly each to other corresponding, neither defective, nor redundant: To bewaile it as a crosse from God, when it is otherwise: that so penitencie may provide a Remedie, either of the deformity by the hand of Man; or of the discomfort by the stroke of Death.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20809:12"/>
This Lesson, I say, is now presented to you, and I trust will bee remembred by you: And if so; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Question may goe on as it is in the words of our Saviour. Neither this man, nor his parents, but that the works of God should bee made manifest in him.</p>
            <p>To winde up this first observation in a word, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the religion of the Disciples: they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looke up to sinne as to the cause of Gods Hand: nor shall it mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become us to doe the like: provided alway, that it bee (what they forgot) in our owne occasion rather than in anothers. Doe I suffer? Let mee say, Lord, I have sinned; Thou art just. Doth another suffer? Let mee say, Lord, thou art mercifull to me: this case might have beene mine. Blessed bee thy Name for ever.</p>
            <p>Something long have I stood upon this, because I am sure this is a Lesson, which all monstrous and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen births, though dead, yet speake for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Living: I will dispatch the other more briefely, which may seeme to bee peculiar to this one in respect of the shape thereof.<note place="margin">Observat. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The twinnes you see are males; brothers, had they beene borne alive. To love as brethren, is the duty of Christians: a Duty frequently remembred by the Apostles, and powerfully pressed. To love, is to have one soule in two bodies; One, not so much by union of essence as by combination of Affection: And lo, here a fit resemblance of this mutuall duty: As fit, as lively almost as can be devised: Here are all the parts and members of Consultation, and operation for two persons; onely here is one body, one brest, one belly: the brest the seat of the heart, the belly of the bowells: One I say, not in the Identity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20809:12"/>
but in the conglutination of externall parts from brest to belly: whether one heart, one liver, one community of Intestines, is more than wee could see; though all reason indeed giveth them to be two throughout in all parts: yet you see, so two in one, that had they lived to the yeares of expression, wee might well have expected from them united hearts, intire affections, and more than Sympathie, each to other, as to himselfe. Surely, these are not more neere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y conjoyned in brest and belly, than Christians ought to be in heart &amp; affection. These two were one body; Christians are one spirit: though severall bodies<note place="margin">Cor. 12. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and soules, yet one and the same spirit diffused into all, to enlive and quicken all. Nor would it have beene more prodigious for these Twinnes (suppose they had lived to bee men) to have quarrelled and contested one against another: than it is for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to quarrell and contend, specially to live in the minde of irreconciliation. To these Twinnes (had they quarrelled) a man might have sayd, you are one body: To Christians a man may well say, You are one spirit: why doe you wrong one to another? Was that an Argument in all reason fit to compound the supposed differences of these? And shall not this bee able to perswade peace, nay love among Christians? Mee thinketh it should: Nay, I am sure, if this doe not prevaile, the faultie person shall one day smart for it: perhaps when Repentance for it will come too late.</p>
            <p>Wel, I have now acquainted you with my thoughts. I have shewed to you, how this Birth, though dead, yet speaketh: Truth it is, Faith alone hath eares to heare these Lessons, these Instructions: Nature is deafe, and Reason dull in these occasions: A brutish<note place="margin">Ps. 92. 6.</note>

man knoweth not; neither doth a foole understand: Faith quickneth the Vnderstanding to apprehend: the Will to believe: the Affections to take pleasure in these Meditations.</p>
            <p>Which Faith, since it is the gift of God, let us now turne our selves to him with hearty devotion, desiring him to bestow upon us the gift of Faith, and all grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
