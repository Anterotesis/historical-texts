            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </item>

            <p>All which notes I have proved in my Latine Treatise of Antichrist, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to agree to the now Church of Rome, the forbidding of marriage, and commanding abstinence from meates, <hi>part. 1. lib. 3. cap. 2. &amp; 3.</hi> Idolatry, <hi>ibid. cap. 3. §. 5.</hi> Miracles, <hi>lib. 6. cap. 1. §. 5.</hi> whereby it is evident, that the new Church of Rome, hath made this Apostasie. Now let us consider, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Church of Rome is revolted from the faith. By faith in this question we understand, not the habit or grace of faith, but the Doctrine of faith, <hi>Non id quo creditur,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">This distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by S. Augustine, de Trinit. lib. 13. c. 2. and by the master of the sentences.

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that which we doe beleeve. In which sense the word faith is often used both in the Scriptures, and also in the monuments of Ecclesiasticall writers. Now the Doctrine of faith is either generall or speciall. The generall are the whole canonicall Scriptures, or the written Word of God in generall, which is <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22501:4"/>
               <hi>fidei adaequatum,</hi> the even object, the rule and foundation of faith: so that whatsoever doctrine is contained in the Scriptures either expressely, or by necessary consequence, is to bee received as a doctrine of faith, and whatsoever is not so contained in the Scriptures, is not <hi>dogma fidei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the holy Scriptures, which God hath propounded to be the only rule of faith, they are revolted unto the doctrines &amp; devices of men, by changing the rule of faith; which they have done divers wayes. For first, whereas the rule, the foundation, and chiefe principle of faith whereinto it is last resolved, is the authority of God speaking in the holy Scriptures; they have set up another rule, which is the authority of the Romane Church, and therein of the Pope; which they make the superiour<note n="e" place="margin">Vid. Diatrib. de Antichristo. lib. 4. c. 6. &amp; 7.</note> rule, from which the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves dependeth, and into which their faith is last resolved. For the Pope is, as they say, virtually the Church, and what they say in this kinde to magnifie the authority of the Church, is specially to bee under stood of the Pope, who onely for sooth hath an infallible judgement, and not subject to errour, for, if you will beleeve them, a generall or oecumenicall Councell without the Pope may erre, but the Pope alone without a Councell cannot erre: yea, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pope and Councell together, is no greater than the authority of the Pope alone, from whom all Councels have their authority, for <hi>ab arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Now whosoever taketh upon him authority above the Scriptures, which are the undoubted Word of God, hee is undoubtedly Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ; whose judgement to make (as the Papists plainely doe) the chiefe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of faith, into which their faith is last resolved, is no better th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voli from Christ to Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they change the rule of faith, by making their traditions, that is, such doctrines and observations as are taught and observed in the Church of Rome, having no ground nor warrant in the holy Scriptures, to bee the Word of God, the word unwritten, and a rule of faith: which also they doe not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thirdly, they have changed the rule of faith, by making those bookes cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, which all antiquity almost, yea, and all succeeding ages untill the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent; following therein the judgement of Hierome, did hold Apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, or at the most but Eeclesiasticall; which might bee read in the Church for morall instruction, but not as rules of faith.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they change the rule of faith, when in stead of the originall Text of the old and new Testaments, which were penned by the Prophets and Apostles themselves, they make a corrupt, and that sometimes a barbarous translation of I know not whom, to be the authentike text, and the rule of faith; preferring the vulgar Latine translation before the originall text, which the penmen of the holy Ghost did write.</p>

            <p>Thus hath the Church of Rome revolted from the generall doctrine of faith, which is the written word of God, or the holy Canonicall Scriptures.</p>

            <p>But from the peculiar doctrine of faith, <hi>quatenus justificat,</hi> which is the doctrine of the Gospell concerning justification by faith in Christ alone, the Church of Rome chiefly erreth, as I have shewed in this Treatise; and by their Antichristian doctrine in this point they are revolted from the Gospell, which is<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10. 8.</note>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22501:5"/>For first, can it bee imagined, that the Apostles by <hi>Catholike</hi> understood the Romane Church, which, when they composed the Creede, was not extant, nor for divers yeeres after.

And although after the grant of the Tyrant <hi>Phocas</hi> in the yeare sixe hundred seven, the Pope challenged for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the universall Bishop, and for his See to be the head of all Churches: yet by the Greeke, and other Churches, which were, and are the better and greater part of Christendome, this claime never was, nor is at this day acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.

The former is perfect, as being the righteousnesse of him that is God: the later is but begun in this life, and is to be perfected in the life to come. By the former we are justified, by the later we are sanctified. If it be objected, that there seemeth little or no difference betweene these two words: for as to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie is to make just, so to sanctifie is to make holy.

By this doctrine we may trie our selves whether we be reconciled, redeemed, adopted, justified. For hereby it shall appeare, that God hath received us into his grace, if he hath also endued us with his grace. <hi>Chasidim,</hi> as they are called in the Scriptures, the favourites of God, are usually translated his holy ones, and all the faithfull, even in this life, are termed <hi>Saints.</hi> Hereby it will appeare, that we are redeemed from the guilt of sinne, if we be also freed from the dominion of sinne. Hereby it will appeare, that we are adopted, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Wherefore, though adoption and regeneration, though receiving into grace and enduing with grace, though redeeming from the guilt and purging in some measure from the corruption of sinne, though justification and sanctification are alwaies unseparable companions: yet we may not with the Papists confound them, and so place the matter of justification, and merit of salvation in our selves, as they wickedly doe; but we are religiously to distinguish them, as they are in themselves truly and really distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, to the praise of the glory, that is, the glorious praise of his grace, not of that which is in us, but of that which is in himselfe, whereby he hath graciously accepted us in his beloved, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 6.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 6.</note>

and to come are remitted in an instant; but as an act of God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from our vocation, wherein the grace of faith is begotten in us, to our glorification, which is the end of our faith. For as this action of God is called the <hi>justification of a sinner;</hi> so, whiles we continue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we have still need to be justified. And as we alwaies have sinne in this life: so, that it may not be imputed, we have need, that Christs righteousnesse should be imputed unto us: and that as we sinne daily, so Christ our advocate should continually make <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> intercession for us: that notwithstanding our manifold slippes, whereinto through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailety we fall; and notwithstanding those manifold infirmities and corruptions, which remaine in us as the relikes of originall sinne, we may be continued in the grace and favour of God, by the continued imputation of Christs righteousnesse, obtained by his continuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us. For therefore doth he continue his intercession for us, that our justification may bee continued to us: and that as wee sinne daily, so wee may daily seeke and obtaine pardon. But if justification should so be wrought <hi>once</hi> and <hi>at once,</hi> as that after that act wrought in an instance, we should no more be justified, nor no more neede remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne; then must we erroniously conceive, that the sinnes which after the first moment of our justification we doe commit, are actually remitted before they bee committed; whereas God forgiveth onely sinnes past, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.

               <p>§. VII. If it be said, that it is a received opinion among many, that <hi>justificatio simul &amp; semel fit,</hi> that justification is wrought at once, and but once: I answere, that that assertion is not to be admitted without distinction, nor without good caution. The distinction is this: that there is a justification of a sinner before God <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> coelesti,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is called justification, and is that, which here I have defined: and there is a justification whereby a man already justified before God, is justified <hi>in foro conscienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> in the court of his owne conscience: which is not properly justification it selfe, but the assurance of it. To this latter that assertion of <hi>but once and at once</hi> cannot in any good sense, be applied. For neither is the full assurance of our justification attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at once, but by degrees, wherein we are to labour and to give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make, as our election and calling, so also our justification more and more sure unto us. Neither is it given but once. For by committing of any crime or any grievous sinne, by spirituall deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>orcible temptations of Satan, this act of spirituall faith, which we call assurance, may be interrupted or lost for a time; and yet by repentance, by prayer and practise of pietie it may be recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22501:22"/>
and therefore not given but once. To the former indeed it may be applied in both parts, but with a twofold caution: first, in respect of <hi>simul, at once,</hi> if it be understood as excluding degrees, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Namely, that we are not justified by degrees, and as it were by little and little, as though our justification were not perfect at the first. For no sooner doth a man truly beleeve in Christ, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ is imputed to him, and in and by that righteousnesse he standeth righteous before God, as well at the first, as at the last; that righteousnesse of Christ, by which he is justified, whether first, or last, being most perfect. Therefore the righteousnesse of justification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be increased, neither doth our justification before God admit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, either in one and the same person, or yet in diverse men: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the assurance of justification, and the worke of sanctification, whereby we are to <hi>be renewed in the inner</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">a Cor. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>man day by day</hi> have degrees, according to the degrees of our faith, and according to the measure of grace received. Secondly, when it is said that we are justified before God <hi>semel, but once,</hi> that also may be admitted, if by <hi>once</hi> be meant one continuall act. For as we are regenerated but once, because <hi>ut semel nascimur, ita semel renascimur:</hi> so faith, which is wrought in our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given but once. For that which Saint <hi>Iude</hi> saith, <hi>verse</hi> 3. of <hi>faith once given,</hi> is no lesse true of the habit, than of the doctrine of faith; which habit, being once had, is never utterly lost. For all they who have true faith, are borne of God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12, 13. And those<note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 1. Iohn 1. 12, 13.</note> who are once borne of God are never unborne againe; but being made sonnes by faith, as all the faithfull are, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. they are also made<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>. Rom. 8. 17.</note> heires of God, and coheires with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. As faith therefore is never utterly lost, no more is justification. For so long as wee have faith, so long wee are justified. But the habit of faith wee never lose, though perhaps some act of faith may sometimes bee interrupted. Therefore our justification is but one continued act, and in that sense we are justified but once.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Now, whereas we have defined and defended according<note place="margin">The Papists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, who deny it either to be an action of God, or an action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</note> to the Scriptures, that justification is an action of God, and such an action as is without us, and a continued act: hence we may conclude against the Papists; first, that neither their first, nor second justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that justification, which is taught in the Scriptures. Not the second, for that is not Gods action, but their owne: who being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before by habituall righteousnesse infused from God, doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>each, by practising of good workes increase their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, that is, justifie themselves by actuall righteousnesse, as the merit of their second justification. Not, that wee deny, that inherent righteousnesse is by practise of good workes increased; but that wee hold, that justification is not our owne act, neither that we are justified by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves, or performed by our selves, nor that the righteousnesse of justification (which is indeed the righteousnesse of Christ) can be increased, and therefore no degrees of justification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:22501:23"/>Not the first; which they make to bee an action of God within us, working in us a reall change or positive mutation by infusion of the habits of grace, and specially of charitie, and confound it with habituall sanctification, from which notwithstanding it is necessarily to be distinguished.</p>
               <p>Secondly, justification being an action of God, is not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with justification passively understood, and much lesse with justice it selfe. But the Papists not onely understand it passively, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so confound it with inherent Iustice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they doe not hold justification to bee one continued act from our vocation, to our glorification. But such an act, as may not onely be interrupted ostentimes, and lost for a time, as they say it is, by every mortall sinne, and againe be renewed, so oft as they goe to shrift; but also that it may totally and finally bee lost. Which error I have confuted at large in my Treatise of perseverance.</p>

The causes, because in the knowledge of them standeth the science of every thing: the essentiall parts, because in them justification it selfe consisteth. The causes of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of all other things, are foure: The Efficient, the Matter, the Forme, the End.</p>

                  </gap>t causes are of two sorts, either principall or instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. The principall is God, which I noted in the definition, when I said,<note place="margin">The principall efficient.</note> it is an action of God. For it is God that justifieth, as the Scriptures in many places doe testifie: as namely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26, 30. 4. 5, 6. 8. 30, 33.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 26, 30. 4. 5, 6. 8. 30, 33.

For it being an outward action of God (or, as the Schoolemen speake, <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>) respecting the Creatures, it is the common action of the whole Trinity. And thus God alone, as the Iudge doth justifie. For he alone is the Lawgiver, <note n="a" place="margin">Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>refore hath the Lord set
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22501:24"/>
forth his sonne and our Saviour to bee a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousnesse through the remission of sinnes that are past by the forbearance of God: to declare I say at this time his <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> that he might be <hi>just,</hi> and the Iustifier of him which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in Iesus. For such is the righteousnesse of God, that hee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no mans sinne for which his Iustice is not fully satisfied by Christ: neither doth hee accept of any as just, but such as by imputation of Christs righteousnesse are made just in him. The consideration of this justice of God in forgiving sinnes, doth afford singular comfort to the faithfull. For seeing the Lord forgiveth no sinne for which his justice is not satisfied; and seeing our Saviour hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father for the sinnes of all that beleeve in him: from hence we may be assured, that as there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, so no punishment properly so called, that is, such a penalty as is inflicted <hi>in ordine justitiae,</hi> and by way of vengeance: because it cannot stand with the justice of God to punish the second time those sinnes in us, for which his justice is already fully satisfied in Christ.<note place="margin">The actions of the three persons distinguished.</note>

The Father, I say, as primary cause; and that in two respects; first, in that hee gave his onely begotten Sonne for us, and set him forth to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Sonne, as the Mediatour and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">The Sonne.</note> cause; and that also in two respects. First, as he is our Surety, who paid our debt, and our Redeemer who laid downe the price of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us, <hi>Esay.</hi> 53. 11. affording unto us the matter and merit of<note place="margin">Esay 53. 11.</note> our justification. Secondly, as hee is our Intercessour and Advocate to plead for us, that his merits may be imputed to us, <hi>Rom. 8. 34. 1 Ioh. 2. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34. 1 Iohn 2. 2. Heb. 7. 25. 9. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb. 7. 25. 9. 24.</hi> God the Father therefore justifieth, as the primary cause <hi>per authoritatem,</hi> as the Schoolemen speake; the Sonne, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary<note place="margin">Esay 53. 11.</note> cause <hi>per ministerium.</hi> For so it is said, <hi>Esa. 53. 11.</hi> My <hi>righteous servant</hi> shall justifie many. The Father, as the Iudge; the Sonne, as the Mediator and Advocate. The Father, as the Creditour accepting Christs satisfaction for us: the Sonne, as the Surety paying our debt for us. But howsoever God the Father hath given his So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For although the sufferings of Christ be a precious salve to cure our soules; yet they will not heale us unlesse they bee applyed. And although his righteousnesse bee as a wedding garment to cover our nakednesse, yet it will not cover us, unlesse it bee

               </p>
               <p>§. V. Now the meanes of this application, are instrumentall causes<note place="margin">Instrumentall causes.</note> of our justification, and doe justifie instrumentally. And these are of two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> on Gods part, and on ours. For to effect this application, there must bee <hi>manus Dei offerentis,</hi> the hand of God offering, and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus accipientis,</hi> the hand of the receiver. The instruments on Gods part, are the ministery of the Word and Sacraments, whereby the holy Ghost doth beget and confirme faith in us. In respect whereof Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters<note place="margin">The Ministerie of the Gospell.</note> are said to justifie men; <hi>Dan. 12. 3.</hi> For as touching the ministery of the Gospell: first, in it the benefit of the <hi>Messias,</hi> as namely reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, adoption, and justification, &amp;c. is revealed and offered to all that shall beleeve, and by it wee are stirred up to receive and embrace it. In which respect the preaching of the Gospell is called the ministery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and the Ministers are Gods Embassadours sent to entreat men in Gods name and in Christs stead, that they would be reconciled<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18, 20.</note> unto God, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18, 20.</hi> Secondly, the holy Ghost having thus by the ministery of the Gospell knocked at the doore of mens hearts, in his good time maketh it effectuall, opening their hearts <note n="h" place="margin">Acts 16. 14.</note> to give a lively and effectuall assent to the Gospell, whereby they receiving Christ and beleeving in him are justified. Thus faith commeth by hearing <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 10. 14, 17</note> the Word. And in this respect Preachers of the Gospell are said to be the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 5.</note> Ministers by whom men doe beleeve, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 5.</hi> Thirdly, in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, seconded and made powerfull by the operation of the holy Ghost, the sentence of justification and remission of finnes, and consequently of salvation is pronounced and concluded in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the faithfull: when as out of the generall promise of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>Whosoever truely bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eveth in Christ</hi> hath remission of sinnes, being by the Minister conditionally applyed to the hearer, and absolutely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by the beleever, after this manner, If thou, saith the Minister, doest truely beleeve in Christ, thou hast remission of sinnes and thou<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 9.</note> shalt be saved, <hi>Rom. 10. 9.</hi> But I (saith the faithfull hearer) doe truely beleeve in Christ, my conscience bearing mee witnesse in the holy Ghost; this conclusion is inferred, as the verdict of the holy Ghost te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying with the conscience of the faithfull in the assumption, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Word contained in the proposition: therefore <hi>I have remission of sinnes, therefore I shall be saved.</hi> And in this sense Ministers are said to remit sinnes, <hi>Ioh. 20. 23.</hi> and consequently to justifie, when they<note place="margin">Iohn 20. 23.</note> doe pronounce remission of sinnes to them that beleeve and repent. And whatsoever they doe in this behalfe upon earth according to the Word, is ratified in heaven.</p>
               <p>§. VI. As touching the Sacraments: in them first the benefit of the<note place="margin">Sacraments.</note>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:22501:25"/>
                  <hi>Messias</hi> is represented before our eyes by the outward signes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Sacrament is called <hi>Verbum visibile.</hi> Secondly, such is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall union betweene the signe and the thing signified, that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the signe the thing signified, that is, Christ with all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is offered in the lawfull use of the Sacrament. Thirdly, the benefit of the <hi>Messias</hi> is not only offered in the lawfull use together with the signe, but also conferd and given to every faithfull and worthy receiver. And hereof the Sacrament is a pledge given to the beleever, to assure him, that as the Minister doth give unto him the signe, so the Lord doth give unto him the thing signified. And in this sense every Sacrament is a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. annexed to<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> the promise of the Gospell, which by delivery of the Sacrament is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applyed to every faithfull receiver, to assure him in particular of his justification and salvation by Christ. Thus the ministery of the Gospell is the meanes to beget faith, and the Sacraments the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirme the same. But the Papists deny both, for that faith is begotten in the ministery of the Word, and that so men attaine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes and justification, they say, it is a <hi>fiction of the heretikes of these times.</hi> Neither doe they grant that Sacraments are seales of righteousnesse, or that they were ordained to seale the promises unto us. But they hold them to bee such effectuall instruments as doe by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue inherent in themselves conferre justifying grace (which they call <hi>gratiam gratum facientem) ex opere operat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> By which doctrine, a, they have turned Religion into a meere outward formality, according to the prophecy of them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. ascribing all the degrees of salvation to<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note> be atchieved in this life, <hi>viz.</hi> Vocation, Iustification, Sanctification to the externall use of the Sacraments; so they have made their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of justification to bee an idle speculation, whereof in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice there is little or no use. For to what purpose doe they dispute of justification, by vertuous preparations and gracious dispositions, when they teach that the Sacraments doe <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> that is, by the very performance of the outward act justifie the receiver, requiring in him neither any vertuous preparation, or gracious disposition, for without them hee is justified. Onely this caution they doe interpose, that hee doe not <hi>ponere obicem mortalis peccati,</hi> that hee put not the obstacle of mortall sinne. For if those things should necessarily be required, then the Sacraments should conferre grace, not <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as they stifly hold, but <hi>ex opere operantis.</hi> So much of the hand of the giver.</p>
               <p>§. VII. The instrument on our part which is, as it were, <hi>manus</hi>

For if we should be justified by faith as it is an habit in us properly, then we should be justified by habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and inherent righteousnesse, which hereafter<note n="h" place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> I shall fully disprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>And if we be not justified by it, as it is an habit, then much lesse as it is an act, as <hi>

                  <hi>ipsum credere,</hi> did properly justifie. Which opinion is worse than the other. For faith doth justifie (as hereaster shall be proved) as the instrument only; but it is the instrument, not as it is an act, but as it is an habit producing that act: and therefore it is said that we are justified by faith, and that faith is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> unto righteousnesse. But if wee should bee justified by it, as it is an act, then we should be justified by our owne workes: which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> is also to be confuted: and further, if we were justified by it, as it is an act, then we should be no longer justified actually than we doe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beleeve, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> so there should bee an intercision of justification (which I proved before to be a continued act) so ost as there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission of the act of faith; which is ridiculous. Againe, if wee should be justified by faith, either as it is an habit, or an act <hi>in sensu pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio;</hi> as they speake, and not relatively or metonymically; then should we be justified by one habit alone, or by the act of one habit: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently by a partiall and most unperfect righteousnesse. When it is certaine that all the habits and acts of grace, which are in the best, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring together are not. sufficient to justifie a man before God for the reasons hereafter to be delivered, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. It is true, that faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for righteousnesse, and is accepted of God, as the perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the whole law: but this is to bee understood relatively in respect of the object received by faith, that is, Christ, who is the end<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10. 5.</note> and complement of the Law to all that beleeve; insomuch that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever truly beleeveth in Christ, hath fulfilled the Law.<note place="margin">Secòndly, it must be such a faith às doth specially apprehend and embrace Christ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. VIII. 2. is the consequent of the former. For if faith doth justifie onely as it is an hand or instrument to apprehend and receive Christ, then justifying faith must be such a faith as doth apprehend<note n="l" place="margin">

For by a lively and effectuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe we receive and embrace Christ, not only in our judgements by a willing and firme assent, being undoubtedly perswaded and assured thathe is the Saviour of all that truly beleeve in him; but also in our hearts by an hungring desire to be made partakers of him, and in our wils by resolving, both to acknowledge him to be our Saviour, and also to rest upon him for salvation. Having this lively assent, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promise, we are to apply the promise to our selves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to us. By the former degree we are justified, before God <hi>in foro coelesti;</hi> by the latter, we are justified <hi>in foro conscientiae,</hi> in the court of our owne conscience.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22501:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we are not properly justified, but are in some measure assured of our justification. By the former I doe effectually beleeve, that Iesus is the Saviour; by the latter I doe truely beleeve, that hee is my Saviour. That faith therefore which doth justifie, doth specially apprehend, and apply Christ: and the proper object<note n="m" place="margin">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ustice. But the truth is, that by a true justifying faith we are not prepared onely, but wee are actually justified. For no sooner doth a man beleeve by a true justifying faith, but he is justified<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 13. 39.</note> and entitled unto the kingdome of heaven. As soone as he doth beleeve, he is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 24.</note> from death to life, yea, so soone he hath<note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 47.</note> eternall life, that is, hee hath <hi>jus,</hi> right unto the heavenly kingdome.</p>
               <p>§. X. Fourthly, when wee say that faith doth justifie, wee doe not<note place="margin">Faith doth not justifie absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of its owne worth, but relatively in respect of the object.</note> meane that it justifieth absolutely or in respect of its owne worth and dignity; and much lesse, that it doth merit justification, either as it is an habit, or as it is an act, but relatively in respect of the object which it doth apprehend, that is, Christ, who is our righteousnesse For seeing faith doth receive Christ and make us partakers of him, therefore all those benefits which wee receive from Christ are attributed in the holy Scriptures to Faith: as to justifie, to save<note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. §. 6.</note>, &amp;c. not, that these effects are to bee ascribed to the vertue of faith absolutely, but relatively in respect of the object. So when it was said to the woman, thy<note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 7. 50.</note> faith hath saved thee, the meaning is, Christ received by faith hath saved thee. Thus by the faith of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Creeple was cured, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 6. yet not by<note place="margin">Act. 3. 6. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the name of Christ, that is, Christ himselfe, by faith in his name, as the instrument, did cure him, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. so the name of Christ by faith in his name doth justifie and save, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 31. And that faith doth not justifie in respect of<note place="margin">Act. 10. 43. Ioh. 20. 31.</note> its owne worth appeareth by this evidence, because the faith of divers men, though unequall in degrees doth justifie alike, and therefore is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of equall value, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh of all the faithfull to whom he writeth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>that have obtained coequall faith with us in the righteousnesse of our God and Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi> For it is not faith properly, which doth justifie, but the righteousnesse of Christ, received by faith. The almes received by a weake hand releeveth the party, as well as that which is received by a strong hand: because it is not the hand properly which releeveth, but the almes. And for the same cause the righteousnesse of justification is equall in all that are justified, neither doth it in the same persons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of degrees. For it is the most perfect righteousnesse of Christ, to which, considered as created and finite, nothing can bee added.</p>
               <p>§. XI. Fifthly, from hence we learne the true meaning of that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The meaning of the question, whether by faith, or by workes.</note> whether we be justified by faith or by workes, not as opposing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace of faith to the outward acts of obedience, which indeed are the fruits of faith: but as opposing the righteousnesse of Christ appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith, to that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves, and performed by our selves.</p>
               <p>§. XII. Sixthly, when we say that faith doth justifie alone, two things<note place="margin">How faith is said to justifie alone.</note> are implyed: First, that we are justified by the righteousnesse of Christ alone apprehended by faith, and not by any righteousnesse in herent in us. Secondly, that this righteousnesse of Christ, by which alone wee are justified, is apprehended by faith onely. Not that justifying faith is or can bee alone: but because there being many graces in the faithfull, which all have their severall commendations; yet none of them serveth to apprehend Christs righteousnesse, but faith onely, and yet that faith which is alone, severed from all other inward graces, and outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, doth not justifie either alone or at all; because it is not a true and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> lively, but a counterfeit and a dead faith. For even as the eye among all the parts of the body, which all have their severall uses, hath onely the faculty of seeing: and yet that eye which is separated from the rest of the parts, doth see neither alone nor at all, because it is but the carcase of an eye. So among all the graces of the soule, it is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of faith alone, as the eye of the soule, to looke upon him that was figured by the brazen Serpent: yet if it should bee severed from the rest, it were dead. For as Saint <hi>Iames</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>. 2. 17.</note> saith, that faith which is alone and by it selfe is dead. And as the eye, in respect of being, is not alone, yet in respect of seeing it is alone: so faith which is not alone, doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie alone.</p>
               <p>§ XIII. Seventhly, and lastly, when we say that faith doth justifie<note place="margin">Faith doth not sanctifie alone.</note> alone, wee were never so absurd, as the Papists absurdly charge us, as if wee meant, that faith alone doth sanctifie. For although nothing in us doth conferre with faith to the act of justification as any cause thereof, (in which sense wee say, it justifieth alone) yet in the subject; that is, the party justified, many graces doe concurre with faith, as the necessary fruits thereof; wherein, as also in our obedience, our sanctification stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, wherefore faith, which justifieth alone, is but one of those many graces, wherein besides our obedience, our sanctification doth consist.</p>

The matter of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, considered as it is an action of God, is that which the Lord imputeth unto us for righteousnesse, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth as our righteousnesse, and that is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, which I noted in the definition, when I said, <hi>imputing to a beleeving sinner the righteousnesse of Christ.</hi> The Papists confounding not onely justice and justification, but also the matter (which is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall cause) and the subject; say, that the matter of justification is the soule of<note n="a" place="margin">Bellarm. de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifi. lib. cap. 2.</note> man, or at the least the will of man; because that is the seat of justice, whereas indeed of justification, though passively understood, not the soule or the will is the subject, but the person or the whole man. For justification is <hi>totius suppositi,</hi> of the person, and not of any part or faculty of man. But for the better clearing of this point, let us briefly consider other not unlike actions: First, when <hi>Rebecca</hi> arrayed or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed her sonne <hi>Iacob</hi> with the raiment of <hi>Esau</hi> her elder sonne, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this action was that, which being applyed unto him, did clothe him, <hi>viz. Esau's</hi> garment: the forme of that action was the applying of it to him, which was the indution or putting it on. For she clothed him by putting upon him <hi>Esau's</hi> garment. So the Lord justifieth us by putting upon us our eldest brothers righteousnesse, which is our wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment. Which similitude is used not only by Saint<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Jacob. &amp; vitabeat. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ambrose,</hi> but also by <hi>Pighius</hi> himselfe, as heereafter<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</note> shall bee shewed. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore of justification is Christs righteousnesse: the forme is the imputing thereof. Secondly, the actions of redemption, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and justification in substance are the same. As therefore the Lord redeemeth us, and reconcileth us by applying unto us and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for us the righteousnesse and merits of Christ, as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or price of ransome, and as the propitiation; for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himselfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. so hee justifieth us, by applying unto us and accepting for us, the same righteousnesse and merits of Christ, as our righteousnesse. As the matter therefore of our redemption is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or price of ransome which Christ payed for us; the matter of reconciliation is the propitiatory sacrifice which Christ offered for us; the matter of justification is Christs righteousnesse which hee had and performed for us: so the forme of redemption, as it is Gods action, is the applying unto us the price of ransome which Christ payed, and the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22501:27"/>
accepting of it in our behalfe; the forme of reconciliation, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying unto us the propitiation made by Christ, and accepting of it in our behalfe; the forme of justification, the applying or imputing of Christs righteousnesse unto us, and accepting it in our behalfe. In like manner the Papists, if they would consider Iustification as an action of God, should according to their owne doctrine conceive, that of their first justification; whereby as they teach, a sinner is made righteous by infusion of righteousnesse; the matter is the righteousnesse infused or inherent, the forme the infusion thereof: because according to their doctrine, the Lord in the first justification maketh a man righteous by infusion of righteousnesse. The Papists confesse after a sort, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ to bee the merit of justification, but they deny it to be the matter thereof, whereas indeed it is both: the matter, as justification is the act of God imputing it; the merit, as justification is passively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, because for it wee are justified: the matter, I say, of Gods justifying us; the merit of our being justified. And this may appeare by the contrary: For justification, as hath beene said, and shall bee proved, is opposed<note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 12. 37. Rom 8. 33. 1 King. 8. 32.</note> to condemnation. As therefore sinne is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the matter of condemnation, which is the imputation of sinne; but also the merit both of the sentence, and of the punishment by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence awarded: so the righteousnesse of Christ is both the matter of justification, as being that which God imputeth to us; and also the merit both of the sentence of absolution, and of eternall life, unto which we are accepted.</p>
               <p>§. II. But of the matter and forme of justification, whereof I am<note place="margin">Of the matter and forme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</note> hereafter to treat at large; of the matter, in the whole fourth booke; of the forme, in the fifth, I will here onely set downe briefly the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox doctrine of the reformed Churches, and maintaine it against the private opinions of some protestant Divines, who are not sound in these points.</p>
               <p>The matter of justification is that righteousnesse, wherein wee stand<note place="margin">The matter is that which is called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God.</note> perfectly righteous before God.

                  <hi>the man Christ Iesus.</hi> The righteousnesse of Christ, as he is God, is the essentiall righteousnesse of the Godhead.

But this, being the essentiall and uncreated righteousnesse of God, which is his essence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himselfe, cannot be the righteousnesse of any who is not God; and therefore if we should be justified thereby, we should also bee deified. Againe, the essentiall righteousnesse of God, being the essence of God and the very Godhead, cannot be communicated to any creature, much

lesse can it become the accidentall righteousnesse of a creature. And farther, it being the righteousnesse of the Godhead, is the common righteousnesse of the whole Trinity, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. And therefore if we should be justified thereby, we should be justified by the righteousnesse of the Father, and of the holy Ghost, as well as by the righteousnesse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is it<note place="margin">Whether it be the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Manhood.</note> then the righteousnesse of the Manhood? I answer, it is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ our Mediator, who is both God and man which he in his humanity had and performed in the dayes of his flesh for us. And this is to bee understood not of a part but of the whole righteousnesse of Christ, which was either inherent in the man Christ, or performed by him; whether to fulfill the Commandements, or to satisfie the Curse of the Law for us. This righteousnesse of Christ (that I may speake more distinctly of it) is either negative (if I may so speake) or positive. By the negative, I understand an absence of all sinnes and vices forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Law. By the positive, I meane both a presence of all vertues and duties required to the perfect fulfilling of the Commandements, and also of the voluntary suffering of the penalty to satisfie the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and curse of the Law.

And this necessarily followeth upon that which hath beene said of the <hi>matter.</hi> For it cannot bee imagined how we should be justified by that righteousnesse of Christ, which is out of us in him, otherwise than by imputation.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>atisfaction, is the imputation of his righteousnesse, for what is Christs satisfaction but that whereby hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ully satisfied the Law, and consequently the justice of God for us, which he did both in respect of the penalty, which he fully satisfied by <note n="a" place="margin">Esai. 53. 11.</note> bearing our iniquities; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the commandements, by fulfilling them: the former, is the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the crosse, or his passive righteousnesse; the latter, is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law, which is both his habituall and actuall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. By the former, he freeth us from hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the latter, he doth enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle us to the kingdome of heaven. But the meaning of the Papists is, that Christ by his satisfaction doth free us from hell; but as for heaven, we must attaine to it by our owne merits, as if there needed not so great a price to purchase heaven, as to redeeme from hell. But it is certaine, that there is required as infinite merit to purchase heaven, as there is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22501:30"/>
required infinite satisfaction to redeeme from hell. In respect of both God accepteth of no righteousnesse to our justification, that is, either to free us from hell, or to entitle us unto the Kingdome of Heaven, but that which is of infinite value; because the offence of sinne, for which satisfaction is to be made, is infinite, and because the reward which is to be merited, is of infinite worth. But, that righteousnesse may bee of infinite value, it is not necessary, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">De justificat. lib. 2. cap. 5. in fine.</note> himselfe teacheth, that it should be infinite in it selfe; but it is sufficient, that it bee the righteousnesse of an infinite person. And such is the righteousnesse of Christ, as being the righteousnesse of him, that is, God; such is not the righteousnesse of any meere creature: which is an invincible argument, as hereafter shall bee shewed, to prove that wee are justified not by any righteousnesse in our selves, but onely by imputation of Christs righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>§. IX. And yet this imputation of Christs righteousnesse (without<note place="margin">Imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse denied not onely by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but also by some others.</note> which there can be no salvation) is denied, not onely by the Papists, but by some others hereafter to be mentioned in the fifth chapter of this booke; who seeme to have beene drawne to this opinion by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Papists; which I will therefore in this place answer, for their satisfaction. If (say they) Christs righteousnesse and merits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">The reason of their denia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> confuted.</note> hee redeemeth and saveth men should bee imputed unto us, then should we thereby become Saviours and redeemers of others: but this latter is false; therefore the former. <hi>Answere:</hi> I deny the consequence of the proposition; for first, when we say, that we are justified by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christs righteousnesse, our meaning is this, that the Lord accepteth for us, and in our behalfe, the obedience and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rits of Christ, as if we had performed the same for our selves in our owne persons. For as the merit of Christ is the common price of redemption sufficient for the salvation of all universally, so it is the price for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and so is applyed to every particular, not as the common price re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming all, but as the price of those soules in particular, to whom it is particularly applyed. Secondly, the efficacie, or effect of imputation dependeth upon the will of the imputer, and therefore the force of it cannot be extended further than he extendeth it; which is the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parties to whom it is imputed, but no further. Thirdly, the consequence of the proposition doth no more follow, than if I should argue thus: If by imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression others are made guilty of sinne and damnation, then they to whom <hi>Adams</hi> transgression is imputed are made the cause and fountaine of sinne and damnation in all others; but of the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> we should conceive, not as of private men; but the first <hi>Adam</hi> is to be considered, as the root of mankind, in whom when he fell, all sinned.

members: the Lord accepting in their behalfe the obedience and Merits of Christ, as if they had performed the same in their owne persons, not for others, but for themselves. And therefore by imputation of Christs righteousnesse they are not redeemers, but redeemed. For though Christ, who is the Saviour of his body, communicate to his members his obedience, yet not his Headship, nor his Mediatorship, in respect whereof hee was and is both God and man. Man, to doe and suffer: God, to give infinite value and worth to that which his Person did or suffered, for the justification and salvation of all those to whom his righteousnesse should bee communicated and imputed; but not to make them redeemers and Saviours of others. The righteousnesse of the head is of sufficient vertue to justifie and redeeme all the members to whom it is imputed; but being imputed, the merit thereof exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no further, than to what end it is imputed; that is, to save the member, not to make it a Saviour, nor to confound the members with the head, nor to take away the proportion, that is and ought bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the head and the members. Fourthly, to the Papists, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christs satisfaction to be imputed unto us, I returne the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Now this righteousnesse is either the parties owne, or of another. Not their owne, for they are sinners, and being sinners they cannot bee justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by righteousnesse inherent, but righteousnesse is imputed to them without workes, that is, without respect of any obedience performed by themselves. Therefore it is the righteousnesse of another: That other is no other, nor can be any other, but Christ onely; therefore by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his righteousnesse we are justified.

For some as touching the matter, doe hold that we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the passive righteousnesse of Christ onely. Of these men, some doe not hold the matter of justification to bee the passive righteousnesse of Christ it selfe, but a righteousnesse <hi>morte Christi partu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> purchased by the death of Christ, as the meritorious cause thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> remission of sinnes, which they not without absurdity say is imputed to us. For what is remission of sinne, but the not imputing of it? If therefore wee bee justified by imputation of the remission of sinne, then are we justified by the imputation of the not imputing of sinne. Againe, the authors of this opinion confound justice with justification; for they say, that remission of sinne is our justice, and that justification is nothing also but remission; when indeed neither the one, nor the other is justice, but an action of God, imputing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and not imputing sinne unto us. Others hold that by the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive righteousnesse of Christ it selfe meaning thereby his death and passion, we are justified, as by the onely matter of justification imputed to us. But that wee are not justified by the passive righteousnesse of Christ alone, it may appeare by these reasons:</p>
               <p>§. II. By what alone the Law is fully satisfied, by that we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">The first reason, because there is no justification without the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law.</note> and by what alone the Law is not fully satisfied, by that alone wee are not justified. By the whole righteousnesse of Christ, that is to say, the righteousnesse of his person, that is, his holinesse, or habituall righteousnesse; the righteousnesse of his life, which was his obedience or actuall righteousnesse; the righteousnesse of his death and passion, which is <hi>obedientia crucis,</hi> or his passive righteousnesse, the Law was fully satisfied or fulfilled: but by the passive obedience alone of Christ the Law was not fulfilled; therefore by the whole righteousnesse of Christ and not by the passive onely we are justified. The proposition is thus proved: there is no justification before God without perfect and compleat righteousnesse, for without that no man can stand in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before God, and to imagine, that a man is justified without ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, is as absurd, as to conceive that a man is cloathed without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: For they that are justified are clothed <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 132. 9.</note> with righteousnesse, as having <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> put on Christ, whose righteousnesse is their wedding garment, <note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 22. 11.</note> signified by that white and shining linnen, <note n="d" place="margin">Apoc. 19. 8.</note> which are the justifications
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22501:31"/>
of the Saints. But there is no perfect righteousnesse, but that which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the Law, and is fully conformable unto it, it being the perfect, perpetuall and immutable <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 5. 18.</note> rule of righteousnesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without the fulfilling of the Law, either by our selves, or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for us, there is no justification. Now to the full satisfying and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> two things are required; not onely a perfect and perpetuall conformity to the Law to satisfie the commandement, and to fulfill the condition of the legall <note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 18. 5. Rom. 10. 5. Gal 3. 12.</note> promise, <hi>Doe this and live:</hi> but also a full satisfaction to the sentence of the Law by bearing the penalty therein denounced, in regard of sinnes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy committed. Againe, faith or the true doctrine of justification by faith, doth not abrogate the <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3. 31.</note> Law, but establish it. But if it should teach justification without Christs fulfilling of the Law for us, it should abrogate the Law, and not establish it.</p>
               <p>§ III. Of the assumption there are two parts: the former affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,<note place="margin">By the passive righteousnesse of Christ onely the Law is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</note> that by the whole righteousnesse of Christ the Law is fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and fulfilled; for by his sufferings the penalty of the Law is fully satisfied for us to free us from hell, and by his righteousnes, both hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and actuall, the commandements were fulfilled for us, to entitle us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven. Neither of which we were able to performe for our selves: for neither could wee satisfie the penalty, but by everlasting punishment; neither could wee fulfill the commandement, but by a totall, perfect, and perpetuall obedience; which to us, by reason of the flesh, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. And this was the miserable estate, wherein the Law did hold us: both to bee accursed, if but once, and that in the least degree wee did breake it (which the best of us often doe, and sometimes in an high degree) and to be excluded from justification and salvation, if wee did not fully and perfectly fulfill it, which since the fall hath beene impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Wherefore as without imputation of Christs sufferings we could not bee freed from hell; so without his obedience and perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law imputed unto us, wee cannot be justified or saved. By the former, our blessed Saviour hath redeemed us from the curse <note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> of the Law, himselfe being made a curse for us; by the latter hee maketh us partakers of the promised blessednesse, by performing for us that righteousnesse, which was the condition of the promise, <hi>Doe this and live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The negative part is, that by the onely passive righteousnesse of Christ the Law is not fulfilled. The Law indeed is thereby fully satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our behalfe for the avoiding of the penalty therein threatned; but not fulfilled in respect of the commandement for the obtaining of the blessednesse therein promised. For the righteousnesse, which is of the Law, is thus described, that <hi>the man</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 10. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>which doth those things</hi> (which are commanded) <hi>shall live therein.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against divers excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. First, that the Law is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by bearing the penalty.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§ IIII. Against this assumption divers exceptions are taken. First, that the Law is satisfied either by doing that which is commanded, or by bearing the punishment, which is threatned. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true in respect of the penall statutes of men, but not in respect of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:22501:32"/>
in which there is not onely a penalty threatned, but bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse also promised. If man had continued in his integrity, the Law might have beene satisfied by obedience onely: but being fallen into a state of disobedience, two things are necessarily required to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law; the bearing of the penalty, in respect of sinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed, to escape hell; and the perfect performing of the commandements, which is the condition of the covenant, <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> to attaine to the life promised: but neither alone will suffice to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. For neither will our obedience satisfie for the punishment <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justis. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Scct. Deinde.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth; nor the bearing of the punishment performe the condition of the promise. But both must concurre.</p>
               <p>§ V. <hi>Inst.</hi> I. But it will be said, that whosoever are freed from hell, <note place="margin">Secondly, that those who are freed from hell, are admitted untobeaven.</note> are also admitted into heaven. <hi>Answ.</hi> The reason thereof is, because our Saviour, who did beare the punishment to free them from hell, did also fulfill the commandements to bring them to heaven. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver these two benefits of Christ doe alwayes concurre in the party justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; as the causes thereof concurre in Christ, who not onely did both obey and suffer, but in obeying suffered, and in suffering obeyed: yet both the causes betweene themselves and the effects are to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. For as it is one thing to obey the commandement, another to suffer the punishment: so it is one thing to be freed from hell by Christ his suffering the penalty, another to be entituled to heaven by his fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the commandements.</p>
               <p>§ VI. <hi>Inst.</hi> II. Yea but God is a most free Agent, and therefore<note place="margin">Thirdly, that God may justifie by the passive righteousnesse onely if bee will.</note> may if he will justifie men by the passive righteousnesse of Christ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without fulfilling of the Law. <hi>Answ.</hi> What God may doe, if hee will, I will not dispute; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ure I am, that he justifieth men according to his will revealed in his word. Wherein it is revealed, first, that God hath taken that course for the justifying and saving of sinners, as serveth most for the illustration of the glory of his justice, <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25, 26.</note> as well as of his mercy. And therefore as in mercy he freeth none from hell, for whom his justice is not satisfied: so in mercy hee admitteth none to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for whom Christ hath not by his obedience merited the fame. Secondly, it is revealed, that the judgement of God is according to the <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 2. 2.</note> truth, and therefore he justifieth none by his sentence, but such as hee maketh just by imputation of Christs righteousnesse; thereby not onely absolving them from their sinnes, but also accepting, yea consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting them righteous in CHRIST. Thirdly, that as wee are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our sinnes by the blood of Christ; so we are made <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 5. 9. 19.</note> just by his obedience: that as he was made finne for us, so we were made <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God in him; that as wee are reconciled unto God by the death <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> of his Sonne, so wee are justified and saved by his life: by his life, I say, which he lived before his death in the dayes of his flesh; and by the life which he lived, and doth live, after his death. By the acts of his life before his death, meritoriously; by the acts of his life after his death, as his <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> resurrection, his ascension, his session at the right hand of his Father and intercession, his comming againe to judgement, hee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22501:32"/>
saveth us effectually, that Christ as hee was made unto us redemption, so also righteousnesse; that as hee came to deliver us from sinne, so to<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30. Dan. 9. 24.</note> bring in everlasting righteousnesse, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>§ VII. <hi>Inst.</hi> III. If we bee justified by Christ his fulfilling of the<note place="margin">If by Christs fulfilling of the Law, then by a legall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Law then wee are justified by a legall righteousnesse; but wee are not justified by a legall justice; but by such a righteousnesse, as without the Law is revealed in the Gospell. <hi>Answ.</hi> The same righteousnesse, by which we are justified, is both legall and Evangelicall in divers respects. Legall, in respect of Christ, who being made under the <note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 4 5.</note> Law, that hee might redeeme us, who were under the Law, perfectly fulfilled the Law for us. Evangelicall, in respect of us, unto whom his fulfilling of the Law is imputed. And herein standeth the maine, both agreement and difference betweene the Law and the Gospell. The agreement, that both unto justification require the perfect fulfilling of the Law: the difference, that the Law requireth to justification perfect obedience to be performed in our owne persons. The Gospell propoundeth to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication the righteousnesse of <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17. 3. 21.</note> God, that is, the perfect righteousnesse of Christ, who is God, performed for us, and accepted in the behalfe of them that beleeve, as if it had been performed in their own persons.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son out of</hi> Rom. 5. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§ VIII. Our second reason. As by the disobedience of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he transgressed the Law, men were made sinners, his disobedience being imputed to them: so by the obedience <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> whereby hee fulfilled the Law, men are made righteous, his obedience being imputed to them. In answer to this argument, two novelties are broached; the former, that as wee were made sinners by one act of disobedience committed by one man, and that but once: so we are justified by one act of obedience performed by one and that but once; which was that oblation of Christ, whereby hee but once <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 9. &amp; 10.</note> offered himselfe. Whereunto I reply, first, that betweene sinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Law is broken, and obedience whereby the Law is fulfilled, there is great ods. The Law is broken by any one act of sinne; for hee that offendeth in any <note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> one, is guilty of all. But the Law is not fulfilled by any one act of obedience, but by a totall, perfect, and perpetuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Law; for by the sentence <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> of the Law hee is accursed, whosoever doth not continue in all the things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them. But in no one act of obedience, there neither is, nor can bee a continuance in doing all the things that are commanded. Secondly, that although the obedience by which we are justified was but of one man, yet it was not one act, but as the Apostle calleth it in the verse going <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 5. 18.</note> before, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note> is all that the Law requireth to justification. The second Novelty is, that neither <hi>Adam</hi> in sinning transgressed the Law, nor our Saviour in his obedience to death obeyed the Law. For neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to the Israelites for the spoiling of the Aegyptians, but a speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Whereto I reply, that although every thing which God commandeth in particular, be not expressed in the Law; yet wee have a generall commandement <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 12. 32.</note> expressed in the Law, that whatsoever God commandeth we must doe; and if we doe it not, we sinne; and every sinne is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 4.</note> a transgression of the Law.</p>
               <p>§ IX. Our third reason. If Christ by his conformity to the Law fulfilled the Law for us, then his obedience in fulfilling of the Law is<note place="margin">Thirdly, because Christ bis obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is accepted for u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</note> accepted of God in our behalfe, as if wee had fulfilled it in our owne persons: but Christ by his conformity to the Law fulfilled the Law for us; therefore his obedience in fulfilling of the Law is accepted of God in our behalfe, as if wee had fulfilled it in our owne persons; that is to say, both his habituall and actuall righteousnesse is imputed to us. The consequence of the proposition is necessary, for if hee performed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for us and in our behalfe; he performed it in vaine, if it be not accepted for us and in our behalfe. The assumption also is of necessary truth; for first, that Christ did fulfill the Law it is evident, for himselfe professeth, that he came to fulfill the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. that it became<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 17. 3. 15.

reason, which is rendred, is in a large sense called the cause, though it may be any other argument, which is not the cause of the Consequent, but of the consequence; as here, humiliation was not the cause, but the way to exaltation: and exaltation not the effect; but the consequent, as<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> it is said, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. ought not Christ to suffer these things and so to enter to his glory? And this appeareth by the scope of the Apostle in that place; which is to exhort us to the imitation <note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 2. 3, 4. 5.</note> of our Saviour Christ his charity and humility. Of his charity, in that hee being God, for our sakes became man; and being man <note n="z" place="margin">ver. 6, 7, 8. vers. 9.</note> humbled himselfe further, and became obedient untill his death, even the death of the crosse. Of his humility, in that it was the way to his glory. For before honour <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 15. 33. 18. 12.</note> is humility, and he that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted. But humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so farre from being the cause of exaltation, that it is the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 14.</note> to it; even as corruption to generation, and losse to recovery, yet because recovery presupposeth losse, and the generation of one the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of another, and the exaltation of the Sonne of God, his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going humiliation: therefore each of these may be said to be <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> as all necessary forerunners may, though they be no causes: Even as <hi>Fabius,</hi> when <hi>Livius Salinator</hi> bad him remember, that by his meanes hee had recovered <hi>

For although in respect of Christs resurrection, <note n="c" place="margin">Act 13 33. Psal. 2. 7. Heb. 1. 5.</note> especially it be said, Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee; yet was not Christ then first begotten, whose generation is eternall; but then he was mightily declared to bee the Sonne of God by his resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. and<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> this was that name above all names, which God did give unto him after his humiliation, his manifesting and declaring him by his resurrection to be <hi>the Sonne of God.</hi> So the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4, 5. that Christ<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 4, 5.</note> hath obtained a more excellent name than the Angels: For unto which of the Angells said he at any time, Thou art my Sonne, this day I have begotten thee? This exaltation was a necessary consequent of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and that in two respects; first, for avoyding the scandall of the crosse, for having taken upon him the forme of a servant, and therein having humbled himselfe to become obedient untill death, and to the death of the crosse; it was necessary, lest men should take offence at his great humiliation, and refuse to beleeve in a man that had beene cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, that he should mightily be declared to bee the Sonne of God by his resurrection, ascension, and sitting at the right hand of his Father; secondly, this declaration of Christ to bee the Sonne of God was to follow his humiliation as a necessary stay of our faith in Christ, for if Christ had not risen againe; <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 14. 17.</note> then had our faith beene vaine, and wee had remained in our sinnes.

Neither was it the holinesse of the humanity that sanctified the sacrifice, or gave the vertue of satisfaction unto it; but the dignity of the person, and the vertue of the Godhead, which made the righteousnesse of the Man Christ, as well active as passive, to bee meritorious and satisfactory for others. Iesus Christ therefore being both God and Man, was and is our high Priest, who offered the sacrifice of his humanity upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of his Deity, which sanctified the sacrifice and made it an all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent satisfaction for the sinnes of all that beleeve.

               <p>§. XVI. Our fifth reason. There are two parts of justification, the<note place="margin">Our fifth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: that there are two parts of justification.</note> one, the absolving from the guilt of sinne and damnation; the other, the accepting of a beleeving sinner, as righteous unto life: the former, is wrought by the sufferings of Christ imputed, as a full satisfaction for sinne; the other, by imputation of Christs perfect obedience, as a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient merit of eternall life: by the former we are freed from hell, by the latter we are entituled to the kingdome of heaven. Of them both the<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 9. 19.</note> Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that we are justified, that is, absolved from our sinne, by the bloud of Christ. v. 9. and that wee are justified, that is, constituted just by his obedience, vers. 19. To this argument they answere by denying the antecedent; saying, that there are no parts of justification, but that it wholly consisteth in remission of sinnes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if it were the onely matter of justification, as some of them teach, and the entire formall cause of justification, as others avouch, of whom we shall speake in the next Chapter; I say, if both these opinions were true, then I would confesse, that the whole nature of justification doth consist in forgivenesse of sinne; but whiles it is either, but the matter, as some say; or but the forme, as others; or neither of both, as I avouch: it is a manifest errour to say, that justification consisteth wholly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes. Againe, in every mutation, though it be but relative, we must of necessity acknowledge two termes; <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>rminum à quo, &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ad quem;</hi> the denomination being taken commonly from the <hi>terminus ad quem.</hi> As in justification there is a motion or mutation from sinne to justice, (from which terme justification hath its name) from a state of death and damnation, to a state of life and Salvation. But if justification be nothing else but bare remission of sinne, then is there in it onely a not imputing of sinne; but no acceptation as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: a freedome from hell, but no title to heaven. To this they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; that to whom sinne is not imputed, righteousnesse is imputed; and they who are freed from hell, are admitted to heaven. I doe grant, that these things doe alwayes concurre; but yet they are not to bee confounded, for they differ in themselves, and in their causes, and in their effects: in themselves, for it is one thing to bee acquitted from the guilt of sinne, another thing to be made righteous; as wee see daily in the pardons of malefactors: in their causes, for remission of sinne is to be attributed to Christs satisfactory, sufferings; the acceptation as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous unto life, to Christs meritorious obedience. In their effects, for by remission of sinne wee are freed from hell; and by imputation of Christs obedience, we have right unto heaven.</p>
               <p>§. XVII. If unto justification there be required besides remission<note place="margin">Object.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22501:37"/>
one action is the onely forme of justification, <hi>viz.</hi> imputation of Christs righteousnesse; of which are two effects, which also be the two parts of justification, remission of sinne, and acceptation as righteous; as I said in the definition, that justification is an action of God, wherein hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the righteousnesse of Christ to a beleeving sinner, doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly absolve him from his sinnes, but also accepteth of him as righteous, and as an heire of eternall life.</p>

                     </gap>ly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes.</note> Divines, of whom we spake, when they would prove justification by the passive righteousnesse of Christ onely, take this position for granted, that justification is nothing but remission of sinne, and hereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that seeing wee have remission of sinne onely by the bloud of Christ, we are justified by his bloud onely: And to this purpose they alleage many testimonies of Scriptures, affirming that by the bloud of Christ and by his death and passion wee have remission of sinne; to all which we readily subscribe. But if there be any other places that seeme to ascribe unto the sufferings of Christ more than remission of sinnes, as entrance into heaven and salvation, &amp;c. such places are to be understood by a Synecdoche, putting the chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e and most eminent part of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the whole. Others labour to prove this assertion, that justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is nothing but remission of sinne, by testimonies, and by reasons; and to this purpose collect a multitude of testimonies of Protestant Divines, who against the Papists have maintained, that justification confisteth in remission of sinnes onely. But this assertion, as hereafter I shall shew, is to be understood as spoken in opposition to the Papists, who unto justification, besides remission of sinnes, require inward reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or sanctification; and therefore their meaning was to exclude from justification, not imputation of righteousnesse, which alwayes concurreth in the same act with remission of sinne, and without which there can be no remission; for by the same act of imputation of Christs whole and entire righteousnesse, we have both remission of sinnes, and acceptation unto life; but to exclude renovation <hi>à ratione justificationis,</hi> from the proper nature of justification; as if they had said, wee are not justified both by remission and renovation, as the Papists teach, but by remission without renovation; that is, in their meaning, by remission onely: and this is acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, as hereafter shall bee shewed. And forasmuch as by remission of sinne wee have an imputative righteousnesse, for to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne, to him he imputeth righteousnesse without workes, as the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7. therefore, when it is said, that we are justified by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission<note place="margin">Rom. 4 6, 7.</note> onely, and not by renovation; it is all one, as if wee said, that wee are justified by imputation onely, and not by infusion of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.<note place="margin">Their chiese ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, because remission is as well of sinnes of omission as of commission.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§ XIX. Their chiefe argument to prove their assertion is this. Remission is as well of the sinnes of omission as of commission. As therefore he, whose sinnes of commission are remitted, is reputed, as if hee had done nothing forbidden: so whose sinnes of omission are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22501:37"/>
is reputed, as if hee had left undone nothing that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now hee that is reputed as if hee had neither done any thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, nor left undone any thing that is commanded; hee is reputed, as if hee had fulfilled the whole Law.</p>
               <p>I answer by distinction, if they consider remission of sinnes barely without imputation of righteousnesse (as they must, if they will make good their assertion) then hee that hath onely remission of the sins both of commission and omission, is freed from the guilt of both, but not from the fault. For notwithstanding such remission of his sinnes, he is a sinner, as having both committed what is forbidden, and also omitted what is commanded. Yet by remission or not imputation of sinne hee is freed from the punishment, and <hi>a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>th re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is reputed, as having neither committed any evill, nor omitted any good; not simply or absolutely, but in respect of the punishment, and the guilt which bindeth over to punishment. As for example, a male<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>actour being convicted of Felony, is by the Kings pardon acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both from the punishment and the guilt binding him over to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; but yet notwithstanding his fault remaineth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd for all his pardon hee is a theefe. But if they conceive of remission of sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, as having the imputation of righteousnesse concurring with it, as alwaies it happeneth in Gods justification of a sinner; then it is true, that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to whom his sinnes are remitted, that is, to whom sinne is not imputed, and righteousnesse is imputed, is reputed simply and absolutely, as if he had neither committed any thing forbidden, nor omitted any thing commanded, but as if he had fulfilled the whole Law. For it is not in Gods pardon as it is in mens: A man by his pardon may remit the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and the guilt binding over to punishment; but hee cannot take away the fault, neither can hee by his pardon, make the offendor just. But whom God doth justifie, hee maketh them righteous by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christs righteousnesse, whereby hee doth not onely free them from the guilt of sinne and damnation; but also covering their fault he accepteth, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§ XX. To this argument some doe adde a second not unlike, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever<note place="margin">Object. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission we are made innocent and therefore just.</note> are innocent they are just; by remission of sinnes men are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; therefore by remission of sinnes men are just. <hi>Answ.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22501:38"/>
is not generally and necessarily true, for wee may conceive a man to bee innocent, who is not just: for innocency is but an absence of sinne, not importing a presence of righteousnesse. Infants if they were cleare from originall sinne, were innocent, but not just. To the assumption, I answer, that by the bare remission of sinnes without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousnesse men are not innocent: for bare remission is like to a Kings pardon, which taketh away the punishment, but not the fault. But if they speake of remission of sinne accompanied with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christs righteousnesse, then I will confesse, that by remission of sinne men are made both innocent and just. But that righteousnesse imputed which shall make a man just, must not stand in suffering onely, but in an universall conformity with the Law of God. You have heard our arguments, and their answers: now let us examine their proofes.</p>
               <p>§ XXI. The principall authour of this Novelty hath three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of</hi> I. P.</note> The first is this; Whereby we have entrance into heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">1</note> alone we are justified: by the blood of Christ wee have entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven; therefore by the blood of Christ alone wee are justified. <hi>Answ.</hi> The proposition if it had beene propounded thus, by what wee have entrance into heaven, by that wee are justified; or thus, by what alone we have entrance into heaven, by that alone wee are justified, had been true; but as it is propounded, it is false: for we have entrance into heaven by his resurrection, ascension, and intercession, (not to speake of his obedience, by which notwithstanding wee are as the Apostle saith, justified, and entituled to heaven) yet we are not justified by any of these alone. If his meaning be that by the blood alone of Christ we have entrance into heaven, the assumption also is false, unlesse hee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> doe under one principall include all the merits of Christ, or exclude all other meanes out of Christ, who is our onely Saviour.</p>
               <p>His second argument, <hi>Sablata privatione ponitur habitus,</hi> therefore sinne being remitted and taken away, justice followeth of its owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.<note place="margin">2</note> To which I answer briefly, that neither the punishment, nor the guilt, which onely (as themselves teach) are taken away in justification, are privations, nor the justice which is acquired is an habit in the party justified: and therefore that Logicall Axiome doth not serve his turne.</p>
               <p>His third argument; If we are justified onely by remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">3</note> then not by that righteousnesse which is in Christ: but we are justified onely by remission of sinnes. <hi>Answ.</hi> The consequence of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is unsound, for although wee were justified by remission of sinnes alone; yet wee were justified by imputation of Christs passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at the least, unto remission of sinnes. The assumption hee proveth, first, by this reason; because otherwise our sinnes being remitted, wee should still remaine accursed. <hi>Answ.</hi> It followeth not, for together with remission of sinnes by imputation of Christs sufferings, concurreth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation unto life by imputation of Christs obedience, without which we could not be said to have fulfilled the Law in Christ. Secondly, by

And againe <note n="n" place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>, that God, when he doth justifie us, he doth absolve us by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousnesse, that in Christ wee may be accepted as just, who in our selves are not. Wherefore, saith hee, when <hi>Calvin</hi> in the same Chapter, §. 21. and 22. and in his Antidote unto the Councell of Trent, <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. doth contend, that justification consisteth only in remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes; he doth not exclude the imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, but inward renovation and sanctification. The same <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> confesseth <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justif. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</note>, that those whom he calleth Lutherans. (who indeed are very sound in this point) doe all of them place justification in the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, which assertion of theirs is most true, because by imputation of Christs righteousnesse wee have not onely remission o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> sinnes, but also acceptation unto life, as being righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in Christ; not onely freedome from hell, but also right and title to the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>§ XXII. Another treating of this point, affirmeth, that Christ is the<note place="margin">The arguments of <hi>J. F.</hi>
                  </note> matter of our justification, and is made righteousnesse unto us in his passive obedience onely; and yet confesseth, that both the holinesse of his person and the obedience of his life are necessarily required, that he might be meet to become our righteousnesse in his sufferings. But this is frivolous: because, as I noted before, he being perfect God, as well as perfect man, had beene in his sufferings an All-sufficient satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our sinnes, though hee had never submitted himselfe to the obedience of the Law. But the divine Nature of the Sonne of God, and the dignity of his person, as it made his sufferings all-sufficiently satisfactory for our sinnes, to redeeme us from hell, because they were the sufferings of God, the blood of God, &amp;c. so it made his obedience all-sufficiently meritorious to constitute and make us righteous, and to make us Heires of Eternall life; because it was the obedience or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God. For the Sonne of God was made under <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> the Law, that he might not onely redeeme us, who were under the Law, by his sufferings; but also that by his meritorious obedience we might receive the Adoption of sonnes. But he proveth Christ to bee our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse onely in his passive obedience, because it onely was both prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the types and figures of the Law, and also represented in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. As touching the types and figures of the Law which prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Christ; they were either figures of his person and office, or they represented his benefits, as namely and especially justification or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And yet, saith he, Baptisme signifieth onely the washing of the soule by the bloud of Christ; the Eucharist representeth onely his body broken, and his blood shed for our sinnes. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though some parts onely of the benefits of Christ are represented in the severall Sacraments; yet the substance of each Sacrament is the participation of Christ wholly with all his merits and benefits. Thus in Baptisme we are incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, and in it we put on <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> Christ, who is our righteousnesse. And it is the Sacrament, not only of remission of sinne and of justification, but also of regeneration and sanctification, we being therein conformed to his death and resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5. In the Lords Supper we have communion with Christ, being not only united to him as <note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note> bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh; but also have communion with him both in his merits by imputation, and in his graces by influence from him as our head. Other arguments are used by the same authour; but because in them he taketh two things for granted, which hee cannot prove; the one, that justification consisteth onely in remission of sin; the other, that wee ascribe remission of sinne to Christs active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I will not trouble the Reader with them. Onely let him call to minde the errours which the Authors of this opinion doe runne into for the defence thereof. First, that remission of sinnes is the matter of justification which is imputed to us. Secondly, that the Law is fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by bearing the penalty alone. Thirdly, that by one act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we are made just, as wee were by one act of disobedience made sinners. Fourthly, that neither by his disobedience <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>m</hi> did trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the Law, nor Christ by his obedience unto death, obey it. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22501:39"/>
that Christ obeyed the law not for us, but for himselfe. Sixthly, that justification consisteth wholly and onely in remission of sinnes. Which being for the most part consequents of this opinion, doe prove the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to be false.</p>

But being, according to their owne conceipt, but the one, or the other, and according to the truth, neither of both, but an effect of the true forme (for by imputation of righteousnesse we have remission of sinne) their opinion must needs be unsound.

What then? forsooth the act of faith. Of these mens errour I shall not need to say much in this place: because, besides that, which hath already beene delivered in the third Chapter, I have plentifully and fully proved in my whole fourth booke, that the righteousnesse of Christ, is the matter which is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to justification; and in my whole fifth booke, that the imputation of Christs righteousnesse is the forme of justification. Only I will note their depravation of our Doctrine, and point at their errours.</p>
               <p>§ II. As touching the former: when we say, that the imputation of<note place="margin">Their depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our Doctrine.</note> Christs righteousnesse is the formall cause of justification, because by imputation of Christs righteousnesse God doth justifie us: they will<note place="margin">

                  </note> needs, with the Papists, make us hold, that we are formally righteous by that righteousnesse, which is not in us, but out of us in Christ; which is absurd: for as themselves expound the phrase <note n="*" place="margin">A. W. pag. 180. n. 4.</note>, <hi>Formall justice consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth either in the qualities of the soule, or in good actions</hi> (that is, it is either habituall or actuall) <hi>so that it cannot stand in imputation; by which wee can</hi>

But wee teach, that Christs righteousnesse, both habituall and actuall, by which he was formally just, is the matter; and the imputation thereof is the forme of justification.

                  <hi>formall</hi> cause of justification. We say then, that the righteousnesse of Christ it selfe is not the formall cause of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or that by which we are formally just; but the imputation of it; it selfe being the matter of justification; that is to say, that thing, which unto justification is imputed. Wherefore I shall not need to answere, in defence of our assertion, the arguments, either of those <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teratores,</hi> the Papists, or these <hi>Novatores,</hi> who both agree in this calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation against us, all tending to prove, that wee are not formally ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ly just, is inherent in himselfe: for what is more intrinsecall than the forme? But Christs righteousnesse is not inherent in us, no more than our sinne was inherent in him. And yet, as he was made sinne or a sinner by our sinnes, not formally, (God forbid!) but by imputation: so wee are made righteous by his righteousnesse, not formally (as we are justified) or in our selves, but in him, <hi>viz.</hi> by imputation. And againe, as by <hi>Adams</hi> actuall transgr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And yet we deny not, but that, as they to whom the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression is imputed, are also by sinne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent transfused from him by carnall generation formally made sinners: so they, to whom the obedience of Christ is imputed unto justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are also made formally just by an inchoated righteousnesse received by influence from Christ, and infused by his spirit in their spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
               <p>§ III. In their opinion it selfe denying the imputation of Christs<note place="margin">Their owne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, are six.</note> righteousnesse to justification they erre more dangerously than the Papists, who are forced to confesse the imputation of Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: for the maintenance of this maine errour they hold sixe others. First, that remission of sinne is the entire forme or formall cause of justification. Secondly, that justification is nothing else but remission of sinne. Thirdly, that no other righteousnesse concurreth to justification besides the remission of sinne, no not the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, otherwise than it doth merit remission of sinne. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the righteousnesse, by which we are justified, is not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:22501:40"/>
of Christ it selfe, but a righteousnesse purchased by the death of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> remission of sinne. Fifthly, that not the obedience of Christ it selfe is imputed whether active or passive, but the merit therof. Sixthly, that not the righteousnesse of Christ, but the act of faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for righteousnesse. All which before I saw the booke wherein these errours are broached, I had plainely and fully confuted in this Treatise.</p>
               <p>§ IV. For as touching the two first, and the maine errour it selfe;<note place="margin">The two first of the sixe.</note> I have proved, both in the third Chapter of this booke <note n="d" place="margin">

                  </note> briefly, and in the whole fifth booke at large, that the forme of justification is the imputation of Christs righteousnesse; by which we are both absolved from our sinnes, and also are in Christ accepted and made righteous; and consequently, that these two are the essentiall parts of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. §. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. §.</note> justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> the not imputing or remission of sinne, which God doth grant by imputation of Christs sufferings, in respect whereof wee are said to be justified by his <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5. 9.</note> blood; that is, freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation; and the imputation of Christs <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> obedience; by which wee are made or constituted righteous, and are entituled to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven. So that remission of sinne is not the forme, and much lesse the entire forme of justification, considered as an action of God; but an effect of the forme, because by imputation of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we have remission of sinne. Neither is it the whole benefit of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, but a part thereof. For although many of our Divines, as hath beene said, have taught, that unto justification remission of sinnes is onely required: yet their assertion, as hath also beene shewed, is to be understood (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe understandeth <hi>Calvin</hi>) as spoken in opposition to the Papists; who say, that to justification concurre, not onely remission of sinnes, but also inward renovation or sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To contradict them, our Divines have said, that wee are justified by remission onely or not imputing of sinne, (wherewith alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth imputation of righteousnesse,) and not by renovation or sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Their meaning therefore by the exclusive particle <hi>onely,</hi> was to exclude, not imputation of righteousnesse, which unseparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth the not imputing of sinne, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 6. 8.</note> 6. 8. and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth; but infusion of righteousnesse or renovation.</p>
               <p>§ V. The third is the same in effect with that which I fully confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">The third error</note> 
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. and contradicteth their owne assertion, who teach with us, that we are justified by the whole course of Christs obedience: for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin is properly ascribed to Christs sufferings or his blood <note n="g" place="margin">1 Job. 1. 7.</note> which cleanseth us from all our sinnes; and not to his active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And justification is nothing, as they say, but remission of sinne: whereupon it would follow, that we are justified onely by Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ts pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience, which I have already disproved.<note place="margin">The fourth error.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§ VI. The fourth, denying the righteousnesse of Christ it selfe to be our righteousnesse, I have fully confuted in the fourth booke: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, which hath already beene alledged in the third chapter of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:22501:41"/>
this book that which is added concerning a righteousnesse purchased by the death of Christ, is the same with that which I confuted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. §. 1. for our righteousnesse is not remission of sinne, but that by which wee have remission; not justification it selfe, but that by which wee are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified. For remission of sinne, as well as justification it selfe, is an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, not imputing sinne and imputing righteousnesse; and therefore is not that righteousnesse which is imputed. Thus therefore I argue; By what we have remission of sinne, by that wee are justified, and by what we are justified, that is, our righteousnesse by the bloud of Christ we have remission of sinne, and not by that righteousnesse which is purchased by his blood, <hi>viz.</hi> remission of sinne, for that to say were very ridiculous. Wherefore by the blood of Christ we are justified; and consequently, that with the res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of his obedience is our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>§. VII. To the fifth I answer, that the meritorious obedience of<note place="margin">The fift error.</note> Christ both active and passive are the merits of Christ. If therefore the merit of Christ be imputed, then his meritorious obedience: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the merit of Christs obedience be imputed to us, unlesse the obedience it selfe be imputed, and by imputation accepted of God for us, as performed by our selves.</p>
               <p>For as the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression could not be imputed to us, unlesse the transgression it selfe were first imputed, and made ours; by imputation whereof wee are made sinners, that is, guilty of his sinne unto condemnation: so the merit of Christs obedience cannot bee imputed, unlesse the obedience it selfe be imputed, and made ours; by imputation whereof we are freed from the guilt of sinne and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are accepted as righteous, and as heires of eternall life. And as it may truely be said of them, to whom <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they sinned in <hi>Adam:</hi> so of them, to whom Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is imputed, it may no lesse truely be said, that in Christ they have satisfied the justice of God, in Christ they have fulfilled the Law; the Lord accepting of the obedience of Christ in their behalfe, as if they had performed it in their owne persons. For Christ is the end, the perfection and complement of the Law to all that beleeve. So that whosoever truely beleeveth in Christ, hath in him fulfilled the Law, as the Greeke expositors expound that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note>

And therefore, neither could we be said to have satisfied the justice of God for our sinnes, nor to have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law in him, as we are truely said to have sinned in <hi>Adam.</hi> Or if it could be said, that in Christ we satisfied Gods justice for our sinnes, then should we need no pardon.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ is the Lambe <note n="p" place="margin">Apoc. 13. 8.</note> of God slaine from the beginning of the world. The vertue of whose obedience is extended, not onely to them that come after Christ; but also to all the faithfull that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the beginning of the world, who were members <note n="q" place="margin">Their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were the reproch of Christ. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. viz. in his members.</note> of Christ as much as we are now. And for them, as well as for us, Christ obeyed the Law, and suffered death; and to them (so many as beleeved) was the obedience of Christ imputed, <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 15. 11.</note> as well as to us. They all did eate the same <note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3. 4.</note> spirituall meat, and did all drinke the same spirituall drinke. For they dranke of that spirituall Rocke which followed, and that Rocke was Christ.</p>
               <p>§. XI. But if in Christ, say they, we satisfied the punishment, then<note place="margin">Obiect. 4</note> we need no pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When wee say, that in Christ wee satisfied and fulfilled the Law, our meaning is, that his satisfaction and obedience is imputed to us; that is, it is accepted of God in our behalfe, as if wee had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the same in our owne persons. Neither should it seeme strange, that satisfaction and pardon may stand together, seeing God pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no sinne, for which his justice is not satisfied. But it is Christ that satisfied, &amp; bare the punishment; and we are they who are pardoned by imputation of his satisfaction unto us. Here therefore especially mercy and justice met together: justice, executed upon Christs mercy, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us; who are justified by the grace of God <hi>freely,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24. 15.</note> in respect of us, through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus: and therfore not freely in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:22501:42"/>
respect of him, who paid so great a price. For him God set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes, &amp;c. But that the righteousnesse of Christ is the onely thing, which properly is imputed to justification, I have at large disputed, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>§. XII. The sixth I have already refuted <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. §. 7. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I now adde; that these men, confessing the truth with us, that faith<note place="margin">The sixth error</note> is the instrumentall cause of justification, confute themselves. For if it be the instrument to receive that which is imputed, then is it not the thing it selfe which is imputed properly; though relatively it may in respect of the object, which it, as the instrument or hand, doth receive to justification: and that is the righteousnesse of Christ. And for this cause, as hereafter <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 6.</note> shall bee declared, the same benefits, which wee have from Christ properly, are attributed to faith; not absolutely, in regard of it selfe; but relatively in respect of that righteousnesse, which it doth apprehend. If it be said, that faith as the instrument receiveth remission of sinne, because by it we are assured thereof: I answer, that by faith receiving Christ we have remission of sinnes and justification, before we can by speciall faith be assured of it. And it is a great absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as elsewhere <note n="*" place="margin">Covenant of Grace. cap. 8. page 94. n. 5.</note> I have shewed, to teach, that men must beleeve, and be assured of the remission of their sinnes, to the end that they may be remitted.</p>
               <p>§. XIII. I shall not need therefore to say any more in this place,<note place="margin">A Caveat for young Divines.</note> unlesse it be to give a Caveat to all young Divines, that they give no credit to these Novelties, which either affirme that wee are justified by the passive righteousnesse of Christ onely; or deny that wee are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the righteousnesse of Christ at all, as the matter of our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By <hi>Matter</hi> I understand that very thing, which is imputed as our onely righteousnesse; by which wee stand perfectly righteous before God; by imputation whereof, we are both freed from hell, and also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to the kingdome of heaven. And let all men take notice, that these opinions, howsoever to some they seeme matters of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are notwithstanding very dangerous, if not pernicious; seeing they concerne our very title to the kingdome of heaven, and seeing al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o I have proved in this Treatise, that without imputation of Christs<note place="margin">The necessity of imputation of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</note> righteousnesse there can be no justification, nor salvation. For all will confesse, that without Christs obedience and sufferings none can bee justified or saved; and that they justifie or save none, but them onely to whom they are communicated and applyed. But they cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated otherwise than by imputation, whereby God accepteth them in our behalfe, as if we had in our owne persons performed them for our selves. Againe, these foure assertions I hold for undoubted truthes: first, that what Christ our blessed Saviour in the daies of his flesh did or suffered in obedience to God, he did and suffered, not for himselfe, but for us: secondly, that whatsoever he did and suffered for us that beleeve, that the Lord accepteth in the behalfe of all that beleeve: thirdly, that what he accepteth in our behalfe that he imputeth unto us,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:22501:42"/>
for by imputation wee meane nothing else: fourthly, to say, that what Christ did and suffered for us God doth not accept in our behalfe, is both blasphemous against Christ the wisedome of his Father, as if hee did and suffered those things, which he did and suffered in vaine: and also pernicious unto us, for if Christs doings and sufferings for us bee in vaine, as they are if they bee not imputed to us; then is our faith vaine, and wee remaine in our sinnes, and in the wofull state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. But some will say; it is sufficient to beleeve, that by the<note place="margin">Object.</note> merits of Christ we have remission of sinne, and that having remission of sinnes we shall be saved by him. <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, but God forgiveth no sinnes, for which his justice is not fully satisfied. For as he is mercifull, so he is just in forgiving our sinnes. But no such satisfaction can bee imagined, but that of Christ. For we our selves are not able to satisfie for our sinnes, but by eternall punishment. And how shall we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by Christs satisfaction, if it be not applyed and communicated unto us? how can it be communicated and made ours, but by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And that the very papists themselves are at length forced to confesse. And where they say, that having remission of sinnes they shall be saved: I confesse it is true, because with Gods remission of sinnes there doth alwayes concurre imputation of righteousnesse. But the bare remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne without imputation of righteousnesse, which onely freeth a man from the guilt of sinne and damnation, doth not entitle him or give him right to the kingdome of heaven. It is one thing to have by faith remission of sinnes, and another to have by faith inheritance among them that be sanctified, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. Eternall life is not to bee<note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> had without perfect fulfilling of the Law, which is no where to bee found but onely in Christ. And therefore by the onely meritorious obedience of Christ, by which he hath merited and purchased salvation for us, wee are saved. But how should we be saved by his obedience, if it be not communicated unto us, and made ours for our selves? how can it bee made ours, but by imputation? wherefore no imputation of Christs obedience, no salvation.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE finall cause or end, for which God doth justifie a<note place="margin">The end Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame.</note> sinner by imputation of Christs righteousnesse, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supreme, or subordinate. The supreme, is the manifestation of the glory, both of his mercy, and of his justice (as is noted in the definition) which as they doe concurre in all the worke of God, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 145. 17.<note place="margin">Psal. 145. 17.</note> so especially in the worke of redemption and justification. For therein the mercy of God appeareth to be so great, that rather than hee would suffer us most miserable sinners to perish in our sinnes, he hath sent his owne and his only begotten Son, that we might be justified <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein hee hath made us <note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 6.</note> accepted in his beloved. His justice also such, that rather than hee would suffer the sinnes of his owne elect to goe unpunished, or forgive them without due satisfaction; hee hath punished them in his owne Sonne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from him a full satisfaction for them: having set him forth <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25, 26.</note> to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteousnesse through the forgivenesse of sinnes, which are past, by the sufferance of God; to demonstrate, I say, his righteousnesse at this time, that hee might be just and the justifier of him who beleeveth in Iesus. Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us therefore, not unto us, as if we were justified by our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse or worthinesse; but <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 119. 1.</note> to the name of God all glory is due for his mercy and for his righteousnesse sake; who doth justifie us, not of workes <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>§. II. The subordinate end is our salvation, and the way unto it,<note place="margin">The subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate end.</note> which is our new obedience or sanctification. Salvation, though it bee<note place="margin">1 Salvation.</note> our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, our particular supreme end and chiefe good, unto which both justification and sanctification is referred; yet it is subordinate to the glory of God, as to the soveraigne and universall end. For such is Gods goodnesse towards his elect, that hee hath subordinated our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to his owne glory; as he hath our justification and sanctification to both. And therefore, as we are first above all things to desire, that God may bee <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.</note> glorified; so, that hee may bee glorified, wee are first
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22501:43"/>
among those things, which wee desire for our owne good, to seeke his <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> Kingdome, and his righteousnesse; that his Kingdome of glory, and the Kingdome of Grace, which consisteth in the <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> righteousnesse of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the two companions thereof peace and joy in the holy Ghost; may come upon us; and next, that his will may be done upon earth, as it is in heaven, by our new obedience: for this is the will of God <note n="k" place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 3.</note>, even our sanctification. Salvation, I say, is the end both of our justification and sanctification: for being made free from sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come servants to <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note> God, we have our fruit unto holinesse, and the end everlasting life. The end of our faith by which we are justified, is the <note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 9.</note> salvation of our soules, unto which by justification wee are entituled, and <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> saved in hope that being justified by his <note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 3. 7.</note> grace, wee should bee made heires according to, hope of eternall life: for all that be justified, <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> shall be glorified. And this also I noted in the definition, when I said, that those whom the Lord doth justifie by imputation of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, he accepteth as righteous in Christ, and as heires of eternall life: for by faith <note n="q" place="margin">Act 26. 18.</note> we have remission of sinnes, and inheritance among them that are sanctified.</p>
               <p>§ III. But we are justified by faith, not onely, that in the end wee<note place="margin">2. <hi>Certainety of Salvation.</hi>
                  </note> may be saved; but also, that in the meane time our salvation being of Grace, might be certaine and sure: and that being justified <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 5. 1, 2.</note> by faith we might have peace and joy in the holy Ghost: Whereas, if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon our workes or worthinesse, it would be uncertaine. For the promise of this inheritance was not made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed through the Law, in respect of any righteousnesse therein prescribed, but through the righteousnesse of Faith. And therefore it is of faith, that it might bee by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 13, 16.</note> the seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. 16.</p>
               <p>§ IV. The other end, which is subordinate not onely to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Sanctification.</note> but also to our Salvation, is our sanctification, as being the way to eternall life: for though we be saved by grace through faith, and not of workes; yet we are the workmanship <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10.</note> of God, created in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus unto good workes, which God hath before ordained, that we should walke in them: We are therefore justified, First, that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Secondly, that wee may bee saved in the life to come. Thirdly, that in this world we may lead a godly life. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74, 75. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. So much of the causes.</p>
               <p>§ V. There remaine the essentiall parts of justification, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed<note place="margin">The parts of justification.</note> in the definition, when I said, that God doth justifie a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinner, when imputing unto him the righteousnesse of Christ, <hi>he doth absolve him from his sinnes, and accepteth of him in Christ as righteous, and as an Heire of Eternall Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parts therefore of justification are two, absolution from sinne, and acceptation as righteous in Christ; both which the Lord granteth by imputation of the full and perfect satisfaction of Christ, whereby he fully satisfied the Law, both in respect of the penalty, which he satisfied by his sufferings; and also in respect of the precept, which he satisfied

by his perfect righteousnesse, both habituall and actuall. As therefore there were two branches of the Law to be satisfied, the commination and the Commandement; and two parts of Christs satisfaction answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thereunto: so there are two parts of justification, absolution from the curse of the Law, by imputation of Christs sufferings, wherein he became a curse for us; and acceptation as righteous in Christ by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christs most perfect righteousnes both habituall &amp; actuall: in respect of both which parts of his satisfaction, Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnes<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note>, that is, doth justifie all that truly beleeve in him.</p>
               <p>§ VI. And hereby it may appeare, that those three benefits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Reconciliation, and Adoption, are all comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Redemption, reconciliation, adoption com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised under Iustification.</note> this maine benefit of justification; the two former, being all one in substance with the former part: for as touching the former, In Christ wee have Redemption through his bloud<note n="u" place="margin">

First, whether they doe justifie a man before God. Secondly, whether they doe merit Eternall Life.</p>
               <p>§ II. The first capitall errour of the Papists is, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found<note place="margin">The Papists confound justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and sanctification.</note> justification and sanctification, and by confounding of them, and of two benefits making but one, they utterly abolish, as shall be shewed, the benefit of justification; which notwithstanding is the principall benefit, which we have by Christ in this life, by which wee are freed from hell, and entituled to the Kingdome of Heaven. And this they doe in two respects: for first, they hold, that to justifie in this question signifieth to make righteous by righteousnesse inherent, or by infusion of righteousnesse, that is, to sanctifie. Secondly, they make remission of sinne, not to be the pardoning and forgiving of sinne, but the utter deletion or expulsion of sinne by infusion of righteousnèsse. Thus they make justification wholly to consist in the parts of sanctification. For whereas Sanctification is partly privative, which is the taking away of sinne, which we, according to the Scriptures call mortification; and partly positive, which we call vivification; and is partly inward or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall, consisting in the habits of Grace infused, and partly actuall which is our new obedience, and practice of good workes: all these, and onely these they make to concurre to justification: which with them is partly privative, which they call remission of sinne, whereby they understand the utter deletion or extinction of sinne, wrought by infusion of perfect righteousnesse, which is an higher degree of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, than we can attaine unto in this life: and partly positive, and that either habituall, which they call their first justification, wherein a man of a sinner is made righteous by infusion of the habits of Grace, which is indeed regeneration: and partly actuall, which they call their second justification, wherein a righteous man is made more just by the practice of good works, whereby they merit not onely the increase of righteousnesse, but also the Crowne of Eternall Life.</p>
               <p>§ III. Of this first controversie therefore are two questions: First,<note place="margin">The Papists ground their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rrour upon the like notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine words.</note> whether to <hi>justifie</hi> doth signifie to make righteous by infusion of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, which is to sanctifie. Secondly, whether remission of sinne be the utter deletion and abolition of sinne by infusion of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. In both the Papists hold the affirmative. The former, which is a most pernicious errour, they ground upon the like notation of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine words to <hi>justifie</hi> and to <hi>sanctifie.</hi> That as to sanctifie is to make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by holinesse inherent; so to justifie is to make just by infusion of righteousnesse. But though the notation of the Latine words were to be respected; yet no more could be inforced from thence, but that to justifie is to make just. And that is all, which <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goeth about to prove. Now God maketh men just two wayes: by imputation, as he justifieth: by infusion, as he sanctifieth them. For if a man may bee made just, not only inwardly by obtaining righteousnesse, but also out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by declaration, as <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe saith; then much more by imputation: even as we were made sinners by <hi>Adams</hi> actuall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and as Christ was made sinne, that is, a sinner for us. For

                  </gap>de this word to bee<note place="margin">The Hebrew word never signifieth to make just by righteousnesse inherent.</note> used in the old Testament. By all which it doth evidently appeare that the Hebrew word, which signifieth to justifie, doth never signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse, or by righteousnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent: the which will more clearely appeare by the countrary; for as to condemne is to make wicked; so to justifie, is to make just. The word <hi>Rashah</hi> signifieth to be wicked, as <hi>Tsadaq</hi> doth signifie to be just, so <hi>Hirshiah,</hi> which signifieth to make wicked, is to condemne, as <hi>Hitsdiq,</hi> which signifieth to make just, is to justifie. As therefore they, who are condemned, are said to be made wicked, or unjust, namely by sentence: so they, who are justified, are said to be made just, <hi>viz.</hi> by sentence. But he that condemneth the wicked, whether it be God or man, though he be said, according to the force of the word, to make him wicked; yet doth not make him wicked formally, or by infusion of wickednesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent. Therefore, he that justifieth a man, whether he be God or man, though he be said, according to the Etymologie of the word, to make him just: yet <hi>quatenus justificat,</hi> he doth not make him just, as hee justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, by righteousnesse inherent. No more than hee that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the just doth make him formally wicked; nor hee that justifieth the wicked doth make him formally just; which if a man should doe, it would be no abomination to God, as by he sentence of <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 17. 15.</note>

               <p>§. VII. And not unlike hereunto is the phrase of cleansing or<note place="margin">The like use in other words.</note> polluting, that is, making cleane or uncleane, attributed to the priest in

                  </note> Law when hee was to judge of the Leprosie either in persons or things; which he was said to make cleane or uncleane, when he did but judge or pronounce them so to be. And further, this is to be noted, as a thing usuall in the Hebrew tongue, that the third Conjugation doth seeme to make that quality or thing, which is implied in the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the first Conjugation, not alwayes really and formally, but many times in word onely, or judgement, sentence, or conceit. Thus <hi>Gadal</hi> signifieth to be great, <hi>Higdil</hi> to make great or to magnifie, which is in words to extoll, in which sense we are said to magnifie <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 1. 46.</note> God, &amp;c. So <hi>Aman</hi> signifieth to be true, <hi>Heemin</hi> to make true, that is, to beleeve, as contrariwise not to beleeve a man is to make him a liar<note n="h" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 10.</note>, and yet a man may beleeve <note n="i" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 11.</note> a lye, which he cannot make true. Thus <hi>Rashah</hi> signifieth to be wicked, <hi>Hirshuah</hi> to make wicked by sentence; and so <hi>Tsadaq</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to be just, and <hi>Hitsdiq</hi> to make just, namely by sentence. And such is the ordinary use of divers Latine and English words of the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as to glorifie, magnifie, vilifie, nullifie (as <hi>Herod</hi>

But the sinner being instructed in the Gospell, and the holy Ghost having opened <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> his heart to beleeve, appealeth from the sentence of the Law to the promise of the Gospell, and from the tribunall of justice to the throne of Grace, humbly intreating the Lord for Christs sake to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his sinnes, and to accept of the merits and obedience of Christ, as a full satisfaction for them.

The Lord, as a gracious and righteous judge imputing to the beleever the merits and righteousnesse of Christ, absolveth him from his sinnes, and accepteth of him as righteous in Christ, that is to say, justifieth him. The beleeving sinner being thus justified in the Court of heaven, is not at the first justified in the Court of his owne conscience, that is to say, is not yet perswaded and assured of his justification; untill the holy Ghost, by the ministery of the Gospell pronouncing remission of sinnes and justification to every one that beleeveth, teacheth him to apply the promises of the Gospell unto himselfe, which he sealeth unto him by the Sacraments. The beleever being thus perswaded, and in some measure assured of his justification, giveth diligence by practising the duties of repentance and sanctification, to confirme and increase that assurance more and more unto the end of his life, labouring by all good meanes to make sure his election, his vocation and his justification: and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from faith to faith. The beleever having thus beene justified in this life, both in the court of heaven, and in the court of his owne conscience; after this life, namely at the day of judgement, when our Saviour will judge of mens faiths according to the evidence of their works, shall be justified, that is, pronounced happy and blessed.

place <hi>incrementum justitiae,</hi> the encrease of justice, which is their second justification: which distinction, if it were applied to sanctification, were not to be rejected.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it is the righteousnesse of Christ by which wee are justified, which is a perfect righteousnesse, whereunto nothing can bee added. Therefore of justification it selfe there are no degrees, though of the assurance thereof there are degrees according to the measure of our faith.</p>
               <p>§ IV. But let us see how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth his second significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">The second sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by three testimonies. The first, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</note> To that purpose he alledgeth three testimonies of Scripture, which prove nothing else but that the Papists have no sound proofe for their erronious conceit. The first is taken out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>And such were you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified.</hi> Where indeed the word is used, but in a sense distinguished from sanctification. The scope and intendment, the Apostle is to exhort the Corinthians, being now Christians, to abstaine from those sinnes whereunto they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, whiles they lived in Gentilisme. Such you were then, saith the Apostle, but now since you gave your names to Christ, you were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his Name, and in your Baptisme were washed from those sinnes, being sanctified from the corruption of them by the Spirit of God, and iustified from the guilt of them in the Name of Iesus Christ, that is, by faith in his Name. Thus therefore these three words are to bee distinguished. The washing of the soule, which is represented by the washing of the body, is the generall word whereby the purging of the soule from sinne is generally signified, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16. But as in sinne there are two things from which we had need to be purged, that is, the guilt of sinne, and the corruption thereof: so this ablution or washing of the soule hath two parts, ablution from the guilt of sinne, which is our justification; ablution from the corruption of sinne, which is our sanctification. Both which are represented and sealed in the Sacrament of Baptisme, wherein, as the outward washing of the body doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the inward washing of the soule, both from the guilt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne: so the Element of water, whereby the body is washed or sprinckled, is a signe of the water and blood which issued out of Christs side, whereby the soule is washed; that is to say, the blood of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22501:52"/>
and the water of sanctification: for by the blood, that is, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, wee are freed from the guilt of sinne; and by the water, that is, the Spirit of sanctification, wee are freed in some measure from the corruption. And both these, as I said, are signified in Baptisme. For wee are baptized into the remission of sinnes, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 4.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 4.</note> Our soules being washed with the blood of Christ, according to that in the Nicene Creed, <hi>I beleeve one Baptisme for the remission of sinnes:</hi> and wee are baptized unto the mortification of sinne, and rising unto holinesse of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. our soules being washed by the water of the<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3, 4.</note> holy Ghost. For wee are baptized into the death of Christ and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his resurrection; that as Christ dyed and rose againe, so wee that are baptized should dye unto sinne, and rise to newnesse of life: for which cause Baptisme also is called the Laver of regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> 3. 5. This then is the summe and effect of the Apostles exhortation: that seeing they having given their names unto Christ, had been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into his Name, and were therefore Sacramentally at the least wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and consequently both in their owne profession and opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, judging according to charity, sanctified from the corruption of sinne, and justified from the guilt of the same: therefore they should take heed, lest they should againe bee polluted with those sinnes from which they were sanctified; or made guilty of those crimes, from which they were justified.</p>

It is God that justifieth, as was said, <hi>verse</hi> 30. who shall condemne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where justifying most plainely is used, as a judiciall word, signifying by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to justifie (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But heere it may bee objected, that in this place, where the Apostle setteth downe the degrees of salvation, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is either included in justification, or left our. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is left out: for the Apostle setting downe the chaine of the causes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the degrees whereof every former being the cause of the latter, left out sanctification, as being no cause of salvation, but the way unto it, and the cognizance of them that are saved. And these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are so set downe, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. where the end of the ministery is expressed: first, Vocation that men should bee called, and thereby brought to beleeve: secondly, Iustification, that by faith they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remission of sinnes: thirdly, Glorification, that by faith they may receive the inheritance among them that are sanctified: where sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is mentioned onely as the cognizance of them that are saved. Againe, sanctification is left out, because it is included, in respect of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22501:52"/>
the beginning thereof, which is our conversion or regeneration, in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and in respect of the consummation, in glorification: for as sanctification is <hi>gloria inchoata,</hi> so glorification is <hi>gratia consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata.</hi>

                  </gap> signifieth to cease: secondly, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> alwaies: fourthly, that those words, <hi>but the reward of the Lord endureth for ever,</hi> are found in the Originall Text. But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knew, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in due season and without delay, and not alwayes; and that the clause concerning the reward of the Lord is not in the Greeke Text; then can it not be denied, but that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> endevoured against his owne conscience to father his errour upon the Sonne of <hi>Sirach:</hi> howbeit the reason which he rendreth is Pharisaicall: For unto the first justification, saith he, of sinners, not reward, but indulgence agreeth, as though there were any reward of our righteousnesse, (which alwayes in this life is impure and imperfect, <hi>Esai.</hi> 64. 6.) but by indulgence. If thou Lord should'st marke what is amisse, O Lord, who shall stand? but with thee there is mercy or indulgence, that thou maist be feared, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3, 4.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22501:53"/>
great mercy that hee pardoneth the imperfection and iniquity of our good workes; greater, that he accepteth of them in Christ; but grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, that hee graciously rewardeth them: and who knoweth not that eternall life it selfe, which is the reward that endureth for ever, is the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</note> free and undeserved gift of God, not rendred to our merits, but given of his free grace.</p>
               <p>§ IV. His second testimony is, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.24. <hi>You see then that a man is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His second proofe out of <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>justified by workes, and not by faith onely. Answ.</hi> Of this place wee are hereafter to treat more fully. Now we are onely to cleare the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, which in this place most evidently signifieth, not to bee justified before God or made just, but to bee approved or declared just. In which sense the Schoolemen themselves doe teach, that good workes doe justifie <hi>declarativè.</hi> But here it may be objected, that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in this place speaketh of that justification whereunto faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth with good workes, and good workes with faith. But to declare a man to bee justified, faith being an inward and hidden grace of the heart, hath no use or efficacy; but it selfe is to be declared and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by workes, as it is <hi>verse</hi> 18. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle doth not speake<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.18.</note> of justifying faith it selfe, but of the profession thereof, or of saith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed onely, as appeareth by the fourteenth <hi>verse,</hi> where the question is propounded; <hi>What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man shall say hee hath faith, and have not workes, can that faith,</hi> which is in profession onely, <hi>save him?</hi> Now to the justification of a man before men, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him to bee a man justified before God, two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site; the profession of the true faith, and a godly conversation answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that profession. For neither good workss declare a man to bee justified, if they bee not joyned with the profession of the true faith: neither doth the profession of faith justifie a man before men, if his faith cannot bee demonstrated by good workes. And in this sense it is said, that a man is justified, that is, knowne to bee just by workes, and not by faith onely.</p>
               <p>§ V. His third testimony is, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Qui justus est justifice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur adhuc,</hi> hee that is just let him bee justified still. <hi>Answ.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this place doth not signifie to bee justified, but to be just, as the word is often used not onely in the translation of the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> but also in the new Testament, as I have shewed before, as being the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not of the passive, but of <hi>tsadaq</hi> the verbe <hi>neuter in Cal,</hi> which signifieth not to bee justified, but to bee just. And this exposition is confirmed, first, by the words going before; He that doth wrong let him doe wrong still, hee that is filthy let him bee filthy still; and so, hee that is just let him bee just still. Secondly, by the authority of the <hi>Complutensis editio,</hi> of the Kings Bible, of <hi>Andraeas Caesariensis,</hi> and of <hi>Arethas in Apoc.</hi> who instead of <gap reason="foreign">

Fourthly, saith he, <hi>It is taken for the declaration of justice after a judiciall manner, in which sense hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s said to be justified, who when he had beene by the accuser made guilty of some iniquity, is by the sentence of the Iudge declared iust and absolved.</hi> And to this purpose hee alleageth not onely <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. hee that justifieth the wicked and condemneth the just, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 23. But (which are not so pertinent) <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 35. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 29. Now, saith hee, of the foure acceptions of the word our adversaries teach this fourth to be most proper. As for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>econd, and the third which ariseth from the second, they say it is improper, and not to bee found in any approved Authors. But of this matter, saith hee, wee will discourse <hi>Libro</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. whether wee will follow him. In the meane time let it bee observed, that the Papists who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve their owne acceptions of the word by any one place of Scripture, doe neverthelesse acknowledge that use of the word which we doe maintaine. But whereas hee doth insinuate, that we doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reject the second and third significations, because the word is not so used in approved Authors: I answer, if hee speake of the Latine word (as hee doth) that it is not used of the Authors of the Latine tongue at all; and in the Latine edition of the Scriptures, and from thence in other Ecclesiasticall writers, it is used as the translation of the Hebrew and the Greeke, and must accordingly bee understood. And if of the Greeke, that it is not used indeed of the Authors of the Greeke tongue in the Popish sense. But that is not the reason why wee reject those senses, but because they are not to bee found in the holy Scriptures.</p>

Their first reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle opposeth <hi>justifying</hi> to condemning, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16. 18. 8. 33. Therefore as God is said to condemne, when he doth not acquit a man, but pronouncing him guilty deputeth him unto punishment: so on the contrary, he is said to justifie, when hee acquitteth and absolveth a man from guilt, and pronouncing him just accepteth of him in Christ as righteous unto eternall life. To this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shapeth two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres: first, <hi>That justification is rightly opposed to condemnation; but is not therefore alwayes a judiciall word: for even condemnation it selfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is the act of a Iudge appointing him to punishment, who in judgement was found guilty: and sometimes it is the effect of a fault, which hath deserved punishment. And so</hi> Adam <hi>hath condemned us, and God condemneth: but</hi> Adam <hi>hath not condemned us by judging us after a judiciall manner, but by imprinting in us Originall sinne. After the same manner,</hi> saith hee, <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sometimes is the act of a Iudge, sometimes the effect of grace. And both wayes doth Christ justifie us:</hi> first, <hi>as the second</hi> Adam <hi>by deletion of sinne, and infusion of grace:</hi> secondly, <hi>in the day of judgment by declaring them just, whom before he had made just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply:</hi> Iustification in this question, and in the places alleaged, is considered as an action of God, and being referred to God, it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not to make just by infusion of righteousnesse; but by sentence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of a Iudge, to absolve from sinne and to pronounce and accept as righteous, as being opposed to condemning, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to God, signifieth not to make sinfull, but by sentence after the manner of a Iudge to pronounce the offendour guilty, and to award him punishment. But what either justifying or condemning may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, being referred to other either persons or things, it is not materiall; so that it be confessed, (which cannot be denied) that justifying, being ascribed to God, signifieth not to make righteous by infusion, no more than condemning, being attributed to God, signifieth to make wicked
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:22501:55"/>
by infusion; but both are to bee understood as the actions of a judge, who either pronouncing a man just absolveth him from guilt; or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing him guilty appointeth him to punishment. This therefore was an impertinent shift of a subtle sophister having nothing to say to the purpose, for whereas he applyeth his distinction of condemning and justifying to the first and second <hi>Adam,</hi> as pertinent to the places alleaged: I answer, first, that neither is considered, as the act of the first or second <hi>Adam,</hi> but as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth in his second answer, as the actions of God the Iudge: secondly, that although in some sense the first <hi>Adam</hi> may bee said to have condemned us, as the second <hi>Adam</hi> is truely said, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53. 11. to justifie us: yet both is to bee understood of the guilt of sinne, brought upon us by the one, and taken away by the other. For as the first <hi>Adam</hi> by his transgression may be said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to have condemned us, because hee hath inwrapped us in the guilt of his sinne, and so made us guilty of death and obnoxious to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>entence of condemnation, that transgression of his being imputed us, being in him as the root: so the second <hi>Adam</hi> may truely be said to justifie us (who are in him) both as a surety in taking upon him our guilt, and paying our debt for us, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53. 11. and also as our intercessour and advocate pleading for us, that by imputation of his righteousnesse we may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from our sinnes, and accepted as righteous in him.</p>
               <p>§. III. His second answer is, that <hi>although condemnation and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>

                     </gap>claring him just, he doth also make him just, because the judgement of God is according to the truth. And therefore Christ, whether he justifieth us by his obedience, or by his judgement, he alwayes maketh just. And thus Augustine</hi> (saith he) <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood this place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply:</hi> That God maketh just, whom he pronounceth just, we freely confesse: but the question still is of the manner, for in justification when he pronounceth a man just, he maketh him just, and that perfectly just, not by infusion of inherent righteousnesse, but by imputation of Christs righteousnesse. And whom hee justifieth, that is, maketh just by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of righteousnesse; them hee also sanctifieth, that is, maketh just in some measure by infusion of grace. For to use <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne words, <hi>when God doth justifie a sinner by declaring him righteous,</hi> it is plaine, that in himselfe hee is a sinner, who by God is declared to bee just: and therefore, that hee is not justified by inherent justice, for in himselfe he is a sinner, as wee all are. How then shall the judgement of God bee according to the truth, when hee declareth a sinner to bee just? To a sinner beleeving in Christ, the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith is imputed for righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. and this we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> shew to be an argument unanswerable.</p>
               <p>None, remaining sinners in themselves, can truely bee declared or pronounced just in respect of righteousnesse inherent.</p>
               <p>All mortall men, even the most righteous of them, meraine sinners<note place="margin">1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 7. 20.</note> in themselves, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Ecclus</hi> 7. 20. Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:22501:56"/>No mortall man can truly be declared or pronounced just in respect of inherent righteousnesse, and consequently none are or can bee justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by righteousnesse inherent.</p>
               <p>§ IIII. The testimony of <hi>Augustine</hi> is falsified. For disputing<note place="margin">Augustine <hi>de peccatorum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis &amp; remis. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> against the errour of the Pelagians, who imagined that originall sinne was not propagated from <hi>Adam,</hi> but that imitation onely maketh sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by <hi>Adam:</hi> hee inferreth, that then by the same reason onely imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation maketh just by Christ. As though either <hi>Adam</hi> had done no more against us, or Christ for us, than that they had been prime exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and precedents, the one of sinne, the other of righteousnesse. But <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that as those who are regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, obtaine remission of sinnes and inward grace: so those who come from <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall generation, are made guilty of his sinne unto condemnation, and also receive corruption from him by propagation, all which we teach. But that <hi>Augustine</hi> pleadeth not for justification by inherent justice, appeareth by the <hi>antithesis,</hi> which in that place hee maketh betwixt our condemnation by <hi>Adam,</hi> and our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Christ. First, that whereas to condemnation there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres<note place="margin">Non tamen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua justitia propter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, sicut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua peccata propter Adam.</note> our owne voluntary transgression besides <hi>Adams</hi> sinne: yet to our justification there doth not concurre any righteoufnesse besides Christ. Secondly, (which difference Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also noteth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 16) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the carnall generation originall sinne onely is contracted; but in the spirituall regeneration there is remission not onely of originall, but also of voluntary sinnes.</p>
               <p>§ V. The second reason of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The second reason of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius,</hi> that as the Hebrew, so the Greeke signifieth.</note> taketh upon him to confute, is this, because the Apostle writing of justification did, no doubt, imitate the Hebrew phrase, though he wrote in Greeke. But the Hebrew word signifying to justifie, hath the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all signification. The argument may thus be propounded.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Such as is the signification of the Hebrew <hi>hitsdiq</hi> in the old Testament, the same is the signification of the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> both in the edition of the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> as being the translation thereof, and in the new Testament, which in this point retaineth the translation of the <hi>Septuagints:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Hebrew <hi>hitsdiq</hi> is meerely a judiciall word, opposed to condemnation, as I have proved heretofore by induction of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 1. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 32. 8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>Esai</hi> 5. 23. and never signifieth to make righteous by infusion, or to endue with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse inherent:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Greeke word also hath the same signification.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To the assumption <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that <hi>the Hebrew word proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifieth to make just, but because a man may bee made just, both inwardly by obtaining of justice, and outwardly by declaration; hence it is, that the word admitteth these divers significations. Reply.</hi> In this answer we are to take his confession of the truth, both that we may be made just outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by declaration, and also that the Verbe sometimes doth signifie so much. In vaine therefore doe the Papists urge against us the signification
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22501:56"/>
of the Latine word <hi>justificare,</hi> as signifying <hi>justum facere.</hi> seeing by our exposition it signifieth <hi>justum facere</hi> also, not onely by declaration, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> heere speaketh, but much more by imputation. But though he confesseth the signification of the Verbe urged by us: yet wee may not acknowledge the signification so much urged by the Papists: yea wee confidently deny, that the Hebrew <hi>hitsdiq</hi> doth any where in the Scriptures signifie to endùe with righteousnesse inherent.</p>
               <p>§ VI. This therefore hee endevoureth to prove by induction of<note place="margin">

Yea, but <hi>it disproveth,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine, the judiciall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification so much urged by you. For Teachers doe not justifie after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But this is nothing but a cavill. For where wee say, that to justifie, in this doctrine of justification, is <hi>verbum forense,</hi> a word taken from Courts, having a judiciall signification, as namely to absolve from sinne, or to give sentence with a man after the maner of a Iudge: our meaning is, that this word being attributed to God, as it is God alone that justifieth, (and so wee consider justification as an action of God) it alwaies hath this judiciall signification, and never signifieth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due with righteousnesse inherent. But wee doe not say, that it being attributed to any other, as it is to divers others both per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ons and things, it is to bee expounded as the act of the Iudge; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the justice implyed in the signification of the word, bee after the judiciall sense, not inherent, but imputative. Thus (as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Christ justifieth, not onely as hee is our Iudge, but also as our Surety paying our debt, and as our Advocate pleading for us. The holy Ghost justifieth, both as he is the Spirit of regeneration working in us the grace of faith; and as the Spirit of adoption, by applying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the merits of Christ, assuring us of our justification and adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Ministers of the Gospell justifie (as they are also said to forgive sinnes, to beget men unto God, and to save them) ministerially, as the Embassadours of Christ, whose office it is to reconcile men unto God, to preach and to pronounce remission of sinnes to them that beleeve, and also instrumentally, as the instruments of the holy Ghost, to worke in them the grace of faith, by which they are justified: for faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 17. and Preachers are said to bee Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by whom you beleeve, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.

                  <hi>Chemnitius</hi> saith, Whereas <hi>Andradius</hi> (saith he) wresteth that sentence of <hi>Esay</hi> to prove, that to justifie is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the minde with the quality of inherent justice, it is great impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for there is presently added an exposition, how that justification is to be understood, because he shall, saith <hi>Esay,</hi> beare their iniquities: where <hi>Chemnitius</hi> doth not so much as mention the judiciall signification of the word, justifying, after the manner of a Iudge, but rather signifieth, that Christ at his first comming, did not justifie the Elect after the manner of a Iudge, but as a surety in taking upon himselfe our debt and bearing our iniquities, and as a Redeemer paying our ransome, and so di charging us from our debt and from our bondage. Neither doth it follow, that it is not a judiciall word, because in that place it signifieth not to justifie as a Iudge, for besides the Iudge there are other parties also who doe justifie in a judiciall sense, as namely sureties and advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</p>

                  <hi>that Christ doth justifie not onely by teaching, but also by just working, and by imparting his righteousnesse unto us.

To what purpose then doth he urge this word, seeing Christ is just in justifying us, as well by imputation, as by infusion? Forsooth, to shew, that Christ by his obedience and sufferings doth not justifie after the manner of a Iudge: which no man affirmeth. But what is his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? because it is not required to justifying after a judiciall manner, that he, who justifieth others, should himselfe be just: as if he should say, it is not required that a Iudge should bee just: contrary to that <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25. But God doth justifie us after the judiciall manner, as a Iudge, through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus, and by forgivenesse of sinnes, and that to this end to shew forth his justice that hee might bee just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the justifier of him who beleeveth in Iesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. But this might better have beene objected against his owne exposition of the former word; seeing he, who is not just himselfe, may by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine justifie others. Notwithstanding, that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here áffirmeth concerning Christ, is most true: that it was necessary, that he who should justifie others by his obedience should bee just himselfe: howbeit he impertinently alleageth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. which speaketh of God justifying us, not as a Mediator by his obedience, but as a Iudge by his sentence. But the true reason, why the Prophet useth this word, is in respect of the words following, to signifie that Iesus Christ the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous was made a propitiation for our sinnes, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 2. and that Christ, who was just and knew no sinne, was made sinne for us, that wee might bee the righteousnesse of God in him, as the Apostle speaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and <hi>Esai.</hi> 53. 5, 6, 6.</p>

                  </gap>ter the manner of a Iudge, is true. But his reasons are not sufficient. Not the former, for he might bee Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister or servant, as all Kings or Iudges are, and yet our Iudge. Not the second; for although he were our Priest to offer himselfe for us, and by his obedience and sufferings to justifie us; yet is he also our King and our Iudge, who by his sentence will justifie us at the last day. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ did not justifie us after the manner of a Iudge: yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not either that the word doth signifie infusion of justice, to which purpose <hi>Andradius</hi> alleaged this place, or that it is not a judiciall word. For it is a judicial word as it is attributed not only to Iudges, but also to sureties and advocates. Christ, as our Advocate, justifieth by pleading for us as asurety, by bearing the punishment judicially imposed upon us. And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would prove out of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. that inherent righteousnesse is an effect of Christs satisfaction, or bearing our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he proveth nothing but what we teach, <hi>viz.</hi> that the fruits and end of our justification and redemption by Christ is our sanctification, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74, 75. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.

               <p>§. II. The third and fourth reason, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleageth out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and answereth them together, are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the signification and composition of the Latine word <hi>justificare:</hi> which indeed are not used as arguments to prove the true signification of the word in this controversie, but as just exceptions against the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Papists, who rely too much upon the signification and composition of the Latine word: wherein they were justly reprooved by <hi>Chemnitius;</hi> first, because the controversie being, what is the use and signification of the word in the Scriptures, it is not materiall, what the Latine word doth signifie in other authors; but what is the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Hebrew word in the Old Testament, and of the Greeke in the New, whereof the Latine is meerely a Translation. And therefore the Latine, if it be a right Translation, must in this controversie bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:22501:58"/>
to signifie the selfe same thing with the Hebrew and the Greeke: the use and signification whereof in the Scriptures is judiciall, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer used in the Popish sense: wherefore though the use of the word in other authors did favour the Popish conceipt, yet would it not disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage us: secondly, though the Latine words do signific to make just, (which is all that can be enforced from the signification and compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof) and be so expounded by <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to that purpose alleageth, yet this maketh nothing against us. Not onely because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath confessed, men may be made just, either inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by obtaining of righteousnesse inherent, or outwardly after a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner; but also because we freely professe that whom God doth justifie, he maketh righteous by imputation of Christs righteousnesse. It is true indeed, that some of our Divines deny the word to signifie making righteous: but their deniall is to be understood according to the meaning of the Papists, <hi>viz.</hi> by infusion: thirdly, the Latine word <hi>justificare,</hi> and so the English, as in the translation of the Scriptures it hath alwayes the judiciall signification, and never signifieth to endue with righteousnesse inherent, no more than the Hebrew and the Greeke whereof it is a translation: so oftentimes in the Fathers, and many times in the Popish writers, and alwayes almost in the common use of speech, it signifieth to cleare from guilt, to free from imputation of fault, to approve, to declare, or pronounce just. Or if at any time it be used in the sense of induing with righteousnesse inherent, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the use of the Scriptures, which in the doctrine of justification is to be retained.</p>
               <p>§. XII. Yea, but the <hi>Fathers interpret justifying to be making righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The use of the word in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
                  <hi>whom to refuse in an ecclesiasticall question, and to appeale to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Latine authors as</hi> Tully <hi>and</hi> Terence, <hi>is a great importunity,</hi> saith Bellarmine, <hi>especially seeing the Apostle hath taught, that to be justified, is to be constituted or made just, according to the composition of the word. Answ.</hi> That which is said of the Authors of the Latine tongue is a meere calumniation, for in them the word is not used at all. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Fathers, according to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wee approve; acknowledging, that whom God doth justifie, hee maketh them just, by imputation of Christs righteousnesse. Yea but, say they, the Fathers meane by inherent justice. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though some of the Latine Fathers, who were ignorant of the Hebrew, and not skilfull in the Greeke, sometimes under the terme of justification include the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit also of sanctification, being led thereunto by the notation of the Latine word; yet sometimes they exclude it; as first, when they place justification in remission of sinnes, as many times they doe: secondly, when according to the Scriptures they oppose it to condemnation: thirdly, and especially, when with one consent they plainely teach, that we are justified by faith alone, as hereafter shall be shewed: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of justification by inherent righteousnesse. For it were very absurd to affirme (which the Papists would faine father upon us) that to justification by inherent righteousnesse nothing is required
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:22501:59"/>
but faith only. Againe, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objecteth, which in the ninth <hi>Chapter</hi> (where he confesseth justification to be often taken in the Scriptures for declaration of righteousnesse) he more plainely expresseth, <hi>although to justifie were every where taken for to pronounce just, yet that were no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us. For a sinner cannot truely be pronounced just, unlesse he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth him just, doe withall make him just, which God onely can doe. And therefore hee alone is said to justifie a sinner, and by absolving him to make him truely just. Answere.</hi> Whom God pronounceth just, them hee maketh just: but still the question is of the manner: for to justifie by absolving, is to make righteous by the not imputing of sinne, and imputing of righteousnesse, and not by infusion of righteousnesse: for that is not to justifie, but to sanctifie. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it wee freely confesse, that whom God justifieth, hee also sanctifieth, and that whosoever is in CHRIST IESVS, hee is a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But howsoever these graces doe alwayes concurre, insomuch that whosoever hath the one hath the other, and whosoever hath not both, hath neither: yet notwithstanding they must carefully bee distinguished. And that is it which hitherto I have endevoured to prove.</p>

with sinne, which is to make unholy and uncleane.

And as condemning and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are by no meanes to bee confounded, no more can justifying and sanctifying.</p>
               <p>§. II. In justification wee are freed from the guilt of sinne: in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, from the corruption or pollution of sinne. For God is then<note place="margin">Secondly, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from <list>

None of these actions doth worke a Reall change in the party, but importeth a new relation betweene God and them, as hath beene shewed.

The parts of sanctification are mortification, whereby wee dye unto sinne, and vivification whereby wee live unto righteousnesse, rising from the grave of sinne, unto newnesse of life; and is therefore called the first resurrection; both wrought in us by the Spirit of sanctification.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Wee are justified by faith, not as it is a grace or habit in<note place="margin">Eightly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of faith.</note> us, that is to say, as it is a part of inherent righteousnesse: but as the hand or instrument receiving the righteousnesse of Christ, which is imputed to them that beleeve: but wee are sanctified by faith, as it is a part of that righteousnesse, which is inherent in us. And therefore wee are justified by faith alone, because no other grace doth concurre with it to the act of justification, none of them serving to receive the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ, but faith onely: but we are not sanctified by faith alone, because with it concurre not onely all other inward graces, but also our outward obedience.</p>
               <p>§. IX. The righteousnesse, by which wee are justified, is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Law, but without<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3. 31.</note> the Law is revealed in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Ninthly, in respect of the Law.</note> the righteousnesse of God, that is to say, of Christ, who is God, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith. For the Law to justification requireth perfect and perpetuall obedience to bee performed by him in his owne person, that should bee justified thereby; which fince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath beene, and is by reason of the flesh impossible to all men, who are descended from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary generation. But the Gospell assureth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication without respect of workes to all that truely beleeve in Christ, teaching that wee are justified by faith, that is, by the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith, without the workes of the Law, that is, without respect of any obedience prescribed in the Law and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by us. But the righteousnesse, by which wee are sanctified, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Law, which is a most perfect rule of all righteousnesse inherent.</p>
               <p>§. X.

But will needs understand justification to be that, which wee, according to the Scriptures, call sanctification. And this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground, both of their malitious calumniations against us; and also of their owne damnable errours concerning justification. For as if we also did confound justification and sanctification, they charge us, as if wee taught that wee are sanctified by faith alone, that wee are formally made just or sanctified by a righteousnesse, which is without us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if wee did hold, that justification were to bee confounded with sanctification, we would acknowledge, that the most things, which the Papists affirme concerning justification, are true, because they are true of sanctification. As namely that wee are not sanctified by faith alone, that we are sanctified by a righteousnesse inherent in us and performed by us; that it is partly habituall, consisting in the habits of grace, as faith, hope, charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and partly actuall, which is our new obedience consisting in good workes; which are the fruits and effects of our faith, and charity, and other inward graces. That of sanctification there are degrees, and that by exercise and practice of the duties of holinesse and righteousnesse, our sanctification is encreased, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. XX. What then? Is the difference betweene us and the Papists<note place="margin">It is also the source of their errours, which are most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.</note> in this great controvefie onely in words? Nothing lesse. For as their confounding of justification and sanctification is the ground of their calumniations against us, so of their owne errours. For confounding justification and sanctification, first they confound the Law and the<note place="margin">First, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, and are farther from grace.</note> Gospell, the covenant of workes and the covenant of grace; as if the Gospell did unto justification require inherent, and that a more perfect righteousnesse, than the Law requireth. And consequently, with the false Apostles and teachers of the Galatians, doe teach another<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> Gospell than that which the Apostle taught; which, whosoever doth, hee is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed. Whrefore the samethings, which the Apostle objecteth against the Galatians, who were seduced by their false Teachers, are verified of the Papists: who seekng to be justified by the workes of the<note n="o" place="margin">G l 310.</note> Law are under the curse: they are fallen<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 5. 2, 4.</note> from grace, to them the promise is of no effect, to them Christ dyed in vaine, then Christ profiteth nothing, as hereafter I shall shew. For whosoever seeketh to bee justified by the workes of the Law, hee is a<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> debtour to the whole Law, and to him, who is a debtour to the whole Law, (that is, to bee subject to the curse, if he transgresse it, and to be excluded from justification and salvation, if he doe not perfectly fulfill it) Christ profiteth nothing. For whereas they distinguish the workes, which they make the condition of both the Covenants, that the one are the workes of Nature, the other of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:22501:61"/>
grace; it is evident, that all good workes and all inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is prescribed in the Law, which is the most perfect rule of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse. Secondly, that inherent righteousnesse is not the condition of the covenant of grace, but is the thing promised to all that truely beleeve. For the better understanding whereof, wee are to know, that the covenant of workes was made with all mankinde in <hi>Adam;</hi> the Covenant of Grace with the heires of promise in Christ. The former promiseth justification to these, who in their owne persons performe perfect obedience; that perfect obedience being the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant. The latter, that to us the sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> being redeemed and justified by faith, the Lord will give grace<note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75.</note> to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him, in which our<note place="margin">

                  </note> himselfe confessed, when he thanked God for it. But the holy Ghost doth teach us, that wee are neither justified by the obedience or righteousnesse which is taught<note n="t" place="margin">

And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this very difference betwixt the Papists and us, wee are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily called <hi>Evangelici</hi> the professors of the Gospell; and they, the enemies thereof: who seeking to establish their owne righteousnesse, doe with scorne reject the righteousnesse of Christ imputed: which is that righteousnesse of God<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 16. 17.</note> revealed in the Gospell from faith to faith. This being the maine doctrine of the Gospell, that we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves, or performed by our selves, but by the righteousnesse of Christ alone apprehended by faith.</p>

Whereunto I answere, that indeed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists pretend so much. For the Councell<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> of Trent in expresse termes saith, that justification is not remission of sins alone, but also sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renovation of the inner man: and to the like purpose <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Iustis. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> disputeth, that justification doth not consist in the remission of sinnes alone, but also in inward renovation. And yet all this is but a meere colourable pretence: For as they exclude from justification the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, by which onely wee have remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne: so they doe indeed and in truth exclude remission it selfe. And as in stead of imputation of righteousnesse they have brought in infusion of justice: so in stead of remission of sinne by imputation of Christs righteousnesse, they have brought in the utter expulsion, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse. And for this they have some shew of reason: For if they should hold, that justification consisteth partly in remission, that is, in the forgivenesse, or not imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne, and partly in renovation or sanctification; then they must confesse, that there are two formall causes of justification, which <hi>Calvin</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Antidot. ad Sess. 6.</note> objected against the Councell of Trent, (and may truly bee objected against such of the Fathers as held justification to consist, partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and partly in renovation) and consequently should bee forced to acknowledge two wayes of making men just, by one and the same act of justification: the one, by imputation of that righteousnesse, by which being without us we have remission of sinne; the other, by infusion of righteousnesse inherent, by which sinne is expelled. But the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent doth stedfastly hold, that there is but one formall cause of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:22501:62"/>
justification, and that is infusion of justice, whereby sinne is expelled. What then becometh of remission of sinne, which according both to Scriptures and Fathers concurreth to justification? I say of it, as of justification; the name is retained, but the thing is taken away.</p>
               <p>§. II. Heere therefore I am to shew two things; first, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists<note place="margin">The Papists from justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exclude remission of sinne.</note> from justification exclude remission of sinne, by putting into the roome thereof the expulsion and extinction of sinne, which belongeth not to justification, but to sanctification, and consequently doe wholly abolish by their doctrine the benefit of justification. Secondly, that remission of sinne is not the utter extinction or deletion thereof. As touching the former, when <hi>Calvin</hi> objected against the Councell of Trent, that it made two formall causes of justification:<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justif. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth thus, the Councell of Trent in expresse termes said, that there is but one onely formall cause of justification. Yea but, say wee, the Councell seemeth to make two, <hi>viz.</hi> remission of sinnes and renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, saith he, <hi>when the Councell maketh mention severally of remission of sin, and of infusion of grace, it did it not to signifie, that there is a twofold for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cause of justification; but to declare, that there are two termes of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is called justification, or two effects of the same cause. For there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee that mutation or translation, which the Councell noteth to bee in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, unlesse by remission of sinne a man cease to bee wicked, and by infusion of justice begin to be godly. But,</hi> saith hee, <hi>as the aire, when it is enlightened of the Sunne, by the same light, which it receiveth, ceaseth to bee darke, and beginneth to be lightsome. So a man by the same justice given and infused by the Sunne of righteousnesse ceaseth to bee unjust, the light of grace expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the darknesse of sinne;</hi> and beginneth to bee just, the light of grace succeeding the darkenesse of sinne. <hi>And as in calefaction,</hi> which simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude hee useth elsewhere, <hi>the accesse of heat expelleth cold; so in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the infusion of justice expelleth sinne.</hi> This then is the doctrine of the new Church of Rome; that in this mutation called justification which they define to bee<note n="e" place="margin">Transitus a peccato ad justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> 
                  <hi>a passage from sinne to righteousnesse;</hi> though there be, as in all other motions, <hi>duo termini, viz.</hi> sinne, which is <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus à quo,</hi> and righteousnesse, which is <hi>terminus ad quem;</hi> yet there are not two distinct actions concurring, <hi>viz.</hi> remission or expulsion of sinne, and infusion of righteousnesse; but one and the same action, which is the infusion of justice expelling sinne, even as in calefaction, though there bee two termes cold and hot, yet there are not two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the same action of fire which bringeth in heat, expelleth cold; and so in illumination, there are two termes, darkenesse and light, but not two actions; for one and the same act of the Sunne, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth light, driveth away darkenesse. Whereby it is evident, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne the Papists doe not understand, as all men from the beginning of the world have understood, pardoning, forgiving, not imputing sinne; but the utter deletion, expulsion, abolition of it: which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justif Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>veram remissionem,</hi> true remission, as if the pardoning of the offence and taking away the guilt were not true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:<note place="margin">§. secundò.</note> but this true remission they hold to bee such, that in a man
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:22501:63"/>
who is justified, and hath remission of sinne, there is no sinne remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hee onely is to bee held a just man, in whom there is no sinne. Thus then remission of sinne is by the Papists excluded from justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that brought in the roome of it, which belongeth to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of sanctification, whereunto none attaine in this life.</p>
               <p>§. III. Now, that the Papists grossely erre in making remission of<note place="margin">That remission of sinne is not the extinction of it.</note> sinne to bee the utter abolition or expulsion of it by infusion of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, may appeare by these arguments: First, whereas in sinne there are two things to bee considered, the guilt and the corruption, or Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thereof; it is evident, that the guilt of sinnes past is taken away by remission wholly and at once: the corruption is taken away by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof, not wholly in this life, and at once, but by degrees, we being day by day <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 19.</note> renewed in the inner man. The latter is the worke of Gods Spirit within us. The former is an action of God without us, such as is that of the Creditor in remitting or forgiving a debt. And so the Scriptures conceive of remission. For our sinnes are debts in respect of the guilt binding us over to punishment, which wee owe for them. When as God therefore remitteth the debt, releaseth this obligation, forgiveth the punishment, hee is said, to remit our sinnes. This our Saviour taught by the parables of the creditors and debtors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 41. And thus he hath taught us to pray, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 12. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts, as wee forgive our debtors. How doe wee forgive? By not revenging the offence, but laying aside all desire and purpose of revenge, by passing by it, and as it were forgetting it, by covering it with <note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 10. 12.</note> charity, by not imputing it, by being reconciled unto the party who hath offended us; not by a reall taking away of the sinne from the offender, but a wiping of it out of our remembrance; not by expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the offence out of the offender, but out of our thoughts.</p>
               <p>§. IV. Thus in the Scriptures, to remit sinne is not to abolish and<note place="margin">To remit, what it is in the Scriptures. See more <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.</note> extinguish the sinne it selfe, but to absolve from the guilt of sinne, to pardon and to forgive the debt, and to remit the punishment, to cover a mans sinne and not to impute it. And this plainely appeareth by these manifold phrases which are used in the Scriptures to signifie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne, all which import the taking away of the guilt, but none the utter abolishing of the corruption. As first the Hebrew <hi>Salach, Exod.</hi> 34. 9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 19, 20. 30. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 3. <hi>Esay</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 20. signifieth <hi>parcere, remittere, ignoscere, condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, propitium esse.

               <p>§. V. For the farther clearing of this point, let us consider these three things; first, what that is which is remitted. Secondly, where it<note place="margin">Three other arguments.</note> remaineth untill it bee remitted. Thirdly, by what act of God it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The thing remitted is our debt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 12. The subject where it remaineth are the bookes of Gods providence and of our own consciences. The act of God in remitting our debts is the wiping them out of his remembrance, as it were, his debt-bookes The debt is the sinne it selfe, which maketh us debtors unto God. And therefore sinnes<note place="margin">First, the debt.</note> are called debts, and sinners debtors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>cum Luk.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 16, 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>cum</hi> 2. which also appeareth by the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the debtors, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 23, 35. and therefore sinners are called debtors, because for their sinnes they owe punishment, unto which by the just ordination of God they are obliged. This obligation, whereby sinners are bound over to punishment, is called <hi>reatus,</hi> that is, guilt. When as therefore God remitteth sins, he forgiveth the debt, hee remitteth or releaseth the punishment, hee taketh away the guilt, whereby we were bound over to punishment. And <hi>è converso,</hi> when God forgiveth the debt, releaseth the punishment, taketh away the guilt, he is said to remit sinne. Now sinnes are either habituall or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: An habituall sinne God doth remit, when hee doth take away the guilt of it, <note n="i" place="margin">Psalm. 32. 2.</note> and cover the Anomy of it, not that it should not be at all, but that it should not bee imputed, as <hi>Augustine</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">De Nupt. &amp;</note> saith of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence or originall sinne, whereof all particular habituall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. VI. But here the Papists have found out a new devise, to confirme their error in confounding justification and sanctification; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">Whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission be of the <hi>macula.</hi>
                  </note> there are two things, which as themselves doe teach, <note n="n" place="margin">

But then say I, what becometh of the punishment, &amp; the guilt binding over to punishment? It is certaine, that the infusion of righteousnesse doth not take away the guilt, nor free us from punishment. Neither can we be freed either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rom the one or the other, but only by the satisfaction of Christ imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. Hence therfore they should have learned to distinguish between justification and sanctification, rather than to confound them, that whereas there are two things remaining after sinne committed, the guilt, and the pollution; the guilt is taken away by imputation of Christs righteousnesse in our justification; the pollution is in some
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:22501:64"/>
measure cleansed in our sanctification.</p>

Insomuch as where the same actuall sinne is often committed and reiterated, that evill disposition groweth to bee an habit. For all evill dispositions or habituall sinnes, which are in men, are either the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquia</hi> or remnants of originall sinne in some measure mortified, or the increments thereof, when by the committing of actuall sinnes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive increase. And such a thing is that <hi>macula,</hi> whereof they speake: which remaining in the soule <hi>per modum habitus,</hi> is to bee taken away, as all other habituall sinnes are, as they are pollutions, by the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note n="p" place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> of them; which is a part of sanctification and not of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither is the mortification of sinne a totall deletion or aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof in this life, as if no sinne or corruption remained in the party justified or sanctified: for though in the forgiving or remitting of originall sinne, the guilt bee wholly taken away; yet the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is called concupiscence, remaineth more or lesse mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Now followeth the subject, where that, which is to bee<note place="margin">The booke out of which God doth wipe our sinnes, when he doth remit them.</note> remitted, doth remaine; and from whence, when it is remitted, it is wiped or blotted out, that is, Gods remembrance and our conscience, which are as it were the Lords debt-bookes, according to which bookes he will judge, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 12. the former is the booke of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 56. 8. 139. 15. wherein all offences are written, and wherein they remaine upon record, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 2. 8. 13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1. The other is the booke of our conscience, which is, as it were, the Lords at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney indicting us of sinne. In regard whereof <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 51. 3. I doe know, or am conscious to my transgressions, and my sinne is ever before mee. Out of the former booke the Lord doth wipe out sinnes, when he justifieth us in the Court of Heaven: out of the latter, when we are justified in the Court of our owne Conscience.</p>
               <p>§. IX. And hereby the third thing appeareth: namely, by what<note place="margin">By what Act of God our sinnes are remitted.</note> act of God our sinnes are remitted. For if that which is remitted be a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:22501:64"/>
debt, which is recorded in Gods booke: then this debt is remitted not by any act of God within us, either really wiping the pollution out of our soules, or infusing grace into them (both which are done in some measure after the debt is remitted, in our sanctification) but by an act of God without us, wiping our sinnes out of his booke, blotting them out of his remembrance, <hi>Esai.</hi> 43. 25. casting them behinde his backe, <hi>Esai.</hi> 38. 17. turning his face from them, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 51. 9. not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34. nor imputing them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>ex Psal.</hi> 32. 2. but forgiving and forgetting them, and accepting of Christs satisfaction for them in the behalfe of all that truely beleeve in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>§. X. Our fifth argument may be this: The utter deletion of sinne<note place="margin">Our fifth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The proposition is certaine: For during this life sinne remaineth in the best, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. 20. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>The assumption is undeniable, as being an Article of our faith testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Or thus: If in justification there were an utter deletion or aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne, then in those, that are justified, there is no sinne.</p>
               <p>But there is no mortall man, though justified, in whom there is no sinne.</p>
               <p>Therefore in justification there is not a Totall deletion of sinne.</p>
               <p>§. XI. Sixthly, if remission of sin be an utter deletion of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Sixthly, the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in justification, are not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by infusion of righteousnesse.</note> by infusion of righteousnesse, and nothing else concurre to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but infusion of righteousnesse expelling sin; what then becommeth of the guilt of sinne and the punishment? how is our debt satisfied? The justice infused, though it should utterly expell the corruption; yet it neither doth nor can satisfie for the punishment, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth. Neither is there any other satisfaction or propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sinnes, whereby Gods justice may be satisfied, our debt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, our selves freed from hell and damnation, but onely the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Christ, without imputation whereof there is no justification nor salvation: but none of this is done by righteousnesse infused ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling sinne. Wherefore the Papists, if they will bee saved, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, besides the benefit of the infusion of righteousnesse expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the corruption of sinne, which they call justification, but is indeed sanctification, another greater benefit, whereby we are both freed from hell, and entituled to heaven, by imputation of Christs satisfaction, called in the Scriptures justification, which they by their Antichristian doctrine have utterly abolished.</p>
               <p>§. XII. Seventhly, that which worketh no reall change in the party<note place="margin">Seventhly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission doth not worke a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all change.</note> doth not really take away and expell all sin from him by infusion of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, for that cannot bee done without a reall, yea and a great change in the party. True remission of sinne doth not worke a reall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:22501:65"/>
change in the party. Therefore the true remission of sinne doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take away and expell all sinne by infusion of righteousnesse. The assumption is thus proved: first, the forgiving of a debt worketh no reall change in the debtor, but relative. The true remission of sinne is the forgiving of our debt, therefore the true remission doth not worke a reall change in the party. Secondly, that which is imputative doth not worke a reall change in the party but is an act wrought without the party. True remission of sinne is imputative, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. consisting in the not imputing of sinne, presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the imputing of righteousnesse without workes, therefore it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a reall change.</p>

For if remission of sinne bee the utter deletion of sinne, then have not they, neither can they have remission of sinne, in whom any sinne remaineth: and those, that neither have, nor can have remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne in this life, because sinne doth ever remaine in them, what remaineth to them but despaire? Secondly, that there is no necessity of the imputation of Christs righteousnesse for justification, because there is in them both a totall deletion of sinne, and an infusion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse, whereby sinne is wholly expelled.

The third, that to remission of sinne there needeth no favour or indulgence for pardon or forgivenesse: for if remission of sinne be a totall deletion of sinne by infusion of perfect righteousnesse, then without any accession of favour the one contrary is necessarily expelled by the other.

               <p>§. XIV. These absurdities doe necessarily follow upon their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse: For if a man be justified before God by inherent righteousnesse, then is he not a sinner in himselfe, and consequently hath no sinne in him. And if by infusion of righteousnesse there be a totall deletion of sinne, then must that righteousnesse, which is infused, be perfect. For that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect cannot wholly expell sinne, the imperfection being of it selfe a sinne; and if upon infusion of perfect righteousnesse there doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily and of its owne accord follow a totall deletion of sinne, then to remission of sinne favour and condonation is needlesse. And yet we have not done with their absurdities: For to dreame that men who
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:22501:65"/>
are but infants in Christianity, yea infants in age, before they have the use of reason, or are capable of habits, are endued. and that ordinarily, with perfect righteousnesse in their first imaginary justification, which is <hi>inciptentium</hi> of such as be but incipients, whereunto the best profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents doe not in this life attaine, is a monstrous absurdity.</p>

And therefore as it is the Sacrament of remission of sinne, and the seale <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> of that righteousnesse which is by faith: so it is called the Laver<note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> of regeneration, wherein we are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the similitude <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 6. 3, 4.</note> of Christ his death and resurrection. And therefore, though in Baptisme sinne were wholly taken away, as well in respect of the corruption, as of the guilt: yet it would not follow, that in justification there is a Totall deletion of sinne. But neither in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:22501:67"/>
is there a totall abolition of sin; seeing it is manifest, that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, which is called the flesh, the old man, and evill concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, remaineth in all the faithfull, though in some measure mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet never fully and altogether extinguished in this life.

A great accusation, if true. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> words in answere to an objection, (which the Papists can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer) how can originall sinne bee transmitted from regenerate parents, if in Baptisme it be wholly taken from them, are these: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, saith he, <hi>dimitti concupiscentiam in baptismo, non ut non sit, sed ut in peccatum non imputetur.</hi> Where <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking of the traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of originall sinne, calleth it (as his manner is) <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> in stead whereof, some of our Writers have said <hi>sinne,</hi> both <hi>Augustine</hi> and they meaning nothing else, but originall. Now, that <hi>Augustine</hi> by that which he calleth <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> meant sinne, hereby appeareth; first, he saith it is remitted in Baptisme, and remission is of debts onely, and of sinnes, as debts; secondly, because he saith it is remitted, not that it should not bee any longer, but that (though it be a sinne, yet) it should not be imputed unto sinne; for nothing is wont to be imputed unto sin by God, but that which is sinne. Where by the way wee may observe, that in <hi>Augustines</hi> judgement remission of sinne is not the utter deleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, that it bee no more, but the not imputing of it. For whereas the Papists for a poore shift and evasion say, that Concupiscence is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sinne, not because it is a sinne, <hi>sed quia expeccato est, &amp; ad peccatum inclinat;</hi> this hindereth not its being a sinne, but rather setteth forth the greatnesse of this evill, as having all the respects of evill in it: being both a sinne, and a punishment of sinne, and the cause of all other sinnes, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore through the obedience of Christ we are made truly righteous, namely by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse inherent. But here, to serve his present turne, he altereth both the assumption and the conclusion. The assumption; for where before he said, not onely by imputation, here he saith, not by imputation. The conclusion: for first, in stead of concluding, that wee are by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ made inherently just, which we confesse, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Apostle in that place; he concludeth, that the obedience of Christ hath truly taken away and wiped out or abolished all our sinnes. And secondly, that he hath taken away our sinnes <hi>non imputa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè, sed verè,</hi> not by imputation, but truly. His former argument I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted after this manner:</p>
               <p>As through <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience wee were made sinners, that is, guilty of death and damnation: so by Christs obedience wee are made just, that is, absolved from that guilt, and accepted as righteous unto eternall life.</p>
               <p>But by imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience we were made sinners.</p>
               <p>Therefore by imputation of Christs obedience wee are made righteous.</p>
               <p>The assumption, that we were made sinners by imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience, I proved, as by other arguments, so by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne confession in other places. Secondly, I have acknowledged it to bee true, that as we are made truely sinners through <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience, not onely by imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, but also by transfusion of both that privative and positive corruption, which by that disobedi- ence he contracted: so we are made truly just through the obedience of Christ, not onely by imputation of his obedience, but also by infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righteousnesse from him. But though we be truly made just by righteousnesse inherent yet it followeth not, that we are in this life made perfectly just. Neither doth it follow, that because Christ doth free us from the dominion of sin, we are therfore freed wholly from the being of sinne in us: neither, that if we be freed from sinne by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are not freed truly. For the Apostle useth these termes promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously, remitting of sinne and not imputing of sinne, justifying and imputing righteousnesse. And as Christ <note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>Thus have I proved, that neither remission of sinne is the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sinne, nor justification all one with sanctification: and that the Papists by confounding justification and sanctification, and of these two making but one, have utterly taken away and abolished out of their Divinity, that great benefit of our justification.</p>

But, that Grace doth signifie that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, wee are able out of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to alleage above fifty testimonies, whereof some shall hereafter be cited.

               <p>The proposition is in it solfe evident. The assumption is proved out of <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>id est, gratos fecit,</hi> hee hath made us accepted in his beloved, in whom wee have redemption through his blood even forgivenesse of sinnes, according to the riches of his grace, <hi>verse</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. 7.

us in his beloved. But it were very absurd to say, that God hath elected us to the praise of the glory of our Charity, or that wee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed according to the riches of our charity. But we were elected to the praise of the glory of his grace, that is, of his gracious love and bounty in Christ, which grace was given unto us in Christ before all secular<note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> times: and according to the riches of this grace he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us by Christ.

Therefore by the gracious favour of God in Christ, and not by any grace inherent in us, the Lord doth justifie us: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sacred fathers of Trent must take home to themselves (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the censure of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 9.) that Anathema, which they denounce against those, who say, that the grace whereby wee are justified is onely the gracions favour of God in Christ.</p>
               <p>§. V. Against the proposition if it bee objected, that the grace of<note place="margin">

For the same gracious favor of God is the efficient cause as wel of our sanctification, as of our justification; and I deny the assumption. But if by that phrase be meant the essentiall c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For wee are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the grace, that is, the gracious favour of God in Christ, <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. from faith.</note> but we are justified by faith. Or thus, faith doth justifie, faith is a grace inherent, therefore some grace inherent doth justifie. I answer againe, by distinction, that faith doth not justifie, as it is a grace or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity inherent, or as it is a part of our inherent righteousnesse; but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as it is the instrument, as hath beene said before, to receive Christ who is our righteousnesse: neither doth faith properly, but the object thereof, which it apprehendeth, justifie. As it is the almes properly, which releeveth the poore man, not the hand which receiveth it. For when we say that a man is justified by faith without workes, or by faith alone, our meaning is, that we are justified by the righteousnes of Christ alone, which is apprehended by faith onely, without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in us, or obedieuce performed by us.</p>

                  </gap> grace This grace of God is notably expressed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. 5. 7. 8. by divers words of the like signification.

So in the Old Testament, mercie and grace are used as words of the like signification. <hi>Exo.</hi> 33. 19. I will bee gracious to whom I will bee gracious, and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy; which text the Apostle rendreth thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15.

                     </gap> workes.</note> such opposition, as the Apostle maketh in the question of justification, betweene grace and workes; as that if wee bee justified by the one, wee cannot be justified by the other: but they might as well stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the first justification of the Papists, which is habituall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the habits of grace infused, with the second which is actuall consisting in works, or rather the one would infer the other: because we cannot be justified by the one, (I speak of <hi>adulti</hi>) without the other: for if wee bee justified by inherent righteousnesse, that righteousnesse must be totall and perfect, and therfore both habituall, and actuall, and both must concur unto justification: for neither without the other is perfect. <hi>Object.</hi> Yea, but the Apostle, when hee saith, that faith doth justifie without workes, hee speaketh of the first ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

But it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that by the workes of the Law is meant, all that obedience and righteousnesse, that is prescribed in the Law, which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse. And therefore, when the workes of the Law are rejected, all inherent righteousnesse is excluded from justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is also manifest, that the holy Ghost speaketh generally <note n="l" place="margin">

               <p>§. X. Sixthly, whereas the Papists say, that justifying grace is the same with charity, I argue thus:</p>
               <p>Charity is the fulfilling of the Law in our owne persons:</p>
               <p>But wee are not justified by our fulfilling of the Law in our owne persons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. 3. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are not justified by our charity, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not by grace inherent.</p>
               <p>§. XI. Seventhly, that the Apostle by grace in the articles of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. plaine testimonies where grace signifieth grace</note> and salvation understood the gracious favour of God in Christ and not inherent grace, appeareth both by his assention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:22501:73"/>
where sinne abounded, Gods grace did much more abound; and by his question, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. shall wee continue in sinne, that grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound? for it were a strange conceit, that where sinne aboundeth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse should abound so much the more. And to these we may adde those places which speake of going to the throne of grace that we may obtaine mercie and find grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. of the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindnesse towards us through Iesus Christ, for by grace we are saved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7. 8. of the grace of God, and the gift of grace distinguished one from the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. of those that beleeve by the grace of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 27. of commending men to the grace of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 26. 15. 40. of the word of his grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 3. 20. 32. of the Gospell of his grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24. of the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, who being rich became poore for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. of our predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the praise of the glory of his grace <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 6. of the election of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5. of the appearing of the grace of God which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. of Christ his tasting of death for us by the grace of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. of the reward not imputed of grace to him that worketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. of turning the grace of God into wantonnesse, <hi>Iud.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Whereunto we may adde, that those few places, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleageth for inherent grace, are by some of their owne writers understood of the gracious favour of God, as we shall shew in the particulars which now we are to examine.</p>

               </p>
               <p>§. II. And this is proved, first, by the context, or coherence of these words, with those which goe before. For thus the Apostle reasoneth:</p>
               <p>Those that bee in themselves sinners, and by their sinne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the judgement of God, are not justified by righteousnesse inherent, all which is prescribed in the Law; but of necessity must be justified by a righteousnesse, which without the Law is revealed in the Gospell, even the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God, that is, of Christ, who is God, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by faith.</p>
               <p>But all men, without exception, both Iewes and Gentiles are in themselves sinners, and by their sinne obnoxious to the judgement of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore, seeing all have sinned, and are fallen short of the glory of God, that is, excluded from eternall glory, they are not justified by righteousnesse inherent which is prescribed in the Law; but they are justified by a righteousnesse, which without the Law is revealed in the Gospel, to wit, the righteousnesse of God, that is, of Christ, who is God,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22501:74"/>
apprehended by faith. And that is it which is said in this text, that those who have sinned, and are fallen short of Gods glory, and from their title to heaven, are justified, that is, acquitted from their sinnes, and entituled unto the Kingdome of heaven, freely, without respect of any grace or righteousnesse in themselves, by the meere gracious favor of God, when they had deserved the contrary, through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus, whom God hath set forth to bee a propitiation through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteousnesse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose the Apostle disputeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. as hereafter wee shall heare.</p>

For by Christ wee have redemption, that is, remission of sinnes, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 14. and so <hi>Occumenius</hi> expoundeth these words <hi>by the redemption,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

So that this exclusive particle was inserted, not to set downe the true cause of justification, but to exclude the false: that we are justified freely without any cause in us, or desert of ours, or price paid by us, meerely by the grace of God, through the redemption which is in Iesus Christ.

               <p>§ III. His second reason: because <hi>the preposition</hi> per, <hi>when it is said,</hi> per gratiam, <hi>being not a note,</hi> as hee saith, <hi>of the efficient cause, is not rightly applied to the favour or good will of God, which is the efficient cause, but either to the formall cause, or to the meritorious cause, or to the instrument. For wee could not well say, that God doth justifie us</hi> per favorem aut per suam bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiam,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:22501:76"/>
                  <hi>by his favour or by his good will: but wee say well by grace inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> (though not very well by <hi>his</hi> grace inherent, for that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent is ours, though from him) <hi>by the merit of his sonne, by faith, by the sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I answere, that the preposition is not in the originall text, where the Apostle doth not say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as noting in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit the formall cause, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as noting the antecedent or moving cause, which is <hi>principium actionis,</hi> as is usuall in the like actions, which (the efficients working <hi>per se</hi>) are done <hi>naturâ, arte, consilio</hi> or <hi>voluntate, &amp;c.</hi> in which wee doe not say, <hi>per naturam, per artem, &amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this objection is very frivolous. Secondly, I answer, that <hi>per</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greeke, are very often applyed to the efficient cause: whereof, even in the New Testament, there are, as I suppose, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples than there bee leaves: whereof some are attributed to God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21. to the Sonne, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. And to omit other examples, which are innumerable, to the attributes of God, which are the prime motive causes of all his actions: as by the will of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 32. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. by the grace of Iesus Christ wee shall bee saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11. who beleeved by Grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 27. called by his grace, <hi>Galath.</hi> 1. 15. by the tender mercies of our God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 78.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justif. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> place denying the preposition <hi>per</hi> to be rightly applied to the efficient cause, I oppose <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

               <p>His third argument. <hi>The good will of God cannot bee in vaine, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes performeth and worketh that good, which hee willeth to any. For whatsoever he willeth that he doth, Psal.</hi> 115. 3, &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> All this is true in respect of his will decreeing any thing, which is absolute,<note n="i" place="margin">Esa. 46. 10.</note> and is called <hi>voluntas beneplaciti;</hi> but not in respect of his will prescribing or requiring any thing, which is conditionall, and is called <hi>voluntas signi:</hi> of which will the Apostle speaketh in the place cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 1 <hi>Th.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>This is the wil of God even your sanctification.</hi> Otherwise, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument all men should bee holy, <hi>because,</hi> as hee saith, <hi>God would have them truely just and holy. Therfore,</hi> saith he, <hi>if justifying grace be the favour and goodwill of God, and God doth not favour nor wish well in vaine, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us holy, and blamelesse, such as he would have us to bee, then it followeth, that to be justified by grace, is not onely to bee reputed just, and not to bee so, but to be truly just, holy, and blamelesse. Answ.</hi> This argument doth not prove the particular point, for which it is brought, namely, that by grace is meant grace inherent, and not the gracious favour of God. But if it were ought worth, it would serve to prove the maine question: that although grace did signifie the favour of God, when it is said, that wee are justified by his grace: yet this place would prove, that wee are also made just by grace inherent. For whom the Lord favoureth and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well unto, his benevolence is not in vaine to him: but to whom hee
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:22501:77"/>
willeth good hee worketh it, making them truely just and holy, whom by his grace hee justifieth. For hee hath elected us that wee might bee holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. and this is his will, our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All this wee freely confesse, that whom God justifieth, he maketh just; first, by imputation, and truly and perfectly, as hee justifieth: secondly, by infusion, as hee sanctifieth. But the Papists must at length learne to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt justification and sanctification. For as wee have said before, wee are justified by grace, as it signifieth the gracious favour of God onely: but wee are sanctified not onely by his gracious favour as the efficient, but also by his graces infused and inherent in us, as the matter.<note place="margin">His fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, from the attributes given to Grace.</note>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:22501:80"/>
of God which he sheddeth abroad in our hearts and sealeth unto us, as the ground whereupon our sound hope, which never maketh asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is founded, is Gods eternall and immutable love; from the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof sealed unto us by the Holy Ghost our assured hope doth flow. And therefore if we speake, as the Apostle here doth, of such a love of God, as is both the Object of our faith, and the ground of our hope: we must say with Saint <note n="k" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Sonne to be the propitiation for our sinnes. For that is it, whereby especially God hath commended this his love towards us, as it is here said, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> also saith in the same place, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 9. In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because God sent his onely begotten Sonne into the world, that we might live through him. As for us, wee love God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loved us first, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 19. For when we are by the holy Ghost shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts perswaded of Gods love towards us in Christ; then, and never till then our hearts are inflamed to love God againe, and our neighbour for Gods sake. But why is this love of God said to be shed forth in our hearts? (for this some doe urge.) I answere, either in respect of the knowledge and assurance thereof wrought in us by the holy Ghost, as I have said (for therefore the holy Ghost is given unto us, that we might know <note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And in these three the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace consisteth, <hi>viz.</hi> in righteousnesse, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. And this joy the Apostle amplifieth, because we glory and rejoyce in hope of glory, not onely when all things goe with us according to our minds, but also in affliction and tribulation.

Can wee have it by the bare assent of faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out application or desire thereof, which is the onely faith which the Papists acknowledge? Can wee have it by our owne charity, when wee cannot know, as the Papists teach, that we have charity?

                  <hi>Lapide</hi> confesseth, <hi>Valde favent,</hi> doe very much favour our exposition: wherein the Apostle sheweth, how this love of God, whereon our hope, &amp;c. is grounded, is both manifested and assured unto us. It is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by this, <hi>verse</hi> 6. that when wee were of no strength, yea dead in our sinnes, the Son of God dyed for us: for so saith the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5.

For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled wee shall bee saved by his life. I conclude therefore, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the testimony of <hi>Augustine,</hi> (which as himselfe <note n="p" place="margin">Uid. diatrib. de Antiebristo part. 2 ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstr. 1.</note> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth deserveth no credit further than it is warranted by the authority of Gods word, or sound reason) by the love of God in this place is meant Gods love towards us.

                  <p>Therefore that Charity wherewith wee love God is the holy Ghost.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This conclusion <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knoweth to bee false.

Neither is charity that fruit of the holy Ghost, whereby the Spirit of adoption causeth us to cry Abba Father, but faith. For although by charity wee may bee declared or knowne to bee the sonnes of God: yet wee become the sonnes of God, not by charity, but by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.

dwelleth by his Spirit, the one in respect of the soule, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. that howsoever by reason of sinne the body is dead, that is, mortall or subject to death: yet the soule is life, that is, designed unto life, by reason of righteousnesse.

Now, as our bodie is dead, that is, subject to death by reason of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, in whom, as the roote, all sinned: so our soule is life, or intituled to life, by reason of Christs righteousnesse; in whom, as our head, wee satisfied the justice of God: The sinne of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and the righteousnesse of the second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both communicated unto us by imputation. And this is all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath alleaged to prove that justifying grace is inherent: all which is as good as nothing.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. VI.</hi> The use of the word <hi>Grace</hi> in the writings of the Fathers.</head>
               <p>§. I. <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving shewed how the word <hi>grace</hi> is used in the<note place="margin">The word grace used most frequently for the grace of sanctification, because that was oppugned by the Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> Scriptures, something is to be added concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the use thereof in the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whose authority the Papists are wont to object against us. Howbeit as in the Scriptures, so also in the Fathers, there are two principall significations of the word <hi>Grace:</hi> the one, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, signifying the gracious favour of God in Christ, by which they acknowledge us to be elected, called, justified and saved. The other, metonymicall, signifying the gift of grace, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the grace of regeneration or sanctification, which in the Scriptures is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> opposed to the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the new Man, or new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is renewed, and as it were recreated according to the Image of God in true holinesse and righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Of this grace of sanctification there is more frequent mention in the Fathers, who wrote against the Pelagians than of the other. Because the Pelagians acknowledging the grace of God in forgiving sinnes, which is indeed the justifying and saving grace: they had not the like occasion to insist upon the declaration and proofe thereof, as they had of the other, which the Pelagians denyed.</p>
               <p>§. II. Of whose errors in this point there were foure degrees.<note place="margin">Foure degrees of the errour of the Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> For first, they acknowledge no other inward grace of God but <hi>bonum</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:22501:82"/>
                  <hi>naturae,</hi> the possibility of nature and the power of free-will: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is freely given of God without any precedent merits of ours, they acknowledged to bee Gods grace. In the second place they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the grace, that is, the gracious favour of God in forgiving sinnes: but the inward vertue, avoid sinnes and to walke in obedience, they ascribed to the power of nature. Thirdly, for our direction and instruction, how and what sinnes to avoid, and how and what duties to performe; they acknowledged Gods grace in teaching and instructing us by his word and by his law. Fourthly, they acknowledged, after a sort, the helpe of grace for the more easie performance of their duties; but they denied the necessity thereof, because without grace they being directed by the word, were able of themselves, though not so easily, to fulfill the Law.</p>
               <p>§. III. These three latter degrees are condemned by so many decrees of the Councell of Milevis, among which this is one,<note n="a" place="margin">C. 3.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Anathema against such, as shall say, that the grace of God, whereby wee are justified through our Lord Iesus Christ, doth availe onely to remission of sinnes, which are already committed, and not for a helpe that we may not commit them: unto which rightly understood we doe subscribe, acknowledging, that by the same grace of God, by which we were elected, redeemed, called, reconciled, adopted, justified, wee are also sanctified: For wee professe that our blessed Saviour was given unto us of God,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> not onely to bee our justification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but also to be our Sanctification. And we doe acknowledge, that in the Covenant of grace<note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 31. 33, 34.</note> the Lord hath not onely promised remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes to those that beleeve in Christ; but hee hath also sworne,<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75.</note> that he will give us, being redeemed and having remission of sinne, to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the daies of our life. And therefore we do also willingly subscribe to those sentences of <hi>Augustine</hi> which <hi>Gratian</hi> hath transcribed into the third part of his decree.<note n="e" place="margin">

And againe,<note n="f" place="margin">

                  </note> the grace which by our Lord Iesus Christ is given, is neither the knowledge of the divine Law, neither nature, nor remission of sinnes alone: but it felfe also causeth, that the Law be fulfilled, that nature be freed, that sinne raigne not. And this, I<note place="margin">De gratia &amp; lib. arb. ad Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentin. c. 14.</note> presume, is as much as can truely bee alleaged out of the Fathers: For seeing they doe hold, as wee shall hereafter shew, justification by faith onely; it cannot bee imagined, that they held justification, properly understood, by inherent graces, unlesse wee can imagine, that they thought there is no inherent grace but faith onely.</p>
               <p>§. IV. But howsoever the Fathers may be excused, who opposing<note place="margin">The use of the word grace in the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and latter writers.</note> the errors of the Pelagians, which oppugned the sanctifying grace, did much insist upon the declaration, the proofe, and the amplification
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:22501:82"/>
thereof, oftner speaking of this gift of grace, which was oppugned, than of the gracious favour of God in forgiving of sinnes, which the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians did confesse: yet the backsliding posterity cannot bee excused, and that in three respects. For first, they leave out altogether the proper signification of grace, which is most frequent in the holy Scriptures, as if there were no other grace to bee acknowledged, but that which is inherent. Secondly, they take away that grace of remission, which the Pelagians did confesse, and in the roome thereof they have brought in an utter deletion or abolition of sinne, caused by the infusion of grace. Thirdly, that grace which they would seeme so much to magnifie, is not much better acknowledged by them, than it was by the Pelagians. For first they doe not acknowledge it to be a quickning and reviving grace to them that are dead: but an healing grace to the sicke, and a helping grace to the weake. And by how much they extoll the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and lessen the foulenesse of originall sinne: so much they extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the benefit of grace, and are as well as the Pelagians, worthily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the enemies of Gods grace: Secondly, there seemeth to be little or no difference betweene the Pelagians <hi>bonum Naturae,</hi> which they acknowledged to bee Gods grace, and that sufficient grace, which the Papists hold to be common to all. Thirdly, neither is there any great difference betweene them in respect of that grace whereby men are called. For the Pelagians acknowledged the great grace of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his will unto us, and in directing us what to doe and what to beleeve; and withall confessed, that God doth worke in us to will by revealing his will to us. And what doe the Papists acknowldge more? but that God having called us by his word, and moved us to turne unto<note place="margin">August. Epist. 105.</note> him, it is in the power of our free-will either to accept Gods effectuall grace, or to refuse it. But this belongeth to another controversie.</p>

               <p>§. I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE third Capitall errour of the Papists in the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">The state of the Question.</note> of justification, is concerning that righteousnesse whereby we are justified: where, for prevention of Popish calumniations, I must desire the Reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member three things: First, that the controversie is not concerning our Sanctification, but concerning our Iustification: For wee confesse, that our habituall sanctification consisteth in our righteousnesse inherent; and actuall, in our new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Secondly, that the question is not of our justification before men, but before God. For we acknowledge, that we are justified, that is, declared and knowne to be just, not onely by profession of the faith, but also by good workes, as Saint<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi>

                     </gap>. 14. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth. Thirdly, that wee doe not deny, that there is a righteousnesse in the faithfull, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> falsly chargeth us. For we professe, that there is no faithfull or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified man, in whom there is not inherent righteousnesse, more or lesse, according to the measure of grace received. And further we professe, that this righteousnesse which we have from God, and is inherent in us, is graciously both accepted of him, and rewarded by him; but wee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:22501:84"/>
deny, that any man is justified by it. This question therefore is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matter of justification. For whereas justification, considered as an action of God is his making or constituting a man righteous, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Christs righteousnesse imputed (as wee teach according to the Scriptures) or by righteousnesse infused as the Papists hold: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apparent, that as according to our Doctrine, the righteousnesse of Christ is the matter, and the imputation thereof the forme of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so according to their doctrine, inherent righteousnesse should be the matter of justification, and the infusion of it, the forme. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee differ in respect of logicall termes in setting downe the state of this controversie, because they against reason make inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the forme of justification: yet the true state of the controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and us is this, whether wee bee justified before God by Christs righteousnesse, which is out of us in him, imputed to us: or by that righteousnesse, which being infused of God is inherent in us: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee the righteousnesse of God, as the Apostle calleth it, that is, of Christ who is God, inherent in him; or a righteousnesse from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us: we hold the former; the Papists the latter.<note place="margin">This, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall point.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. Now this is the principall point of difference betweene them and us in this whole controversie, and that in two respects: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the righteousnesse of God whereby wee are justified, is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall matter contained or revealed in the Gospell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. For which cause wee, who maintaine justification by that righteousnesse of God which is taught in the Gospell, which the Pápists oppugne, are worthily called the professours of the Gospell, whereof the Papists are professed enemies. Secondly, because upon this all the other points of difference doe depend. For if wee were justified by righteousnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, then it would follow. First, that to justifie were to make just by infusion of righteousnesse inherent. Secondly, that wee are justified by the grace of God, or rather graces inherent in us. Thirdly, that the forme of justification were infusion of righteousnesse. Fourthly, that faith doth justifie as a part of inherent and habituall righteousnesse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also that it doth not justifie alone. Fifthly, that workes justifie as our actuall righteousnesse. But on the contrary, if wee bee justified by that righteousnesse, which is not inherent in us, but out of us in Christ: then it followeth, first, that to justifie doth not signifie making righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by justice inherent. Secondly, that we are not justified by inherent grace, but by the gracious favour of God accepting us in Christ. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wee are not justified by infusion, but by imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Fourthly, that faith doth not justifie as a part of inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, but as the hand to receive Christ, who is our righteousnesse. Fifthly, that workes doe not justifie as causes to worke, but as fruits and signes to declare and manifest our justification.<note place="margin">The other points prove this.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. III. And as the proofe of this inferreth the rest: so the rest being proved, are so many proofes of this. For first, if to justifie doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Scriptures signifie to make righteous by infusion of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, then wee are not justified by inherent righteousnesse; neither
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:22501:84"/>
is justification by inherent righteousnesse, that justification which the Scriptures teach. Secondly, if wee bee not justified by grace inherent then not by habituall or inherent righteousnesse, if by the gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God freely without respect of any cause of justification in us, then not by workes or inherent righteousnesse. Thirdly, if by imputà<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs righteousnesse, then not by infusion of inherent justice. Fourthly, if by faith as it is the hand to receive Christs righteousnesse, then not by righteousnesse inherent. Fifthly, if not by workes as any cause, then not by inherent righteousnesse. But the two first I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearely proved already; the first in the second booke; and the second, in the third. And the rest I shall by the grace of God demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in their due place.</p>
               <p>§. IV. That, which hath already beene said, both here, and<note n="b" place="margin">

This point to be proved, in the affirmative part, and in the negative, first joyntly, and then severally.</note> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, together with that which shall hereafter bee produced to prove the other three points remaining to bee proved, might bee a sufficient demonstration of this point. But because the proofe of this point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principall, doth prove all the rest, as I have shewed; therefore I will not onely bring a supply of divers arguments, by disproving the popish assertion, and proving our owne, but also answere the cavills and objections of the Papists. And first, I will prove our assertion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theirs joyntly and together: and then severally I will disprove their assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that wee are justified by righteousnesse inherent in ourselves; and prove ours, to wit, that wee are justified by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ, which is out of us in him.</p>

               <p>The former part of the proposition is proved out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and 3. 21. Thus:</p>
               <p>The righteousnesse, which there is said to be revealed in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is that righteousnesse, by which wee are justified. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is confessed of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:22501:85"/>The righteousnesse of God is that righteousnesse, which is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Gospell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17.

               <p>Therefore the righteousnesse of God is that righteousnesse by which wee are justified.</p>
               <p>The whole proposition in both the parts is proved out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. where it is not onely signified, that wee are justified by Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and not by our owne; but there is also such an opposition made betwixt Gods righteousnesse and ours in the point of justification; that whosoever seeke to be justified by their owne rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The redemption wrought by Christ, is Gods righteousnesse, not ours, because Iesus Christ himselfe is true God.</p>
               <p>This righteousnesse of Christ, which is called the righteousnesse of God, by which we are justified; the Papists (even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe) sometimes confesse to be a plenary satisfaction to God, and by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them that beleeve: and that this righteousnesse of Christ is the meritorious cause of our justification, and that by the merit of Christs righteousnesse we are justified: and yet they cannot abide to heare, that it is the matter of justification: when as wee by the matter of justification understand nothing, but that righteonsnesse, which is imputed to justification. Now it is certaine, that the righteousnesse of Christ, neither active nor passive, which were transient, nor the merit thereof, can otherwise be communicated to us, but by imputation. Even as the actuall transgression of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the guilt thereof, were by imputation communicated to us. Neither could inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bee merited for us unto our sanctification, unlesse his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe and the merit thereof were first imputed to us unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: no more than the actuall sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> could have infected us with originall corruption, if his sinne and the guilt thereof had not first beene imputed to us.</p>
               <p>§. V. The fecond part of the assumption was, that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse inherent is ours.</note> inherent in us, is <hi>our</hi> righteousnesse: which, one would thinke should need no proofe. For though we receive it from God, as wee doe all other good things which wee have, yet it, as well as all other good things, even our daily bread, which we have received from God,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:22501:86"/>
is to be called <note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 6. 11.</note> ours. All good things which we have, are Gods gifts, and yet they are not called his, but ours. As our bodies, our soules, our life, our liberty, our learning, our wisedome, our charity, our tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, our piety, &amp;c. and so <hi>our</hi> righteousnesse. The Papists, and some others doe teach, that, that righteousnesse is called Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which wee shall have from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ours, which wee have from our selves, and by the strength of nature: whereto I answer, first, there can bee no righteousnesse, which is not the gift of God, from<note n="m" place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> whom all gifts doe come. Neither is it credible, that the Iewes, who were instructed in Gods word, should ever looke to bee justified by a righteousnesse not received from God. The Pharisee himselfe, who trusted unto his owne righteousnesse, and thought, as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Iewes, <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> to be justified by his owne righteousnesse, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to be the gift of God, and therefore thanked him for it.

I answer, that Christs righteousnesse both habituall and actuall,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:22501:87"/>
both active and passive is such, for it is not that whereby God, that is the Godhead is just, but that whereby hee maketh us just.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas the Papists will needes have the righteousnesse of God, by which wee are justified, and which is the principall matter taught in the Gospell to be inherent in us, though from God: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Gods righ teousnes and ours, and thereby confound the Law and the Gospell, and by confounding them abolish the righteousnes of God: as before, by confounding justification with sanctification they abolished the benefit of justification, and evacuate the Gospell, or at least with the false Apostles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. teach another Gospell whiles they teach another righteousnesse whereby to bee justified, than the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of God: which whosoever doth, though hee were an Apostle, though an Angel from heaven, <note n="q" place="margin">

               <p>§. VII. Our second argument: That is the matter of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion besore God, by which wee being sinners in our selves (for that justification, which the Scriptures teach, is the justification <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. 5. 8. 10.</note> of a sinner) doe stand righteous before God; which wee being sinners may oppose to the judgement of God, why he should not condemne us; which wee being sinners may interpose betwixt Gods justice and us; and which we may plead as a full satisfaction to God for us. Such is the righteousnes of Christ: for being sinners in our selves, yet beleeving in Christ, we are in <note n="s" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21. Rom. 5. 19.</note> him accepted and constituted righteous. The righteousnesse of Christ is that, which we being sinners in our selves may oppose to Gods judgement, or interpose betwixt Gods justice and us, which wee may plead as a full satisfaction made in our behalfe. For though by our sins wee have deserved to bee condemned, and to be excluded from heaven: yet if wee beleeve in Christ, his sufferings are accepted in our behalfe to free us from hell, and his obedience to entitle us unto heaven. In him we have borne the penalty, in him wee have fulfilled the <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> Law. Such is not ours: for being sinners in our selves wee cannot stand before God as righteous by justice inherent, neither can wee oppose it to Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or interpose it betwixt Gods justice and our sinnes, or plead it as a full satis faction. But the best of us must pray with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>

This is not it, in which wee can stand in judgement before the righteous King sitting on his throne.</p>

               <p>The righteousnesse of Christ, which is out of us in him, is the onely righteousnesse of man which is perfect, and all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse in this life is unperfect.</p>
               <p>Therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of Christ, which is out of us in him, and not by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves.</p>
               <p>The proposition needeth no proofe; for that justice, which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, cannot stand in judgement before God, and is so farre from justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that it selfe is sinfull, every imperfection and defect being <gap reason="foreign">

That the righteousnesse of Christ is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is also manifest: And that it is the onely righteousnesse of man which in this life is perfect, is evidently proved, because all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of all meere and mortall men is unperfect.

               <p>All mortall men are sinners.</p>
               <p>Therefore no mortall man hath perfect righteousnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him.</p>
               <p>The proposition is manifest: for whiles men bee sinners, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be perfectly righteous. The assumption, <hi>viz.</hi> that all men are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is proved by the common experience of all men in all ages. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">2</note> it is grounded upon most plaine and undeniable testimonies of holy Scriptures, which have concluded all men whatsoever under sinne. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 46. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 20. Thirdly, it is a<note place="margin">3</note> confessed and received truth: which therefore the Apostle in his Enthymeme, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. taketh for granted. For thus the Apostle argueth;</p>
               <p>Every one that is a transgressour of the Law, is accursed, therefore</p>
               <p>All men whatsoever, even those, who seeke by their obedience of the Law to be justified, are accursed. If any man should deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this Enthymeme, it is to bee made good by adding the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption (which the Apostle left out as a thing presupposed and taken for granted) thus,</p>
               <p>Whosoever is a transgressour of the Law, is by the Law accursed; which the Apostle expresseth in these termes, <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> Cursed is every one that continueth not in all the things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them.</p>
               <p>But all men without exception, even those which seeke to be justified by the Law, are transgressours of the Law: Never any man continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them, that is, never any meere and morall man hath so abstained from all evill forbidden, as that he hath also done the things commanded, that he hath done all, that hee hath ever continued in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all. Thus <hi>Chrysostome</hi> understandeth the Apostle to argue. No man is justified by the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because no man, saith he, fulfilleth the Law.</p>
               <p>Therefore all men without exception, even those which seeke to bee justified by the Law, are by the Law accursed: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is of no force if it bee not granted, that all men are transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours<note place="margin">4</note> of the Law. Fourthly, all they who are to pray to God for the forgivenesse of their sinnes, are sinners: But all, even the best of men are to pray to God for the forgivenesse of their sinnes. <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 32. 6.</note>

               <p>Whosoever is a lyar himselfe, and maketh God a lyar, that saith he hath no sinne, he undoubtedly is a sinner.</p>
               <p>But every man, though he were as holy as the beloved Apostle and Evangelist Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> is a lyar himselfe, and maketh God a lyar, that saith he hath no sinne: for if wee (saith he, including him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) say we have no sinne, wee deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 8. if we say that we have not sinned we make him a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and his word is not in us, <hi>vers.</hi> 10.

For though both these assertions were true, as they are not, yet would they not conclude justification by inherent righteousnesse. For first, as touching the persons, the question is not, whether some choice men in some part of their life, after they have beene good and long proficients, doe attaine to some perfection; but whether they, and all others, when they are first justified, are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perfect justice: for if they be not then endued with perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse, they are not justified by it. Now justification by habituall righteousnesse, which they call their first justification, is <hi>incipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entium,</hi> of incipients: and themselves distinguish Christians into three rankes, that some are incipients, some proficients, some perfect.

The former are perfect at the first, according to their kinde: as were the workes of creation. The latter are not perfect at the first, but by degrees are brought to perfection: as the worke of procreation or carnall generation, and of Spirituall Re-creation or Regeneration. <hi>Adam</hi> was the immediate Worke of GOD created at once: and therefore perfect in his kinde at the first. <hi>Seth</hi> also was the Worke of GOD, not immediate by creation, but mediate by Procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being first begotten by his parents and conceived, then formed in the wombe, then borne, then growing from age to age, untill hee came to bee a perfect man. So it is in the Spirituall Re-creation. For wee are the workemanship of God created <note n="c" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 10.</note> unto good workes: but we are not perfect Christians at the first. For we are first begotten by the incorruptible <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note> seed of Gods Word, receiving, as it were, the seeds of Gods graces at the first, being but as Embryons in the wombe untill Christ <note n="e" place="margin">Gal 4. 19.</note> bee formed in us. And when wee are borne a new, wee are at the first but as new borne Babes, who are to desire the sincere <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 1.</note> milke of the worke, that we may grow thereby: and afterwards stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger meats, that wee may grow more and more: and then, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selves with that measure of growth, which wee have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, must still strive towards perfection, being from day <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> to day renewed in the inner man untill we come to be adult, growne men, or, as the Apostle speaketh, <note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>perfecti;</hi> and when we are such, (because alwayes in this life we are in our <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. III. As touching actuall righteousnesse, hee dealeth also So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistically:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for actuall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</note> for first, where hee should prove, that the works of the faithfull are perfect, or purely and absolutely good, he proveth that they are truely good, and not sinnes: but especially, when he should prove, that all the workes of the faithfull or righteous, are purely and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good; he proveth, that some are. As though a man who is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of many sinnes, and infected with manifold corruptions and infirmities, but also in respect of his former sinnes obnoxious to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; could bee justified by some good workes among many not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:22501:89"/>
good. But this is a most erroneous conceit of the Papists, who hold, that every good worke, proceeding from charity, doth absolutely deserve heaven; even as well as any evill worke committed against charity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth hell. As though by one act of charity the whole Law were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, as well as by one act committed against charity the whole Law is broken. Hee that transgresseth one Commandement, <note n="l" place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> though it bee but once, is guilty of all. But hee doth not fulfill the Law, and much lesse can bee justified by his obedience, whose obedience is not totall, <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> perfect, and perpetuall. It is true, that a faithfull man may bee justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, declared and approved to be just by some one or more good workes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 2. 21, 25.</note> by offering his sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> by her enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and delivering of the Espies; but no man can bee justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by his works, who is guilty of any sinne. For if <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 4 4.</note> who was not conscious to himselfe of any sinne, was not thereby justified: how can he that is guilty of any, or rather many sinnes be justified? For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is justified before God <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 4 6.</note> is blessed, but cursed <note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> is every one that continueth not in all the things, which are written in the booke of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to doe them.<note place="margin">Reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the workes of the faithfull are not purely and perfectly good. and first, <hi>Esa.</hi> 64. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. IV. But if it shall evidently appeare, that none of the workes of the faithfull are purely and perfectly good, how farre then are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists from proving justification by workes. And this I will prove by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers arguments, which I will also maintaine against the cavils of the Papists. And first out of <hi>Esa.</hi> 64. 6. We are all as an uncleane person, or thing, all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth. Where the Church doth freely confesse her selfe and all her members to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and all their righteousnesses, that is, all their most righteous workes, to bee as polluted clouts: which, though it be a most pregnant testimony, wherein wee have just cause to triumph; yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

                  </note> saith it is <hi>impertinent,</hi> and that for three reasons: First, because <hi>without doubt the Prophet speaketh not of just men, but of notorious sinners, for whose sinnes the City of Ierusalem and people of the Iewes was to be delivered into the hands of the King of Babylon.</hi> And that the prophet speaketh in the person of such wicked men, he endeavoureth also to prove by three arguments: First, <hi>because he a little before had said, because thou art angry and wee have sinned,</hi> that is, as <hi>Cyrill</hi> expoundeth it, because thou art angry, thou hast forsaken us. <hi>But neither is God angry with the just, neither doth hee forsake them.</hi> I answere no lesse confidently, but upon better grounds, that without doubt the prophet speaketh in the person of the Church, and namely of the faithfull, who living after the desolation of Ierusalem in the captivity of Babylon, should bewaile their owne sinnes and of the whole people of the Iewes, which had drawne upon them those fearefull judgements. For these words are part of that prayer of the Church of the Iewes, which from the seventh verse of the 63. chapter is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the end of the 64. And in token of this continuation, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the last verse of the former chapter in the hebrew, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this chapter in the Greeke, Latine, and other translations. Now in the former chapter, the same persons, which here confesse their

sinnes, after they had magnified Gods mercies towards them, <hi>verse</hi> 7. &amp;c. doe say unto God, <hi>verse</hi> 16. doubtlesse thou art our Father, though <hi>Abraham</hi> be ignorant of us, and Israel know us not: thou O Lord art our Father and our Redeemer. And in this chapter, as they bewaile in this verse their sinnefulnesse with aggravation: so they desire the Lord (whom they call their Father) not to remember their iniquities, because they are his people, <hi>verse</hi> 8. 9. professing their hope of salvation, <hi>verse</hi> 5. which is not the manner of notorious and impenitent sinners, but of those that are penitent, and faithfull. And further, that which <hi>Esay</hi> here foretelleth, is accordingly performed: First, by <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9. from the fourth verse to the twentieth, who in like manner in the name and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the desolate Church of the Iewes, prayeth unto God, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his owne sinnes and of the people of Israel, as he speaketh, <hi>verse</hi> 20.

ceremoniall, or if they placed the top of their righteousnesse (as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites many times doe) in ceremoniall observations, that they would compare those things, which they so highly esteemed, to menstruous clouts.

And this I prove: first, out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 36. 38. where the high Priest, who was the figure of Christ, is appointed to weare on his forehead a plate of pure gold, which is also called an holy coronet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 6. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 9. engraven with this inscription, Holinesse of the Lord; and so the 72. translate it, <gap reason="foreign">

The end wherefore he was to weare it, was, that <hi>Aaron</hi> might beare the iniquity of the <hi>holy</hi> things which the children of Israel should hallow, in all their <hi>holy</hi> gifts. And it was alwaies to be on his forehead, that they (the holy gifts) might be accepted before the Lord: where we are plainly taught, that in all our best actions and holy services which wee performe to God, there is iniquity, which must bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the holinesse and righteousnesse of Christ imputed unto us, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they cannot in themselves be accepted of God.</p>
               <p>§. XII. Secondly, out of <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 20. There is not a just man upon the <note place="margin">Secondly, out of <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Quisecerit bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; non poccârit.</hi>
                  </note> earth, that doth good, and sinneth not; that is, who in doing good sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not. For if the meaning were onely thus, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it, <hi>that none are so just, but that sometimes they sinne,</hi> according to that, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 46. those words, <hi>that doth good</hi> were superfluous: for there is no just man that doth not good. But his meaning is, that there is no just man upon earth, who doing good sinneth not, that is, which doth good so purely and perfectly, as that hee doth not sinne therein. For to the perfecting of a good worke many things must concur, the want of any whereof is a sinne. The truth of this doth best appeare in the particulars; Prayer is a good worke, and so is the hearing of the word, &amp;c. but there is no man doth so pray, or so heare the word, but that when hee hath done, he hath just cause to pray unto God to forgive his defects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, both in the one and the other. And in this sense <hi>Luther</hi> did tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold, that <hi>justus in omni opere bono peccat,</hi> that a just man sinneth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good worke. Not that the worke in respect of its kind, or <hi>per se,</hi> is a sinne, as if wee said that prayer, &amp;c. is a sinne, but <hi>per accidens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in that good worke, there happeneth a defect, which defect is a sinne, not mortall to them who are in Christ, but veniall. And thus <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> also seemeth to understand this place. For speaking of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection

               </p>
               <p>§. XIII. Thirdly, such as is the tree, such is the fruit. The tree is corrupt in part: For even in the best there is the Old man and the New, the flesh and the Spirit, betwixt <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> which there is a perpetuall conflict, so that wee cannot doe the things wee would, and much lesse as we would, <note n="p" place="margin">

               <p>§. XIV. Fourthly, actions absolutely good may stand in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Actions purely good maystand in iudgement.</note> before God. But our workes cannot stand in judgement. The best of us have need to pray with him, who had lesse neede than wee: <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 143. 2.</note> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into judgement with thy servant O Lord. If <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 130. 3.</note> thou Lord shouldest marke what is amisse, even in our best actions, who should be able to stand? <hi>Noliergo intrare mecum in judicium Domine Deus meus:</hi> wherefore enter not into judgement with me O Lord my God: <note n="s" place="margin">August. in Psa. 142.</note> 
                  <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumlibet rectus mihi videar, producis tu de the sauro tuoregulam, coaptas me adeam, &amp; pravas invenior.</hi> For though I seeme to my self never so right, thou bringest forth of thy treasury a rule, thou examinest mee by it, and I am found wicked. This which <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> expounding him, speake in respect of the person, may bee applyed to his best actions; as namely to his prayer, unto which more specially <hi>David</hi> in both places doth seeme to have relation. Lord heare my prayer, &amp;c. and enter not into judgement with thy servant. Lord heare my voice, &amp;c. if thou shouldest marke what is amisse, who should stand? For though my prayer (may the best of us say) seeme to my selfe never so godly, yet thou hast a rule, according to which if thou shouldest exactly examine my prayer, it would bee found sinnefull. Alas, Lord, I doe not pray with that humility in respect of mine unworthinesse, nor with that feeling of my want, nor with that reverence of thy great and glorious Majesty, nor with that attention of minde, nor with that devotion and fervencie of Spirit, nor with that assurance of faith, &amp;c. that I ought to doe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come unto thee, not in any conceit of mine owne righteousnesse, or of the worthinesse of my prayer; but I come unto thee in the name and mediation of Christ, appealing from thy tribunall of justice to the throne of thy grace, desiring and beleeving, that the incense of my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, being perfumed with the odours of his merits, may and shall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto thee.</p>
               <p>§. XV. But if any popish pharisee doth thinke, that hee needeth not <note place="margin">Appeale to the conscience of the Papists.</note> thus to pray, I shall desire his Conscience thus to speake unto him: Doest thou thinke, that for the worthinesse of thy prayer thou shalt bee heard, and that if the Lord should enter into judgement with thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:22501:93"/>
to his exact rule, he could finde no fault with thy prayer? Alas, besides those blemishes and imperfections even now mentioned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the most godly have just cause to complaine: thou directest thy prayer not to God alone, but to Saints and Angels, and so committest horrible idolatry: and when thou dost direct thy prayer unto God, thou dost conceive of him under some bodily shape, whereby thou doest circumscribe him, and make him finite, and so no God, but an idoll of thine owne braine. Thou doest not come unto God, in the name and mediation of Christ alone, who is the onely mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, but in the mediation of many others, by whose merits and intercession thou hopest and desirest to be heard. Thou cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest not the helpe of the Holy Ghost the Spirit of grace and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose helpe thou findest not thy selfe to need for such a prayer as thou doest make. Thy prayer is but a formall recitall of a certaine taske of words, uttered for the most part without understanding, without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without devotion, without faith. Thou, if unlearned, as the most are, thou prayest in an unknowne language, speaking like a Parrat thou knowest not what, thy prayer is a meere lip-labour, thou hopest by the multitude <note n="t" place="margin">Matth. 6. 7.</note> of thy words, and the often repetitions of thy Ave-maries, thy Pater-nosters and thy Creeds, most ridiculously and odiously reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated upon thy Beads by most superstitious <note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 6. 7.</note> Battology. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, wilt thou bee so wickedly impudent, as to obtrude thy orisons unto God, not only as an acceptable service, wherewith, though he should enter into judgement with thee, he could finde no fault, but also impetratory of thy desires, satisfactory for thy sinnes, and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of eternall life? Nay, I assure thee, that thy prayer to God with the opinion of satisfaction and merit, though it were otherwise well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (as it is farre from it, there being nothing almost performed in it which is required in prayer) it were abominable in the sight of God: what shall I say more? The acceptable and effectuall prayer is the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16. whereby a man doth specially beleeve, <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 21. 22. Mark. 11. 24. Iam. 1. 6, 7.</note> that his requests are or shall bee granted to him, as namely for remission of sinnes and eternall life: but thou (I speake to the best and most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Papists) thou I say dost scorne and detest this speciall faith, and so thy prayer, wanting faith, besides all other the abominations thereof, is turned into sinne.</p>
               <p>§. XVI. So in like manner in respect of the rest of our actions, though seeming laudable unto us; wee must pray, that the Lord will not enter into judgement with us. To which purpose manifold testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies<note place="margin">Testimonies of Fathers.</note> of the Fathers might be alleaged.

               <p>§. I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His was our third argument taken from the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">His first testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 22</note> of our obedience and righteousnesse, which I have defended against <hi>Bellarmines</hi> cavils: before I proceed to the fourth, I hold it needfull to answere his arguments in propounding whereof hee falleth short of his projects: as I noted before, for hee that would prove that men are justified by their workes; had need to prove, that all the workes of all the faithfull, are purely and perfectly good, which is impossible to bee proved: but hee neither concludeth of all works nor of all the faithfull. And yet it is most certaine, that if the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full be justified by their works, then all the works of all the faithfull are purely and perfectly good. His proofes are of three sorts: authority of Scriptures, Testimonies of Fathers, and other reasons. Out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he citeth eight testimonies <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Iustif. lib.</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</note> The first out of <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 22. <hi>In all these things Iob sinned not with his lips:</hi> And that we may not <hi>answere with some</hi>

                  <hi>of the Rabbins, that though he sinned not with his lips, yet hee might sinne in his heart:</hi> hee telleth us, <hi>that in the next Chapter,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Iob 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>God giveth him this testimonie, that still he retained his innocency; and therefore sinned neither in his tongue, nor in his heart.</hi> Againe, <hi>whereas Satan sought by so many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to bring Iob to sinne, and God on the other side permitted all those temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that the patience and vertue of that holy man should bee manifested; if Iob should have sinned, God should after a sort have beene over come by the devill: wherfore it is certaine, that that worke of Iobs patience was not stained with any sinne; and that the Lutherans, which say the contrary, take part with the devill against God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. <hi>Answ.</hi> Those temptations were permitted by God, as tyrals<note place="margin">Answere to his allegation out of <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 22.</note> of <hi>Iob,</hi> not perfection, but integrity. For that is Gods end, that they who are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, sound and upright may be knowne, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. and this end was atchieved, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. for still <hi>Iob</hi> retained his integrity. But Satans intention was to prove him to be an hypocrite, and to move him not onely to fall, but to fall away from God, and to blaspheme him to his face and so much hee undertooke both <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 11. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. 5. howbeit hee failed in his enterprize. And so much is signified in both the places alleaged by <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> that <hi>Iob</hi> was so farre, either from blaspheming God to his face, which Satan undertooke he should, that he offended not with his lippes, nor charged God foolishly; or, from being discovered to be an hypocrite, that by Gods owne testimony he

retained his integrity, as that word signifieth which <note n="c" place="margin">Tummath.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgar Latine, calleth innocencie.

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> writing on those words of <hi>Iob, Verebar omnia opera mea,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 9. 28.</note> understandeth it to be an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confession, as if he had said, <hi>quae apertè egerim video, sed quid in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenter pertulerim, ignoro,</hi> what overtly I performed, I see: but what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly I suffered therein, I know not. But here may be objected, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the next <hi>Chapter</hi> alleageth out of the said <note n="f" place="margin">Epist. ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. resp. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Gregory, Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mentium est, ibi etiam aliquo modo culpam agnoscere, ubi culpa non est,</hi> it is the property of good minds even there to acknowledge a fault, where nofault is, wherto I answere, that <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh in regard of humane infirmities which were laid upon man after his fall, (and namely of the monthly infirmity of women) which though they bee not inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man for his personall offences: yet it is the property of good minds to esteeme them as laid upon them for their sinnes. Thus <hi>Iob,</hi> though his afflictions were not inflicted upon him, as corrections for his sinnes, but as tryals of his vertue; yet he imputeth them to his sinnes, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26.</p>
               <p>§. III. In the second place he allegeth diverse testimonies out of the<note place="margin">Two alegations out of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Psalmes wherein <hi>David</hi> pleadeth his owne innocencie, and appealeth unto God to be judged according to his owne righteousnesse <hi>Psalm.</hi> 7. 4. 9. 16. 1, 2, 3. 18. 2. 1. 26. 1. 119. 121. <hi>Answ.</hi> In some of these places <hi>David</hi> pleadeth the justice of his particular cause against his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, not the absolute innocencie of his person. The rest are to be understood of his uprighttnesse and integrity. For otherwise, no man was more forward to confesse and to deplore his manifold sinnes, than <hi>David</hi> was; none more ready to implore Gods mercy, none more fearefull that God should enter into strict judgement with him.</p>
               <p>§. IV. His third testimony is <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22. If thine eye be single, the whole body shall bee lightsome: where <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> without any<note place="margin">His third testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22.</note> probability, <hi>by the body</hi> understandeth <hi>a good worke, and by the single eye, a right intention:</hi> for who knoweth not, that many times workes are done with good intentions that are not good. This place in <hi>Matthew</hi> is diversly expounded, and may bee applied to many purposes. But the proper true meaning may be gathered out of the coherence, as I have shewed elsewhere <note n="g" place="margin">Serm. in Mat. 6. 33.</note> for in the latter part of that <hi>Chapter</hi> our Saviour sheweth, both what in our judgements wee should esteeme out chiefe good, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and consequently, what in our afflictions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours wee should chiefly desire and labour for, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 33. As touching the former, he exhorteth us not to lay up our treasure upon earth, but in heaven; that is, that we should place our happinesse, not in earthly, but in heavenly things. For where our treasure is, there will our heart bee also. That is, whatsoever wee esteeme our chiese good,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:22501:95"/>
upon that our hearts and affections will be set. This judgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our chiefe good, is by our Saviour compared to the eye; whereunto, whether it be right or wrong, the whole corps or course of our conversation, which he compareth to the body, will be sutable. If we repose our happinesse in heaven, our conversation will bee religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and heavenly, but if we place our paradise on earth, our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be answerable. As for example, if pleasure be our chiefe good, our conversation will be voluptuous; if profit, it will bee covetous; if honour, it will be ambitious. Such therefore as our judgement is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning happinesse, such will be our desires, our endeavours, and in a word, such will bee our whole conversation. But as his allegation is to no purpose, so his conclusion is besides the question, as if wee held that good workes were in their owne nature mortall sinnes: when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wee acknowledge them to be good, <hi>per se,</hi> and in their kinde; as namely prayer, and almes-giving, but sinfull by accident, as being stained with the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But howsoever wee say, that our righteousnesses are stained with the flesh: yet wee distinguish them from our unrighteousnesses, and with Saint <hi>Iames</hi> we distinguish good workes from sinnes; things commanded from things forbidden; things according to their kind good, but by accident sinnefull, from things which according to their kind are absolutely evill.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> where he saith that the workes of the faithfull are called abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good workes, there is an ambiguity to bee cleared.

From which wee are so farre, that wee willingly, subscribe to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, which hee would prove out of the fathers, and is the title of his chapter, <hi>Opera bona non esse peccata, sed verè bona, that good workes are not sinnes, but truly good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. XI. Now follow his reasons; which if they served to prove no<note place="margin">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, nor is the want of the love of God a sinne in them, nor veniall sinnes such sinnes, as are contrary to the Law of God, or unto charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, for the confirmation of one error <hi>Bellarmin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> broacheth three more. But if concupiscence bee a sinne, if the want of Gods love bee a sinne, if those, which the Papists call veniall sinnes, bee sinnes indeede: then must it bee confessed, that the good workes which are stayned with the flesh, which proceed from a defective love of God and our brethren that are mixed with divers imperfections and corruptions, are notpure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good.</p>
               <p>§. XII. As for concupiscence of the flesh, which remaineth in the<note place="margin">Concupiscence in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a sinne.</note> regenerate, it hath possessed and defiled all the parts and faculties of the soule, which as they are in the regenerate partly spirit, so they are also partly flesh. And these two are opposite one to the other, the Spirit lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting against the Flesh, and the Flesh lusting against the Spirit. So that though Will be present with us, <note n="o" place="margin">

soules, with our whole mind, heart, and affections. For what good wee minde or will as wee are Spirit, the same wee will as wee are Flesh. This concupiscence the Apostle had not knowne<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> to bee a sinne, had not the Law said, <hi>non concupisces,</hi> that is, thou shalt have none evill concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, neither habituall nor actuall. Neither is it onely a sinne, as the Apostle oftentimes doth cal it, but also it is the mother-sinne, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 13 <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. which taking occasion by the Law, to produce ill concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scences therein forbidden, is convinced, not onely to bee a sinne, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly sinnefull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. But of this I have spoken before, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the testimony of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that concupiscence against which the good Spirit lusteth, <hi>(viz.</hi> in the regenerate, for in the unregenerate the Spirit is not) is both a sinne, and the cause of sin, and a punishment sinne.<note place="margin">Secondly, nor with want of charity.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. XIII. And as touching the second: the summe of the Law is, that we should love God with all our heart, and with all our soule, &amp;c. but where is any defect of love, there God is not loved with all the heart, &amp;c. it being legally understood: and therefore every defect is an aberration from the Law, and consequently a sinne. I have also proved out of <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Epist. 29. illud quod minus est qudm debet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitio est.</note> that it is a fault where love is lesse than it ought to bee, from which fault it is, that there is not a righteous man upon earth which doth good, and sinneth not. For which also though wee<note place="margin">

               <p>§. XIV. And as to the third: If those, which the Papists call veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sinnes bee not contrary to the Law, then they are not forbidden in the Law: and without doubt they are not commanded therein. Now if neither they bee commanded nor forbidden, then they are things indifferent:. but that is absurd: yea but (saith hee) <hi>veniall sinnes hinder not justice, And the Scripture absolutely calleth some men just and perfect, notwithstanding their veniall sinnes.</hi> I answere, they hinder not imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive justice, nor evangelicall perfection which is uprightenesse: for to them that beleeve and repent they are not imputed. Neither can it be denied, but that the most upright men have their imperfections, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and slippes, which though in themselves and according to the Law are mortall sinnes (for if they should not bee forgiven, they would, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth, exclude men from heaven:) yet to them that are in Christ Iesus th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither did the Apostle expect the reward for the merit of his works, but for the truth and fidelity of God, who is just in keeping his promise made to the upright, though unperfect indeavers of his servants. And therefore the reward, whereby God doth crowne his owne gifts in us, is called a crowne of righteousnesse, not of ours, but of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, as <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>§. XVIII. The third: <hi>If all the works of the righteous were mortall sinnes, then God himselfe should sinne mortally, because it is God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in us, when we doe any good works, Phil.</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Answ.</hi> If all good workes were absolutely sinnes, yea mortall sinnes, as they malitiously charge us to hold: then indeed, God, who is the author of them, might perhaps bee said, though not to sinne, and much lesse to sinne mortally (for he is not subject to the precept of the Law and much lesse to the curse of it) yet to be the author of sinne. But wee hold, that the good works of the faithfull are truly good, though not purely good: and that what goodnesse is in them is the worke of God, and what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity is in them, it is from the flesh, which staineth the workes of grace in us. Neither are the defects of the secondary causes to be imputed to the first cause. That which God worketh in us, no doubt is good, but this good worke hee hath but begun in us, as in the place by him quoted, <hi>Philippians</hi> 1. 6. for our in regeneration wee are not wholly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at once, for then wee should bee wholy spirit and no flesh. Neither doth the leaven of grace season the whole lumpe at once, but the inward <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> man is renewed day by day: And what is not yet renued is a remainer of the old man, and what is not Spirit, is flesh. Now betweene these two there is a perpetuall conflict, <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> the spirit lusting against the flesh, and the flesh lusting against the Spirit. So that a man regenerate cannot with full consent of will doe either good or evill, there being a reluctation of the Spirit against the evill, which the flesh affecteth; and a re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>luctation of the flesh against that good, which is willed by the Spirit. By reason of this conflict it comes to passe, that as the sinnes of the faithfull are sinnes of infirmity more or lesse, and not wilfull sinnes committed of meere malice: so the good works of the<note place="margin">The fourth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity.</note> faithfull are not purely good, but stained with the flesh.</p>
               <p>§. XIX. The 4. that our <hi>assertion is greatly injurious to our Redeemer, who as the Apostle saith, gave himselfe for us, that he might redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, &amp; might purge unto himselfe an acceptable people, zealous of goodworks: For neither should he truly have redemed us from any iniquity, nor truly clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his people, nor made them zealous of works truly good, but of mortall sinnes, namely if all their good works be mortall sinnes,</hi> (which we utterly deny)</p>
               <p>But I answere, Our Saviour Christ gave himselfe for us, both that he might justifie us by redeeming us from all iniquity, and also that hee might sanctifie, or as the Apostle speaketh, that hee might purifie unto himselfe a peculiar people, zelous or studious of good works. The ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from which he redeemeth us, is not onely of those transgressions, which are absolutely sinnes, but also of those unperfect and defective workes, which wee indevour to performe in obedience to God. And

herein, as I have said, the high Priest was a notable type of our Saviour Christ, who did weare in the forefront of his Miter a plate of gold, in which was ingraven this inscription <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 28 36. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Holinesse of the Lord,</hi> meaning of <note n="g" place="margin">Ier. 23. 6.</note> Iehovah our righteousnesse, which he was appointed to weare, that he might beare the iniquity of the holy things, which the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell should hallow in all their holy gifts, that notwithstanding the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of them they might be accepted before the Lord, by imputation of his holinesse, who is Iehovah our righteousnesse. And the like is to be said of the incense <note n="h" place="margin">Apoc. 8. 3. 4.</note> of the Saints upon earth, that is, of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and all other their good works: which have need to bee perfumed with the odours <note n="i" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 2.</note> of Christs sacrifice; that so being defective in themselves, they may be accepted <note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> of God in Christ. As for our sanctification, it is true, that Christ gave himselfe to sanctifie us. But this sanctification is but begun, and in part in this life, and is to be perfected in the life to come. So saith the Apostle, <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Ephcs.</hi> 5. that Christ loved his Church and gave himselfe for it, that hee might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himselfe (<hi>viz.</hi> at the mariage of the Lambe) a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinckle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish: which last words, as I have shewed out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> are to bee understood not of the Church militant on earth, but of the Church triumphant in heaven. The workes, which we are to be studious of, are workes not onely truly, but also, as much as is possible, purely good. For though wee cannot in this life attaine to full purity and perfection: yet we must aspire towards it, affecting and desiring to performe good works in a better manner and measure, than wee can indeed attaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Howbeit we must say with the <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> Apostle to will is present with me, but how to performe that which is good, I finde not, for the good that I would, I doe not, but the evill which I would not, that I doe, and lest it should bee said, that the Apostle speaketh all these things in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a carnall man, he concludeth thus: so then <gap reason="foreign">

Conclusions worthy of the Lutherans, that some mortall sinnes are to bee done, and that no good worke is to be done.

As therefore their persons, though in themselves sinners, are in <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> Christ accepted as righteous; so their actions, though in themselves defective, are acceptable <note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> in Christ. Here therefore wee may justly retort both the accusation it selfe, and all these absurdities upon the Papists, who be necessary consequence are proved to hold, that all the workes of the righteous are simply evill and so absolutely to be called sinnes.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Those works wherein is found any defect or imperfection are not good, but absolutely they are to bee called sinnes, as the Papists teach:</p>
                  <p>But in all even the best works of the righteous there is to be found some defect, imperfection, or blemish, as being stained with the flesh. This assumption is plainely taught in the holy Scriptures as I have proved heretofore:</p>
                  <p>Therefore all, even the best actions of the righteous, are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be called sinnes, as the Papists teach.</p>

The fourth<note place="margin">The fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument we are iustified only by that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfieth the Law of God.</note> argument therefore to prove joyntly that we are justified by Christs righteousnesse and not by ours, may be this.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>By that righteousnesse alone and by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are justified by which the Law is fully satisfied; By the righteousnesse of Christ alone the Law is fully satisfied, and not by any righteousnesse inherent in us or performed by us:</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of Christ alone, and not by any righteousnesse inherent in us, or performed by us.</p>
               </q>
               <p>For the proofe of the proposition, three things are to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: first, that whosoever is justified is made just, by some righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for as I have shewed heretofore, to thinke that a man should be justified without justice, is as absurd, as to imagine a man to be clothed without apparell: secondly, that all true righteousnesse is a conformity to the law of God, which is the perfect rule of righteousnesse, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as what is not conformable to the Law, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is iniquity and sinne: thirdly, that there can be no justification without the Law be fulfilled, either by our selves, or by another for us. For our Saviour, when he came to justifie us and save us, protested, that hee came not to breake the Law but to fulfill it: and professeth that not one jot or tittle of the Law should passe unfulfilled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17, 18. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise avoucheth, that by the doctrine of justification by faith, the Law is not made void, but established, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. The proposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is undenyable. The assumption hath two parts: the former, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, that by the righteousnesse of Christ the Law is fully satisfied: the other, negative, that by any righteousnesse inherent in us, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, the Law neither is, nor can be fully satisfied. For the clearing of the assumption in both the parts, wee are to understand, that to the full satisfying of the Law, since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> two things are required, the one, in respect of the penalty, unto the suffering where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of sinne hath made us debtours: the other, in respect of the precept,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:22501:100"/>
to the doing wherof the Law doth bind us. The former, to free us from hell and damnation; the other to entitle us to heaven and salvation: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sanction of the Law, If thou dost not that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, thou art accursed: if thoudoest it, thou shalt be saved. In respect of the former, the Law cannot be satisfied in the behalf of him, who hath oncetransgressed it, but by eternal punishment, or, that which is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: in respect of the latter, it is not satisfied, but by a totall, perfect and perpetuall obedience.</p>
               <p>§. II. Now our Saviour Christ hath fully satisfied the Law for all<note place="margin">The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ hath fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Law for us.</note> them that truly beleeve in him, in both respects. For hee hath supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly satisfied the penalty of the Law for us by his sufferings and by his death: and he hath perfectly fulfilled the Law for us, by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all righteousnesse, in obeying his Father in all things, even unto death: and by them both he hath justified us, freeing us from hell by his sufferings and entituling of us unto heaven by his obedience. And therefore the holy Ghost affirmeth that wee are justified by his bloud, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. and by his obedience <hi>verse</hi> 19. For his sufferings were the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of God; in which respect, they who put him to death, are said to have killed the Author of life, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 15. and to have crucified the Lord of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8 and for the same cause, the bloud, by which we are redeemed, is called the bloud of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. or, which is all one, the bloud of the Sonne of God. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.

Here let the Reader take notice, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> disputeth sophistically in diverse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for first hee will needs be <hi>actor,</hi> when indeed hee is <hi>reus;</hi> and that hee might get the better end of the staffe pretendeth to confute our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: when indeed he laboureth to defend his owne. Secondly, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth but a piece of our argument, and such a piece as might be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as being added <hi>mantisae loco,</hi> by way of advantage: for thus we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no man can satisfie the Law because hee hath already broken it: yea hee is so farre from satisfying the Law, in respect of the time past, that for the time to come hee is not able to fullfill it. Thirdly, where hee should prove, that all those, who are to bee justified, doe fulfill the Law for else how should they by fulfilling of the Law be justified, all, that he endevoureth to prove, is, that it is possible for them that are already ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified to fullfill it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> disputing, as wee say, a <hi>posse ad esse.</hi> Fourthly, where hee should prove, that all who are justified doe fulfill the Law, for else how should they be justified by fulfilling it, hee endeavoureth to prove that some rare men have fulfilled it not caring what becomes of the rest Fifthly, where hee argueth, that if men shall fulfill the Law, they shall be justified; his consequence doth not hold in respect of them, who at any time heretofore have broken it (as all meere men without exception have done) though they should perfectly fulfill the Law for the time to come. Sixthly, he would prove, that some doe fulfill the Law, and yet cannot deny, but that even those some doe sinne many times, yea seven times a day, and that they have need daily to pray for the forgivenesse of their sinnes: and therefore faileth in the proofe of that also, as I have made manifest in answering <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> his arguments.<note place="margin">Sixe reasons, that men are not able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law. First, because all are trans. gressours.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. VI. Now to make good this part of our reason, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe to have answered elsewhere all his objections againstit, but I will here also briefly propound some of our arguments to prove, that wee (I meane all mortall men) neither doe, nor can by our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and obedience fulfill, and so even in that respect cannot satisfie the Law. And first I prove it by this most plaine reason.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>No transgressours of the Law doe fulfill it.</p>
                  <p>All men without exception of any but Christ, are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours of the Law, not onely the unregenerate, but the regenerate also:</p>
                  <p>Therefore no man whatsoever (Christ excepted) doth fulfill it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The proposition needeth no proofe, the assumption I have proved before, <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 6.</note> and every mans Conscience giveth testimony to it for himself.</p>
               <p>Or thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whosoever is a fulfiller of the Law is without sinne.</p>
                  <p>No mortall man is or can bee without sinne.</p>
                  <p>Therefore no mortall man is or can bee a fulfiller of the Law.</p>
               </q>
               <p>§. VII. Secondly, If any man could fulfill the Law, he might bee justified thereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:22501:101"/>But no man whatsoever can be justified by the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. 3. 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p>Therefore no man can fulfill it.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Thirdly, Those who cannot fulfill the first commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two, and the last of the ten, cannot fulfill the whole Law.</p>
               <p>But no mortall man is able to fulfill the first and last comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
               <p>Therefore no mortall man is able to fulfill the whole Law.</p>
               <p>The first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the great commandement, injoyneth us to love the Lord our God with all our soules, &amp;c. which, being legally understood, no mortall man is able to fulfill. For whosoever are in all the parts and faculties of the soule, partly flesh and but partly Spirit, they cannot love God with all their soules.</p>
               <p>The most regenerate in this life are partly flesh, and but partly Spirit in all the parts and faculties of the soule.</p>
               <p>Therefore the most regenerate in this life cannot love God with all their soules, that phrase being legally understood.</p>
               <p>The last commandement forbiddeth all evill concupiscence: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habituall, with which all men generally are infected, or actuall, from which none are free, and those not such as are joyned with consent of the wil, which are passions of lust, for those are forbidden in the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; but such as goe before consent, which are called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. IX. Fourthly, by the testimony of Saint <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 15. 10. that the observation of the Law is not to be imposed upon Christians as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to justification, as being a yoke, which neither the Apostles, nor their forefathers the Patriarches and Prophets were able to beare: but that we are to be justified and saved by the grace of God through a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which purifieth the heart. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that the Apostle speaketh of the ceremoniall Law, which wee doe not altogether deny. But from hence wee argue, as from the lesse. If the ceremoniall Law were an unsupportable yoke, how much more the morall? For the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law, in it selfe considered, was not unsupportable, nor requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any thing exceeding the power of man. For not onely the godly did performe it, but hypocrites also; who many times were more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in observing the ceremonies, than the godly themselves: but as it was an appendice of the Law morall: As for example: Circumcision, in it selfe (though the most painefull ceremony) might well bee borne. But as by it men were made debtors <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> to the whole Law, in such sort as they could not be justified, but were under the curse, if they did not observe the whole Law, it was a yoke unsupportable. For in that sense
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22501:102"/>
the Apostle speaketh, when he protesteth to the Galathians, that if they were circumcised <note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> Christ should profit them nothing. And in that sense, as it seemeth, it was urged by the beleeving <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>. 5.</note> Pharisees: that it was needfull, that the disciples, meaning all the Christians of that time, as well Gentiles, as Iewes, should bee circumcised, and so required to keepe the Law; otherwise they could not be justified nor saved. And to that purpose tendeth Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 7, 8, 9.</note> speech, That it was not needfull to require the beleeving Gentiles to be circumcised; seeing it was well knowne, that the Gentiles were first called by his ministery, had truly beleeved, and had received the holy Ghost, who had purified their hearts by a lively faith, by which without circumcision or other obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Law they were justified, as well as the beleeving Iewes: the Iewes also themselves expecting to bee justified and saved by the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ, even as the Gentiles were, without the workes of the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> also reasoneth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>§. X. Fifthly, by the testimony of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and his experience in himselfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence I reason thus: whosoever are not able to performe that which is good, though by the grace of God they are willing to performe it, they are not able to fulfill the Law. But the faithfull and regenerate are not able to performe that which is good, though by the grace of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hey be willing thereunto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not able to fulfill the Law.</p>
               <p>The assumption is proved from the example of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as it were an argument from the greater. For if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, who in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity farre excelled any man now living, did not finde in himselfe ability to performe that which was good, but was so hindered by the flesh, that the good, which he would, he did not: how sholl those, who are farre inferiour unto him, bee able to doe it? being the common conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the regenerate, that by reason of the reluctation of the flesh, they cannot doe those things they would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p>§. XI. Sixthly, the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. doth acknowledge <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the impossibility of the Law, namely to justifie us. The reason whereof is not any defect in the Law it selfe, but our impotencie to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it by reason of the flesh: for if it were possible for us to fulfill the Law, it were possible to the Law to justifie us: but it is not possible to the Law to justifie us by reason of the flesh, and therefore by reason of the flesh it is not possible for us to fulfill the Law, whiles the flesh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in us, as it alwayes doth remaine even untill death. To these arguments, if you shall adde the testimonies of the Fathers, which in handling the sixth question I doe plentifully alleage <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note>, you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that besides the authority of Scriptures, and evidence of reason, we have the consent of antiquity, that no mortall man is able to fulfill the Law of God.</p>

                  </note>, that by the preaching of the Word of God faith is stirred up, and so sinnes are forgiven, is a fiction of the hereticks of our time. Nay, we say more, that by the preaching of the Word, faith is not onely excited, where it was before; but that it is first wrought ordinarily, and begotten by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Gospell. The Papists ascribe the begetting of faith to the Sacraments, and the stirring of it up to the Word. As if faith infused in Baptisme did ly a sleep untill it be excited and awakned by the word,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> But the Scripture teacheth us, that faith commeth by hearing the Word, that Preachers are Ministers by whom you do beleeve, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 5.</note> a preacher men cannot ordinarily beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. that men are begotten to God by the preaching of the Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preachers are their Fathers in the faith, that they justifie men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. because they are the instruments of the holy Ghost to beget faith in them, whereby they are justified. Why then doth <hi>Peter</hi> require them to whom he had preached, to repent and to be baptized? I answer, that the holy Ghost by <hi>Peters</hi> sermon had wrought the grace of faith in the hearers before they were baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. as by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. in so many of the hearers as were ordained unto life, in Lydia, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14, 15. By <hi>Philips</hi> preaching in the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 38. by <hi>Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. 44. and by this faith they were justified before God before they were baptized, even as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was before he was circumcised, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. But that they might be justified also in the Court of their owne Conscience, and much more that they might be saved; many other things, as repentance and a godly life, with the use of the Sacraments, and of all other good meanes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired besides that faith, whereby alone they are justified before God. And to this end did <hi>Peter</hi> require them to repent and to bee baptized: not that Baptisme properly doth justifie, and much lesse that it beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>aith, for, in all these faith was wrought before they were baptized, but because it is a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith to them that are baptized, not onely at the time of Baptisme, but whensoever or how long soever they beleeve. And whereas he saith, <hi>that remission of sinnes is preached to those that beleeve as they ought:</hi> I confesse it is true, that remission is not promised to an idle dead or counterfeit faith, but
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:22501:104"/>
to the true, lively and effectuall faith, which in some measure purifieth the heart, and worketh by love; causing a man, though not to fulfill all things that are commanded, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaketh; yet to will, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and to endevour that hee may performe all things commanded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of grace received.

And howsoever the Scriptures often make mention of Sanctification, as well as of justification: yet no where doe they make Sanctification a part of justification. This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> should have proved and not have craved. Neither is it to bee doubted, but that if forgivenesse of the guilt and punishment concurre unto justification as a part thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation or infusion of righteousnesse being the other part as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here affirmeth, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. VIII. <hi>Finally</hi> saith he, <hi>from which you could not be justified by the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>signifieth, that the observation of the Law, neither by the strength of nature, nor by helpe of the Law alone presumed, doth justifie: not because the true observation of the Law is not righteousnesse, but because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remission of sinne, the Law cannot be kept. Reply,</hi> By the observation of Law is meant, all obedience and righteousnesse inherent whatsoever prescribed in the Law, whether it goe before faith and justification, or follow after. For before, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> truly saith, the Law cannot be fulfilled, neither can there be any true righteousnesse. And that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is performed after, though it be a righteousnesse begun in us, and be not onely accepted in Christ, but also graciously rewarded: yet it cannot satisfie for our former sinnes, nor justifie us from them. That, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth, I admit with some small qualification, as making for us. <hi>For God,</hi> saith he, <hi>when by the merits of Christ he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth any man, hee doth withall forgive his sinnes,</hi> (so saith the Apostle

               <p>§. IX. But to returne to the proofe of my proposition: to that place of the <hi>Acts,</hi> I adde for the further proofe of the first branch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. where the Apostle useth these words promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, <hi>justification and blessednesse,</hi> and proveth out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1. that this blessednesse consisteth in remission of sin, or, as he also speaketh, in the not imputing of sinne, and imputation of righteousnesse without works: from whence this is proved; by what righteousnesse we have remission of sinne, by that we are justified: and by what wee are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we have remission of sinne. The second branch; by what righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we are redeemed, by that we are justified, and <hi>è converso,</hi> by what we are justified, by that we are redeemed. The benefit of redemption is explained by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. to bee remission of sinne, and expressed by the phrase of redeeming from all iniquttie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 133. 8. The third branch, by what righteousnesse wee are reconciled to God, by it we are justified, and by what we are justified we are reconciled. The Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. useth these words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously, to bee justified by the bloud of Christ, and to bee reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God by the death of his Sonne, and 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 19. God is said to reconcile men unto him in Christ, when hee doth not impute untio them their sinnes, but imputeth unto them righteousnesse, even the righteousnesse of God, that is, of Christ, that they only may be made the righteousnesse of God in him, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. The fourth branch: for what righteousnesse wee are saved, by that wee are justified, and <hi>è converso:</hi> that which is the matter of justification is the merit of salvation: for which cause justification and to be justified is many times expressed, by salvation or to bee saved: for they that are justified are saved in hope <note n="h" place="margin">Tit. 3. 7.</note>; and by what they are justified, by that they are intituled to salvation, and by what we receive remission of sinnes, by that also we receive our <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> inheritance.

               <p>§. X.

                  </hi> 9. 3. Thirdly, because our obedience, though it were totall (as it is never in this life) yet it were a debt and we cannot be absolved from one debt, by the payment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when ye shall have done all things which are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to doe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. The second branch, that we are redeemed by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, and not by our owne righteousnesse, needeth no proofe, neither in respect of the affirmative, that by his bloud we have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even the <note n="l" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 7.</note> remission of our sinnes, that he gave himselfe <note n="m" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> to bee <gap reason="foreign">

Nor in respect of the Negative; unlesse it may be thought, that we, who were held captives under sinne and Satan <note n="n" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> to doe his will, could deliver our selves, which God doth sweare to bee his gift, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74. Neither could we be delivered out of the hands of the strong man, but by him <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 12. 29.</note> that is stronger than he. The third branch also is manifest, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the affirmative, that we are reconciled unto God by the death of his Sonne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22, and also of the negative. For we were enemies, when we were reconciled, and such enemies, as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we minded <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> was enmity against God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. Lastly, the fourth branch needeth no proofe, neither in respect of the affirmative, unlesse it may bee thought needfull to prove, that we are saved by the merits of Christ: nor in respect of the negative, the Scriptures so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten testifying that we are saved by grace <note n="q" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 8, 9.</note> through faith, not by workes, no not by any workes of righteousnesse <note n="r" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> that we have done.

This being the maine difference betweene the Law and the Gospell, that the Law to justification requireth perfect obedience to bee performed in our owne persons: the Gospell propoundeth the obedience of Christ which hee performed for us, to bee accepted in their behalf who beleeve in him. Wherfore let him be held accursed, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> though hee were an Apostle, though an Angell from heaven, who shall reach justification by the legall righteousnesse, and not by the evangelicall.

God being so mercifull in forgiving sinnes that he remaineth just, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. For though he proclaime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note n="f" place="margin">Exod 34. 7.</note> mercifull and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodnesse and truth, keeping mercie for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and sinne: yet he protesteth, that absolving he will not absolve, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:22501:107"/>
is, by no meanes will absolve such as ought not to be absolved, that is, such as for whom his justice is not satisfied. Neither doth he indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give any sinne, for which his justice is not satisfied. But as every sinne deserveth death, so it is punished with death, either with the death of the party, for whom he hath no other satisfaction: or with the death of Christ, who hath satisfied the justice of God for the sinnes of all that truly beleeve in him.</p>

               <p>But by that righteousnesse which it inherent in us, the justice of God is not satisfied, as <note n="k" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth. Therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of Christ, which is out us in him, and not by righteousnesse inherent in us.</p>
               <p>And here I will make bold, with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to borow a speech from him, (which he borrowed as it seemes from our Writers) to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of himselfe and all other Popish Iustitiaries. For where <hi>Osiander</hi> had argued, that God accepteth for a satisfaction no justice, but that which is infinite, and consequently none but his owne uncreated and essentiall righteousnesse, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth: <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>De iustif. l.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>. 5. <hi>sine.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God indeed doth not accept as a true satisfaction for sinne, any justice, but that which is infinite, because sinne is an infinite offence. But that some justice may be finite,</hi> that is, <hi>of infinite price and valour, it is not necessary that it should be the essentiall justice of God, but it is sufficient that it be the justice of an infinite person, such as Christ is, God and man. Therefore the obedience, the passion and death of the Sonne of God, though in it selfe and essentially it was a created justice and finite, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in regard of the person, who obeyed, suffered, and died, it was infinite, and in the true rigour of justice it was a propitiation for our sinnes, and not for our sinnes alone, but for the sins of the whole world.</hi> From whence I argue thus, that justice, which is of infinite value, the Lord accepteth as a true satisfaction for sinne, and that which is not of infinite value he doth not accept; for the offence of sinne is infinite. But the righteousnesse of Christ onely is of infinite value, ours is not: therefore the Lord accepteth Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not ours, as a true satisfaction for sinne.</p>
               <p>§. IV. Ninthly, they that cannot be justified without remission of sin, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. no man iustified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remission of sinne.</note> are justified neither by inherent righteousnesse, because they are sinners, nor without the righteousnesse of Christ imputed; without which, as there can be no satisfaction for sinne, so no remission of sinne.</p>
               <p>But no man can be justified without remission of sinne. Therefore no man is justified by righteousnesse inherent, but onely by the righteousnesse of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:22501:108"/>§. V. The tenth, that is to be esteemed the true doctrine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The true doctrine of iustification is comfortable.</note> which doth minister sound comfort to the distressed conscience of the faithfull; and that falfe, which is a racke to the conscience of Gods children, when they are humbled under the hand of God.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of justification by the merits and obedience of Christ imputed, ministreth singular comfort to the distressed conscience of the faithfull, even in the agony of death: assuring the beleeving sinner, that howsoever the devill accuseth, the Law convicteth, the conscience confesseth his demerits: yet notwithstanding, if hee truly beleeve in Christ, he shall be accepted of God as righteous in Christ, and as an heire of eternall life; Christs sufferings and obedience being imputed unto him, and accepted of God in his behalfe, as if he had suffered and performed the same in his owne person.</p>
               <p>But the doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse, is, as it were, a racke to mens consciences. For when a man being summoned to appeare before the judgement seat of God, shall seriously consider with himselfe, what he shall oppose to the accusations of Satan, to the conviction of the Law, to the Testimony of his owne Conscience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing himselfe to be a most wretched sinner, to the judgment of God, the most righteous judge: If he looke backe to his owne conversation, as having nothing to trust to, but his owne righteousnesse, he shall finde sufficient matter of despaire. He may say with <note n="m" place="margin">In libello de Miseria homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> 
                  <hi>Anselme, Terret me vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta mea, &amp;c.</hi> my life doth terrifie me: for being diligently examined, my whole life almost appeareth either to bee sinne or barrennesse: and if there seeme to bee any fruit therein, it is either so counterfeit, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, or some way or other corrupted, as that it can doe no other, but either not please, or displease God. And summoning himselfe before the judgement seat of God, hee findeth himselfe to bee in great straits. On this side, saith he, will be accusing sinnes, on that side terrifying ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: under, will lye open the horrible gulfe of hell; above, an angry Iudge; within, a burning conscience, without, a flaming world—where shall I be hid, how shall I appeare? to be hid is impossible, to appeare is untolerable. To avoide these straits, there is no way but to renounce the doctrine of justification by works or inherent righteousnes, and to fly to the doctrine of the Gospell teaching justification by the grace of God, freely without respect of works through the merits of Christ received by faith: and to appeale from the tribunall of Gods justice to the throne of his mercy. For whiles a man retaineth this opinion, that he can bee no otherwise justified than by his owne good workes, or inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, he can never be soundly perswaded, that his righteousnesse is sufficient for that purpose, but ever hath just caufe not onely of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but also of despaire. And this is the cause of that Popish opinion, that no man without speciall revelation can be assured of the remission of his sinnes, or of salvation.<note place="margin">Argument ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. VI. The eleventh and last argument shall be taken from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For when men seriously considering of their justification before God, as a judiciall act of God (as the word it selfe importeth) shall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:22501:108"/>
and in the feare of God, set themselves before his judgement seat, where they must receive the sentence either of absolution or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and shall bethinke themselves, what, they being accused of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and convicted by the testimony of their owne Conscience, have to oppose to the just judgement of God, why sentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should not passe against them; they would utterly disclaime their owne righteousnesse. For as <hi>Augustine,</hi> and other of the Fathers observe, as before I have noted, out of the eight and nine <hi>verses</hi> of <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. joyned together, <hi>cum Rex justus sederit in solio, quis potest dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mundum est cor meum,</hi> when the righteous King shall sit upon his throne, who can say, my heart is cleane? yea, the best of the Papists, when By deadly sicknes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>CAP. VIII.</hi> The disproofe of the Popish assertion affirming, that we are not justified by righteousnesse inherent.</head>
               <p>§. I. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we are severally to disprove the Popish asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">The disproofe of the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> and to prove ours. As touching the former, that wee are not justified by righteousnesse inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.<note place="margin">The first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment because inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is prescribed in the Law.</note> Our first argument may bee this. That righteousnesse of God, by which we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not prescribed in the Law, as before hath beene proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. nor is that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is of the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>All inherent righteousnesse is prescribed in the Law, and is that which is of the Law:</p>
               <p>Therefore inherent righteousnesse is not that righteousnesse of God, by which we are justified.</p>
               <p>That all inherent righteousnesse is prescribed in the Law, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: first, because the Law is a perfect rule of all inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whether habituall or actuall: secondly, because charity, wherein they place their inherent righteousnesse, even that charity, whereby they are to love God withall their soules, and their neighbour as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: that charity, which proceedeth from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from faith unfained is prescribed in the Law, as the summe and complement thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37. 39, 40. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. the righteousnesse of faith, or that which is of, by or through faith. Secondly, the righteousnesse of the Law is that, which the Law prescribeth, as themselves define it: and what doth that differ from that, which is prescribed in the Law? Thirdly, of the righteousnesse of the Law our Saviour speaketh, saith <hi>Pererius, Matth.</hi> 19. 17. If thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements. Of that, which is of or by the Law, <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh that he which doth those things (that are commanded) shal live in them: betwixt which two spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Christ and <hi>Moses</hi> there is no difference. Fourthly, if the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes prescribed in the Law could be performed, then would the Law give life, according to that legal promise, he that doth these things shall live thereby, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. and if there had been a Law given which could have given life then there should have been righteousnesse <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of, or by the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. and therefore that perfect righteousnesse justifying and giving life, should be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the righteousnesse which is of, or by the Law. Fifthly, the righteousnesse of the Law is, as they teach, necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of all that shall bee saved, and cannot be performed without grace and without faith: and therefore, according to their doctrine, differeth not at all from the righteousnesse of faith, <hi>hoc est,</hi> saith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, operibus bonis quaefiunt ex gratia &amp; fide,</hi> that is, from good workes, which are done by grace and faith. So that by this goodly distinction, the Law and the Gospell, the Law of workes and the Law of faith, the righteousnesse of the Law, and the righteousnesse of faith are confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For the righteousnesse of the Law is charity proceeding from grace and from faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and the righteousnesse of faith as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> here teacheth are good works proceeding from grace and faith. And yet I deny not, but that great difference is to be made between the seeming obedience performed by carnal men without faith &amp; without grace, (which cannot truely be called righteousnesse) and the new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of men spirituall and regenerate proceeding from faith working by love, as the fruits of the Spirit. But neither the one, nor the other, is the righteousnesse of Faith. The new obedience of the faithfull is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a righteousnesse begun, and performed in some measure <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. IV. Yea, but <hi>Augustine</hi> hath this distinction, denying those<note place="margin">

I answer, that <hi>Augustine</hi> disputing against the Pelagians, who held that men might fulfill the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law by the strength of nature, saith, that they might have a kind of righteousnesse in the Law or by it, which notwithstanding did not fulfill the righteousnesse of the Law, which could not bee done without the grace of the Spirit.

                  </gap> the grace of absolution and of Gods acceptation redounded upon all unto justification of life. And thus this distinction
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:22501:110"/>
maketh against the Papists. For <hi>justitia legis</hi> the justice of the Law considered in the abstract, as it is described in the booke of the Law, being most perfect, is never fulfilled by that righteousnesse of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete in or by the Law, which men not onely carnall but spirituall also attaine unto by their observation of the Law, being alwayes unperfect in this life and stained with the flesh. For even as it may bee said of all other graces, which being considered in the abstract, are perfect, and are so defined: but considered in the concrete as they be in men, who have received but the first fruits <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> of the Spirit, according to the measure of the donation <note n="g" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 7.</note> of Christ, they are unperfect: So the righteousnesse of the Law, as it is taught in the Law, and as it was performed by Christ, is perfect; but as it is in all mortall men, it is unperfect. Therefore righteousnesse inherent in us is not that righteousnesse of God by which we are justified.</p>
               <p>§. V. Our second argument. That doctrine, which confoundeth<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish doctrine confoundeth the Law and the Gospell.</note> the righteousnesse of the Law and of the Gospell, and by confounding them maketh void the Covenant of grace, is false and Antichristian.</p>
               <p>The Popish doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse, confoundeth the righteousnesse of the Law and of the Gospell, and maketh void the covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is false and Antichristian.</p>
               <p>The assumption is thus proved: whosoever maketh the condition of justification to be the perfect fulfilling of the Law in our owne persons, confoundeth the Gospell with the Law. For the righteousnesse of the Law is, the man that doth these things (which are prescribed in the Law) shall live by them: but the true condition of the Gospell is, beleeve in Christ, and thou shalt be saved. He also maketh void the Covenant of grace. For if justification be promised upon condition of perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or righteousnesse, which condition is impossible by reason of the flesh, then is the promise void and of none effect. But the Papists make the condition of justification to bee the perfect fulfilling of the Law in our owne persons, or perfect righteousnesse inherent. Againe, whosoever are made debtours to the whole Law, to them not onely the covenant of grace is void, but Christ himselfe is of none effect, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. But they who must bee justified by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse are made debrours to the whole Law, which they must perfectly fulfill, else they cannot bee justified. But of this more <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>§. VI. Our third argument, That doctrine, which depriveth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians<note place="margin">Thirdly, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth men of the chiefe part of Christian liberty.</note> of the chiefe part of that Christian liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, is false and Antichristian. The popish doctrine of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by inherent righteousnesse depriveth Christians of the chiefe part of that Christian liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free: the chiefe part of our liberty is, that, which we have by justification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are freed from hell, and intitled to heaven. And that is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from a double yoke of most grievous bondage, wherein all are held that are under the Law: the former in respect of the curse, under
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:22501:111"/>
which all are, who in the least degree at any time transgresse the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. which all do both oft and grievously: the other in respect of the rigour of the Law, excluding all men from justification and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who doe not perfectly fulfill it: which by reason of the flesh is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. But by the popish doctrine the benefit of justification it selfe is taken away, as I have shewed, and with it, the liberty, which we have by it. For if we cannot be justified but by perfect inherent righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eousnes, then are we subject to the curse, then are we excluded from all possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of justification and salvation as being sinners in our selves, wherefore all those, who will stand fast <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, must abhorre the doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse, which intangleth the imbracers of it with this double yoke of bondage, whereby they are subjected to the curse and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are excluded from heaven and salvation.</p>
               <p>§. VII. Our fourth Argument, No sinners, whiles they remaine<note place="margin">Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all men are sinners.</note> sinners, are justified by righteousnesse inherent.</p>

               <p>This seemeth to be the Apostle argument in the three first <hi>Chapters</hi> of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> whosoever are sinners, they are not justified by the works of the Law, that is to say, by no righteousnesse inherent in themselves or performed by themselves.</p>
               <q>All mortall men whatsoever, both Iewes and Gentiles, are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which hee proveth at large. Therefore no mortall man whatsoever is justified by the works of the Law, that is, by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse inherent.</q>
               <p>§. VIII. Our fifth argument: None that are accursed by the Law,<note place="margin">Fifthly, because all men by the Law are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> are justified by their obedience to the Law, for to bee justified is to bee blessed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>All mortall men without exception are accursed by the Law, as the Apostle proveth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. because all without exception have broken the Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore none are justified by their obedience to the Law, and therefore not by inherent righteousnesse.</p>
               </q>
               <p>§. IX. Our sixth argument: whosoever is justified by inherent<note place="margin">Sixthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law.</note> righteousnesse fulfilleth the Law.</p>
               <p>But no mortall man doth fulfill the Law, as I have elsewhere defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and proved <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <p>No man can be justified by the Law, unlesse he fulfill the whole Law, but this is not possible for any man; therefore that righteousnesse is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to the ground.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this argument adde a seventh as being a Consectary thereof: whosoever is justified by inherent righteousnesse, and namely by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he is justified by his owne fulfilling of the Law. For charity is the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:22501:111"/>
fulfilling of the Law, but no man is or can bee justified by his owne ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, for none can fulfill it: therefore none are justified by inherent righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>§. X. Our eighth argument: we are not justified before God: both<note place="margin">Eigthly, Not by faith and by workes.</note> by faith and by workes, by Gods righteousnesse and our owne, by that righteousnesse which is out of us in Christ, and by that which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our selves. For the holy Ghost maketh such an opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these, as that they cannot stand together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. 4. 4, 5. 9. 30, 31, 32. 11. 5, 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. 3. 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9. But wee are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, by the righteousnesse of God through faith, by Christs righteousnesse which is out of us in him. <hi>viz.</hi> by his sufferings and by his obedience, as besides the places even now quoted appeareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. 19.</p>
               <p>Therfore we are not justified by righteousnesse inherent in our selves.<note place="margin">Ninthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. XI. Our ninth argument: Imputative righteousnesse is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, as being not ours, nor in us, but communicated to us by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>The righteousnesse by which we are justified is imputative: that</p>
               <p>I prove, first, by testimony, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8, 23, 24. for then is God said to justifie, when not imputing sinne, hee imputeth righteousnesse without workes. Secondly, by reason. The personall righteousnesse of Christ is inherent in him and not in us, being proper to his person, though by imputation communicated unto us. The righteousnesse of God, by which we are justified, is the personall righteousnesse of Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 11. <hi>viz.</hi> his passive and active righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. 19. And that it is his personall righteousnesse, appeareth evidently, because it is the righteousnes and obedience of one onely, wheras if it were a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse from him in us, it would be the justice of so many as are justified: so saith the Councell <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sess</hi> 6 <hi>Sess.</hi> 7.</note> of Trent, <hi>justitiam in nobis recipientes unus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisque suam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. XII. Our tenth argument. That justification which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Tenthly, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication taketh away boasting</note> teacheth, taketh away all matter of boasting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Epbes.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>But justification by works or by inherent righteousnesse doth not take away all matter of boasting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. 4. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Therefore justification by workes or inherent righteousnesse is not that which the Scriptures teach, we must therefore say with <note n="o" place="margin">Ambr. de Iacob. &amp; vitabeata. l. 1. c. 6.

And therefore I will glory in Christ. I will not glory because I am just, but I will glory, because I am redeemed. I will glory, not that I am without sinne, but because my sinnes are forgiven mee. I will not glory because I have beene profitable, or because any other hath profited me, but because Christ is an Advocate for me with the Father, and because his bloud was shed for me.</p>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:22501:112"/>§. XIII. Our eleventh argument: If there be no justification but by righteousnes inherent, and that also perfect and pure, then is justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promised upon an impossible condition, and so consequently the promise should be void and of none effect. But farre be it from us to thinke, that the promise of justification by Christ is void and of none effect. Therefore wee are not justified by workes, or by righteousnesse inherent, but by faith, that the promise might bee sure to all the seed, as the Apostle reasoneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. Our twelfth argument: because unto justification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth<note place="margin">Twelfthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne is a necessary part of iustification.</note> remission of sinnes, as a necessary part thereof: from whence three arguments arise, First, true justification is not without remission of sinne. The popish justification by infusion of perfect righteousnesse is without remission of sinne. For although they pretend that to their justification concurreth remission of sinne: yet by remission they not understanding the pardoning or forgiving, but the extinction and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of sinne, have utterly excluded from justification the forgivenesse of sinne, as I have shewed before. Secondly, unto true justification ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily concurreth remission of sinne. And where is remission of sin, there is imputation of righteousnesse without workes. But in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish justification there needeth no imputation of righteousnesse; and that for two reasons, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth prosecute at large in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against imputation. The one, because in justification by infusion of righteousnesse, sinne is fully expelled, and therefore no need of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. And secondly, because the righteousnesse which is infused is perfect of it selfe without imputation of any other righteousnesse. Thirdly, if our justification and blessednesse doth consist in the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our sinnes, as it doth <hi>Rom. 4. 6, 7. ex Psal.</hi> 32. 1. then not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect inherent righteousnesse: for where is neede of the forgivenesse of sinne, there is no perfect righteousnesse inherent. And where perfect righteousnesse is infused, there needeth not imputation of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>§. XV. Our thirteenth argument. If <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>Not <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose example was a samplar in this behalfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24.

As the Apostle proveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. For to whom righteousnesse is imputed of grace through faith, he is not justified by workes before God: And contrariwise whosoever is justified by workes, to him the reward of righteousnesse is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of grace, but rendred as a due and deserved debt, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:22501:113"/>
that which followeth in the text, that he is our Sanctification. These two benefits, as they are here distinguished, so they ought not to bee confounded. <hi>Bernard</hi> in a Sermon of his doth oftentimes very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They onely are wise who are instructed by his doctrine, they onely just who of his mercie have obtained pardon of sinne, those onely temperate or holy, who study to imitate his life; they onely vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who imitate his patience.</p>

For although by justice inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in us we bee truly called and are righteous: notwithstanding we doe not by it satisfie God for our faults and for eternall punishment—And thus,</hi> saith he, <hi>it were not absurd to say, that Christs righteousnesse and merits are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us, when they are given and applied, as if we our selves had satisfied God.</hi> And to that purpose he citeth <note n="t" place="margin">Epist. 190.</note> 
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> who saith, that Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, <hi>ut viz. satisfactio unius omnibus imputetur,</hi> that the satisfaction of one may be imputed to all but addeth this needlesse caution, <hi>modo non negetur,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine, esse in nobis preterea justitium inherentem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ám<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que veram,</hi> so it be not denied that there is in us besides a justice inherent and that true: which, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would stay there, we would yeeld unto. For we doe not deny, that there is a righteousnesse inherent in those that are justified, and that also a true, though not a pure, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and absolute righteousnesse: onely wee deny that we are thereby justified. Wee are indeed just, but by Christs righteousnesse, as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> saith in the same place: <hi>justum me dixerim, sed illius justitiâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. VII. This confession of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dissolveth the very frame of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confession overthroweth the popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> his owne doctrine of justification: whereunto he hath taught, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concurreth but deletion of sinne, and infusion of righteousnesse. And these, not as two acts, but as one act, <hi>viz.</hi> the infusion of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse expelling sinne. As for imputation of Christs righteousnesse, hee and his fellowes deride and scorne it. But here hee confesseth, (which needs must be confessed) that in justification the satisfaction of Christ is imputed unto us, and accepted of God in our behalfe, as if we our selves had satisfied God: and that, for that cause hee is truly called our righteousnesse. And this imputation he acknowledgeth to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because by righteousnesse inherent we doe not satisfie for our sinnes and eternall punishment: We say the same: onely wee adde that this satisfaction made by Christ in our behalfe, is not onely his death and sufferings whereby he satisfied the penalty of the Law, and delivered us
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:22501:114"/>
from the curse, himselfe being made a curse for us: but also the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his person, and the obedience of his life, whereby he perfectly satisfied the justice of God infulfilling the commandements. Now Gods acceptation of Christs satisfaction in our behalfe, whereby he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth us from the guilt of sin and damnation by imputation of Christs sufferings, and his acceptation of us as righteous in Christ, by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his most perfect righteousnesse and obedience, is that very thing, which wee, according to the Scriptures, doe call justification, which distinct benefit of Christ not to be confounded with sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Papists must learne to acknowledge, if they would bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. To these I adde other as plaine testimonies, where it is<note place="margin">

                  </gap>h in the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the old man, and putting on the new) hee saith, that wee argue from the similitude of a garment, as more fitly resembling imputed ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice than inherent: and that we confirme it by the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who being clothed with the rayment of his elder brother, obtained the blessing.</p>
               <p>§. X. To this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shapeth two answers. First, that the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> first answere.</note> of a garment may fitly agree to inherent righteousnesse, which I wil not deny: for in the Scriptures theterme of clothing or putting on, is of a large extent: so that he will confesse, that the Hebrew <hi>Labash</hi> and the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, properly signifying to cloth or to put on apparrell, which is not inherent in the body, but adherent, is more fitly by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphore applyed to signifie outward, than inward indowments. And therefore that I may come to the proofe of my assumption, those phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of putting on Christ and his righteousnesse, figured by <hi>Iacob</hi> his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of his elder brothers apparell, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. of the wedding garment,

(of which place I have spoken before) are most fitly understood of the righteousnesse of Christ imputed unto us, and put on as it were by faith.<note place="margin">His second answere.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. XI. In his second answere <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, <hi>that this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of garments and that example of the Patriarch</hi> Iacob, <hi>may after a sound manner bee accommodated to righteousnesse imputed, if it shall bee said, that it behoueth us to put on, or to be clothed with the merits of Christ: that, being after a sort covered with them, we may aske of God pardon of our sinnes: for as I have said before</hi> (saith he) <hi>Christ alone was able to satisfie for our sins, and indeed in justice did satisfie: and that satisfaction is given and applyed to us, and reputed ours, when weare reconciled unto God and justified. That exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therefore being referred to the righteousnesse of satisfaction for the fault, it may be admitted. But if it be referred to that righteousnesse, whereby wee are formally justified, when of sinners and wicked men we are made just and godly, it is by all meanes to be rejected; seeing it is manifestly repugnant, to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the Fathers, and to reason it selfe. For that one man should satisfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> for another, it may easily be conceived: but that one man should be just, because another is just, was never heard of, and is not onely above, but also against reason,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. XII. Here, as you see, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh a distinction betwixt<note place="margin">Reply to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> the righteousnesse of satisfaction, and that by which wee are formally made just. But what is that righteousnesse of satisfaction? No doubt, that whereby our Saviour satisfied the Law for us; which he was to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, as I have shewed before, not onely in respect of the penalty threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, by his sufferings; but also in respect of the Commandement, by his perfect obedience fulfilling the condition of the promise, Doe this and live. To this, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth the similitude of garments and the example of the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> may fitly be applied: which is as much as wee desire. For this is the whole righteousnesse of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein the Lord imputing to a beleever the sufferings of Christ, covereth, or not imputeth or forgiveth his sinnes and the punishment thereunto belonging; and imputing unto him the perfect obedience of Christ, accepteth of him as righteousnesse in Christ. For it is most certaine, that to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne, them hee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as righteous: and that hee imputeth righteousnesse, to whom hee imputeth not sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7. For as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth, the not imputing of sinne bringeth with it the imputing of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Lord accepteth as well the merits of his obedience, as of his sufferings. And what is that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, whereby he saith we are formally made just? no doubt inherent justice, or the righteousnesse of sanctification, by infusion where of sinne is expelled. To this, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the similitude of apparell and the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> cannot be applyed. For though one may satisfie for another: yet one cannot be formally just by the righteousnesse of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which never any of us (to my knowledge) affirmed. The more
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:22501:115"/>
absurd was <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in thinking so absurdly of us. For because hee confoundeth justification and sanctification, hee would needs beare the world in hand, that wee confounding them also, doe teach, that wee are formally made just by the righteousnesse of another, which is out of us in him. But if justification and sanctification are to be distinguished, as I have proved they must of necessity bee distinguished: then it will appeare manifestly, that, that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth the justice of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, is the whole righteousnesse of justification: and that, by which hee saith wee are formally made righteous, is the righteousnesse of sanctification. Now wee are well content, that the righteousnesse whereby wee are sanctified, or formally made righteous, should not be imputative: so that they will confesse, that the righteousnesse of Christs whole satisfaction, whereby wee are justified before God, is imputed unto us: which they must confesse, or else they cannot bee saved. Here therefore we may sing the triumph, and say; <hi>Magna est veritas &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have I aboundantly proved, that the righteousnesse of<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> God, whereby wee are justified, is not any righteousnesse inherent in us or performed by us: but onely the righteousnesse of Christ our Saviour, which is out of us in him, as being proper to his person; though by imputation communicated to all that truly beleeve in him.</p>

                  <hi>Adam</hi> by his transgression contracted? By this assertion, it seemeth not to be traducted otherwise, than as the fruit and consequent of the actuall disobedience: which was the opinion of <hi>Pighius</hi> and <hi>Catharinus</hi> For as <hi>Adam</hi> by his first transgression, which was the sinne of mankind, contracted not onely the guilt of death, but also the corruption of his nature, being both a privation of originall righteousnesse, and also an evill disposition and pronenesse to all manner of sinne, which is that <hi>macula peccati</hi> remaining in the sinner after the act is gone: so wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinned in <hi>Adam</hi> are not onely made guilty of death, and void of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall righteousnesse; but also are defiled with that habituall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pronenesse to all manner of sinne. So that, according to this assertion, it may be defended, that nothing in our generation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto us with the humane nature but the disobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is communicated by imputation. As for the guilt of death and the inherent coruption, they are not derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by our sinning in him. And hereunto we may apply <hi>Bellarmines</hi> distinction <note n="q" place="margin">De amiss. gra. &amp; statu pec. l. 5. c. 17.</note> of sinne so properly called: that it is either a voluntary transgression, or that blemish which remaineth in the soule, caused and

For in the former sense originall sinne is the voluntary trangression of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed unto us, and is one and the same in all men; in <hi>Adam</hi> actuall and personall, in us originall. For onely he by actuall will committed it, but to us it is communicated, after that manner, by which, that which is past and gone, may bee communicated, to wit, <hi>by imputation.</hi> In the latter sense it is the corruption inherent contracted and caused, as in <hi>Adam</hi> by his personall sinne, so in us by our sinning originally in him, which though it bee alike and equall in all, yet it is every mans owne.</p>

Of the transgression we can be no otherwise partakers than by imputation. For <hi>Adams</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression being an action, and actions continuing, or having a being, no longer than they are in doing, cannot bee traducted or transmitted from <hi>Adam</hi> to his posterity. But the corruption being habituall, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivable by propagation. Now the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. speaketh of <hi>Adams</hi> actuall disobedience once committed by him, by which he saith we are made sinners, that sinne of his being communicated unto us by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and not of the corruption thereupon following. So by the like reason we are made just by the obedience of Christ, which hee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for us in the daies of his flesh, which can no otherwise be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto us, than by imputation.</p>

And this is our justification by imputation of Christs righteousnesse. And further as <hi>Adams</hi> fall deserved, as a just punishment, the defacing of Gods image by inherent corruption in all his posterity, to whom the same corruption is by naturall generation transfused: so the obedience of Christ merited, as a just reward, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of Gods image in us by inherent righteousnesse in all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, into whom the said righteousnesse is in their Spirituall regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on infused. And this is our Sanctification by the Spirit of Christ, of which the Apostle speaketh not untill the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that our justification is alwayes accompanied with Sanctification. In a word from either of the two <hi>Adams</hi> we receive two things, which are contrary each to other. From the first <hi>Adam,</hi> his disobedience is communicated unto us by imputation, whereby wee are made sinners, that is, guilty of sinne and damnation; which guilt is opposite to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and secondly the corruption, which he contracted, is transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto us by carnall generation, which corruption is contrary to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. From the second <hi>Adam,</hi> his obedience is communicated to us by imputation, whereby wee are constituted just, that is, absolved from the guilt of sinne and damnation, and accepted in Christ as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and as heires of eternall life which is the benefit of justification, and secondly, the graces of his holy Spirit, which hee received without measure, are in some measure as it were by influence infused into us by our spirituall regeneration.<note place="margin">This place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> maketh not for him, but most strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note>

               <p>§. VI. Whereas therefore hee would prove out of this place, that justification is the obtayning of righteousnesse inherent. I answer, first, that to be constituted sinners by <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience, is to be made guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sinne and subject to death and damnation: and so contrariwise, to be constituted just or justified by Christs obedience, is to be acquitted from the guilt of sinne and damnation, and to bee accepted unto life: secondly, that wee are constituted sinners by <hi>Adams</hi> personall sinne, which is not inherent in us, but once, and that long since committed by him: so we are justified by Christs personall obedience, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us, but long since performed by him: thirdly, that as wee are truely made sinners by imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression which is not inherent in us: so we are truly made just by imputation of Christs obedience, which is not inherent in us: fourthly, that the disobedience of the first <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed to all his children, because they were in him originally, as the root; so in him they sinned, and therefore when he did fall, they fell: so the second <hi>Adams</hi> obedience is imputed to all the sonnes of God, because by faith they are in him, as his members, the head and the members making but one body. This place therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> maketh wholly against him. Neither doth that,

which he addeth concerning persect, absolute and abundant righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse communicated unto us by Christ, agree to that righteousnesse, which is in herent in us, unperfect and but begunne, as being the first fruits of the Spirit; but to the absolute and most perfect righteousnesse of Christ communicated unto us by imputation.

For howsoever whiles they were Gentiles, they were addicted to many vices and sinnes: yet after they were called (which the Apostle expresseth thus; after that the bounty and humanity of God was manifested, <hi>viz.</hi> by the preaching of the Gospel) God, not out of any desert of theirs, but out of his meere mercy, saved them by Baptisme (as Saint <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> also spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) that is, justified them, for that is the salvation we have here, to bee intitled to salvation, or saved in hope; that being justified by his grace, that is, (as he said before) by his undeserved mercy, they should be made heires, according to hope of eternall life, that is, they might be saved in hope. Of this sentence therefore stripped of its amplifications, as it were its garments, the naked substance is this. But after we were called, God by Baptisme justified us, that being justified by his grace, we might be saved in hope. The amplifications which are added, are to set forth and describe Baptisme unto us: which as hee had noted to be the seale <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> of that righteousnesse which is by faith, when he saith, that God justified or saved us by it: so he calleth it the laver of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and of the renovation wrought by the Spirit, which God hath plentifully bestowed upon us. So that these words are not a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of justification, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dreameth waking, but of Baptisme. And they are added according to the purpose of the Apostle in this place, as arguments to move men to Christian duties. Why? Because Baptisme, as it was a seale unto them of their justification; so also a Sacrament of their regeneration and renovation of the Spirit; which Spirit God hath poured forth plentifully upon the faithfull: which he speaketh to this end, that the faithfull which are Baptized, should make this use of their Baptisme, not onely as of a seale to assure them of their justification and salvation: but also to be a Sacrament, token, memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their regeneration and renovation wrought by the Spirit plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poured upon them.

The former, being the righteousnesse of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the latter, of sanctification: the former, absolute and perfect; the latter, inchoated and unperfect. By the former they were justified before God: in respect of the latter, though they were also called just, yet they were not justified thereby: that is, they were neither absolved thereby from their sinnes past, nor intitled to the kingdome of heaven; as may appeare by all those Arguments which before I produced against justification by inherent righteousnesse. As for those examples, which hee alleageth out of <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> (which is the <hi>Chapter</hi> of saith,) namely of <hi>Abel, vers. 4.</hi> and <hi>Noah, vers. 7. &amp;c.</hi> it is evident, that they were justified by the righteousnesse which is of faith (as is expresly said of <hi>Noah, vers. 7.</hi>) that is, by the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith, and imputed to them that beleeve: for the righteousnefse, which is of faith, is imputative, <hi>Rom. 4. 5.</hi> And when it is said, that without faith they could not possibly have pleased God, <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> it is plainely intimated that by faith they pleased God, and that they being besore justified by faith, brought forth the fruits of faith acceptable unto God. by which their faith was approved. But as they were just by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is to say, justified; so also by infusion, that is, sanctified.

And where is not inherent righteousnesse concurring with faith, there is no justifying faith at all.

               <p>§. XIV. But as touching the righteousnesse of justification, we are not said to beare Christs image. Neither can Christ bee said truely and properly to be justified as we are. For justification properly is of a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:22501:121"/>
sinner, and it consisteth partly in remission of sin. But if in respect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee did beare Christs image, then in imitation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wee might conclude: As Christ was not just, nor made just, so neither are wee. But Christ was not just, nor made just by the benefit of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in like manner neithetare wee just or made just by the benefit of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which is evidently false. But in respect of our justification we may rather use that similitude of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. As Christ was made sinne or a sinner for us, so wee are made righteous with the righteousnesse of God in him. Christ was made a sinner for us, not by inherencie (God forbid!) but by imputation of our sinne. Therefore we are made righteous in our justification, not by inherencie, but by imputation of his righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>§. XV. Secondly, he reasoneth thus: <hi>If wee bee not just by iuberent</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bee.</hi> I answer, first, that whosoever is just by imputation, be is not <hi>putativè</hi> onely iust, but truely and indeed. For though he bee a sinner in himselfe (as all but Papists are) yet hee is righteous, or as the Apostle speaketh the righteousnesse of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21. Secondly, that the faithfull are just, not onely by righteousnesse imputed, which is the righteousnesse of justification: but also in respect of justice inherent, which is the righteousnesse of sanctification, in regard whereof all the faithfull are called Saints, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7,<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 16. 15. 1 Cor. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Phil. 1. 1. 4. 22. 1 Tim. 5. 10.</note> &amp;c. Thirdly, although the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bee sinners in themselves, yet being regenerate and sanctified in part, they have their denomination from their better part, and are called just, though not purely and perfectly just, as I have shewed before.</p>
               <p>§. XVI. His third reason: <hi>Of the earthy Adam, who was a sinner, wee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His third reason</note> 
                  <hi>have borne the true image; because sinne was not in us putativè but truely and indeed: so the true image of Christ wee shall beare, if justice bee inherent in us not putativè; but truely and indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> As wee receive two things from the first <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> the guilt of his sinne communicated, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth, by imputation, by which we were truely made sinners, and truely obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to death and damnation, which is opposite to justification, and by it is taken away: and secondly, the corruption of his nature which hee drew upon himselfe, being propagated by carnall generation, which is opposite to sanctification, and by it in some measure, and by degrees is taken away: so from the second <hi>Adam</hi> we receive also two things, the merits of Christs sufferings and obedience communicated by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which we are truely made just, and heires of eternall life; and the vertue of his death and resurrection derived unto us by spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; by which wee beare the image of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as truely, though not so fully in this life, as by carnall generation wee did beare the image of the first <hi>Adam.</hi> But this withall is to bee observed,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:22501:121"/>
that as we doe beare the image of the first <hi>Adam</hi> in respect of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption derived unto us by generation, and not in respect of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his transgression, for in him we sinned and were guilty of the same transgression with him, it being communicated unto us by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so we do beare the image of the second <hi>Adam</hi> in respect of holinesse and righteousnesse derived unto us from him in our regeneration, by which we are renewed according to his image in true righteousnesse and holinesse) and not in respect of our justification, wherein the same righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and obedience which hee performed in the daies of his flesh is communicated unto us by imputation, and accepted of God in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe as if we had performed the same in our own persons. To conclude therefore, it is not the image of Christs righteousnesse and obedience by which we are justified: But we are justified by the righteousnesse and obedience of Christ it selfe.</p>
               <p>§. XVII. His seventh Allegation of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. 6. is scarce worth<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>For this dying unto sinne, and rising unto righteousnesse are the two parts of our sanctification; which never any denied to bee inherent. But that justification and sanctification are not to bee confounded, I have before<note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> proved at large. If hee would have said any thing to the purpose, he should have said any thing to the purpose, hee should have proved, that our justification consisteth in our mortification and vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and then might he well have concluded, that we are not justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by imputation, but by inherent righteousnesse. But I cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wonder at the blind malice of these men, who either would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselves, or would goe about to perswade others, that we hold the righteousnesse of sanctification and the parts thereof, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be wrought in us by the holy Spirit, not to bee inherent, but imputative.

For as the same Apostle saith Phil.</hi> 3. 20. 21. <hi>wee expect our Saviour who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the body of our humility, configured to the body of his glory. But the adoption of sonnes, which wee expect in the redemption of the body shall be most true and inherent in the body it selfe, that is to say immortality and impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not putative, but true. Therefore the adoption, which now we have in the spirit by justification, must also be true, not putative, otherwise as we expect the redemption of the body, so also wee should expect the redemption of the soule.

This is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> whole dispute word for word: where with much travell he hath brought forth this conclusion that our adoption, which now we have by justification is true, and not in conceit onely: which we freely confesse. For whoever denied, that our adoption is as true, as our justification? But doth it from hence follow, that wee are justified by inherent righteousnesse? A good syllogisme concluding that assertion from those premisses had beene worth his labour. The most that can bee said in this matter, as I suppose, is this. That when our gracious God by his holy Spirit doth regenerate us, he doth beget in us the grace of faith. As soone as faith is wrought in us, wee are engrafted into Christ: to us being in Christ, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth the merits of his Sonne; by imputation of whose righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse unto us, hee, remitting our sinnes, doth not onely accept of us, as righteous in Christ; but also in him hee adopteth us to bee his Sons and heires of eternall life.</p>

Neither doth the Apostle speake of the adoption of the soule, nor yet of the adoption of the body, but of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the body from the servitude of corruption into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the sonnes of God, which is not the adoption of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the fruite of the adoption of the whole man, which here by a Metonymy is called adoption. The former he proveth by the latter not to be imputative, but inherent. <hi>The adoption of sonnes which we expect in the redemption of the body, shall be most true and inherent in the body it selfe, that is to say, immortality and impassibility not putative but true: therefore the adoption which now we have in the spirit by justification, is also true, not putative but inherent. Ans.</hi> In this similitude he should rather have said, that as the adoption of sonnes which we doe expect at the redemption of our bodies, that is, at the resurrection, is the everlasting inheritance whereunto wee were adopted as sonnes, which a true and glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, though not inherent, in the body but enjoyed by the whole man as adherent unto him: so the adoption which we now have in the Spirit by justification, which is the entituling of us to this inheritance, is a true adoption, though not inherent, but wrought by imputation of Christs merits unto us. But suppose the adoption of the body as hee calleth it, were inherent: how doth it follow, that the adoption of the soule, as hee calleth it, should also be inherent? he saith, it must bee so: <hi>Otherwise,</hi> saith he, <hi>as wee expect the redemption of the body: so also we should expect the redemption of the soule</hi> (which the Papists had neede to doe whose soules shall bee in purgatory at the last day, but from thence to be delivered at that day by a gaole-delivery) but I say, it followeth not; for the adoption which is imputative is a most true adoption: and wee need no other, but the accomplishment thereof, which is our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. As for that adoption, which he supposeth to bee inherent, it is a meere fancie.</p>
               <p>§. XXI. Now let us see, what may from that proposition, which<note place="margin">As adoption is imputative, so iustification.</note> was agreed upon betweene us, be truly inferred on our part. Such as is our adoption, such is our justification: but our Adoption is imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and not by inherencie. For as I have shewed heretofore <note n="y" place="margin">

foure benefits, reconciliation, redemption, justification and adoption doe not import any reall mutation in the subject but relative and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putative: for when God imputing to a beleever the merits of his Sonne forgiveth his sinnes, which made him an enemy to God, a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave of sinne and Satan, guilty of sinne and damnation, the childe of the Devill; and receiveth him into his favour, maketh him Christs freeman, accepteth of his as righteous, admitteth him to bee his sonne: he is said to reconcile, to redeeme, to justifie, and to adopt him, not by working any reall or positive change in the party, but relative, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of relation. To be a father, and to be a sonne are relatives: when a man therefore hath first a sonne, hee becommeth a father, which hee was not before, not by any reall change in himselfe, but by a new rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which before he had not. When a man is adopted, he becommeth the sonne of another man, whose sonne he was not before; not by any reall mutation, but onely in regard of relation. For if the party adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God should by adoption bee really changed, then God, who adopteth should also seeme to bee really changed, which is impossible, because he is immutable. For as he which is adopted becommeth the sonne of God, which hee was not before: so God, when he first adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any man, becommeth his father, which hee was not before. Here therefore seemeth to bee a change as well in God adopting, as in the party adopted: not reall, for that is not possible, but relative onely, which is a manifest evidence, that as our Adoption, so our justification is not any reall change wrought in us by infusion of any inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but a relative change wrought without us by imputation of Christs righteousnesse.</p>

The one, that faith is the onely formall cause of justification; the other, that justification consisteth onely in remission of sinnes. For if faith be not the integrall cause formall of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that with it charity and other graces doe concurre, by which as well as by faith we are justified formally; then it followeth, that wee are justified by inherent and habituall righteousnesse, which consisteth in the habits of faith aud charity, and other graces. And if justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth consist, not onely in remission of sins, by which our soules are cleansed from sinne, but also in the renewing of us according to Gods image by infusion of righteousnesse, by which our soules are not onely purged from sinne, but also adorned and beautified with grace; then it followeth, that we are justified by inherent righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>The former question he disputeth <hi>lib. 2. de justif. c.</hi> 4. the title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <hi>fidem non esse integram formalem caussam justificationis,</hi> that faith is not the whole formall cause of justification.

And for this cause, though wee hold not this assertion, yet hee thinkes good to confute it, as if we held it.</p>
               <p>§. II. Of his proofes, onely the first serveth to prove, that, with faith, charity doth concurre unto justification. It is taken out of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5. 6. the fifth verse containing the latter part of the <hi>Antithesis</hi> between justitiaries (who were apostates from the doctrine of grace) and the true prosessours of the Gospell. For the former looked to bee justified by the Law, that is, by obedience performed to the Law, and so were fallen from grace: but the latter looked not to be justified by the Law,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:22501:124"/>
but by faith, that is, by Christs righteousnesse apprehended by faith. Of this <hi>Antithesis</hi> the latter part agreeth to us; the former, to the Papists And therefore I marvell to what purpose he alleaged the fifth verse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it were to confute himselfe. Now in the sixt verse the Apostle sheweth, what manner of faith that is, which justifieth; <hi>viz.</hi> not a dead or a counterfeit, but a lively and effectuall faith: a faith, which is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or effectually worketh by love: a faith, which, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi>

               <p>§. III. But these words <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth wilfully deprave. For in other places hee readeth and understandeth the wordes as wee doe, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the vulgar Latine translation, unto which hee is tyed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Councell of Trent, reading, <hi>fides quae per charitatem operatur,</hi> faith that worketh by charity, as our English Rhemists also translate the words. And to seeke no further, in the very beginning of the next chapter, <note n="c" place="margin">De iustif l 2. c. 5</note> where hee confuteth the erroneous opinion of <hi>Osiander,</hi> who held, that the righteousnesse of Christ, whereby wee are justified, is the essentiall righteousnesse of the Deity dwelling in us: saith, that this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is manifestly refuted by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. proving the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by which wee are justified, to bee faith, <hi>vivam, viz. &amp; per dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem operantem,</hi> to wit a lively faith and <hi>working</hi> by love, and likewise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5, 6. we by faith expect the hope of righteousnesse, for in Christ Iesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love. Whereupon hee inferreth, <hi>quòd si fides per dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem operans, &amp;c.</hi> but if faith <hi>working</hi> by charity be that righteousnesse &amp;c. But here for a poore shift, and to serve his present turne, hee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth the Greeke Participle of the middle voice, as if it were passive, <hi>fides quae agitur,</hi> faith which is acted, moved, formed, and as it were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by love. And therupon inferreth, that charity isthe forme of faith, and that faith justifieth formally, as it is formed by charity, and not otherwise: and consequently, that charity justifieth much more, and hereupon also he buildeth afterwards that distinction of faith, that it is either <hi>formata,</hi> when it is acted by charity; or <hi>informis</hi> when it is severed from it: where also to helpe out the matter, hee saith that the Latine word <hi>operatur</hi> is passively understood (whereof, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, no example can bee given) thereby making the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on barbarous, and understanding it, as never any before him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <note n="h" place="margin">Th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>est operatio.</hi> And these acts are either immediate and <hi>eliciti,</hi> as the Schoolemen speak, or mediate and <hi>imperati.</hi> As for example, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate or elicite acts of justifying faith, are first, to beleeve truly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and by a lively assent, that Iesus the Sonne of the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is the eternall Sonne of God, the Messias and the Saviour of all that beleeve in him. Secondly, because I so beleeve in Christ, to beleeve that hee is my Saviour. Thirdly, by these acts, faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christ, who is our righteousnesse, doth justifie. The mediate acts, which are called <hi>imperati,</hi> are these acts which the immediate acts doe produce <hi>mediantibus aliis virtutibus,</hi> by the mediation of other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For if I beleeve, that Iesus is the Sonne of God and the Saviour of all that beleeve in him, and consequently, that hee is my Saviour: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, I shall be moved to trust in him, as my Saviour; which is the act of affiance, but commanded by faith: and to expect salvation from him, which is the act of hope, but commanded by faith; and likewise to love him, and by love to obey him, which are the acts of charity, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by faith, as here it is said: <hi>faith working by love.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Charity not the forme of faith.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. V. Now those graces, by which faith worketh, as namely chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have not the respect of the formall cause unto faith, but rather of the instrumentall: Neither doth faith worke by them as its forme, but as its instruments; as the soule by the body and the members thereof. But that charity is not indeed the forme of faith, whereby it is acted and formed, it may appeare evidently by these reasons. First, because those, which hold it to be the forme of faith, deny it to bee the inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall forme, whereby faith is that which it is, which onely is the formall cause, and as it were the soule of faith; but extrinsecall, whereby, as they imagine, the acts of faith are informed and so they make it by a strange kinde of Logicke, the forme of all vertues, as well as of faith. Secondly, because one habit disparated from another (as the three Theologicall vertues, faith, hope, and charity, being also, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves say, seated in diverse subjects, as the seat of faith is the mind, of love the heart) cannot possibly be the forme of the other. Thirdly; that habit, which proceedeth from another, as the fruit and effect thereof, cannot bee the forme of that other. But charity, which is the fulfilling
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:22501:125"/>
of the Law, proceedeth from faith unfained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. For therefore doe wee love God, and our neighbour for his sake, because by faith wee are pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>swaded of his love towards us: and therefore doe wee love him, because hee loved us first, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 19 Fourthly, if charity be the forme of faith, then faith is the matter of charity; for the mater is that, which is formed, and as it were animated by the forme: but the consequent is absurd; therefore the antecedent. And againe, howsoever faith wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth those acts, which I called mediate or <hi>imperatos,</hi> by meanes of other graces, which acts doe tend to sanctification, (for which cause, faith doth not sanctifie alone): yet the <hi>actus eliciti,</hi> or immediate acts of faith which are to believe in Christ, and by beleeving, to receive, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him, who is our righteousnesse, to justifie; faith worketh nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by charity, nor by any other grace; and therefore it justifieth alone.</p>
               <p>§. VI. Yea, but without charity, faith is <hi>informis,</hi> &amp; with it, it is <hi>formata.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This distinction of faith, that it is either <hi>formata,</hi> or <hi>informis</hi> in a right sence may bee admitted; as namely, if by forme bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, the integrity, or inward efficacie; and if that be called <hi>formata,</hi> which is sound, unfained, lively and effectuall; and that <hi>informis,</hi> which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> uneffectuall, dead and counterfeit. For that distinction is intimated by the Apostle, when he speaketh, either of faith <hi>unfained,</hi> or contrariwise of a dead faith, for in the former, it is implyed that there is also a fained and a counterfeit faith: and in the latter, that there is also a lively faith. And so wee admit this distinction that faith is either</p>

First, because they propound this distinction, as agreeing to a true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying<note place="margin">In the popish sence it is to be reiected for three reasons.</note> faith, as if a true faith might be without forme: when as that, which is without forme is dead and counterfeit, and no more to bee called a true justifying faith, than the carcase, or counterfeit of a man is to be called a man. For howsoever such a faith may perhaps be true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the object, because it is of the truth: yet it is not true in respect of the integrity, efficacy, and soundnesse thereof, and that which is not truely faith, is not faith <gap reason="foreign">

Hee that saith, either that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth that there is a God, <note n="i" place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> and in deeds doth deny him: and that he is just, and feareth not to offend him; or good, and doth not love him; or <hi>omnipr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He that saith, he knoweth Christ, that is, beleeveth in him, and hath not a desire and care to keep<note n="k" place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 4</note> his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, hee is a lyar, and the truth is not in him. That faith which is dead and counterfeit cannot justifie or save a man, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Iam. 2 14.</note> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For howsoever faith alone doth justifie; yet that faith which is alone doth not justifie; neither alone nor at al, becauseit is not a true and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but a dead and counterfeit faith. Neithercan that be a true justifying faith which is common to the wicked, both men and Angels. Neither may wee omit <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confession in this place. <hi>Here,</hi> saith hee,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:22501:125"/>
                  <hi>the Apostle to prevent occasion of errour, explaineth what manner of faith, that is, that justifieth,</hi> non quaecunque fides, sed quae per dilectionem operatur, <hi>not every faith, but that which worketh by love.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. VII. Secondly, this distinction is to bee rejected being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the popish sense, wherein it is implyed, that charity is the forme, and as it were the soule of faith: which opinion I have already confuted. Neither can they ground it upon <hi>Iames 2. 26. As the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without workes is dead.</hi> For if the habit of charity cannot bee the forme of faith, as I have shewed, then much lesse can good workes, which are the outward fruits both of faith and of charity, bee the soule of faith it selfe. Of the profession indeed of faith a godly life is, as it were, the soule, and without which it is dead: but of faith it selfe it is not <hi>anima</hi> the soule, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the breath, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to breath, doth properly fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, in which sense it is often used, being called the Spirit of the mouth, the spirit of the nostrils. And in this sense it may be said, that as the body without breathing is judged to bee dead; so faith without workes, which are as it were the breathing of a lively faith, is also jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be dead; not because it ever had lived, but because it wanteth life.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Thirdly, this distinction is to bee rejected, because, as<note place="margin">The third Reason.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, it is to be understood of one and the same faith, which being <hi>informis</hi> may become <hi>formata;</hi> and being <hi>formata,</hi> may become <hi>informis</hi> againe, remayning still the same: But <hi>fides informis</hi> is not of the same kinde with that, which is <hi>formata,</hi> or justifying faith: as things which be without life, are not of the same kinde with those that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: or as counterfeits are not of the same kinde with those things which they doe resemble. Besides, justifying faith is divine, the <hi>infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> is humane: that, <hi>infusa,</hi> infused and supernaturall; this, <hi>acquisita,</hi> required by the strength of nature in the use of meanes: that, a grace of regeneration proper to the Elect; this, a gift of illumination onely common to the reprobate: that, is <hi>vera</hi> being truely that whereof it beareth the name; this, <hi>simulata,</hi> not being that truly which it is called, but <hi>aequivocè:</hi> that doth so beleeve in Christ, that it doth imbrace him, and willeth and desireth, at the least, to apply him to the beleever: this, so beleeveth Christ, that either it is joyned with horrour, as in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and desperate sinners, or is severed from any will or desire of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: this, is without fruit and root, and therefore is temporary; that hath both root and fruit, and never faileth. And howsoever that which is <hi>informis</hi> may by Gods grace bee changed into <hi>formatam;</hi> yet that which is <hi>formata</hi> can never be <hi>informis.</hi> No more than hee, who is once borne of God, can be unborne againe.</p>
               <p>The rest of his arguments serve to prove, that faith is not the whole formall cause of justification, that is, as wee speake according to the Scriptures, of sanctification, which we deny not: for wee doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a concurrence of many graces with faith unto sanctification. As for justification, we deny faith, either in whole or in part to bee the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:22501:126"/>
cause thereof. Neither doth any other of his arguments prove, that either charity, or any other grace doth with faith concurre unto justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

For wee doe hold (though all perhaps have not so plainely expressed their meaning and some few have delivered their private opinions) that remission of sinne is but a part of justification: and that by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christs righteousnesse we are both absolved from our sinnes, and also accepted as righteous in Christ and as heires of eternall life. But <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> howsoever he would seeme to acknowledge the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of remission of sinne unto justification, yet indeed excludeth it. For by remission of sinne concurring to justification, hee doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the not imputing or forgiving of sinne, but the extinction and abolition thereof, wrought by the infusion of habituall righteousnesse, which expelleth its contrary, as heat doth cold, and light darkenesse.

For infused righteousnesse, though it were perfect, could not discharge us from our former debts; and being unperfect, as their owne consciences cannot but tell them, it cannot entitle them to the kingdome of heaven. Wherefore if they will be saved, they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity flee to the righteousnesse or satisfaction of Christ, who hath fully satisfied the Law, both in respect of the penalty, by his sufferings, and also in regard of the commandement, by his obedience: which obedience and sufferings, being transient and gone so long since, can no otherwise bee communicated unto them, but by imputation.

As for the mortification of sinne, and the renovation of us according to the image of God in true holinesse and righteousnesse, both which are but in part, and by degrees wrought in us by the Spirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, let them bee acknowledged to bee the two parts of our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>

And this he indevoureth to prove by Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture, by the authority of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

From whence <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argueth thus: <hi>to what the Apostle giveth the name of justification, in that justification consisteth, rather than in that, unto which hee doth not give the name: But to renovation in this place the Apostle doth give the name of justification, and not to remission of sinne: Therefore justification consisteth rather in renovation, than in remission of sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I answere, I thinke good to advertise the reader againe, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here by remission of sinne doth not understand the not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of sinne, or as we in plaine English call it, forgivenesse of sinne: but the utter deletion, the extinction, the totall mortification of sinne. And that hee doth foure times at the least signifie in this one passage. Now I answer, by denying his assumption; because the Apostle in this place doth give the name of justification, neither to remission, nor yet to renovation, which is not mentioned so much as once in all the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Indeed in some other places the Apostle and his Disciple Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doe give the name to remission of sinnes, that is, to the not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sinne, or to the absolving and acquitting from sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. <hi>

But indeed in this place the Apostle doth not propound, by way of exhortation, the death and resurrection of Christ as an example to bee followed in dying to sinne, and rising to righteousnesse represented in Baptisme, as hee doth in the sixth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he exhorteth to sanctification as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable consequent and companion of justification: but by way of Doctrine hee speaketh of the death and resurrection of Christ, as the cause of our justification, of which he had spoken in the whole <hi>Chapter,</hi> and even in the <hi>verses</hi> next going before: that righteousnesse shall bee imputed to us, as well as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> if wee beleeve in him that raised up Iesus our Lord from the dead, who was given by his father and by himselfe to us and for us, that by the obedience of his life untill death, but especially at his death he might satisfie for our sinnes: and was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the dead, that we might be justified and saved by his life which he liveth after his death: Christ by his death and obedience did satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for our sinnes paying a full ransome for them, and so did justifie us meritoriously: and in that sense we are said to bee justified by his bloud<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 5. 9. 19.</note> and by his obedience, both as the matter and merit of our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                        <desc>•…</desc>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rasmuch as one and the same grace</hi> (viz. <hi>charity,) being through the merit of Christ infused and inherent in us, doth both blot out or extinguish our sinnes, and also adorneth the soule with righteousnesse, wherefore though the Apostle might have ascribed both remission and renovation, either to Christs death, or to his resurrection: yet he chose rather distinctly to attribute remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his death, and renovation to his resurrection,</hi> propter similitudinem, <hi>because of the likenesse which the extinction of sinne hath with the death of the body: and spirituall renovation with the resurrection of the body:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I answer briefly; first, that though the death and resurrection of Christ, in respect of their efficacie, though remission and renovation alwayes goission and renovation, then in justification there are two actions proceeding from two causes: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that these foure distinct benefits, remission of sinne, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of us as righteous in Christ, (which are the parts of justification, wrought both of them by imputation of Christs righteousnesse, which is the one and onely forme of justification:) likewise the dying unto sinne or mortification, and the rising of the Sonle from the grave of sinne, which is our first resurrection, or vivification, which are the two parts of sanctification, those foure actions I say proceed from two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that in twofold respects. For remission of sinne is procured by the merit of Christs death; and dying unto sinne is ascribed to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his death: the imputation of Christs merits, whereby wee are both absolved from sinne and accepted as righteous, is ascribed to his resurrection, whereby his merits are applyed unto us for our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the grace of rising from the grave of sinne, to the vertue<note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> of his resurrection: for by the same power, whereby Christ did rise againe, are wee raised from sinne to newnesse of life.</p>
               <p>§. V. His second allegation is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. That as sinne reigned<note place="margin">Testimonie 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21.</note>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:22501:128"/>
unto death, so grace may reign by justice to life everlasting through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord: <hi>where by justice opposed to sin,</hi> he saith, <hi>is meant inward renovation. Ans.</hi> 1. We deny not, but that in all the faithful there is a two fold righteousnesse: the one, imputed, which is the righteousnesse of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: the other, infused and inherent, which is the righteousnesse of sanctification, which he calleth renovation. If therfore the Apostle did speake here of righteousnesse inherent, yet this place would make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against us. For we confesse, that as sin reigneth in the children of disobedience by producing the workes of iniquity: so the grace of God, or the Spirit of grace doth reigne in the faithful by bringing forth the fruits of righteousnes. But this is not the righteousnesse of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that wherein our sanctification doth consist. But indeed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here doth not speake, either only, or chiefly, if at all, of inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Neither doth hee in this place make an opposition or <hi>antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> betweene sinne and righteonsnesse, to which supposition <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument is grounded; but betweene the kingdome of sinne reigning unto death; and the kingdome of grace reigning by righteousnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlasting life through Iesns Christ our Lord. Now the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherein the kingdome of grace especially consisteth, is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of justification by faith, whereupon followeth peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and joy in the holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. 2. which being not our righteousnesse (as all inherent justice is) but the righteousnesse of God, is chiefly, <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> yea in the cause of justification is onely to bee sought after, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. Secondly, as in all the chapter from the twelfth verse to the end, the opposition which is made is of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne to Christs obedience: so in this place, as the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was the cause of death, so Christs obedience, of life: the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is not of inherent righteousnesse to inherent sinne, but of Christs righteousnesse to <hi>Adams</hi> sinne.<note place="margin">Testim. 3. Rom. 6. 13</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. VI. His third allegation is out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. Doe not ye exhibit your members as instruments of iniquity unto sinne; but exhibit your selves to God, as of dead men alive, and your members instruments of justice to God; <hi>where, by righteousnesse,</hi> saith hee, <hi>is understood, something that is inherent, &amp;c.</hi> and that hee goeth about to prove, which no man doubteth of, when indeed hee should prove, not, that there is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse inherent in the faithfull, for that wee freely confesse; but that the righteousnesse, which is inherent, is that, by which wee are justified. But it is evident, that the Apostle speaketh not heere of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of justification, but of the righteousnesse of sanctification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in this Chapter hee doth exhort as to a necessary and unseparable consequent of justification. Neither doth the Apostle heere, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, (as before I observed in setting downe the differences betweene justification and sanctification) exhort us to the righteousnesse of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or the parts thereof, which bee not our duties, but Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous favours: for that were to exhort us to remission of sinne, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to life. But to the righteousnesse of sanctification, and the parts mortification and renovation, and to the particular duties thereof, hee
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:22501:128"/>
doth, both here and in many other places exhort, as namely in his sixth testimony cited o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. VII. His fourth allegation had need to be a good one: for this<note place="margin">Testim. 4. Rom. 8. 10.</note> is the third time that hee hath cited, and recited, and as it were recocted it, out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. The Spirit liveth, because of justification, or as it is in the Greeke, the Spirit is life because of justice. <hi>For justification or justice which maketh us to live, and thereby to worke, cannot be onely remission of sin, but something inward inherent. Answ.</hi> In this place, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. 11. as I shewed before, the Apostle setteth down a double priviledge of those in whom Christ dwelleth by his Spirit, freeing them from the Law of death. The one, in respect of the soule, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. that howsoever the body bee dead, that is, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe expoundeth) mortall, or appointed to death by reason of sin, which the first <hi>Adam</hi> brought in, and by it death, his sinne being imputed to all: yet the soule, (for so the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken when it is opposed to the body) is life, that is, as the <hi>Antithesis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, designed unto life, by reason of that righteousnes of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> by imputation whereof all the faithfull are entituled unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, For as in the former part of the <hi>Antithesis</hi> is not meant the spirituall death of men dead in sinne, (for that is the death of the soule and not of the body, and the Apostle speaketh of those in whom Christ dwelleth) but the corporall death, unto which they also, in whom Christ dwelleth, are subject: so in the latter is meant, not the life of grace or of righteousnesse, but the life of glory. The other priviledge respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the body, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. that after it hath beene dead and turned into dust, the Spirit of him that raised up Christ from death, dwelling in us shall raise unto life eternall our mortall bodies.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. His fifth testimony, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>where, when the Apostle saith</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Testim. 5. Gal. 3. 21.</note> If there had been a Law given which could give life, or justifie (as the Rhemists translate the word <hi>vivificare</hi>) then in very deed, justice should be of Law: <hi>hee doth plainely</hi> (saith he) <hi>demonstrate, that justice from whence justification is named, is something, which giveth life to the soule, and hee doth place the same in motion and action. Answ.</hi> If from this proposition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Apostle, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could have assumed the antecedent that so hee might conclude the consequent: then might hee strongly have concluded against us, that wee are justified by inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But seeing the Apostle doth <hi>tollere anteceden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>,</hi> that is, intendeth to contradict that antecedent; what reason hath <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to argue as hee doth? It is very true, that if the Law could have given us life, that is, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As for his testimonies collected out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> a briefe an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>were<note place="margin">The testimony of <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                  </note> may serve: that hee, not considering the force of the Hebrew and Greeke words, which never in all the Scriptures are used in the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of making righteous by inherent or infused righteousnesse: but resting, as it seemeth, upon the notation and composition of the Latine word <hi>justificare</hi> as not differing in respect thereof from the Verbe <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficare;</hi> doth sometimes more largely extend the signification of the word <hi>justification,</hi> than the Scriptures use it, as including the benefit of sanctification. But it is a most certaine truth, that the word <hi>justificare</hi> being used in the Scriptures translated into Latine as the translation of the Hebrew <hi>Hitsdiq</hi> and of the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> must be understood to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no other thing (if it bee a true translation) than what is meant by the Hebrew and the Greeke; which, as I have shewed before, doe never in all the Scriptures signifie to make just by infusion of righteousnesse. And therefore it cannot be denied, but that it is, and was an oversight in them, who using the word as mentioned in the Scriptures, and from thence borrowing it, extend it to another signification, than that of the originall, wherof it is a translation. I say againe, as I have said before, that the fotce of the Latine word, in this controversie, is no further to be respected, than as it is a translation of the Hebrew and the Greek; and as it is a true translation, it must bee understood no otherwise, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the originall: if it be understood otherwise, then is it not a true translation, neither is the sence of the word divine, but humane. Howbeit; <hi>Augustine</hi> differeth from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of this word, in two things, first, that hee doth not alwaies so use the word; as for example, when hee teacheth, as hee, and the rest of the Fathers often doe) that wee are justified by faith alone, as hereafter <note n="n" place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 9.</note> shall bee shewed, they could not meane, that wee are sanctified by faith alone. Secondly, remission of sinne, which is the not imputing or forgiving of sinne, is by <hi>Augustine</hi> included in the signification of the word, which by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is excluded; who, in stead of remission, hath substituted the extinction and abolition of sinne. So that although he retaine the name, which hee confoundeth with sanctification: yet the thing thereby signified, which is the maine benefit, which wee receive from Christ, by which wee are both delivered from hell, and entitled to heaven, hee hath taken away, as I have heretofore declared. If this answere doe not content the Papists, let them understand; that when the use of any word in the Fathers borrowed from the Scriptures, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:22501:129"/>

               </p>
               <p>§. X. I come to his reasons, which are three. The first, <hi>in every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mutation there are two</hi> termini, a quo, <hi>and</hi> ad quem, <hi>the name being taken from the latter,</hi> as in illumination there is a change from darknesse to light; in calesaction from cold to heate. <hi>Iustistcation is a mutation or change, Therefore in justification there are two</hi> termini, a quo, sc. pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; ad quem, justitia, from which it hath his denomination, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore besides remisston of sinne, there must accrew righteousnesse.</hi> I answer, that mutations are either reall or relative. If hee speake of reall muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I deny the assumption, for I have proved before, that justification is no such mutation. If hee speake of relative mutations, I grant the syllogisme, for even in such there are two termini, as in liberation, <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus a quo,</hi> is bondage, <hi>ad quem</hi> is freedome, in marrying, the change is from being a Batchelor to bee a Husband, from being a Maid to bee a Wife; so in Reconciliation, Redemption, Adoption; and so also in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification there is a change from guilt of sinne to righteousnesse impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: from being guilty of sinne and damnation, to bee accepted as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous unto life: from being the bondslave of sinne and Satan, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to hell and condemnation; to bee not onely made a free-man but also a Citizen of Heaven. In all these are great changes, yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or positive, whereby any inherent forme, either going before, is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, or new acquired; but onely relative.</p>
               <p>§. XI. His second reason may thus bee framed: <hi>If justification bee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His second reason,</note> 
                  <hi>given to us of God, not onely that wee may escape the paines of hell, but also, that wee may obtaine the rewards of the heavenly life: then justification doth not consist onely in the remission of sinnes, which onely freeth from punishment; but giveth not glory:</hi> but the former is true: therefore the latter. <hi>Ans.</hi> All this wee freely confesse: but first, the thing principally intended, <hi>that to justification besides remission of sinnes renovation concurreth,</hi> hee doth not goe about to prove. Onely hee proveth that justification doth not consist in remission onely, in which wee agree with him, though not in the other thing which is to bee added; for wee adde making righteous by imputation; hee, by infusion or renovation. Secondly, the proofes of his assumption wee doe not approve. The first, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. yee have your fruit unto sanctification, but the end everlasting life. The whole verse is this: <hi>But now being made free from sinne and become servants to God,</hi> (that is, being redeemed or justified) <hi>ye have your fruit unto holinesse</hi> (that is, the fruit of your justification is your sanctification) <hi>and the end of</hi> both <hi>is glorification,</hi> or everlasting life. For this text doth neither prove, that justification is not remission of sinne onely; not that it is to bee confounded with sanctification, which is here made the fruit of it;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:22501:130"/>
nor that it conferreth everlasting life. For if the holy Ghost, speaking of justification, had mentioned onely remission of sinne without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning any other thing concurring thereunto (as sometimes hee doth <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39. 26. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 7, 8.) his meaning might be, that being freed from sinne and mancipated <note n="p" place="margin">

And whereas hee saith, that in that order of causes set downe in <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> that place, every latter is the effect of the former, as glorification of justification, justification of vocation, vocation of predestination: that may bee a reason, why in that <hi>serie causarum,</hi> sanctification is left out: because it is not the cause, but the way to glorification, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. and the cognizance and character of them that shalbe glorified. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. 26. 18. his third proofe out of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. there is a Crown of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse laid up for me, is nothing to the purpose. For as <hi>Augustine</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">in Psal. 100.</note> saith <hi>donando delicta fecit se Coronae debitorem,</hi> by pardoning offences hee ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Crowne, and <hi>Bernard,</hi>

               <p>§. XII. But the assumption, though not proved by him, is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and granted by us, as agreeing with that justification, which wee teach: and disagreeing from that, which is taught by the Papists. For wee teach that in justification, by imputation of Christs righteousnesse, wee are both freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation, and also are in Christ accepted as righteous, and as heires of eternall life. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee teach, that howsoever the parts of justification, <hi>viz.</hi> remission of sinne and acceptation unto life, in the faithfull; and the causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Christ, that is to say, his bloud and his obedience, doe alwayes concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>re, for whosoever hath remission of sinnes is also accepted unto life, and contrariwise, and our Saviour in his obeying suffered, and in his sufferings obeyed: yet the causes in Christ, and effects unto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are to bee distinguished. For by imputation of his sufferings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly wee are freed from punishment; and by imputation of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience properly wee are entituled to the kingdome of heaven, as I have shewed heretofore. But in the popish justification there is neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes properly to free them from hell: nor donation of such ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tice, as may entitle them to heaven. For neither the abolition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of sinne present by infusion of righteousnesse, though it were compleate (as it is not) can satisfie for their former sinnes, nor can their righteousnesse, being unperfect, give them right to heaven. But

it is the onely satisfaction of Christ by his righteousnesse and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both Passive and Active, which being communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beleevers by imputation, doth both free them from hell, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them a Title and Right to the Heavenly Kingdome. His proofe taken from the courts of men, I admit as good against them, who holding, that wee are justified onely by the Passive righteousnesse of Christ, doe make justification to bee nothing else but remission of sinnes. <hi>For they whom being guilty in themselves</hi> (as we all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e before God) <hi>a judge doth justifie, are freed indeed from punishment, but they doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtaine new rewards.</hi> Howbeit there is a great dissimilitude betweene Gods justification of men, and that of humane Iudges. For a judge by his absolution, though he doth free the guilty, and indeed faulty parson from punishment, and from the guilt binding him over to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thereby perhaps bewrayeth his owne unjustice: yet he doth not free him from the fault, nor doth he make him righteous, and much lesse doth hee indow him with new priviledges. But when God doth justifie a beleeving sinner, hee doth not onely free him from hell, and from the guilt binding him over to condemnation, by imputation of Christ sufferings: but also by imputation of Christ obedience he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him righteous and an heire of eternall life. And in thus justifying a beleeving sinner, he is just, <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 5. 26.</note> because Christ by his sufferings hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied for his sinnes, and by his obedience hath merited for him eternall life.</p>
               <p>§. XIII. His third reason: <hi>justification, of enemies maketh us Gods</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His third reason.</note> 
                  <hi>friends, children, beloved Citizens of Heaven, the Domesticks of God, heires of his kingdome, as the Scriptures every where speake: therefore it doth not stand onely in remission of sinnes,</hi> Thus farre we agree with him. But as it is a good argument against those who hold justification to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but remission of sinne: so it maketh not for him, who hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth justification by infusion of righteousnesse, but against him. For whereas the Scriptures testifie, that God, when he justifieth men, hee doth of enemies make them his beloved friends, and his children, &amp;c. It is to be confessed, that here is a very great change: but is it reall, or relative? by infusion, or by imputation? Surely, when God reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men unto himselfe and of enemies maketh them his favourites; when he adopteth men, and of the children of the devill, maketh them his owne children; when justifying men hee doth of foes make them his beloved friends, of bondslaves not onely freemen, but also Citizens of heaven; of alients, his Domesticks; of men obnoxious to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heires of his Kingdome, hee doth not these things by infusion of any reall or positive qualities into them: but these are externall favours, which God vouchsafeth unto them, when forgiving their sinnes and imputing unto them the righteousnesse of his Sonne, hee doth in him accept them for such, yea, and in respect of his relation unto them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them such, as before they were not. And when he hath made men such by imputation, he also maketh them such by infusion of such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and dispositions, as are answerable to that which they are called,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:22501:131"/>
as I shewed in the beginning: whom God receiveth into his grace and favour, them hee endueth with grace; whom hee redeemeth from the servitude of sinne and Satan, hee maketh them his faithfull servants; they, who are the sonnes of God by adoption, are also his sonnes by regeneration, and finally, those whom God doth justifie, them also he doth sanctifie.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. And this is all which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath brought for the<note place="margin">Testimonies of Fathers.</note> proofes of justification by inherent and infused righteousnesse, either from the Scriptures or from naturall reason. Afterwards indeed in his eighth Chapter hee produceth the testimonies of <hi>Augustine</hi> and some others, which he calleh the tradition of the ancient Fathers, as if they did agree with the doctrine of the present Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which they doe not. For first, though some of the Latine Fathers, led by the notation of the Latine word, which was not to be respected, it being bnt the translation of the Hebrew and Greeke; did under the name of justification include the benefit of sanctification, whereof there is no example in the Scriptures; yet they did not exclude that, which the Scriptures call justification, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>the Papists doe. For they acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that justification containeth remission of sinnes, and that it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth chiefly in remission of sinnes; that being our happinesse, and therefore implying, besides the not imputing of sinne, acceptation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life. The Papists also talke of remission, but their remission is not that, which the Scriptures and Fathers speake of, for the Scriptures and Fathers and all ancient Writers whatsoever by remission understand <hi>veniam,</hi> pardon, condonation, forgiving, not imputing of sinne, absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from it; which is a distinct action of God from infusion of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; that, being a worke of God without us working no reall or positive change within us: and herein wee have the consent of all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The Papists by remission of sinne understand the expulsion or extinction, the utter deletion or abolition of sinne, which is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct action (as they teach) from infusion of righteousnesse, but one and the same action, which is the infusion of righteousnesse expelling sinne; And is an action of God not without us as the other, but within us working in us a reall and possitive change. And therefore remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne in the Popish sense belongeth not to justification, but to perfect sanctification, as being a totall mortification of sinne, which none attaine unto in this life: but of this point I have already treated in the second <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. &amp; 8:</note> question of the first controversie. Secondly, the fathers oftentimes use the word justification in the same sense that wee doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, as implying the forgivenesse of sinnes, and acceptation unto life by the satisfaction and merits of Christ commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As namely when they teach, as very oft they doe, that we are justified by faith alone: which they could not have taught, if by justifying they had meant sanctifying: for we are not sanctified by faith alone as all confesse. Thirdly, the Fathers did not looke to bee justified before God by any righteousnesse inherent in themselves or performed by them, but renounced it as being unperfect and stained with the flesh.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:22501:131"/>
And therefore where they speake of justification by inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they meant sanctification: and not justification before God, whereof our question is.

Because, as they are justified, they stand just before God in the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse of Christ; by which the weake Christian is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as the strong. And in this regard, the faith of Gods children though unequall in degrees, in some weaker, in some stronger, in some more, and in some lesse, is said by the Apostle <note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note>

And as the merit of Christ is equally imputed to all that beleeve; so the reward in respect of the substance, which is eternall life, shall be equally given to all that beleeve: yet I doubt not, but that whom God in this life hath adomed with greater graces, he will in them crowne his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter graces with greater glory.

Yet all his proofes are to prove the inequality and degrees of sanctity or inherent righteousnesse; as though we denyed the same, or held that paradox, which may in respect of habituall righteousnesse more justly be imputed to the Papists. For if incipients in Religion, yea, infants in age, be justified or made just, as they teach, with perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse infused, what difference shall there bee betwixt Baptized infants and the greatest Proficients among them (who dreame of perfection) in regard of habituall righteousnesse? saving that the infants justice may seeme to bee more pure from actuall concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences.

For they denying, and deriding the imputation of Christs righteousnesse (without which notwithstanding no man can bee saved) doe hold, that men are justified by infusion, and not by imputation of righteousnesse: we on the contrary doe hold, according to the Scriptures, that we are justified before God onely by imputation of Christs righteousnesse, and not by infusion. And our meaning when wee say, that God imputeth Christs righteousnesse unto us, is nothing else but this; that hee graciously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth for us, and in our behalfe the righteousnesse of Christ, both active, that is, his obedience, which in the dayes of his flesh hee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for us; and passive, that is, his sufferings, which he sustained for us, as if we had in our owne persons both performed and suffered the same for our selves. Howbeit we confesse, that the Lord doth infuse righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse into the faithfull; yet not as he justifieth; but as hee sanctifieth them: and consequently wee acknowledge, that in all the faithfull there is true righteousnesse inherent, but we deny that they are justified
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:22501:133"/>
by it. How I am first to prove our assertion, and to maintaine our proofs against the exceptions and cavils of the Papists; And then will I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their allegations.</p>
               <p>§. II. My three first proofes shall bee taken from those things,<note place="margin">The three first proofes.</note> which have already beene proved. And first, those reasons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The first.</note>

               <p>Secondly, If <hi>to justifie</hi> in the Scriptures doth never signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse: or to make a man righteous formally by inherent righteousnesse: then it is evident, that the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which the Scriptures teach, is not by infusion of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

               <p>Thirdly, If we be justified by the righteousnesse of Christ, which is out of us in him, and not by any righteousnesse infused or inherent in us: then it is evident, that we are justified, not by infusion of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but by imputation. But the former I <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> have fully demonstrated: therefore the latter must be confessed.

As for the temporall punishment, which they say remaineth after absolution from the eternall, they must satisfie otherwise. And as for satisfaction to the commandements, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof is the condition of the legall promise <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> by which performance Christ merited for us eternall life: they say, that Christs satisfaction and merit is not imputed, but wee our selves are to merit eternall life. But by the same reason, whereby they have beene forced to acknowledge the necessity of that part of Christs satisfaction made by his sufferings to be imputed to free us from hell, they shall be compelled to confesse the necessity of the imputation of the other part of his satisfaction, which is his obedience to be imputed to us, to merit heaven for us. The reason, why of necessity Christs satisfaction by his death and sufferings must be imputed to us to free us from hell, is this: because nothing can satisfie for our sinnes which infinitely offend God and deserve an infinite punishment, but that onely which is of infinite value. By the same reason, nothing can give us right and title to the kingdome of heaven, which is no lesse an infinite reward, being the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fruition of the infinite good (for God as he gave his Sonne in <hi>preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> so he hath reserved himselfe in <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and most worthy to be insisted upon, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Him (<hi>viz.</hi> Christ the just) who knew no sinne, God made sinne for us; that wee (who are sinners in our selves) might be made the righteousnesse of God in him. Where these two words sinne, and righteousnesse need some explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the explication of the latter, will cleare the former. There being a fit analogy betweene Christs being made sinne, and our being made righteousnesse. But it is evident, that wee are said to bee made righteousnesse, in the abstract, when wee are made righteous in the concrete. And therefore by analogy, when Christ is said to bee made sinne for us, the meaning is, that hee was made a sinner for us. Some, because it seemeth an harsh speech to call Christ a sinner (though not so harsh, when it is said withall, that hee was without sinne) doe rather by sinne understand a sacrifice for sinne, as the word <hi>sinne</hi> sometimes is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which I acknowledge to bee a godly sence; but not so agreeable to the analogie, which is betweene the parts of this text. From this analogy I argue thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>As Christ the righteous, who was without sinne, was made sinne, that is to say, a sinner for us, or if you will, a sacrifice for sinne in our behalfe; so wee who are sinners in our selves, are made the righteousnesse of God in him, that is, righteous in Christ by his righteousnesse:</p>
                  <p>But Christ, who was and is most just, was made a sinner, or a sacrifice of sinne for us by imputation of our sinnes unto him:</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee who are sinners in our selves, are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, by imputation of Christs righteousnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: which is therefore called Gods righteousnesse, because it is the righteousnesse of him who is God.</p>

For our sinnes are imputed to him, not as though he had committed them, or could be held unjust: But they are onely imputed to him in respect of the due debt of satisfying, which hee willingly undertooke: for which hee deserveth not to bee called a sinner, but righteous, for hee that satisfieth for another is most just.

And as for and by our sinnes hee was condemned, as if hee had beene a debtour, that is, a sinner; because as our surety hee volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily undertooke our debt: so by and for his satisfaction, which hee performed for us, and which the Lord accepteth in our behalfe, as if we had performed the same in our owne persons, wee are justified. And yet though our sinnes being imputed to him, he was reputed and as it were made a sinner; and though his righteousnesse being imputed to us wee are made righteous in him: yet this hindreth not, but that hee in himselfe was just, and wee in our selves sinners.

For here it is said, not that wee are made righteous, but righteousnesse, yea Gods righteousnesse, and that not in our selves but in him.

Here therfore the Reader is to observe a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confession, which the evidence of truth hath wrung from <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For, as in the next precedent section, hee confessed the satisfaction of Christ to bee imputed to us: so here hee acknowledgeth, that wee are the righteousnesse of God, which is in Christ, as being the members of that body whereof hee is the head, and consequently partakers of that righteousnesse which is in him: which therefore hee calleth divine or Gods righteousnesse, because the person whose righteousnesse it is, is God.<note place="margin">

               <p>§. X. His second exposition is, that <hi>by the righteousnesse of God is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood righteousnesse inherent in us, which is called Gods, because it is given us of God.</hi> But this exposition cannot stand, because the righteousnesse of Godof which the Apostle speaketh, is neither ours, but Gods; nor in us, in Christ, as the Fathers have testified. But inherent righteousnesse, but though bestowed of God (as all other good things which we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God) is ours, and not inherent in Christ but in ourselves: for as the parts of inherent righteousnesse, or sanctification, though given of God are said to bee ours, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Thess 3. 6.</note> as our faith, our hope, our charity, so the whole righteousnesse which is inherent in us, or sanctification, is called<note place="margin">h <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 3.</note> ours, as I have shewed heretofore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>. Neither are wee in this place called righteousnesse, in respect of righteonsnesse inherent: no more then Christ is called sinne, in respect of any inherent sinnefulnesse. Neither are wee by Gods righteousnesse said to bee righteous in our selves but in Christ. Neither doth Saint <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> whom hee citeth, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this place of righteousnesse inherent, as though such a perfect righteousnesse inherent were given by Christ in this life, as that in the justified no spot of sinne were left, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dreameth: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is rather to bee gathered from the words of <hi>Chrisostome.</hi> For it is Gods righteousnesse, saith hee, when wee are justified, not of workes (that is, not by righteousnesse inherent:) and why so? because in that righteousnesse by which wee are justified, there may no spot bee found: noting, as I understand him, that in our workes and in our inherent righteousnesse spots are to bee fouud: whereas that justice, in respect whereof wee are said to bee the righteousnesse of God in Christ, is without spot.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§. XI. His third exposition, that <hi>by righteousnesse of God is meant inherent righteousnesse; which is so called, because it is the image of Gods righteousnesse. For as Christ by a trope is called sinne, because hee tooke the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of sinnefull flesh, that hee might becometa sacrifice for sinne: so wee by a trope are called Gods righteousnesse, because our righteousnesse inherent is</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:22501:136"/>
                  <hi>like the justice of God.</hi> And hereupon he inferreth, that <hi>as Christ truely and not imputatively tooke the likenesse of sinful flesh, and truely and not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively was made a sacrifice for sinne: so we not imputatively, but truly are made righteous in our justification by righteousnesse inherent. Answere,</hi> In this discourse nothing is sound, nothing almost worth the answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For first, in the Scriptures there is an <hi>Antithesis</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9.</note> betwixt our righteousnesse and Gods righteousnesse in the question of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but our righteousnesse is that, which is inherent: Gods righteousnesse is that, which is out of us in Christ. Secondly, by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse we are righteous in our selves; but by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of God, wee are righteous, not in our selves but in Christ. Thirdly, if by a trope wee are said to be righteousnesse, as Christ by a trope was said to be sinne: undoubtedly it is to bee understood of the same trope, which is a metonymy, the abstract being put for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete. Neither is there the like trope of Christ being called sinne, and of us being called the righteousnesse of God in him, if by sinne in this place be meant a sacrifice for sinne. Fourthly, neither is it true, either that Christ in this place is called <hi>sinne,</hi> because he tooke upon him the similitude of sinfull flesh; as though the Apostle compared our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whereby we become righteous, to Christs incarnation, wherein he tooke upon him our nature; and not to his condemnation, wherein he tooke upon him our sinne: or that wee are called the righteousnesse of God in Christ, because we have some likenesse of his justice: neither would it follow from hence, that wee in our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lves are just; unlesse it should follow also, which were blasphemous to averre, that Christ in himselfe was a sinner. For so are we made righteous, as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e was made sinne. Fifthly, neither is that true, that Christ was not made a sacrifice by imputation. For when he was made a sacrifice for us, our sinne was laid upon him, and imputed to him, as hath beene said; that his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse in like manner, might be imputed to us.</p>

                  <p>But every many whatsoever (Christ onely excepted) is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a sinner, and so continueth, whiles hee remaineth in this life:</p>

               <p>Therefore the justification of every Christian is imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>The assumption of the former syllogisme is denyed by the Papists, but against the testimony of their owne Conscience, and against the common experience of all men, in all times and places. But this I prove it briefly. All that sometimes doe sinne, or have sinne abiding in them, are sinners, all men sometimes do sinne, and have sinne remaining in them, therefore all men are sinners, the assumption is proved by <hi>Iames</hi> the just, and by the holy beloved Apostle; including themselves in many <note n="f" place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note> things wee offend all of us, and if wee say, wee have no sinne <note n="g" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 8.</note> wee deceive our selves and there is no truth in us.

Vnlesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papists will say, they are no sinners, and that in them there is no sinne (which if they doe say, wee may bee bold to tell <note n="i" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 8. 10.</note> them that there is no truth in them) they must confesse justification by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs righteousnesse.</p>

               <p>Here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, <hi>that faith indeed is imputed unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that is our righteousnesse</hi> (which confession doth not well agree with his assertions elsewhere, that faith doth but dispose unto justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that our formall righteousnesse is our charity, that faith is an habit of the Vnderstanding, but justice is an habit of the Will) But our glosse hee doth not allow; when wee say, by faith, that is, by Christs righteousnesse apprehended by faith, <hi>because it is repugnant to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle for two causes. For first hee doth not say, Christs righteousnesse; but faith is imputed. Now faith is not Christs righteousnesse, but ours by Gods gift.</hi> Which notwithstanding is the maine doctrine of the Gospell, <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the righteousnesse of God, that is, of Christ, who is God, from faith to faith, the righteousnesse <note n="l" place="margin">

For faith it selfe is not the righteousnesse of God which doth justifie or save us, but the instrument to receive Gods righteousnesse: and therefore doth not justifie or save properly, but relatively in respect of the object which it doth receive, that is to say, the righteousnesse of Christ, which doth justifie and save those which receive it by faith: and therefore when it is said in the Gospell more than once, thy faith hath saved thee, the meaning is, that Christ received by faith hath saved those which did beleeve in him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16 it is said that faith in Christ had cured the lame man, but it is thus to be understood, that <hi>the name of Christ, by faith in his name</hi> did cure him. For we are justified and saved by a perfect righteousnes, which is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value and merit, which is, not faith nor any other grace or graces inherent, but onely the righteousnesse of Christ. And yet because by faith wee are united to Christ, and by it are made partakers of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; therefore all the benefits which wee receive from Christ are attributed to faith, as elsewhere I have shewed: To faith, metonimical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but properly to Christ himself. His second reason: <hi>because the word</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putare <hi>in this place, doth not signifie a bare reputing, but a reputing unto which the truth is answer able in the thing it selfe, as is plaine by these words,</hi>

Answ.</hi> This reason doth not prove our glosse to bee repugnant to the Apostle, unlesse he imagine, that wee hold the imputation of Christs righteousnesse to a beleever to bee not reall, but imaginary. And then by the same reason let him say, that the imputation of our sinnes to Christ, for which he really suffered and the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression to his posterity for which they are really punished, was but imaginary. Howbeit there is a difference in the manner of imputing a reward to him that worketh, and of righteousnesse to him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for that, is <hi>ex debito:</hi> this <hi>ex gratia.</hi>

And his justice cannot be satisfied for our sinnes, being an infinite offence, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth, but by a price or satisfaction of infinit valew, which can be no other but the perfect and al-sufficient satisfaction of Christ, which the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth in behalfe of all those that beleeve in him, which is nothing else but to impute it to them: for if God should not accept of Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the behalfe of those that beleeve, then in vaine had Christ dyed or satisfied for us. Therefore the faithfull are justified by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>§. IX. Hereunto the Papists have nothing to oppose but their owne erroneous assertion, (which is hereby confuted) that remission of sinne is an utter abolition, extinction, deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>But as in the Law two things are to bee considered, the precept it selfe, and the sanction thereof denouncing punishment to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressout: so in sinne there are two things to be considered, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it selfe which is the transgression of the precept, and the guilt which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth over the sinner to punishment. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is twofold: for it is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transient, which is the sinfull act or transgression it selfe; and partly immanent in the soule of the offendor, which is that <hi>macula</hi> or <hi>labes,</hi> the blemish, spot or pollution, which the act doth leave behind it: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth, the transgressour after the act is gone remaineth formally a sinner. The guilt also is twofold; for it is either <hi>reatus culpae</hi> the guilt of offence or of offending God; and <hi>reatus paenae,</hi> which is the binding over of the sinner unto punishment. Now, God doth take away the sinnes of the faithfull both in respect of the fault and also of the guilt of punishment but not after one manner. He taketh away the guilt by remission of sinne: for in regard of the guilt our sinnes are debts, which debts God doth forgive when hee remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the punishment, and taketh away the guilt, which did bind us over to punishment, by imputation of Christs sufferings unto us: who as our surety did pay our debts for us. And because our Saviour fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied our debt, therefore our sinnes, in respect of the guilt of death, are in our justification wholly taken away, and in that respect there is an utter deletion of them, as there useth to be of debts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As for those places, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleageth to prove remission of sinne to be the totall abolition of sinne. I have fully answered heretofore <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond question of the first controversie, shewing that divers of them are to be understood in respect of the guilt, which in remission is totally abolished. The other which are to bee expounded of the corruption, are understood of the cleansing and purging of our soules from them, either begunne in this life, or finished at the end of this life. For the death of the body bringeth with it in the children of God, the death and utter extinction of sinne. And therefore death which was brought in as a punishment of sinne becommeth a remedy to extinguish sinne. For whiles we live in the mortall body, sinne liveth in us: but when the body dyeth, sinne is extinguished.</p>

But when hee shall beginne to doe good, as it were, covering over his former evils with new good things—he is said to cover sinnes. But when he shall come to a perfect man, insomuch that from the soule the very roote of all wickednesse is cut off, in so much, that no footstep of wickednesse can bee found therein (which never happeneth in this life, for concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence which remayneth in all, is both a footstep of sinne at the least, and the very roote of all iniquity, <hi>Iam. 1. 14.</hi>) where now the summe of perfect blessednesse is promised, then God cannot impute any sinne, which was a private and unsound conceit, as there are many more of <hi>Origen:</hi> from which though we dissent, wee cannot justly bee said to swarve from the doctrine of the Primitive Orthodox Church.</p>

They are remitted by Baptisme, they are covered by Charity, they are not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Martyrdome: which assertion also is unsound: both because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this conceipt, to no man is sinne not imputed, but onely to Martyrs: and also because by Charity hee seemeth to understand, not Gods love, but ours, when notwithstanding it is euident, though our charity cover other mens sinnes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 10. yet our sinnes are to bee covered by the love and mercie of God in Christ. Howbeit in that which followeth, he is moresound, and agreeth with us, <hi>quod tegitur, non videtur: quod non videtur, non imputatur: quod non imputatur, nec punietur</hi> what is covered, is not seene: what is not seene, is not imputed: what is not imputed shall not be punished: where he plainely sheweth that the covering and not imputing of sinne, is the not punishing of it.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:22501:142"/>
which he calleth out of <hi>Augustines</hi> exposition of these words, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intirely cited agreeth wholly with us. For, to omit his exposition of these words a little before set downe, <hi>quorum tecta sunt peccata,</hi> whose sins are covered, that is, saith he, <hi>quorum peccata in oblivione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ducta sunt,</hi> whose sins are brought into oblivion: in the place quoted by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he hath these words. Blessed—are they whose sins are covered: he doth not say in whom no sins are found, but whose sins are covered. The sins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and hid, they are abolished or blotted out (by oblivion, according to his owne former exposition even now alleaged.) If God covered sins, he would not have an eye to them nor animadvert them, if hee would not animadvert them, neither would he punish them <hi>Noluit agnoscere, maluit ignoscere;</hi> he would not take notice of them, he would rather par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered: then follow the words cited by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Ne sic intelligatis, <hi>doe not sounderstand, what he saith,</hi> whose sins are covered, <hi>as though they were there, and lived,</hi> unmortified and unrepented of. For that they bee there still, though mortified, appeareth both by the words before, that they may be found there, though covered; and by his next words, <hi>tecta ergo peccata quare dixit? ut non viderentur: why then did he say that sins are covered?</hi> not, that they be not at all, but, <hi>that they may not be seene. Quid enim erat Dei videre peccata, nisi punire peccata?</hi> for what is Gods seeing of sin, but his punishing of sin? and so on the other side, what is his not seeing or covering of sin, but his not punishing or pardoning it? After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, making way for the exposition of <hi>verse</hi> 3. he saith, that no man is without sin, and that no man can boast that he is cleane from sins. And that therefore men, if they would have their sinnes cured, they must not hide them, like the<note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> Pharisee, who be ing in the Temple, as it were, <hi>in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione medici,</hi> did shew his sound parts, and hid his wounds. <hi>Deus ergo tegat vulnera, noli tu:</hi> let God therefore cover thy wounds, do not thou. For if thou being ashamed wilt cover thy wounds, the Physician will not cure it: then follow the words cited by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the second place, <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus tegat &amp; curet; emplastro enim tegit.</hi> Let the Physician cover and cure: for with a plaister he covereth: then followeth: under the cover of the Physitian the wound is healed: under the cover of him that is wounded, the wound is concealed. From whom doest thou conceale it? from him that knoweth all things. Therfore brethren see what he saith<note n="*" place="margin">vers. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>quum tacut, &amp;c.</hi> because I held my peace my bones are waxen old, &amp;c. where <hi>August.</hi> doth not expound these words, <hi>whose sins are covered,</hi> but sheweth that if wee would have them healed wee should not cover them, but confesse them to our Spirituall Physician, that he covering them with an emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, may cure them: all which we confesse: so that he needed not to quote the two <hi>Gregories</hi> to prove, that God doth, as it were, with a plaister co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and cure our sinnes. But withall we would know of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> what this plaister is. Is it our inherent righteousnesse, as the Papists teach? or is it not the righteousnesse and satisfaction of Christ, by whose stripes<note n="o" place="margin">Esai. 53. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> we are healed? for as I shall shew presently out of <note n="p" place="margin">Ad Diogne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note>

But these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which I have produced, are sufficient for the proofe of the point in question; and them I have defended against his cavils.

This is that pretious treasure of Christians, who so findeth, selleth all he hath, that he may buy it. This is that precious pearle, which who findeth, leaveth all, that he may have it. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I esteemed all other things losse, that I might gaine Christ, not having mine owne righteousnesse, but that which is by the faith of Christ And a little after he saith, that the more holy any men are, so much the more they understand themselves to stand in need of Christ and his righteousnesse vouchsafed to them: and therefore forsaking themselves rest upon Christ alone, &amp;c.</p>

And finally he saith, that if wee speake formally, and properly wee are justified neither by faith nor charity, but by the onely righteousnesse of God in Christ by the onely righteousnesse of Christ communicated to us, and by the onely mercie of God forgiving our sinnes, which, saith he, I have before made evident.</p>

               <p>Neither should this act of imputation seeme strange seeing the practise thereof is usuall among men. For as when the debtour being not able to make payment, if the surety shall pay the whole summe or satisfie for the debt, the sureties payment or satisfaction is imputed to the debtour, and accepted in his behalfe, as if himselfe had discharged the debt. Even so wee being debtours to God, both in respect of the penalty due for our sinnes past, and also of obedience which we owe for the time to come, and being altogether unable either to satisfie the one or performe the other: Christ as our surety fatisfieth both these debts for us, and his satisfaction is imputed unto us, and accepted in our behalfe, as if we in our owne persons had discharged our debt.<note place="margin">Secondly, they cavill at impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative iustice calling it <hi>puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiam.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. II. Whereas in the second place they deride imputed justice, calling it <hi>putatitiam,</hi> as if it were an imaginary righteousnes only: which also, they say, doth both derogate from the glory of God, to whom it were more honourable to make a man truely righteous, than to repute him righteous, who in himselfe is wicked; and also detract from the honour of Christs Spouse, who is onely arraied with her Husbands righteousnesse, as it were a Garment, being in herselfe deformed. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere first, whom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the Lord doth justifie, hee doth indeed and in truth constitute and make them righteous by imputing unto them the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ, no lesse truely and really, than either <hi>Adams</hi> sinne was imputed to us, or our sinnes to Christ, for which hee really suffered. Secondly, whom God justifieth or maketh righteous by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, them also he sanctifieth, or maketh righteous by infusion of a righteousnesse begun in this life, and to bee perfected when this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life is ended. And further, that it is much more for the glory both of Gods justice and of his mercie, when hee justifieth sinners, both to make them pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And as for the Spouse of Christ, as it is most honourable for her to stand righteous before God, not in her owne unperfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, but in the most perfect and absolute righteousnesse of Christ the eternal Son of God, which far surpasseth the righteousnes of al men and Angels: so it is both profitable to her, and honorable to God whiles shee is to continue he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

whose <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> grace is sufficient for her, and whose power is seene in her weakenesse; especially considering, that though her obedience bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, yet, it being upright, it is not only accepted in Christ, by whose perfect obedience imputed her wants are covered, but also graciously rewarded: and also considering, that the remainders of sinne are left <hi>ad agonem,</hi> that having maintained a spirituall warfare against them, and the other enemies of her salvation, and having overcome them, she may receive the Crowne promised to them which overcome.</p>
               <p>§. III. As touching the third, which is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> first objection<note place="margin">Thirdly, that is no where to be found, <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>llar. de iustif. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> in this place, that <hi>it is no where read, that Christs righteousnesse is imputed unto us, or that wee are justified by Christs righteousnesse imputed.</hi> I answer, that as in many other controversies the assertion of neither part is in so many words and syllables expressed in the Scriptures: so neither in this. For where doe the Papists read, either in Scriptures, or Fathers, that our righteousnesse inherent is the formall cause of our justification before God? The contrary whereof, in substance, is so often read, as it is said, that wee are not justified by our workes, or by our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, nor in our selves, nor by a righteousnesse prescribed in the Law in which all inherent righteousnesse is fully and perfectly described. But the substance of our assertion is often read, as namely, First, that when God doth justifie a finner hee imputeth righteousnesse unto him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes, that is, without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in or performed by himselfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. Secondly, that hee justifieth him, not by the parties <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 8, 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</note> owne righteousnesse, or by making him righteous in himselfe, but by the righteoufnesse of another, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, in whom hee is made righteous. Thirdly, that we are justified by the bloud <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. c 19.</note> and by the <hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience, that is the personall righteousnesse of Christ, which neither it selfe, nor yet the merit thereof (without communication wherof no man can be saved) is or can be communicated unto us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by imputation. From whence wee may argue thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The righteoufneffe whereby wee are justified is imputed: for when God doth justifie a man hee imputeth <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 4. 6.</note> righteousnesse unto him.</p>
                  <p>By the righteousnesse of Christ wee are justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. 19.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore the righteousnesse of Christ is imputed unto us. Fourthly, that as by the disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> wee were made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>inners, namely, by the imputation thereof unto us, (for neither the guilt, nor the corruption, nor the punishment, which is death, had belonged to us, if the sinne it selfe had not beene imputed unto us,) so by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ wee are justified, which, if it were not imputed to us, we could by it neither be freed from hell, nor entitled to heaven, nor made inherently just by it. Fifthly, that wee are so made the righteousnesse of God in Christ, as hee was made sinne for us, that is, by imputation. Sixthly, and lastly (to omit other proofes) when the Papists doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that Christs satisfaction is imputed unto us: they confesse as much as wee teach, if it bee rightly understood. For his satisfaction for us is either in respect of the penalty of the Law, to free us from hell; or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:22501:147"/>
of the Commandement, to entitle us to heaven. The penalty hee hath satisfied by his sufferings, which is <hi>obedientia crucis</hi> his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Crosse: the Commandement, by the perfect fulfilling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is <hi>obedientia Legis,</hi> his obedience of the Law. Now <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as I have heretofore shewed, teacheth in his fifth chapter of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke that God accepteth in our behalfe the righteousnesse of Christ, whereby he satisfied for us. And in the tenth chapter, that not ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> righteousnesse doth satisfie for our sinnes, but the righteousnesse of Christ which is imputed to us: and to that purpose citeth <note n="h" place="margin">Epist. 190.</note> 
                  <hi>Bernard.</hi> For if one, faith he, dyed for all; then all were dead, that the satisfaction of that one might bee imputed to all, as hee bare the sinnes of all.<note place="margin">His second and third a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>§. IV. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his second and third argument both tend to prove that for the justification of a sinner there is no need of imputation of Christs righteousnesse: where, in mine opinion, hee might as well have alleaged, that there is no need of a Saviour. For if there bee need of a Saviour, it is to free us from the danger of damna ion, and to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle us to the Kingdome of heaven: both which benefits are implyed in justification. But how should we, who are sinners, and consequently by sinne obnoxious to damnation, and excluded from heaven, bee either acquitted from hell, or made heires of heaven? For neither by our selves nor by any other meanes in the world can we bee freed from hell or have right to heaven, but onely by the death and merits of Christ our onely Saviour, which is so cleare a truth, that the Papists themselves cannot deny it. But how can wee bee freed from hell by Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, or entitled to heaven by his obedience, if the Lord doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his sufferings and obedience in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r: then all that Christ did and suffered for us was in vaine; and in vaine did he take our nature and our sinnes upon him If the Lord doe accept in our behalfe the fufferings and merits of Christ, then doth he impute them unto us. For by imputation, as I haue said, wee meane nothing else. Neither can the sufferings and obedience of Christ, being transient, as I have also shewed before, bee otherwise communicated unto us, but by imputation.</p>
               <p>§. V. But come we to his second argument: <hi>for if,</hi> saith he, <hi>imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                  <hi>bee necessary, it is chiefly for this cause, because a man after remission of sinne remaineth still a sinner, his sinne being covered and not abolished. But when sinnes are remitted, they are not onely covered, but utterly abolished.</hi> But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grossely mistaketh our assertion, as if we held, that sins are first forgiven, and then, after the forgivenesse of sinnes, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is imputed. But wee hold, that by imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse or satisfaction we have remission of sinne, and not otherwise: and therefore that to remission it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For God forgiveth no sinne, nor remitteth the guilt of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for which his justice is not fully satisfied. But wee are not able our selves to satisfie for our sinnes but by eternall punishment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

it is impossible <hi>(salva Dei justitia)</hi> that our sinnes should bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne is not the utter deletion of sinne: the first reason.</note> unlesse Christs satisfaction be imputed unto us.</p>
               <p>§. VI. And whereas still he harpeth on that string that remission of sinne is the utter deletion or abolition of it, to wit, by infusion of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and that therefore imputation of Christs righteousnesse is needlesse; I answere, first, that in sinne two things are considered, the<note place="margin">Of this see more, <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</note> guilt, and the corruption. That in remission of sinne the guilt is fully taken away by imputation of Christs perfect righteousnesse; but the corruption or pollution is not taken away by remission, but by mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and that not fully and at once, but by degrees. And howsoever these two benefits doe alwayes concurre, remission of sinne and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of sinne, (for whosoever are freed from the guilt of sinne are also freed from the dominion of sinne; and to whom the Lord gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth remission, to them hee granteth repentance, Gods forgiving and mans forgoing or forsaking of sinne going alwayes together) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they are by no meanes to be confounded. I confesse that both of them are wrought by the bloud of Christ, and by his death; but in a divers respect. For by the bloud of Christ is meant all that which is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out of his blessed side, which was both bloud and water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 34. which Saint <hi>Ioh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is he that came by water and bloud (even Christ Iesus) not by water onely, but by water and bloud. The bloud of redemption, to redeeme us from the guilt of sinne; and the water of ablution, to purge us from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of sinne. The death also of Christ may be considered, either in respect of the merit thereof, as it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. a price or ransome apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by faith, to redeeme us from the guilt of sinne: or in respect of the vertue and efficacy, as it is a medicine or plaister <note n="i" place="margin">Esay 53. 5.</note> applyed by the Holy Ghost to cure us of the malady of sinne. Both Christ worketh by his bloud and by his death: but the former is done without us, and (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of sinnes past, at once, as when a debt is fully satisfied) the later is wrought in us, as when a disease is cured by degrees.</p>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. §. 13.</note> I have shewed: for where is that mortall man in whom no sinne remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? If the Papists say they have no sinne, Saint <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 8. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> will tell them, that there is no truth in them. Thirdly, in the Scriptures, to remit sinne is not to abolish it but to pardon, <note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 32. 1. 2.</note> and to forgive it, or not to impute it. And further, God is said so to forgive our sinnes, as wee forgive the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of others: which wee doe, when by charity <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</note> we cover them; when we do not remember them with any desire or purpose to revenge them: when we are reconciled to them that offended us. The difference is, that God forgiveth not onely in mercy, but in justice also; forgiving no sinnes but those for which his justice is fully satisfied. He forgiveth therefore those sinnes, for which Christ hath satisfied, he remitteth the punishment to us, which Christ hath borne for us; he covereth them,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:22501:148"/>
but with the robe of Christs righteousnesse: hee is reconciled unto us, but it is Christ, for whose sake he doth forgive our sinnes. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I argue, If remission of sinne bee not the deletion of the sinne it selfe by infusion of righteousnesse, but the not imputing or covering of it, the taking away of the guilt by imputation of Christs satisfaction; then we are justified not by infusion but by imputation: but the former is true; therefore the later.</p>

                  </gap>aith <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Scripture by remission of sinne under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the utter abolishing of sinne, and to that purpose useth all manner of words, which could be devised to expresse the utter deletion of sinne: to which purpose he alleageth many testimonies, all which I have answered <note n="n" place="margin">

               <p>§. VIII. Fourthly, if there be a totall deletion of sin in our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the infusion of righteousnesse; then that righteousnesse which in our justification is infused, is perfect: for the infusion of righteousnesse which is unperfect, cannot cause a totall abolition of sinne. Nay, the imperfection it selfe is a sinne. But it is absurd to imagine, that the righteousnesse which is infused in the first imaginary justification of the Papists; or, as we speake, in our first regeneration is perfect, seeing in our best estate in this life wee receive but the first fruits of the Spirit: and in our first regeneration, which is, as it were, our conception, wee receive but the seeds, as it were, of Gods graces. And therefore to imagine, that in Infants newly Baptized, having not so much as the use of reason, there is perfection or full growth of Faith, Hope, and Charity, when actually they neither can beleeve, hope, or love, surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all absurdity. Especially when they acknowledge a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not onely betweene <hi>viatores,</hi> which are <hi>in via,</hi> that is, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this life; and <hi>comprehensores,</hi> which are in <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now it is apparant that their justification is <hi>incipientium,</hi> even of infants in Baptisme: in whom if there be a totall deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse; then that righteousnesse which in Baptisme is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is perfect, neither can any thing be added to their Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>on of Christs satisfaction is absolutely necessary. His disputation is Sophisticall; wherin he argueth <hi>à posse ad esse:</hi> and worse than so: for where he ought to prove, that the righteousnesse infused in our justification is perfect in all that are justified, and so soone as they are justified; hee proveth, that in some men whom he accounteth perfect, it may in some part of their life, after thay have been good <hi>proficients,</hi> be perfect. But that is not the question: but whether the righteousnesse which in the justification of a sinner is infused, which they call their first justification, be perfect, or not: for if it be unperfect and but begun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it cannot possibly justifie a sinner before God; but for all it, the imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse will be most necessary. But let us follow him in his proofe, such as it is. <hi>Inherent righteousnes,</hi> saith he, <hi>

                     </gap>r inherent righteousnesse may be perfect.</hi> Here againe he disputeth sophistically: First, because, when he should prove, that these habits of grace, when they are infused to justify men (as namely in baptisme) are perfect, and therefore that the imputation of Christs righteousnesse is needlesse: hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that they may bee perfect in some men, in some part of their life: secondly, whiles hee proveth severally the perfection, or rather the possibility of the perfection of this or that vertue: for perfection of inherent righteousnesse is not proved by the perfection of any of these severally, but of them and of all others joyntly. For if there bee imperfection in any of those vertues or graces wherein inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse consisteth, then is not the inherent righteousnesse perfect. But let us see, how he proveth them severally. And first, for Faith: which he proveth may bee perfect in this life: what it may bee in some choise men, and in some part of their life, it is not here questioned, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be perfect, when men are first justified thereby.

                  </gap> and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: here wee lead a mortall life; there an immortall. As therefore our mortall life is swallowed up of immortality, wherby it is perfected, and our growing yeeres by perfect age, our obscure knowledge, and as it were in a glasse, by intuitive aspect: so our faith in the life to come is to bee swallowed up in vision, and our hope in fruition.

If therefore faith shall bee perfected by vision, the consequence of the proposition with the proofe thereof is to be denyed: and the evacuating of it by vision is a pregnant proofe, that in this life it is but in part.

                  <hi>neither staggered at the promise of God through unbeleefe</hi> (as <hi>Zacharias</hi> did <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 20. who notwithstanding his unperfect faith was a man justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>but was strong in faith, being fully perswaded and therefore had</hi>

                  </gap>, is the perfection of faith. <hi>Answ.</hi> first to the proposition, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith when hee was first justified, was not perfect, whatsoever it was afterwards: secondly, to the proofe of it out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. 21. from which testimony it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed proved, that the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had beene for a long time justified, was strong, but not perfect.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the full perswasion of speciall faith, (which goeth beyond the ordinary faith of all Papists,) when thou certainely beleevest, not onely that Christ is the Saviour of all the faithfull, but also that he is thy Saviour, and that by him thou shalt be saved. Now every assurance or assured perswasion is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of which there are many degrees, through which we must strive, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from faith to faith, towards a full assurance: which yet is never so full, but that still more and more may and ought to be added to it. As for <hi>Abraham,</hi> though his faith were strong and excellent, yet was it not perfect: which appeareth by many signes. For if his faith had beene perfect, then it had not needed to have beene strengthened and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Why then did the Lord in every <hi>Chapter</hi> almost of his story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and repeat his promises unto him? Why did hee confirme them by oath? Why did he seale them by the Sacrament of Circumcision, which is the seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith. How came it to passe, if <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was altogether perfect, that twice he used that unlawfull shift, which proceeded out of distrustfull feare: calling his wife, his sister; whom, to save his owne life, he exposeth to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for perfect faith expelleth feare and distrust.</p>
               <p>§. VI. His fifth reason is besides the purpose. For whereas hee<note place="margin">His fifth and sixth reasons.</note> should prove, that the faith of all the faithfull is in their justification perfect; hee proveth, that the faith of some speciall men, who are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended in the Scriptures, as rare examples of a strong faith, was after they had beene justified, <hi>not a weake and a languishing, but a strong and valiant faith:</hi> to which purpose hee alleadgeth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. and thereupon inferreth: <hi>Surely that faith which can overcome the world, resist the Devill, and repell all his fiery darts, must not be a weake or languishing, but a strong and valiant faith.</hi> All which we grant. But yet deny, either that it was so strong when they were first
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:22501:150"/>
justified thereby, or that, when it was at the strongest, it was perfect. But here, by the way, I would faine know of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his consorts, whether this strong faith so much commended in the Scriptures, bee onely a bare assent to the truth of the word and promises of God, or rather an assurance, which wee call speciall faith grounded on the word and promises applyed to our selves? In his last reason, he urgeth againe<note place="margin">His sixth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> the force of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>signifying,</hi> as he saith, <hi>with our consent, a most full and most perfect perswasion.</hi> We acknowledge that it signifieth a full perswasion, which wee call assurance, which is so farre from being in all the Papists, when they are justified, as that none of them have it at all without speciall revelation, which, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, is very rare. But yet of this assurance <note n="o" place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 5.</note> there are degrees; all aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this life, but none attaining to perfection: for when wee have attained to some assurance, wee must still labour <note n="p" place="margin">Phil. 3. 14.</note> to increase it, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving toward perfection. So much of Faith.</p>
               <p>§. VII. <hi>As touching Hope,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the testimony of the Apostle, Heb.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of hope.</note> 6. 19. <hi>may suffice: for there he saith, that our hope must be the anchor, as it were, of our soule, safe and sure.

Sound Hope is safe and sure; because it never confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or maketh ashamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. where, by the way also, I would gladly learne, if there may be such a full assurance of Faith and Hope, (as here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth) and that without speciall revelation; why there may not be the like assurance of Salvation, and of perseverance to Salvation, which elsewhere hee stoutly denieth, and by his denyall confuteth his owne assertion in this place: for if there cannot bee assurance of Salvation, much lesse can there bee perfection of Faith and Hope.</p>

For hee being the great <note n="g" place="margin">Tit. 2. 13. 14,</note> God and our Saviour gave himselfe for us, and therefore gave for us a greater gift, than all the Martyrs put together can give. Secondly, because where Martyrs give their bodies only, that they may save their owne soules: Christ gave himselfe, that is both body and soule for us, that hee might redeeme both our bodies and soules: which both hee did assume, that hee might give both for us: not onely in his body suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering death even the death of the Crosse, but in his soule undergoing, as our surety, the wrath of God for us; the feare whereof brought him into that agony which made him sweat drops of bloud, and the sence of it upon the Crosse made him cry out, My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me? being for a time, in his owne sence, as a man separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, which separation from God is the death of the soule. Now that Christ did thus farre give his soule as well as his body for us, divers of the Fathers, especially those which confute the heresie of the Apollinarists (who denied that Christ had an humane soule) doe teach. <hi>Cyrill</hi> saith, <note n="h" place="margin">De recta fide ad Theodosiam.</note> that Christ gave his flesh a price of ransome for the flesh of all, and his soule likewise a price of ransome for the soules of all. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi>

But against this <hi>larva</hi> Bellarmine fighteth, that <hi>if we being formally unjust by inherent unrighteousnesse, should also be formally just by Imputation of that righteousnesse which is without us: there wee ought not to bee called just, but unjust: as an Ethiopian clothed with white is to be called blacke: because the denomination is to be taken from the inward forme, rather then from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> I answere, that so many as are justified, are also sanctified: and that so many as are justified and sanctified are neither to be termed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally unjust by the remnants of originall sinne remaining in us, nor formally just by Christs righteousnesse imputed. For though it be true, that in respect of sinne remaining and inhabiting in us, wee are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sentence and rigour of the Law, sinners: yet we are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the Gospell, to bee called just, and that by a twofold justice. First and principally, by the perfect righteousnesse of Christ imputed, by which we are justified and doe stand perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God in Christ, being made, as the Apostle speaketh, <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> the righteousnesse of God in him. Secondly, by a righteousnesse begun, by which we are, not justified, but in some measure sanctified: which, though it be unperfect by reason of the flesh ever accompanying it (for the best of us are but partly Spirit, and partly flesh:) yet from it the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination is to be taken, as from the better part: and so the Scriptures call <hi>Iob,</hi> and others just, who notwithstanding acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be sinners. And indeed the more righteous a man is, the more doth he acknowledge <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> and feele his owne sinfulnesse: which is a truth confessed by some of the Papists themselves, as I shewed before out of Cardinall <hi>Contarenus.</hi>

I conclude therefore, that by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> owne confession, wee hold the right. And yet, this is that, which he doth mainely oppugne in his whole disputation, by all the rest of his arguments. If the Papists would sincerely and constantly hold themselves to that, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here yeeldeth, there should not need to bee any controversie betweene us in this behalfe.

But the assumption I doe deny. For it is most tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For although, after our justification wee be, as before we were not, righteous, and that by righteousnesse inherent, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, and all the faithfull are; yet it doth not follow, that wee are justified thereby. For our inherent righteousnesse is a consequent of our justification, and not a cause thereof, not going before <hi>justificandos,</hi> but following <hi>justificatos.</hi> But to this Syllogisme, first, I returne the like. If Christ, though most righteous in himselfe, was not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, but really punished as a sinner, yea made <note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> a sinner and a <note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> curse for us, by taking upon him our sinne, which as our debt was laid upon him, as our surety, and imputed to him: then by the like reason wee, though sinners in our selves, are by imputation of his righteousnesse made righteous before God in him: as before hath evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beene proved <note n="o" place="margin">

And howsoever in the regenerate man there is both the flesh and the Spirit, the Old man and the New, in regard whereof he may in divers respects be termed, either a sinner in respect of the flesh and the fruits thereof, according to the sentence of the Law, or a righteous man in respect of the Spirit and the fruits thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the Gospell: yet the denomination is taken from the better part, as an heape of wheat and chaffe, wherein perhaps is more chaffe than wheat, is called an heape of wheat; and a wedge of gold, wherein perhaps there is more drosse than pure mettall, is called a wedge of gold, as I have said. And whereas upon his premisses this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is inferr'd, therfore after the laver of regeneration we are not <hi>verè</hi> and indeed sinners, nor uncleane in our selves, you may see what Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall conceit the Papists have of themselves, that being once <hi>ex opere operato</hi> justified by their Sacraments, though they neither have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor faith, nor repentance, nor any sanctifying grace in them: yet they are not truely and indeed sinners in themselves, neither is there

any sinne in them. And therefore, unlesse they will play the hypocrites and dally with God, they ought not to pray, as Christ taught his owne Apostles to pray, forgive us our sinnes.

                     </gap>t in her selfe, and not by the beauty of her Husband imputed to her. Answ.</hi> From allegoricall Scriptures no sound argument can bee drawne; especially, when they are not understood. But be it, that by the Spouse is meant the Church of Christ. Is it the Church triumphant, as it mayseeme, when she is said to be <hi>tota pulchra?</hi> then is it to no purpose alleaged. As for the Church militant, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation cannot be verified of it, by reason of many deformed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which be alwayes in the visible Church, besides which the Papists acknowledge no other. But if the Church militant bee meant, then of what time? for it may not be thought, that what is spoken in the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles doth agree to the Church at al times. The Spouse, which somtimes is said to be <hi>tota pulchra,</hi> in other places is said to be blacke: sometimes She enjoyethher Beloved, somtimes She is at a losse: sometimes she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth to her Love, sometimes She neglecteth him. But suppose, she be alwaies and altogether beautiful, (which me thinks should hardly be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of the Church of Rome, besides which they acknowledg no other true Church; especially, when the visible Head therof, the Popes, have beene monsters of men, their Clergie Sodomiticall, their Laity void of all truth and power of Religion, their whole Church in respect of her faith hereticall, in regard of her religion idolatrous, and in respect of both, apostaticall,) but suppose, I say, the true universall Church, which is the company of the elect, to be wholly beautifull? This totall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot be understood of her inherent righteousnesse which is stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and unperfect, but of that righteousnesse which her husband hath imputed and imparted to her, as we heard before<note n="p" place="margin">

               <p>§. IX. Yea, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will prove that this beauty is inherent, first, <hi>because her beauty is described as that which is proper to women; and his as that which is proper to men: and therefore that his beauty is one, and hers another. Secondly, because it is absurd to imagine</hi> (hee absurdly chargeth us) <hi>that the Spouse of Christ is deformed in herselfe, being on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For wee doe acknowledge, that the true Church is beautifull, and that by a twofold beauty; the one, the perfect beauty of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band communicated to her by imputation; the other unperfect and inherent; which being but begun in this life is to be perfected in the life to come: but howsoever this inward beauty be unperfect, yet because it is upright, her Husband is delighted<note n="q" place="margin">

In which respect the Tabernacle of the Congregation was a fit type of the Church militant, which in outward appearance is black and brown like

In regard whereof, in the Creed we professe our selves to beleeve, that she is holy, and that the communion of her members among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and with their head, is the communion of Saints. But that by this inherent righteousnesse, either the Church or any member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is justified before God, we doe utterly deny.</p>

His ninth reason is this: <hi>by justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart is cleansed, that it may be prepared for the vision of God; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be cleane, it cannot see God.</hi> The tenth, <hi>Christ suffered and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for his Church, that he might sanctifie it, Heb. 13. 12. Ephes. 5. 26. Tit. 2. 14. loh. 17. 19. which is not done by imputation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both those objections arise from the wilfull ignorance of the Papists, who will not distinguish justification from sanctification. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of sanctification, of which these places speake, wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be inherent, though that of justification be imputed: and that, (which I have shewed heretofore) as wee are by justification entitled to the kingdome of heaven; so by sanctification we are fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it. We confesse, that the heart must be cleane and pure before it can see God: and that by sanctification begun in this life the heart is prepared, but never fully cleansed untill it come to see God: wee acknowledge, that our sanctification is the end, not onely of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but also of our Election, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. of our creation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation according to Gods image, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. of our vocation 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 7. of our justification and reconciliation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74. 75. That sanctification is the way wherein men being elected, called, justified, are to walke to their glorification. But though it bee <hi>via regni,</hi> yet it is not <hi>causa regnandi:</hi> that our Saviour by his Spirit, doth truly, really, and inherently worke the worke of sanctification in all those that are justified. But I beseech you what is the force of both these arguments? Our hearts must be cleansed by inherent purity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not justified by imputed righteousnesse. Christ dyed and gave himselfe for us, that wee might bee sanctified with true inherent grace: therefore we are not justified by righteousnesse imputed. Christ gave himselfe for us <note n="s" place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> that he might redeeme and justifie us, that being reedeemed <note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 1. 74. 75.</note> and justified wee might worship him in holinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse before him.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth us, that <hi>many other arguments might bee produced; but these,</hi> he saith, <hi>were the principall,</hi> which notwithstanding for the most part were such as deserved with scome to bee rejected, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to bee in good earnest refuted: which neverthelesse argueth not the insufficiencie of the disputant, but the badnesse of the cause, which admitteth no better proofes.</p>

And therefore this they call also an entire faith; because thereby, a man doth not onely beleeve the written word but also unwritten verities, which are the traditions of the Church of Rome, and both of them, not for themselves, but for the authority of the Church propounding them to bee beleeved. Now they teach, that not only for Lay men it is sufficient to beleeve as the Church beleeveth which was the Colliars <note n="r" place="margin">Fides Carbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii.</note> faith so much commended by Cardinall <hi>Hosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

Especially, when they are assaulted by Satan: with whom they say it is not safe to contend by Scriptures, but rather to oppose that onely article against him. As the said learned man, who had opposed the Collyar, found by experience.

way for them, who professe a faith not conformable to the Scriptures to put the Devil to silence, who will rest well content with such an answer: whereas if they should stand to the Scriptures the Devill would be able to confute them. As he did <hi>Luther</hi> (whiles hee was a Papist) in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion concerning the private Masse, which he did, not to teach him the truth, but by true accusations to bring him to despaire.</p>
               <p>§. IV. This doctrine of the Papists concerning implicite faith, is<note place="margin">The doctrine of implicit faith confuted, first as false.</note> both absurdly false, and notoriously wicked. False, in diverse respects. First, in that they say, justifying faith may be without knowledge: when as, first of all, faith it selfe is a kind of knowledge; yea a kind of certaine knowledge: yea, of all others the most certaine knowledge: as I have already shewed; proving, that it is that knowledge which we have by Divine relation or report, grounded on the authority of God speaking in his word. Secondly, because faith oftentimes in the scriptures is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led knowledge, or acknowledgment: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. This is eternall life to know thee the onely true God and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent. Now, we know God in the life to come by vision, in this life by faith, as their owne writers testifie. <hi>Maldonat</hi>

                  </gap> the knowledge or acknowledgement of Christ and his truth, is meant nothing else but faith, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 3, 4. hereby we doe know, that we doe know him, that is, beleeve in him, if we doe keepe his Commandements: he that saith he knoweth him, namely, by faith, and keepeth not his Commandements is a lyar and the truth is not in him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. By faith we understand or know, that the worlds were formed by the Word of God: where the act of faith is expressed by this term of <hi>understanding</hi> that which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. we know, (that is, we beleeve, for otherwise it cannot be known but by faith) that after the dissolution of our earthly tabemacle, we have an eternall habitation in heaven. Thirdly, because in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures faith and knowledge are so linked together, that what we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg we beleeve; &amp; what we beleeve we know, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 69. we beleeve and know that thou art that Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 38. that you may know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the Father is in me, and I in him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 8. they have knowen surely, that I came out from thee (saith Christ unto his Father) and they have beleeved, that thou didst send me. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. to bee received with thankesgiving of them which beleeve and know the truth, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 16. we have knowne and beleeved the love that God hath to us. Fourthly it is not possible that a man should beleeve, acknowledge, or assent firmely to that which he doth not know so much as by relation or hearesay, how can they beleeve in him of whom they
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:22501:159"/>
have not heard, and by hearing knowen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. And who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the assent of faith determineth the judgement to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which is beleeved? As for example, if I beleeve the resurrection, my judgement actually assenteth to that particular. But if I never have so much as heard or understood that God hath revealed such a thing that there shall be a resurrection, how can I possibly beleeve it, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally assent unto it. And therefore implicite faith is so farre from being a justifying faith that it is not so good as the bare historicall faith, which not onely wicked men but the Devils themselves have. For historicall faith hath in it an actuall assent, and implyeth a knowledge (at least by relation) of that which is beleeved. But implicite faith hath neither. Fifthly, to the implicite faith, the definition offaith: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. doth in no sort agree: for as it is so farre from being the substance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, that it doth not so much as know what are the things hoped for, so it is further from being an evidence of things not seene, which implyeth a certaine knowledge of things by relation which are not seen or knowne by sence or reason. Sixthly, that which implyeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is false and absurd: but the profession of the implicite faith made by a simple man, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee beleeveth whatsoever the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church beleeveth, implyeth a contradiction: not onely because hee doth not beleeve every, yea scarce any particular, but also through his ignorance sometimes doth actually beleeve that which the Church doth not beleeve; or doth deny credit to that, which the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth. But here now is the speciall priviledge of implicite faith: <note n="*" place="margin">

Yea, saith hee, that which is more, this faith is meritorious: for such an one should not onely not sinne, but also by so beleeving that which is false hee should me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Thus not onely hee is said to beleeve who indeed doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, nor give assent to the truth; but also he who dissenteth from the truth, even from that which the Church doth hold.</p>
               <p>§. V, Secondly, they are absurd, in saying, that faith may better be defined by ignorance than by knowledge, For <hi>notitia</hi> (knowledge) is the <hi>genus</hi> both of faith and of science, whereas ignorance is a privation of knowledge. It were therefore very strange, if faith, which is an habit of the mind, should be defined by a privation, and namely of that habit, which is the <hi>genus</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Yea, but (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) faith is opposed to science, and therefore better to be defined by ignorance, than by knowledge. I answere, it is opposed to science, not as a privation, that it should bee defined by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but as a <hi>species</hi> of the same kind <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; or made manifest by discourse of reason, which is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being a knowledge of things neither manifest to sence nor reason, but knowne onely by relation from God: where, by the way, you are to observe that the knowledge required in faith is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the cause, such as is in science, but onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is to beleeve the relation to be true, and that whatsoever God revealeth is infallibly true. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by faith our judgements are captivated to yeeld assent to divine revelations, though either they may be above reason, or may seeme to be against sence or reason. For though sence and reason may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: yet the ground of our faith, which is the authority of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived, <hi>nec fidei falsum subesse potest:</hi> neither can the subject of faith be false. As for example: the mysteries of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of our Saviour bee above our reason; the articles of the creation of all things from nothing, and of the resurrection of the body seeme contrary to reason, the article of eternall life contayneth such things, as never eye did see <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> nor eare heare, neither did they ever enter into the heart of man: and so of other articles of Christian religion; which notwithstanding we doe firmely beleeve, and undoubtedly know to be true, as God hath revealed the same, grounding this our faith and knowledge on the authority of God speaking in his Word. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of knowledge being acknowledged, that the knowledge of faith is neither the certaine intelligence of things in themselves mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to sense or reason, nor that science which is <gap reason="foreign">

But I answere, that these things are not well distinguished by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For first, apprehension or conceiving of the object is the common act of the understanding, going before all judgement of the understanding<note place="margin">1.</note> whatsoever. For it is not possible, that the understanding should judge of that, which it hath not apprehended or conceived. And yet, behold, implicite faith is so farre from being a true justifying faith, that it hath not so much as this first and common act of the understanding in it. For it doth not so much as apprehend or conceive the particular things to be beleeved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, judgement and assent are not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.<note place="margin">2.</note> For judgement is more generall, and belongeth to those things that wee doe not assent unto, as well as to those which wee doe.

But this assent, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not to be confounded with faith, because it is more generall. For either we assent to a proposition faintly, imagining that perhaps it may be otherwise, as in contingent propositions, which so are true as that they may bee false. And then our judgement of them, and assent to them, is called opinion: or wee assent firmely, as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that it cannot be otherwise, and this is called knowledge Now, a man knoweth a proposition to be true, and is assured that it cannot be otherwise, being perswaded thereunto, either by the evidence of the thing or by the infallible authority of the propounder.

It is the Pope therefore alone that cannot erre, who hath an heavenly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible judgement, who is the supreame Iudge in all controversies, the chiefe and onely authenticall interpreter of the Scriptures, so that no point of religion is to be held for truth but what he determineth, no text of Scripture to be held the word of God, in any other sense than hee holdeth: yea, that a text of Scripture urged against them in another sense, than he holdeth, is not the word of God, <note n="o" place="margin">Hosius de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.

So that the implicite faith of the Papists, whereby they professe themselves to beleeve what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Church, meaning especially the See of Rome, that is to say the Pope, to be beleeved; and consequently whereby they professe themselves to beleeve in the Pope as the principall rule, principle and foundation of their faith, is the very character and marke of the Beast, whereby men are branded to destruction.<note place="margin">The doctrine os implicite faith pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note>

               <p>§. XVIII. The which doth also prove the other point, <hi>viz.</hi> how pernicious the doctrine of implicite faith is, as tending to the perdition of the seduced people, which I will also prove by other reasons. For under the name of implicite faith they commend unto the Laity dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ignorance; that, having blindfolded them, they may lead them, as it were, by the nose, whither it pleaseth them. To them it is sufficient to beleeve what the Church beleeveth, though they know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Churches beleefe. If one <note n="p" place="margin">Rhemists in Luk. c. 12. 11.</note> of them be called before the Commissioners, hee shall say enough and defend himselfe sufficiently when he answereth that he is a Catholike, and that he will live and dye in that faith which the Catholike Church doth teach, and that this Church can give them a reason of all those things which they demand. And thus according to Christs promise, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 12. the holy Ghost (for sooth) teacheth <note n="q" place="margin">Ibid. in Marg.</note> every unlearned Catholike to give sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his faith. But it is evident, that those who live in ignorance, doe live in a state of damnation, or, as the Scripture speaketh, <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 1. 79.</note> doe sit in darkenesse and in the shadow of death. First, because they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. &amp; 4. 18.</note> as it were Atheists in this world. For they that know not God, have not God. Secondly, because they are void of all grace whereby they might hope to be saved. For knowledge being the first of all graces, where that is wanting, all the rest are absent. Againe, without faith there is no saving grace, for faith is the mother and roote
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:22501:164"/>
of all other graces; and without knowledge there is no faith, as I have already shewed. For how can <hi rend="sup">t</hi> they beleeve in him of whom they have<note place="margin">b <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</note> not heard, and by hearing knowne? Knowledge is, as it were, the first step towards faith and all other graces; and therefore he that hath not that in some measure, hath not made one steppe in the way that leadeth to eternall life. Thirdly, because they are not Christs sheepe, nor Gods children. For I, saith our Saviour, know mine, and I am knowne of mine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 14. They shall know me every one of them saith the Lord, from the greatest to the least of them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE second question concerning the nature of faith is, whether a true justifying faith may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Charity and from all other graces of Sanctification. The Papists hold the affirmative, we the negative.</p>
               <p>The reasons of our assertion, that true justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is ever accompanied with Charity and other graces, and cannot indeed be severed from them, are manifold and manifest.</p>
               <p>My first reason is this: All that are regenerate and borne of God<note place="margin">Our first reason: because he that hath true faith is regenerate.</note> have Charity, and other graces of sanctification.</p>
               <p>All that truly beleeve in Christ, or, which is all one, that have a true justifying faith are regenerate and borne of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore all that truely beleeve in Christ, have charity and other graces of sanctification.</p>
               <p>The proposition is thus proved. Regeneration consisteth in the infusion of graces of sanctification, and therfore they, who are regenerate, are indued with those graces.</p>
               <p>Seondly, regeneration is the renewing of a man according to the image of God in true holinesse and righteousnesse, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. both which are comprehended in Charity. The former, being the love of God; the other, of our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Papists themselves doe teach, that when men are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in baptisme, there is with faith infused Charity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as he that hath Charity is borne of God and knoweth him: so he that hath not Charity knoweth not God, and much lesse is borne of him. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 8..</p>
               <p>The assumption: All that have a true justifying faith are regenerate and borne of God. For first, whosoever beleeveth, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thirdly, All that doe truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve are the children of God by faith in Christ Iesus. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. Fourthly, Faith is a grace of regeneration, which the holy Ghost doth ingenerate and infuse, when hee doth regenerate as the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confesse. Neither is it of nature, or from our selves, but it is the speciall gift of God, <hi>Ephes</hi> 2, 8. for no man can truly say, that is, with a lively and unfained assent of the heart, that Iesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.

               <p>§. III. Thirdly, all that are sanctified are endued with Charity and<note place="margin">Our third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because he is sanctified.</note> other graces, for in them our sanctification doth consist.</p>
               <p>All that have true faith are sanctified. For first, by faith the heart is
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:22501:166"/>
purified, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. and true faith worketh by love, <hi>Galathians</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because all that are justified are also sanctified. All that have a true faith are justified, therefore all that have a true faith are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. The proposition can in no sort be denied by the Papists who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found justification and sanctification. But though they must necessarily be distinguished, yet they may not, they cannot be severed. They are such unseparablecompanions, that whosoever hath the one, hath the other and whosoever hath not both, hath neither: whosoever is in Christ (as all the faithfull are) is a new creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. he liveth not after the flesh but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. He crucifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75.</note> that to all the faithfull the sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> he will give them redemption and justification, and being redeemed hee will give them grace to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of their life. Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom God doth justifie by faith, he doth sanctifie by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>But all that have a true justifying faith are justified, and by their justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication have right, or are entituled to the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39. yea the Gospell teacheth, not onely that they which truely beleeve shall bee saved, but also that they are translated from death to life, and that they have eternall life. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24. &amp; 6. 47. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 11. 13.<note place="margin">Five other reasons.</note>

               <p>True faith worketh by Charity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The formed faith is not severed from Charity as the Papists themselves teach.</p>
               <p>True justifying faith is the formed faith, for that which is without forme is neither atrue nor justifying, but a dead and counterfeit faith.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If faith without Charity doe not justifie, then a true ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith is not without Charity. But the former is true, for that faith which is without Charity profiteth nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the later.</p>

               </p>
               <p>§. V. To these eight arguments wee will adde seven more out of the Epistle of S. <hi>Iames, Chapter</hi> 2. beginning at the 14. <hi>verse:</hi> where, he doth not goe about to prove, that a true justifying faith doth not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie alone, but that that faith, which is alone without Charity, without good workes, doth neither justifie alone, nor at all. And that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by these reasons:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>verse</hi> 14. True faith doth justifie and save a man, that faith which is in profession onely being void of Charity, or, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, when a man saith he hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> faith and hath not workes, doth not justifie or save a man, and therefore is not a true faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>à pari, verse</hi> 15, 16, 17. Charity which is onely in words
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:22501:167"/>
and profession, and not indeed and <note n="g" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 18.</note> truth, is unprofitable and vaine: so <hi>pari ratione,</hi> faith which is onely in profession, being alone, void of Charity and of good workes, is dead.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>verse</hi> 18. True faith may be demonstrated by good workes, but that faith which is in profession onely, and void of Charity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonstrated by good workes, therefore it is not a true faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. that faith which is common to devils is no true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, for they beleeve that which they abhorre, whereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">In epistolam Joan. tract. 10.</note> saith, <hi>Fides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christiani, cum dilectione est, daemonis autem sine dilectione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. the dead faith of a vaine man is not a justifying faith: that faith which is without charity is the dead faith of a vaine man; therefore not a justifying faith.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. 22. 23. 24, 25. True justifying faith is such a faith as was that of <hi>Abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ham,</hi> or at least as was that of <hi>Rahab,</hi> that is, fruitfull of good workes: but that which is without Charity and without good workes is not such a faith as that of <hi>Abraham</hi> or of <hi>Rahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>vers. 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> simili.</hi> as the body without spirit is dead, so that faith which is without good workes is dead. Vpon these arguments of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> it doth inevitably follow, that seeing that faith which is severed from Charity, and destitute of good workes is not a true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, therefore a true justifying faith is not severed from Charity, nor destitute of good workes.</p>
               <p>§. VI. These fifteene Arguments, are, as I suppose, without exception.<note place="margin">Sixe other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> First, out of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.</note> Those which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thought he could best answere, hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as our best Arguments, and cavilled with them: they are in number six, the first out of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. That, for want whereof a man declareth himselfe to be without true faith, and to be worse than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell, cannot be separated from a true faith.</p>
               <p>For want of Charity, yea, for want of one branch thereof, which is to provide for a mans owne, especially, those of his owne house, whom the very insidels are wont to provide for, a man declareth himselfe to be without true faith, that is, in Saint <hi>Paules</hi> phrase, hath denyed the faith and is worse than an infidell in that particular: therefore Charity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be separated from true faith.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Bellarmine frameth</hi> an answere, against himselfe, that, <hi>as Chrysostome, and other interpreters doe witnesse, the Apostle speaketh of such, who are said to deny the faith, because they doe not live, as faith doth teach men to live,</hi> (as none doe, who have not Charity, and therefore those who have not Charity, have not faith) <hi>who, as the same Apostle saith,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Tit. 1, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselves to know God, but in deeds deny him:</hi> which also is against himselfe: for how, saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> can such a man be said to beleeve, that denieth God? Therefore, saith he, the wicked deny the faith not in heart or mouth, but indeed; and of them, saith he, writeth Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> whose testimony he alleageth directly against himselfe, <note n="k" place="margin">Homil. 29. in Evang.</note> 
                  <hi>Eos non veraciter credere, &amp; non habere veram fidem, quinon bene operantur:</hi> that they doe not truely beleeve, nor have a true faith, who doe not worke

well. And therefore those that worke ill, as those doe who are without Charity, and namely those who provide not for their domesticks, shew that they have no true faith. But this he salveth with another testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the same <hi>Gregory</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Homil. 38.</note> that many enter into the Church, because they have faith; and yet want the wedding garment, because they have not Charity.

Howbeit, unfitly doth he alleage the Lords not knowing of the wicked, to prove the meaning of our knowing of him. If he speake not of the knowledge of faith, the argument is the stronger, for if he be a lyar, that only saith that he knoweth God and keepeth not his commandements, then much more is hee a lyar, that saith hee knoweth God by faith, and keepeth not his commandements. <hi>Beda</hi> indeed expoundeth this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God of the love of God, which is a fruit and consequent of our faith, <hi>hocest Deum nosse quod amare:</hi> but others, of faith, as <note n="r" place="margin">In Ezek. hom. 22.</note>

                  </gap>, as speaking of a particular; secondly, because hee doth instance in a high degree of that particular, <hi>so that I could remove mountaines,</hi>) then this alegation is impertinent.

               <p>Neither doth our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. say, that if a man had the justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith like a graine of mustard seed, hee should be able to remoove mountaines: for those who have had a great and a strong faith as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Abraham,</hi> have had no such power.

And whereas in the last place hee would prove by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction<note place="margin">two other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</note> of these three, Faith, Hope, and Charity, <hi>verse 13. that hee speaketh of the same faith whereof he had spoken, verse 2. I answere,</hi> first, that it followeth not: for here the Apostle maketh a new comparison of of Charity with Faith and Hope, preferring it before them as greater, both in respect of the breadth or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for whereas the benefit of Faith and Hope respecteth <hi>habentem,</hi> him that hath them, Charity is extended to others: and also in respect of the length, or continuance. For whereas Faith and Hope doe cease in the life to come, faith being
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:22501:171"/>
swallowed up in vision, and hope in fruition: love neverthelesse is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with increase.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this place maketh rather against him. Now saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that is, during this life, these three abide, none of them failing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in this life, and therefore they alwayes goe together; insomuch that whosoever hath any one of them, hath al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

No man can have love or hope, unlesse he have faith: and no man hath true saith, but he hath both love and hope; and according to the measure of his faith, such is the measure both of his love and of his hope. For as that of<note n="d" place="margin">Sup. Ezek. bom. 22.</note>

                  </note> And this appeareth <hi>vers.</hi> 14. where the question, disputed in that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, is propounded. What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man shall say, that hee hath faith, or professeth himselfe to beleeve, and hath not workes, can <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that faith of his, which is in profession onely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes, save him, or justifie him? No, by no meanes, for this affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative interrogation is a most emphaticall negation. This place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prooveth the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that faith which is wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hout workes is not a true justifying faith, and therefore a true justifying faith cannot be without workes.</p>
               <p>But that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of a true faith, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> endevoureth to prove by five reasons against the maine drift of the Apostle in that place, which, as I shewed before, was to prove, that such a faith, as is without workes, is not a true justifying faith. His first reason is, <hi>because Saint Iames calleth it absolutely faith, which name in the Scriptures alw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>yes signifieth the true faith,</hi> that is, (or else hee speaketh to no purpose) the true justifying faith. First, I answer, that Saint <hi>Iames verse</hi> 14. doth not absolutely call it faith: for he doth not say, if a man have faith, meaning a true faith; but if a man shall say, that hee hath faith, can that faith which is in profession only, save him? And so in the verses following, the faith which hee impleadeth, doth not signifie the habi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of true faith, but the bare profession of faith. But doth this word faith alwaies in the Scriptures fignifie the true justifying faith? Nothing lesse: for many times in the New Testament, and almost alwayes in the Old, faith is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for fidel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ans.</hi> As I said before out of <hi>ver.</hi> 14. by faith we are here to understand faith professed, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith. And to be justified is here understood <hi>declarativè.</hi> Now to declare a man before men to be justified before God, two things are required, the profession of the faith, and a Christian life answerable to his profession: and thus faith professed cooperateth with workes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a man to bee justified. For neither works alone without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the faith will doe it, for workes without faith are dead,<note n="l" place="margin">Chrysoft. de fide &amp; lege.</note> nor the profession of the faith without workes; for such a profession is also dead; but both must goe together.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, saith he, <hi>this is proved by</hi> two comparisons, which hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>examples.</hi> The former vers. 15. 16. which hee doth very sorrily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse: first, saith he, <hi>he compareth a man having faith without workes, to him, who seeing the poore wanting food and rayment, is content with that knowledge, and giveth them no almes. For even as it profiteth nothing the poore that the rich know their want, although it be a most true knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, according to that knowledge, they bestow upon them necessaries: so true faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> nothing, unlesse a man doe study and endeavour to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it.</hi> Frigidè admodum &amp; dilutè. For where doth Saint <hi>Iames</hi> compare true faith to these rich mens idle knowledge? But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison plainely standeth thus. As the profession of charity in giving good words to the poore that want food and raiment (depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled) is vaine and unprofitable, if men do not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly give them somewhat to supply their necessities: so the profession of faith without workes is dead. As therefore that charity which is in word and not in deed, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:22501:172"/>
and dead. Secondly, saith he, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> compareth faith without works to a body without Spirit, which certainely is a true body, though it be dead. <hi>Answ.</hi> this also is contrary to the intendment of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> who therefore p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oveth, that faith which is without works, to be no true justifying faith, because it is dead. For the profession of faith without workes is like to a mans body that is without Spirit: yea but saith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> a dead body is a true body, and a dead faith is a true faith. I answere as before. A dead carcase though it bee a true body in respect of his three dimensions, and of his composition of the Elements, yet it is not the true originall body of a man (for a man is a living creature) no more than a dead branch or bough is a true member of a living Tree.<note place="margin">His fourth proofe, because in the Church there are both good and bad.</note>

And wheras <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it for granted, that all in the Church have faith, and that none want it, but such as have lost it, as it is lost, they say, by every act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity: hereby is discovered the most pernicious doctrine of the Church of Rome, whereby innumerable soules are nuzzled in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, infidelity and impenitencio to their utter ruine and perdition. For they teach, that all that are baptized are <hi>ex opere operato</hi> justified by infusion of Faith Hope and Charity; in which estate they remaine, untill they commit some mortall sinne, then indeed they lose their
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:22501:172"/>
charity and their justification, but they retaine their faith, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in Baptisme, and still are to be accounted faithfull men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; though they know nothing, nor actually beleeve any thing; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to their Baptisme be added popish education, by which, for the most part, they are taught to beleeve as their Church beleeveth, that being the safest course: which faith disposeth them to justification, directing them after the losse of their charity, wherein their justification consisted, to seeke to the Sacrament of penance, that thereby they may recover their justification. Once a yeere therefore they goe to their priest, to him they formally confesse their grosser sinnes; formally they professe themselves sorry for them: the priest absolveth them from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment, enjoyning them some petite penance, whereby they are to satisfie for the temporall penalty, which remaineth after their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution from the eternall: by the priests absolution they all stand actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally justified, the priest refusing none, though in truth they neither have knowledge, nor faith, nor Repentance, or amendment of life, nor any other Grace, without which, for all their sacramentall justifications (and other they have none) they live and die in a most wofull state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>§. VII. His fifth argument is taken from the proper nature of faith and<note place="margin">His fifth proofe from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith and charity.</note> charitie: <hi>for</hi> saith he, <hi>if faith and charitie cannot be disjoyned, either it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one is of the nature of the other, or else because one necessarily ariseth or springeth from the other: but neither of these may be said; therfore faith and charitie may be severed. Ans.</hi> First, I deny the disjunctive proposition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a third thing may be added; and that is this, or because the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace or regeneration, who is the author and efficient of both, hath unseparably united them in one and the same subject, wherein, working the one, that is faith; with it, and by it he worketh the other. As touching the Assumption, the former part, that the one is not of the nature of the other, it is denied by the Roman-Catholike: the latter; that the one doth not necessarily spring from the other, by the true Catholikes. For the Papists hold, that charitie is the forme of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, without which it neither doth, nor can justifie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they, of all men, ought to hold, that justifying faith cannot be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from charitie. For whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, that charitie is but the outward forme of faith, by which it worketh; I acknowledge no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme, but of artificiall bodies. As for that which is <hi>principium motus,</hi> by which any thing worketh, it is the very <gap reason="foreign">

And such is the unseparable coexistence of the forme and the thing formed, that <hi>posita forma, res ipsa ponatur; sublata forma, res ipsa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, when they teach, that charitie is the forme of justifying faith, and yet that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith may be severed from it. The second, that the one doth not necessarily spring from the other, we deny. For true faith doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily and infallibly encline the beleever to love God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:22501:173"/>
for Gods sake. For that faith, whereby we are perswaded of Gods love to us in Christ, cannot but move and encline us to love God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we love God as good, if we doe not first beleeve, that hee is good. And such as is the measure of our faith concerning Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to us, such is the measure of our love to him. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that <hi>saith enclineth and disposeth a man to love;</hi> but saith, <hi>a disposition and inclination</hi> non cogit, <hi>doth not compell a man, but leaveth him free.</hi> As though there were no necessitie, but of coaction or constraint.</p>

godly affection, because true faith embraceth Christ, as he is offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us of his Father: now of his Father hee is made unto us, not onely righteousnesse, to bee received by faith unto justification <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note>; but holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse also to bee applied by his spirit unto sanctification. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that receive Christ receive also his spirit. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that it is true indeed, that he which receiveth Christ receiveth him with his spirit,</hi> sed credendo recipit, i. credit illum habere spiritum sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis, <hi>but he receiveth by beleeving, that is, he beleeveth, that Christ hath aspirit of sanctification; but from hence it doth not follow, that the spirit of sanctification is alwaies with faith in a man, unlesse it be objectively, even as health is in a sicke man (that hath it not) when he thinketh of it, and desireth it.</hi> Thus, in popish divinitie, to receive the spirit of Christ, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Christ hath a spirit of sanctification; but not to be partaker thereof, or to have the communion of the holy Ghost; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all those have, who truely beleeve in Christ. For all that truely beleeve are the sonnes <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§. X. His sixth argument is taken from <hi>an absurditie which,</hi> he saith, <hi>followeth upon our doctrine. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>they doe therefore contend, that a man is justified by faith onely, because if justification depended upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of works or our obedience of the Law, no man could be certaine of his justification:</hi> (to which effect the Apostle argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.) <hi>And because they beleeve, that justification consisteth in this certaintie, therefore it wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ld follow, that justification is impossible. But if faith necessarily must bee joyned with charitie and good workes, so that otherwise it is not faith, but a shadow or counterfeit of it: then it followeth, that justification, in that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon a true faith, doth also depend upon works, and upon love which is the fulfilling of the Lawe; and consequently, that no man can be certaine of his justification, but that justification is a thing altogether impossible.</hi> And in this argument he doth so please himselfe, that he concludeth with this Epiphonema: <hi>forsooth so stable is the dogmaticall building of heretikes, that on each side it threatneth ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere briefly by distinction; that justification is either before God <hi>in foro coelesti,</hi> or in the Court of our owne Conscience. Before God, when the Lord imputing the perfect righteousnesse of Christ to a beleeving sinner, absolveth him from the guilt of his finne and from damnation, and accepteth of him as righteous in Christ, and as an heire of eternall life, and this properly is the justification of a sinner. That justification, which is in the Court of Conscience, is not justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it selfe, but the assurance of it. Howbeit, commonly, men are then said to bee justified, and to have pardon of sinne, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is sealed to their owne Conscience. I deny therefore that our justification before God consisteth in the assurance thereof in our owne
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:22501:174"/>
conscience (for those which truely beleeve, are justified and blessed, whether they be assured thereof or not) or that it dependeth upon our charitie or our owne good works, but that without respect of our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or any worthinesse in us, the Lord doth freely <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> and of his meere grace, even when wee deserve the contrary, justifie us so soone as wee truely beleeve in Christ; that, and no other being the condition of the covenant. And howsoever the assurance of our justification before God, if we were to be justified by our owne obedience, were impossible; because to our justification before God perfect and complete obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is required, which to us by reason of the flesh is impossible: yet the assurance of our justification in our owne conscience is not impossible, but is ordinarily obtained by the children of God, by some more, by some lesse; because it doth not depend upon the perfection, but upon the uprightnesse of our obedience. If wee have a true desire, an unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned purpose, a sincere endevour to walke before God in the obedience of his commandements, though wee faile, contrary to our desire and purpose, in many particulars, wee may thereby make our election, our calling, our justification sure unto us. For by our works our faith is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, and our justification knowne to our selves and others: in which sence Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith we are justified by works.</p>
               <p>§. XI. In the seventh place <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth the <hi>consent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, into whose minde,</hi> hee saith, <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>this absurditie never entred,</hi> that faith cannot be where charitie is not. And yet, for all this bragge, he is not able to produce any one pregnant testimony plainely affirming, that true faith, or justifying faith may bee without charitie: wee doe not deny, but that the faith of Hypocrites and of all other wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinners, which is not a true and a lively but a counterfeit and dead faith (which not properly, but catachrestically, or rather equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally is called faith) is severed from charitie and from all other graces of sanctification. And such is the faith, which the Fathers say may bee severed from charitie. But though hee hath not cited any one pregnant testimony against us, yet one hee hath cited for us in plaine<note place="margin">Gregor. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. homil. 29.</note> termes avouching, that they doe not truely beleeve, nor have true faith, who doe not live well; and to the same purpose I cited <hi>Augustine,</hi> and divers others of the Fathers.</p>

But if it bee a spirituall, lively, and effectuall assent, it worketh upon the heart, that is, both the affections and the will, so that hee which in his judgement truely and effectually assenteth to the truth of the Gospell, that Iesus the Sonne of the Blessed Virgin, is the eternall Sonne of God, the Messias and Saviour of all that truely beleeve in him, doth also in his heart embrace him, heartily desiring to bee made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of him, and in his will unfainedly purposing and resolving to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to bee our Lord and Saviour, and to rest upon him alone for salvation.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that which is faith indeed.</p>
               <p>§. III. Of this faith, whereby wee receive Christ to bee our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">The degrees of faith.</note> there are two degrees: the former, of speciall apprehension, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee receive and embrace Christ, consisting in a lively and effectuall beleefe, whereby we truly receive Christ: in our judgement by a willing assent; in our affections, by an earnest desire to bee made partakers of him and of his merits, which is the desire of application; in our will, by a setled resolution to acknowledge him to bee our Saviour, and to rest upon him for salvation, which is the unfained purpose and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of application. So that in this first degree, though we are not able actually to apply the promise of the Gospell unto our selves; yet that application is both desired, and intended. The other is of actuall and speciall application of the promise to our selves, as having the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the promise. The former is <hi>fides principiorum</hi> being grounded on the expresse Word of God, <hi>whosoever beleeveth in Christ, shall bee saved.</hi> The other is <hi>fides conclusionum,</hi> necessarily deduced from the Word by application, in a practicall syllogisme, after this manner: whosoever beleeveth in Christ shall be saved, which generall is true in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> therefore thou doest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ, thou shalt bee saved: but I, saith the faithfull man, doe beleeve in Christ; therefore I shall be saved: which conclusion cannot be false, the premisses being true. To the former all men are necessarily tied under paine of damnation, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. to the latter none are tied, but they onely, who have the former. For the former is the condition of the promise, which whosoever hath not, he ought not to apply the promise to himselfe, unlesse hee will perniciously deceive himselfe. By the former wee are justified before God in the court of Heaven, which is properly called justification: by the latter we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in the court of our conscience, which is not properly justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:22501:176"/>
but the assurance of it. The former goeth before remission of sinne, the latter followes after. The former is the worke of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he doth <note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12, 13.</note> regenerate us in our first effectuall calling; the latter as hee is the spirit of adoption sealing us <hi>after wee</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>have beleeved.</hi> The former is ordinarily wrought by the hearing of the Word, the holy Ghost opening the <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> heart of the hearer to assent thereto, and not by the ministry of the Sacraments, which being the seales <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which is by faith, were ordained to this purpose to confirme our faith in the application of the promise in particularunto our selves, and in the particular assurance of our justification and salvation by Christ: that those who have the first degree offaith may proceed to the second. For if thou doest truely beleeve, that Christ is the Saviour: thou art bound to beleeve, that hee is thy Saviour; otherwise thou <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 10.</note> makest God a lyar. That therefore thou mayest learne to apply Christ unto thy selfe, God by his minister delivereth to thee in particular the Sacrament as it were a pledge, to assure thee in particular, that as the Minister doth deliver unto thee the outward signe: so the Lord doth communicate unto thee that beleevest according to the first degree of faith, the thing signified, that is to say. Christ with all his merits, to thy justification, sanctification and salvation.</p>
               <p>§. IV. This distinction of the degrees of faith, as it is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,<note place="margin">The use of this distinction.</note> for hereby we are taught how to attaine to assurance of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as elsewhere <note n="q" place="margin">Covenant of grace. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> I have shewed; for having the first degree, which is the condition of the promise, thou maiest apply the promise to thy selfe, and by application attaine to assurance: so it is most true, and most necessary to bee held. And first as touching the former degree,<note place="margin">The former degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> which is the speciall apprehension and embracing of Christ by a lively assent, accompanyed with the desire of the heart and resolution of the will as I have said, that it is that faith, which is the condition of the promise, and by which wee are justified before God, I have proved by plaine testimonies of Scriptures, and other pregnant proofes. The places of Scripture, which I alleaged, were these, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. 17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. 10. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 1. 5. Whereunto may bee added. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 15. Among the manifold proofes, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, this is one; that if there bee no other justifying faith but the speciall faith, whereby wee are assured of the remission of our sinnes; then two absurdities will follow. The one, that wee must apply the promises to our selves, before wee have the condition thereof, which as wee ought not to doe, lest wee play the hypocrites, so wee cannot doe unlesse wee will perniciously deceive our selves. The promise is whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth in Christ hath remission of sinne, whosoever beleeveth in Christ shall bee saved, &amp;c. This promise is made to none but to those who truely beleeve, and are endued with a justifying faith, which is the condition of the promise. It is evident therefore, that a man must bee endued with justifying faith, before hee can apply the promise, and hee must apply the promise before hee can have any assurance by speciall faith. The second absurdity is, that a man must bee assured that his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:22501:176"/>
sinnes be forgiven before they be forgiven; and so must beleeve a lie, yea that a man must bee assured, that they are forgiven, to the end that they may be forgiven, which is a great absurdity. This therefore is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable truth, that before we can either apply the promises, or attaine to assurance of remission of sinne; we must be endued with true justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, which is the condition of the promise, and the meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remission. I must beleeve therefore by a justifying faith, before I can have remission of sinnes; I must have remission of sinnes, before I can have any assurance thereof: and I must ascend by many degrees of assurance, before I come to full assurance; which yet in this life is never so full, but that still more may, and ought to be added to it.</p>
               <p>§. V. As touching the second, which by some is called <hi>speciall</hi> faith,<note place="margin">The speciall faith.</note> not onely in respect of the object, which is Christ, for so the former is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so speciall, but in respect of the effect, which is, by actuall application of the Promises to a mans selfe, to assure him in particular of his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and salvation: It is by some both protestant and popish writers called <hi>fiducia,</hi> that is, affiance. Howbeit the most of our Writers by it meant, assurance. But unproperly howsoever, for neither is faith affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor affiance assurance.</p>
               <p>This speciall apprehension &amp; application of Christ, though scorn'd by the Papists, yet is it, of all graces, the most comfortable, most profitable, most necessary. Most comfortable, for the very life of this life is the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a better life. Most necessary, because without this speciall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ, first, by apprehension, and then by application, we can have no other saving grace. How can we love God, or our neighbour for Gods sake, how can we hope and trust in him, how can we rejoyce in him, or be thankefull to him, if we be not perswaded of his love and bounty towards us? and so of the rest. Most profitable, because from it all other graces proceed; and according to the measure of it, is the measure of all other graces, as I have elsewhere shewed. For if the love of God bee shed abroad in thy heart by the Holy Ghost, that is, if by faith thou art perswaded of Gods love towards thee: thou wilt be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to love the Lord, and thy neighbour for his sake, then wilt thou hope and trust in him, then wilt thou rejoyce in him, and bee thankefull unto him, and so forth. And the greater thy perswasion is of his love and goodnesse towards thee, so much the greater will be thy love, thy hope, thy trust, thy thankefulnesse, thy rejoycing in him, &amp;c. When as therefore the Papists detest and scorne our Doctrine concerning speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith, they doe plainely bewray themselves to have no saving grace, nor any truth or power of Religion in them.</p>
               <p>§. VI. But that this speciall receiving and embracing of Christ by<note place="margin">The speciall receiving of Christ necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> faith is necessary to justification, and that faith doth not justifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, it doth evidently appeare by the third and fourth points before handled, in the fourth and fifth Bookes. For if we be justified only by the righteousnesse of Christ which is out of us in him, then are we not justified by faith as it is an habit or quality inherent in us, but as it is the hand and instrument whereby we receive Christ his righteousnesse:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:22501:177"/>
which, as it is imputed to us by God, so we apprehend it by faith. And because faith alone doth receive Christ and all his merits; therefore the same benefits, which we receive from Christ, and are properly to bee ascribed unto him, as the Authour of them, are in the Scriptures at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed also to faith, because by faith we receive Christ.

               <p>§. VII. But if we doe not receive and embrace Christ by a lively<note place="margin">Without it Christs merits availe us not to justification.</note> assent, at the least, working in our hearts an unfained desire to be made partakers of him, and in our wils a settled resolution to acknowledge him to bee our Saviour, and to rest upon him alone for Salvation, without this speciall apprehension and application; at least in desire and intent: Christ and his merits doe not availe them, that are <hi>adulti,</hi> and come to yeeres of discretion, unlesse it be to their greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: who not caring to lay hold upon Christ and to apprehend and apply his merits unto them, suffer, as much as in them lyeth, his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood to be spilt in vaine, as it is in vaine to them, who doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and seeke to apply it to themselves. For though the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ both active and passive bee a robe of righteousnesse and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:22501:177"/>
our very wedding garment to cover our nakednesse and our sinnes: yet it will not cover us, unlesse it bee put on. Though his stripes and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings be a soveraigne salve to cure our soules, yet it will not cure them unlesse it be apply<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d. Though his Body be meate indeed and his Bloud bee drinke indeed to nourish us unto eternall life; yet they will not yeeld nourishment unto us, unlesse we eate his Body, and drinke his Bloud; all which is done by faith apprehending and applying Christ, whereby we put on him and his righteousnesse, apply the salve of his sufferings, eate his Body and drinke his Bloud. The which, because the Papists want, and wanting reject; they are faine to flee to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formalities, wherein their religion consisteth, and to their <hi>opus operatum</hi> in the Sacraments, as if they without a true and lively faith were able to justifie and to save them; without which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our blessed Saviour himselfe doth not availe men to salvation. He that beleeveth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that beleeveth not being <hi>adultus,</hi> though hee bee baptized and receive all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Romance Church, hee shall notwithstanding be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18, 36. It is therefore plaine and evident, that the faith, which doth justifie, must not bee a bare assent, but a lively beleefe or assent, specially apprehending and embracing, and in desire at the least and purpose applying Christ unto us. For actuall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot bee made untill wee finde our selves to have the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the promise, which is that former degree of faith: which being had, and finding our selves to have it; wee are actually to apply the promise, and by application to gather assurance, which some call spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall faith.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Now let us see what the Papists can object against this<note place="margin">The Papists objections against speciall faith.</note> cleare truth. There are two things, or rather names, which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against, <hi>viz. fides specialis,</hi> and <hi>fiducia,</hi> speciall faith and affiance: which dispute notwithstanding hindreth not anything which I have spoken of the nature of justifying faith, as it justifieth us before God. For of justification, taken in a large sence, there are two degrees, though of that which properly is called justification before God, there neither are nor can bee any degrees, as I have shewed. The former is the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a sinner before God in the Court of Heaven, by imputation of Christs righteousnesse apprehended by a lively assent or beleefe. The second is our justification in the Court of our owne Conscience, when wee are perswaded and in some measure assured of our justification, which assurance, of some, is called <hi>fides specialis,</hi> by which, wee are not first justified before God: but is then wrought in us, when being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy justified by faith, the holy Ghost the Spirit of promise shedding abroad <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> the love of God in our hearts, sealeth us after wee have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. How beit, the former degree of faith is also truely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>speciall,</hi> both in respect of the speciall object which is Christ, and in regard of the speciall effect, which is the speciall apprehension or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Christ, not onely in the judgement by a lively assent, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the heart that is the will and affections, by a desire to bee made
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:22501:178"/>
partaker of him and his merits, and by a setled will and resolution to acknowledge him to bee our Saviour, and to rely upon him alone for salvation. And in this sence that faith by which we are justified before God is a speciall faith. But if that onely be called speciall faith by which we are justified in our owne Consciences, that is, assured of our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that assurance arising from the actuall application of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to our selves: then I say and avouch, that this speciall faith is not that by which we are justified before God. For we must have a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, being the condition of the promise, before we can proceed to application, and first wee must bee justified before God, before wee can have any assurance thereof in our owne Consciences: when as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papists dispute against t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ustified before God, they plead besides the purpose. And yet, for all their proofes, it is truely called a justifying faith, because by it we are justified in the Court of our owne Conscience.<note place="margin">Their objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>fiducia.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>§. IX. The like is to be said of <hi>Fiducia</hi> or affiance which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> against which the Papists hotly dispute: proving, that it is not of the essence of justifying faith: when notwithstanding divers of their owne Writers, as well as of ours, have expounded <hi>credere</hi> by <hi>fidere</hi> and <hi>fides</hi> by <hi>fiducia.</hi> But they should understand, that many of our Writers, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance meane assurance, which is the plerophorie of faith: unproperly, I confesse, but that was their meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for affiance, though it be not of the proper nature and essence of faith: yet it is an unseparable fruit of speciall faith, in so much that sometimes it seemeth to be implyed in the signification of beleeving in Christ: For hee that doth beleeve in Christ, doth first by a lively assent acknowledge him to bee the Saviour of all that truely beleeve in him: and secondly, so beleeving hee is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he is a Saviour to him; and thirdly, beleeving Christ to be his Saviour, doth therefore repose his affiance and trust in him for salvation. But howsoever so much sometimes is implyed in the phrase of beleeving in Christ, yet in the most ordinary and usuall acception of the Word in the Scriptures of the New Testament, no more is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than the lively assent and acknowledging of Christ: yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the phrase is used of those who did not so much as give a lively assent, or beleeved with their heart. Howsoever being convicted by the evidence of truth sealed by miracles, they assented to the truth, and acknowledged Christ to be the Messias. Such were those, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 23. who are said to have beleeved on his name, when they saw the miracles which hee did: to whom notwithstanding our Saviour would give no credit because hee knew what was in them. Such a beleever was <hi>Sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Magus,</hi> who being convinced by the evidence of truth confirmed by miracles, assented in his judgement but beleeved not with his heart: for his heart was not right within him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13. 21. And such a one was <hi>Iudas, Ioh.</hi> 6. 64. who, though he beleeved, as being a Disciple, yea an Apostle of Christ, yet beleeved not in deed and in truth.</p>
               <p>§. X. But that the phrase is used ordinarily of those which received<note place="margin">By a lively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ.</note> Christ by a true and lively assent, I could prove by multitude of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:22501:178"/>
divers whereof I have elsewhere mentioned. But I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe with two instances of the Samaritanes and of the Eunuch. Of the Samaritanes it is said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 39. That many of them beleeved in Christ for the saying of the woman, who could beleeve no more, than she had told them; which at the most, was, that hee was Christ. And after, when they professed, that they beleeved because of his owne word; all that they beleeved was this, that he was indeed the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ist, the Saviour of the world, <hi>verse</hi> 41. 42. The Eunuch, <note n="s" place="margin">Act. 8. 37, 38.</note> when <hi>Philip</hi> told him, that hee might bee baptized, if hee beleeved with his whole heart, maketh this profession of his faith; I beleeve that Iesus Christ is the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>§. XI. Now that affiance is not faith, I briefely shew thus. First,<note place="margin">That as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>iance is not faith.</note> because it is a fruit and effect of faith. For by faith wee have affiance, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 12. Faith therefore is the cause, affiance the effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the same thing cannot be both the cause and the effect. For whereas some deny this consequence, trusting to an unlike example; for say they, as naturall Philosophy is the science of naturall things, and yet by it wee attaine to the science of naturall things: so, though affiance be faith, and faith affiance; yet by faith wee attaine to affiance: I answere that there is an homonymie in the word science, which in the former part of the example signifieth the art or doctrine, which is a comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of precepts: in the latter, the habit of the knowledge of naturall things, which by the doctrine holpen with the gifts of nature, and confirmed by exercise, we attaine unto. Secondly, because faith is an habit of the minde; affiance, an affection of the heart: and so also dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the subject. For faith, being a perswasion, is seated in the minde; though working upon the heart; affiance or trust being an affection, is seated in the heart, though proceeding from the perswasion of the minde. Thirdly, because they differ not onely in the Subject, but also in the Object. The Object of faith is <hi>verum,</hi> that which is true: the Object of affiance is <hi>bonum,</hi> that which is good. Yea, but (say some the Promise is good, and therefore the Object of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aith is <hi>good.</hi> I answer, the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ng promised is good, and therefore I conceive affiance or hope; which two, in respect of the time to come, differ not. But be the thing promised never so good, yet I beleeve not the promise, unlesse I bee perswaded that it is true. Faith therefore layeth hold on the Promise, as being true; affiance or hope expect the thing promised, as being good. Those therefore who hold, that affiance, properly so called, is faith; or faith affiance, are not to bee defended. Those which by affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance understand assurance, and say, that justifying faith is affiance, doe speake the truth, if they understand by faith, not that by which we are justified before God, but that by which we are justified, that is, assured of our justification in our own conscience. Concerning which there needs not to be any other controversie betweene us and the Papists, than this, whether there bee any such certaintie or assurance to be had. But that is a different question, not pertinent to the poynt in hand, which I have elsewhere <note n="t" place="margin">Covenant of grace. cap. 8.</note> cleared. And so much of the nature of justifying faith.</p>

mind, that is the reasonable or intellectuall part, though it worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the affections also. For the better understanding whereof, wee are to know, that when the holy Ghost is pleased to worke the grace of faith in the soules of any of the elect, which ordinarily he doth <note n="c" place="margin">Rom 10. 14, 17</note> by the ministery of the Gospell, he openeth their hearts as he did the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> to assent to the Gospell: which he doth, first, by illuminating their understanding; and opening the eyes of their minde, that they may rightly conceive and judge of the doctrine of salvation: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by opening, as it were, the eares of the mind, and enclining the will to affect and embrace, what the understanding hath judged and approved to be true and good. The understanding therefore appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and the Will (which is <hi>intellectus extensus,</hi> and ordinarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the judgement of the practick understanding) embracing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell, which promiseth salvation by Christ to all that beleeve: the mind, which containeth both these faculties, being thus opened by the holy Ghost, doth williugly assent to the doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of the Gospell concerning salvation by Christ. Faith therefore is a voluntary assent of the mind to the promise of the Gospell; unto which, the acts of both the faculties of the mind concurre; of the understanding, to judge, that the thing propounded to be beleeved, is true and good. I meane, that the promise is true, and the thing promised good: of the Will, to accept and to embrace that for true and good, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding hath judged to be such. Out of both which ariseth the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary assent of the minde, which wee call faith. This faith thus wrought by the holy Ghost, (the Spirit of regeneration) being lively and effectuall, worketh upon the heart and affections; which also being renewed by the holy Ghost, readily follow the willing assent of the minde, both to affect Christ, to desire to bee made partakers of him, to love him, and torest upon him for salvation: and also to dis-affect and to detest those things, which are repugnant to the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the chiefe whereof is Sinne.</p>

by the miracles, but Christ <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 2. 23.</note> did not concredit himselfe to them, for such a faith doth not justifie.

Thus have I proved against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that to beleeve is an<note place="margin">Whether the Vnderstanding be commanded by the Will.</note> act of the will, as well as of the understanding; and that the seat of faith is neither the understanding alone, nor the will alone, but the mind which comprehendeth both. Howbeit, I cannot altogether subscribe to the judgement of the Schoole-men, and other learned men, whether Protestants or Papists, who teach, that the understanding is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the will to assent unto divine truthes and that it doth <hi>credere ex imperio voluntatis.</hi> For I doe not conceive, how the will, which is <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus extensus</hi> and followeth the judgement of the practike understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in so much that it willeth nothing, but what the understanding approveth and judgeth to be willed; how it, I say, should command the understanding. Neither doth their reason satisfie; which is this: that the understanding of man, in matters pertaining to Science, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to one thing by the evidence of the thing, or necessity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not by the Will: but the understanding of man in matters belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to faith, which sometimes surpasse the capacity of humane reason cannot be determined to any particular, either by the evidence of the thing, or by necessity of reason, both which are wanting in the objects of faith, which are things hoped for and things not seene. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, say they, there can no assent bee given, unlesse the understanding be commanded by the will to assent. But I answere, as the ground of knowing things by Science is the evidence of the thing or necessity of reason: so the ground of beleeving things is the authority of God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his word, which is infallible, and in certainty surpasseth the grounds of Science, and by it the understanding is determined to such particulars, as it conceiveth to be revealed of God. As therefore in things of science, which the understanding doth judge to bee evident, and of necessary truth, the will doth readily embrace them, following therin the judgment of the understanding: and so the mind which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth both faculties, doth willingly, and yet necessarily, assent therto, moved therunto by the evidence of necessary truth: so in matters of faith, which the understanding, though it comprehends them not, yet doth judge infallibly true, moved thereto by the authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing those truthes; the Will, as I conceive, being captivated by the understanding, and submitting it selfe to the judgement thereof; the mind doth willingly, and yet necessarily assent to such truthes revealed by God, moved thereunto by the infallible authority of God speaking in his Word. Which in certainty of truth doth farre surmount all grounds of science: and doth captivate the understanding; and it the Will. Why therefore the assent to divine truthes which are grounded

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> concerning the object of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.</note> but to the promises of God concerning his seed. Whereunto I answere, First, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the rest of the faithfull before Christ, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the promised seed, which was the Messias to come, and by that faith, as the Papists themselves confesse, were justifyed. Secondly, the promises, which concerned his seed, were either the same with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Gospell, or it was implyed in them. The maine promise was, that in Abraham, that is, in his seed, all Nations, that is, the faithfull in all Nations, should be blessed. For <hi>Abraham</hi> did not conceive, that in himselfe all Nations should be blessed, as if himselfe should be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Happinesse unto All, but in his seed. And so the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe explaneth in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. and in thy seed, that is, in Christ, all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed. And so Zacharie <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 68. 69, 73. and Peter, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25. This promise made to Abraham is the very same with the promise of the Gospell. For, as the Apostle saith, the Scripture foreseeing, that God would justifie the Heathen through faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> preached, before, the Gospell to Abraham, saying, in thee (that is, in thy seed) shall all nations be blessed. Which promise, as it had beene formerly made to our first parents <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the promised seed, so was it after renewed to <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 26. 4. and to <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 28. 14. and, in effect, to <hi>David</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 72. 17.</note>, whose sonne according to the flesh Messias was to be: who is therefore called the sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the branch of <hi>David.</hi> In this promised seed <hi>Abraham</hi> and all other the faithfull beleeved, and by beleeving in Him were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>§. IV. The other promises concerning his seed are two. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,<note place="margin">The two other promises.</note> concerning the multiplication of his seed; that hee should bee Father of a multitude of Nations, namely in Christ; and that hee would be a God to him and his seed, hee doth not say to seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. that is Christ mysticall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. containing the multitude of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all Nations, both Iewes and Gentiles.

Which the Papists themselves cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. The chiefe thing which <hi>Abraham</hi> apprehended in the promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

his seed was, that although he were an hundred yeere old, and <hi>Sarah</hi> past child-bearing, yet he should have seed by her, and in that seed himselfe, and all the faithfull of all Nations should be blessed.</p>

                  </gap>ve; even as <hi>Ioshua</hi> the type of Christ, who also is called <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 4. 9.</note> Iesus, brought the Israelites, after their peregrinations, into that land of rest. So that in the latter Promises concerning his seed, and the land of promise, the former was implyed concerning the promised seed and blessednesse by him, as the principall object of Abrahams faith, for which chiefly hee did so much affect and desire seed. Insomuch that when the Lord had promised him to bee his buckler and his exceeding great reward, Abraham replied, Lord God what wilt thou give mee seeing I goe childlesse. As Abraham therefore who rejoyced <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 56.</note> to see our Saviour Christs day; and as he, and the rest of the faithfull having not received the promises concerning the promised seed; but having seene them a farre off, were perswaded of them, that is, beleeved them, and <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> embraced them, were justified by faith in Christ, the promised seed; so are we, and by nothing else.</p>
               <p>And further, we are to note, that before those words recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. Abraham had by faith embraced the maine promise of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. in thee, that is, in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed: and by that faith was justified, by which also he obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 14, 16.</note> leaving his owne countrey, and, by the same faith, sojourning in the land of promise as a Pilgrime, sought a better countrey, that is, an heavenly. Therefore as S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, when <hi>Abraham</hi> in his great triall<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 23.</note> had approved himselfe to be a faithfull man; that then the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse: Not that then <hi>Abraham</hi> first beleeved, but that then by that notable fruit of faith, hee approved the truth of his faith, and manifested the truth of that oracle, which then by good proofe was verified of him: So, by the like reason, may that place, Gen. 15. 6. be understood, that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse. Not, that then <hi>Abraham,</hi> either first beleeved, or was then first justified, for hee had beleeved the grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Gospell before, and by it was justified; and before this time had brought forth excellent fruits of faith, <hi>Gen. Chap.</hi> 12, 13, 14. but that by this new act of beleeving the Promises renewed (which the Apostle amplifieth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18.) the truth of his faith was manifested.

Before God, when by a lively and effectuall assent or beleefe, as hath beene said wee receive and embrace Christ our Saviour with all his merits, or, which is all one, the promises of the Gospell concerning justification and salvation by him. Such was the faith of Saint <hi>Peter, Math.</hi> 16. 16. and of the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 69. Of <hi>Nathaniel, Ioh.</hi> 1. 49. Of <hi>Martha, Ioh.</hi> 11. 27.

For hee who knoweth, that hee hath the condition; not onely may, but must apply the promise of the Gospell to himselfe, otherwise he maketh God a lyar, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10. This application, as hath been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And such is and ought to be the faith of all that truely beleeve. For the generall alwaies includeth the particular. If therefore thou doest truely beleeve, that Iesus is the Saviour of all that truely beleeve in him, thou art then bound to beleeve that he is thy Saviour. Of this point, I have treated elsewhere,<note n="n" place="margin">Covenant of grace. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. <hi>De iustif. l 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. VII. Now I come to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> dispute concerning the object of faith, wherein hee endevoureth to prove and to maintaine three things: First, that the object of faith is not Gods speciall favour in Christ, but whatsoever God hath reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>led. Secondly, that men may be justified without speciall faith. Thirdly, that men are not justified by speciall faith. As touching the first, wee doe freely confesse, that by the justifying faith we doe beleeve, whatsoever wee understand to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God. And further we professe, that by the virtue of justifying faith all articles of Christian Religion become, after a sort, the objects of speciall faith. For as he who hath the Philosophers stone is said by virtue thereof to turne other metals into Gold: so it may more truely
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:22501:183"/>
be said of him who is indued with that faith, whereby we are justified before God, that he may and ought to make all the Articles of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike or dogmaticall faith, the precious objects of speciall faith by applying them to his owne good and comfort, which being a matter of singular use and comfort, I will a little insist upon it. Doest thou then beleeve by a true and a lively assent, as hath been said, that Iesus the Sonne of the Blessed Virgin is the erernall Sonne of God, and the Saviour of all those that truely beleeve in him? Thou art then bound to beleeve, that hee is thy Saviour. Doest thou beleeve that Christ is thy Saviour? then must thou beleeve that God the Father is thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious<note place="margin">Father.

               <p>§. VIII. Whereas therfore this question is usually made, whether every man be bound to beleeve that he is elected, that he hath remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sins, and that he shall be saved, and so all the particulars before mentioned, that God the Father is his Father, &amp;c. I answere, that not every man is bound so to beleeve, for then the greater part of men should bee bound to beleeve untruthes. But this I say, that every man is bound upon paine of damnation to beleeve in Christ according to the first degree of faith (for he that beleeveth not shall be condemned) that is,<note place="margin">Ioh 3. 18.</note> by a true and lively beliefe or assent to beleeve, that Iesus is the Saviour of all that truely beleeve in him; and having this faith, thou art bound to beleeve, that he is thy Saviour, that hee died for thy sinnes, and rose againe for thy justification, &amp;c. that in Christ thou art elected, that by him thou hast remission of sinnes, and that through him thou shalt be saved. But untill thou hast that faith (which is the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise) thou maiest not apply, and by application beleeve any of these things, unlesse thou wilt beguile thy selfe. And thus much may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the first point.</p>
               <p>§. IX. For the second: where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth that a man may<note place="margin">Whether a man may be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall faith.</note> be justified without speciall faith; it is true in respect of our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God. But they which hold that wee cannot be justified without speciall faith, speake of justification in the Court of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which none can attaine unto, unlesse first they apply the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Gospell to themselves. Which to doe, the Papists hold to be carnall presumption. Thou maist professe thy selfe to beleeve that Christ is the Saviour of the world; but if thou bee a Papist, thou maist not beleeve that hee is thy Saviour, that is to say, that thou shalt be saved by him. Thou maist say, he is thy Saviour, as the Papists held him to be Saviour of all, as well of those that shall perish, as of them that shall be saved: but if thou shalt not be saved by him, then is hee not indeed and in truth thy Saviour. Thou maist have a kinde of hope, that thou shalt be saved, but thou mayst not beleeve it. But that hope will prove a slope, which is not grounded upon faith. Faith being the foundation of hope, and the substance of things hoped for. Neither canst thou truely hope for the performance of a promise to thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse first by faith thou art perswaded, that it doth belong to thee. Thou maist, nay thou must be perswaded that it belongeth to thee, if thou hast the condition of the promise, which is to beleeve in Christ: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them that have that condition, the promises of the Gospell are universally to be understood, and as excluding none that beleeve. Doft thou therefore truely beleeve in Christ, by a true and a lively assent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:22501:184"/>
and embracing him as the Saviour? Then maist thou apply the promises of the Gospell to thy selfe, and by application attaine to some assurance of thy justification and salvation. Yea but, saith the Papist, a man cannot be assured by the certainety of faith that he shall be saved, for many who have thought themselves sure, have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But <hi>fidei falsum subesse non potest.</hi> I answere, that as there is a knowledge of principles in themselves manifest, and of conclusions, which are made manifest by discourse, though not absolutely true as principles, but with presupposall of the premisses, they are so true, that it is impossible the conclusion should bee false, where the premisses are true: so there is a faith of principles contained in Gods Word, which is the dogmaticall or catholike faith, which are absolutely true; and there is a faith of conclusions, by necessary consequence deducted from those principles, by application of the generall to the particular: which though they be not absolutely true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they are necessarily true; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they possibly be false, the premisses being true, and of such conclusions is the speciall faith. And so much of the second.</p>
               <p>§. X. Now for the third, where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> disputeth, that we are not<note place="margin">Whether a man is justified by speciall faith.</note> justified by speciall faith, it is true in respect of justification before God: but it is false in respect of justification in the Court of Conscience, without which no man can boldly say that he is justified before God. Of which justification in the Court of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>onscience, they must bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to speake, who unto justification <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e required to justification, to what purpose doe they tell us, that a man must be disposed and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by faith and other virtues.

               <p>§. II. Forsooth, there are seven, which according to the decree <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 6. Seven. dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions required before justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which <hi>vide infra ca.</hi> 10, 11, 12.</note> of the Councell of Trent, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckoneth, <hi>De justif. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 13. to prove, that faith doth not justifie alone, because the other sixe also doe dispose men thereunto. The seven are, faith, feare, hope, love, peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, a purpose and desire to receive the Sacrament, a purpose of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. All which doe but prepare and dispose a man. But it is the Sacrament, as, namely, of Baptisme<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Trid. Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note>, that doth actually justifie, and without which no man is justified. But I would gladly know, whether these seven preparatives, be fruits of grace, or works of nature. Not of grace, for, as they teach, no man hath grace before Iustification: What
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:22501:185"/>
then? they are the fruits of nature holpen, I wot not, by what grace: which if it were true would not onely prove the maine assertion of the Pelagians, <hi>Gratiam secundùm merita dari,</hi> or as in other words it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Councell of <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>ca.</hi> 7.</note> Trent, <hi>Secundùm propriam cajusque disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem &amp; operationem.</hi> For though, according to their doctrine, these preparations are not merits of condignity, as they say, yet they bee of congruity: but also disprove the doctrine of the Apostle, that we are justified freely by his grace. But this seemeth to me absurd, that men should have one justifying faith, and so one hope and one love, &amp;c. go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before justification, and another infused in our justification: and that by the one justifying faith going before, we should be prepared to justification; and by the other infused in our justification we should in part be formally justified. But this is certaine, that, that faith, which in order of time goeth before justification, is no true justifying faith. For that which goeth before justification, goeth also before regeneration, and what goeth before regeneration, is of nature and not of Grace. But faith in order of time goeth not before justification, though in order of nature it doth; for so soone as a man beleeveth he is justified, as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> saith<note n="d" place="margin">In Rom. 10. 4.</note>, <hi>Talis est ille qui in Christum credidit, die qua credidit, qualis ille qui universam legem implevit.</hi> Such a one is hee that beleeveth in Christ, the very day that hee beleeveth, as hee that hath fulfilled the whole Law; nor in order of nature before regeneration; for in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation it is wrought. As therefore no man hath faith who is not regenerated, so no man hath faith who is not thereby justified. The Scripture is plaine, that in Christ whosoever beleeveth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39. He that beleeveth in Christ is passed from death to life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 54. which passage from death to life is justification; whereby, as themselves <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Trid. sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> teach, a man is translated from the state of death and damnation, into a state of Grace and Salvation. Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actually justifieth, and not disposeth onely to justification.</p>
               <p>§. III. The other question is, whether faith doth justifie formally,<note place="margin">Secondly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith doth justifie formally</note> as they speake, as being a part of inherent righteousnesse; or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally only, as the hand to receive Christ, who is our righteousnesse. The Romane Catholikes hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he former; the true Catholikes, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the former I have sufficiently disproved before, and proved the latter. For if we be not justified by any grace or righteousnesse inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our selves, or performed by our selves, which I have before <note n="f" place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> by many undeniable arguments demonstrated: then it followeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that we are not justified by faith, as it is a gift or grace, an act, or habit, or quality inherent in us, or performed by us. And if we be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the righteousnesse of Christ onely, which being out of us in him is imputed to those who receive it by faith, which also before <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</note> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly proved: then also it followeth by necessary consequence, that wee are justified by faith, onely as it is the instrument or hand to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or receive Christ, who is our righteousnesse. Wherefore where faith is said to justifie, or to bee imputed to righteousnesse, it must of necessity be understood relatively, and in respect of the object, to which
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:22501:186"/>
purpose, both justification, and all other benefits, which we receive by Christ, are attributed to faith, as I have shewed<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Supr. cap.</hi> 4. §. 6.</note> before. Not that faith it selfe worketh these things, but because by it wee receive Christ, and with him all his merits and benefits. And for the same cause the faith of all the faithfull, though unequall in degrees, in some greater, in some lesse, is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> in respect of justification; we acknowledge it to bee the onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or hand to receive Christ, to be the condition of the Covenant of Grace, to which the Promises of remission of sinnes and of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are made, without which the promises of the Gospell doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine unto us, and without which our blessed Saviour doth not save us. Secondly, in respect of Sanctification, wee attribute all that and more, which the Papists ascribe unto it in respect of their imaginary justification. That it is the beginning, the foundation, and root of all inherent righteousnesse; the mother of all other sanctifying Graces, which purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God, without which, whatsoever is done, is sinne.</p>
               <p>§. V. But howsoever here the Papists would seeme to plead for faith, yet the truth is, that, as they have abolished the benefit of justification, as it is taught in the holy Scriptures, so with it, they have taken away the justifying faith. For though they retaine the name, yet in their doctrine there is no such thing. For first, to faith they doe not ascribe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to justifie, but only to be a disposition, one among seven, even such a one as servile feare is, of a man unto inherent righteousnesse, or to the grace of Sanctification, it selfe being not as yet a justifying or sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. Secondly, that faith, being infused, becommeth the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a part of formall inherent righteousnesse. But so small a part they assigne unto it, that they say, that the habit of formall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse differeth not from the habit of charity: so that in justification it hath no use at all, and in sanctification charity is all in all: which is a manifest evidence, that the Church of Rome is fallen away from the ancient doctrine of the faith. For both Scriptures and Fathers every where ascribe justification to faith, and not to Charitie: to faith, and not to workes: but the Papists ascribe the first justification to charitie, which they make to be the onely formall cause of justification, which, as themselves teach, is but one; and the second justification they assigne to workes.</p>

               <p>§. I.</p>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I come to the third question, which is the<note place="margin">The state of the Controversie.</note> principall concerning faith, whether we be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith alone, as wee with all antiquity doe hold: or not by faith alone, but also by other habits of grace, as charitie, and the rest, and by the workes of grace, which the Papists hold to concur in us to the act of justification, as the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereof. Where first, we are to explaine our assertion; and afterwards, both to prove, and to maintaine it. And great reason there is, that wee should explaine it, because the Papists most wickedly, against their owne knowledge, calumniate our doctrine in this point. I will therefore explaine all the three termes, <hi>Fides, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat, sola,</hi> Faith, doth justifie, alone: for by Faith wee doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,<note place="margin">What wee meane by faith.</note> as I have shewed before, neither the profession of faith, or faith onely professed, which S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth deny to justifie: nor that faith which is a bare assent, which is the faith of Papists, and is common to them with the Divels, and with other hypocrites and wicked men; for such a faith we deny to justifie, either alone, or at all: but a true, lively, and effectuall beleefe in Christ, being a speciall apprehension or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and embracing of Christ, and of the promises of the Gospell, joyned with application, or at least with a true desire, will and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thereof. The which faith also wee deny to be true, if in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, it doe not purifie the heart, if it doe not worke by love, if it cannot be demonstrated by good workes.</p>
               <p>§. II. Now for the word <hi>justifie:</hi> shall I need to tell you, that by<note place="margin">What is meant by the word <hi>justifie.</hi>
                  </note> justifying we doe not meane sanctifying? And yet such is the blinded malice of the papists, as that because they wickedly confound justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sanctification, which we carefully, according to the Scriptures, distinguish: they beare the world in hand, that our assertion is this in effect, that faith alone doth sanctifie, and that nothing concurreth to sanctification, but faith onely: and consequently, that wee teach the people, so they can perswade themselves, that they have faith, they need not take care either for other graces or for a godly life. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we hold, that faith doth justifie alone, yet wee doe not hold that it doth sanctifie alone: but that our sanctification is partly habituall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, with faith, concurre the habits of other sanctifying graces, as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:22501:187"/>
hope, charity, &amp;c. and partly actuall, which is our new obedience in the practice of good workes.</p>
               <p>§. III. But the word <hi>sela alone</hi> doth most displease the Papists, who<note place="margin">Of the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive particle <hi>alone.</hi>
                  </note> will needs part stakes with Christ in their justification. This therefore is to be explaned. And first, when we say, that faith alone doth justifie, we doe not meane <hi>fidem solitariam</hi> that faith which is alone, neither doe we in construction joyne <hi>sola</hi> with <hi>fides</hi> the subject, but with <hi>justificat</hi> the predicate: meaning, that true faith, though it bee not alone, yet it doth justifie alone. Even as the eye, though in respect of being, it is not alone, or if it be, it is not a true and a living, but a dead eie which seeth neither alone nor at all: yet in respect of seeing, unto which no other member doth concurre with it, it being the onely instrument of that faculty, it is truely said to see alone: so faith, though in respect of the being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is not alone, or if it bee, it is not a true and lively but a counterfeit and dead faith: yet in respect of justifying, unto which act no other grace doth concurre with it, it being the onely instrument of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and receiving Christ, it is truely said to justifie alone: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the brazen Serpent, which was a figure of Christ, was life up and set on high in the wildernesse, that whosoever was bitten by the fiery serpents, might, by looking onely upon it, be cured. And although their eye could not properly bee said to cure them; yet because it was the onely instrument to apprehend that object, which God had ordained, as the onely remedy to salve them; it is truely said, that by onely looking upon that object they were cured. Even so our Saviour Christ was lifted up upon the Crosse (it is his owne similitude, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14, 15.) that whosoever being stung by the old serpent doth but looke upon him with the eye of faith (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 40.) may be justified and saved, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this eye of the of the soule, which is faith, cannot be said proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to justifie them who are sinners: yet because it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to apprehend that object, which God hath ordained as the onely remedy and propitiation for our sinne, it is truely said, that by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely in Christ we are Iustified.</p>
               <p>§. IV, Secondly, whereas faith it selfe doth not justifie properly,<note place="margin">That the object of faith doth justifie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.</note> but the object which it doth apprehend, which is Christ and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, our meaning therefore when wee say that faith alone doth justifie, can be no other but this, that the righteousnesse of Christ alone, which is onely apprehended by faith, doth justifie us. And forasmuch as this is a necessary disjunction, that wee are justified either by that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves, or by that which is out of us in Christ (for by some righteousnesse wee are justified, and a third cannot be named:) it followeth therefore necessarily, that if we be not justified by inherent righteousnesse, then by Christs righteousnesse alone: because a third righteousnesse, by which we should bee justified, cannot be named.</p>
               <p>§. V. Thirdly, where wee say, that Christs righteousnesse alone,<note place="margin">That nothing in that kind doth justifie, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ, as the matter, and Faith as the onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on our part.</note> which is apprehended by faith alone, doth justifie, wee doe not meane absolutely that nothing else doth justifie, but nothing in that kind <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:22501:187"/>
that the righteousnesse of Christ is the only matter of our justification; and faith the onely instrument on our part, by which wee are justified. For otherwise, as hath before beene shewed, wee confesse that many things else doe justifie, <hi>viz.</hi> God, as the Author and principall efficient of our justification, who imputethunto us the righteousnesse of his Son. The holy Ghost also doth justifie us by working in us the grace of faith hy which he applyeth Christs righteousnesse unto us. The Ministers also doe justifie, as the instruments of the holy Ghost, both by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Gospell, by which faith is begotten in us, and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, whereby the promises of the Gospell are sealed unto us. And lastly, good workes doe justifie, as the signes and evidences, whereby our faith and justification is manifested. But as the matter, nothing doth justifie but Christs righteousnesse, and as the instrument on our part nothing but faith. And in this sense wee doe constantly affirme, that by Christs righteousnesse alone, apprehended by faith alone, wee are justified.</p>
               <p>§. VI. For the demonstration of our assertion, I shall not need to<note place="margin">Our prooses.</note> bring many new proofes, seeing that all those arguments, which before I have produced, but especially those which concerne the matter and forme of justification doe invincibly prove that wee are justified by the righteousnes of Christ alone, being apprehended by faith alone, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them that beleeve. For if we be justified by the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ alone, and if in us there bee nothing which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth or maketh us partakers of Christs righteousnesse, but faith onely: then there is nothing in us, by which we are justified, but onely faith. But because the Papists object heresie and novelty against us in this point; I will, besides some few places of Scripture, and some other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, briefly propounded, produce the testimonies of the Fathers, and others, who have in all ages lived in the Church before these times.</p>
               <p>§. VII. First, therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. the word <hi>gratis</hi> freely, being an exclusive particle, doth import, that we are justified by the grace of God and merits of Christ through faith without righteousnesse in us; and therefore by faith alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. We know that by the workes of the Law (that is, the righteousnesse and obedience prescribed in the Law, in which all inherent righteousnesse is fully and perfectly described) a man is not iustified <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> no otherwise but by faith, <hi>non nisi per fidem,</hi> as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Iustinian,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">In Gal. 2. 16.</note> or by faith onely, as <hi>Henry Steven,</hi> who well understood the Greek, translateth it, <hi>sed tantùm per fidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. the exclusive is implyed. To him that worketh nor, but hath beleeved, that is, hath onely beleeved in him who justifieth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his faith is imputed unto righteousnesse, and so the Syriack Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast readeth; <hi>but hath onely beleeved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 50. Onely beleeve.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">De justif. l 1. cap. 20.</note> answeareth, That Christ speaketh of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous raising of a dead body, and not of the justification of a sinner, for, as for the obtaining of a miraculous cure, he confesseth, that faith doth
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:22501:188"/>
suffice alone. Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that place, to serve his present tume. But in the seventeenth<note n="c" place="margin">§. <hi>Consirmat.</hi>
                  </note> Chapter of the same booke, where hee would prove, that faith doth justifie, not relatively in respect of the Object, but by its owne efficacie: hee alleageth, that the woman of<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 29.</note> Canaan procured her daughters health by the efficacie of her faith; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth his owne answere in the other place. <hi>Neither may it bee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> saith he, <hi>that it is one thing to speake of justification, and another of the curing of a bodily disease. For our Lord by the very same words attributeth Vtramque sanitatem,</hi> the health both of the body and the soule <hi>to faith. For as he said to the woman who was a sinner, Luk. 7. 50. thy faith hath saved thee: so to the woman which had the bloudy issue, Mat. 9. 22. thy faith hath saved thee: and to the blinde man whom he restored to sight, Mar. 10. 52.</hi> thy faith hath saved thee. And further it is to bee thought that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when he telleth them, whom he cured, that their faith had saved them, that is, himselfe<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16. his name through faith in his name.</note> through faith had saved them, looked higher than to the cure of their bodies, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. sonne, be of good cheere thy sinnes are forgiven thee: for sinne being the cause of their mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Lord to cure them tooke away the cause thereof, which was the guilt of sinne.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. All those places, which exclude workes from justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Reasons 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</note> doe by necessary consequence teach justification by faith alone. For, that we are justified by some righteousnesse, is confessed of all. This righteousnesse, is either the righteousnesse of faith, or of workes; that is, either the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith; and that is the righteousnesse of God, which without the Law is revealed in the Gospell; or that righteousnesse, which is inherent in our selves, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Law. For neither can a third righteousnesse bee named, by which we should be justified, neither can wee be justified by both; the holy Ghost perpetually making such an opposition betweene them, as that they cannot stand together. If therefore we be not justified by the righteousnesse of workes prescribed in the Law, as all inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is; then we are justified by the righteousnesse of faith alone. Or thus: The righteousnesse, whereby wee are justified, is either inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our selves, and performed by our selves, which the Scriptures call the righteousnesse of workes; or that, which being out of us, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in Christ, and by him performed for us, which is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of faith. A third cannot be named, and by both wee cannot be justified. If therefore we be not justified by the former, which I have sufficiently, or rather abundantly proved heretofore: then are we justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the latter alone. For if of two and no more but two, you take away one, you leave the other alone. So is it in all dis-junctions consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of two opposites <hi>sine medio.</hi> The one being removed, the other on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaineth.<note place="margin">The second Reason, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold argument.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. IX. That, by which alone the promise of justification, by which alone justification, by which alone Christ himselfe who is our righteousnesse is received, that alone justifieth. By faith alone the promise, by it alone justification, by it alone Christ himselfe is received. For that is the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:22501:188"/>
proper office of faith. For if faith receive the Promise, and justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Christ himselfe, which no other grace in us can doe, then it is the proper office of faith. But faith receiveth the promise wherein justification is offered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. it receiveth remission of sinnes or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 39. it receiveth Christ himselfe <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. which no other grace can doe, as it is evident: therefore faith alone doth justifie.<note place="margin">The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because faith is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. X. That which is the onely condition of the Covenant of Grace, by that alone we are justified, because to that alone justification is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
               <p>Faith is the onely condition<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 3 16. Act. 10. 43. Gal. 3. 9.</note> of the Covenant of grace, which is therefore called <hi>lex</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>fidei:</hi> therefore by faith alone we are justified.</p>
               <p>If against the assumption it be objected, that charity, and obedience, and other virtues are also required: I answere, that these are not the conditions of the Covenant, but the things by Covenant promised to them that beleeve. If we beleeve, God hath promised to justifie us; and being justified, or redeemed, to sanctifie and to save us. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. 22. Charity, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp;c. are the conditions of the Covenant of workes, Doe this, and thou shalt live: but the condition of the Covenant of grace is, <hi>Beleeve,</hi> and thou shalt bee inabled to walke in the obedience of the law, thou shalt receive the gift of the Spirit, and finally, thou shalt bee saved. For being by faith freed from sinne, and become Servants to God, you have your fruit unto holinesse, and the end everlasting life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22.</p>
               <p>§. XI. The holy Scriptures wheresoever they speake of that by<note place="margin">The fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because faith only in the question of justification is mentioned in the Scriptures.</note> which wee are justified, mention nothing in us, but faith; not workes, nor other graces, unlesse it bee to exclude them from the act of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which is a plaine evidence that faith doth justifie alone. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> answereth, that it <hi>doth not follow, that because faith onely is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, therefore it justifieth alone. For sometimes, other things, as not only other virtues, but the Sacraments also are mentioned, which notwithstanding doe not justifie alone.</hi> Whereunto I answere, first, that, in the point of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, faith is mentioned alone, and no other grace with it, even where the holy Ghost treateth <hi>ex professo</hi> of justification, and of the causes thereof. Secondly, that to no other grace mentioned, either alone, or with others, is justification any where ascribed. Neither are the Papists able to produce any testimony out of the holy Scriptures to prove it. As for those which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Which hope or expectation as it is termed, vers. 23. is no cause, either of justification, or of salvation. Thirdly, that the justification attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Sacraments doth not hinder justification by faith alone. For when wee say, that faith doth justifie alone, we meane, that nothing in

               <p>Neither is the justification by Sacraments repugnant to justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith alone, the meaning of our assertion being this, that in us nothing concurreth to the act of justification, as any cause thereof, but faith onely.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:22501:195"/>

In respect of the first, the question which he maketh is, whether faith doth justifie alone by way of disposing unto justification. In respect of the second, whether faith be the onely formall cause of our justification. In respect of the third, whether for the retaining and preserving of righteousnesse good workes be not required, but faith onely sufficeth. The first he disputeth <hi>De justif. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12. and in the twelve chapters following to the end of that booke. The second, that faith is not the onely and entire formall cause of justification, he disputeth in the second booke. The third he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the fourth booke, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. where he endevoureth to prove that good workes doe justifie. But in mine opinion hee should rather have disputed this question, whether faith doth justifie at all or not. For whereas they make two justifications, the first habituall; whereby of a sinner a man is made just: the second actuall, whereby a man of just is made more just; by their doctrine, faith doth not justifie as a part either of the one, or the other: but is required as a necessary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and as it were, <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> which is no cause. For they make the formall cause of their first justification, which they say truely is but one, to be charity; and the meritorious cause of the second to be good workes. Onely, that charity, and those good workes, must not be without faith. All, which they ascribe to faith, is, that they make it the beginning of justification and a disposition to it. Neither doe we deny, but that true faith is the beginning and the root of sanctification, and of all inherent righteousnesse; insomuch that from it both charity it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:22501:195"/>
selfe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and all other both internall graces, and externall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience doe spring: but the act of justification, neither in the first, nor second doe they ascribe to faith. Onely unto the first justification they require it as a preparative disposition for the habit of grace to bee infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which doth not differ from Charity; and when it is infused, to be a companion thereof. And to the second, as <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> without which workes doe not justifie.</p>
               <p>§. II. But to come to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> large discourse: the greatest part<note place="margin">

But to make all seeme pertinent, he maliciously calumniateth us, as if we held all those assertions, which hee with such eagernesse doth confute. But if we doe hold, that faith doth not justifie by way of disposing, either alone, or at all: and that it is not the formall cause of justification, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, as the entire cause; or at all, as any part thereof: and that it is not a consequent of justification at all, as works indeed are; to what end doth all this dispute serve? unlesse it be to make their seduced Catholiks, who never are permitted to read any of our writings, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that he hath doughtily confuted us.</p>
               <p>§. III. And that faith doth not justifie alone, by way of disposing, he<note place="margin">That faith doth not iustifie alone by way of disposing, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by five sorts of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> endeavoureth to prove by five sorts of arguments. The first, from those seven dispositions required by the Councell of Trent to justification, among which he reckoneth faith for one. Whereunto in generall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that this whole discourse, besides that it is impertinent, for wee doe not hold, as I have said, that faith doth justifie by way of dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">First, from the seven dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is idle and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note> either alone or at all: it is also an idle speculation disagreeing from their practicke theologie, and that in two respects. First, to their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative justification, they require foregoing preparations and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but to the obtayning of justification in deed and in practise, no such things are required. For, the efficacie of justifying a sinner they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to their Sacraments, which they say doe conferre <hi>gratiam gratum facientem,</hi> that is, justifie, <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> requiring, as I conceive, no preceding preparation, or disposition in the party to be justified, so hee doe not interpose the obstacle of any mortall sinne. For if foregoing dispositions were required before the Sacraments; then they should not justifie, as I have said before, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> but, <hi>ex opere operantis.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they doe teach, that in their first justification, Charity, and with it Faith and Hope are infused, whereby a man that before was a sinner is made righteous. And that therefore a man is first justified, when these are infused; and that these are first infused, when a man is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and yet they tell us of a true Faith, true Hope, true Love going before justification. Which by their doctrine, though they goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I meane Faith, Hope, and Charity, accompanied with other good dispositions, are neither graces nor gifts of grace infused. For before, or without the Sacrament there is no justification, which they have ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sacrament, and before justification, as themselves say, there is no grace. For if they were graces indeed (as no doubt but they are where they are true and goe together accompanied with other good
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:22501:196"/>
dispositions) then men might be justified before the receit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was; and then the Sacrament to men so qualified, should not conserre grace, but seale it. Thus to mainetaine their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious errour concerning the efficacie of the Sacraments justifying <hi>ex opere operato</hi> (whereby they have turned religion into an outward forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) that Faith, that Hope, that Charity which goe before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as namely in <hi>Cornelius</hi> before his baptisme, should be no true graces, because all true justifying and saving grace is insused in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacrament: and this infusion of grace is that, which they call justification. By their doctrine therefore justifying faith is that which in the very act of justification is infused, and being infused doth justifie, not by way of disposing, but formally; it selfe being informed by Charity. And therefore according to their owne doctrine, that faith which disposeth to justification, is not justifying Faith. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all this discourse concerning six other preparative dispositions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with faith, to prove that we are not justified by faith alone, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the purpose. For that faith, which they make their first prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive disposition, is not justisying faith; neither doth justifie otherwise by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne confession, than its next companion, <hi>viz,</hi> servile feare, doth. But wee, when we say, that faith alone doth justifie, speake not of a bare and naked assent which is common to the wicked which cannot justifie, either alone, or at all; but of a true, lively, effectuall faith, which worketh by love: and therefore, I say againe, this whole dispute of the seven dispositions is meerely impertinent.</p>
               <p>§. IV. But some will say, doe you require no preparative dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">Preparative dispositions to justifying faith.</note> going before justification? I answer, that <hi>in adult is</hi> we doe: but that no way hindereth the truth of our assertion concerning justification by faith alone: wee doe confesse, that to the begetting of justifying faith preparative dispositions are ordinarily required <hi>in adultis,</hi> in those who be of yeares, wrought partly by private education and use of other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meanes, as reading, meditation, conference, &amp;c. and partly, by the publicke ministery both of the Law and of the Gospell, by which, first, our minds are illuminated to know God and our selves, and what wee shall bee in Christ if wee beleeve in him. Secondly hee mollifieth our hearts and humbleth our soules ordinarily by the ministery of the Law and extraordinarily by afflictions, either outward or inward, which are the terrours of a distressed conscience, by which when the Word will not serve, the Lord draweth men, as it were, with a strong hand: that being thus humbled we may become fit auditours of the Gospell, In which the Lord to the humbled and prepared soule revealeth his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable mercies in Christ, stirreth us up, by the ministers of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, to accept of his mercie in Christ, intreating and perswading us in the name of God, and in Christs stead, that wee would be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto God. The holy Ghost, having thus knocked at the doore of our hearts, at length in his good time he himselfe openeth our hearts to receive Christ by faith, working in our judgments a lively assent to the doctrine of salvation by Christ, and by it both an earnest desire in our
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:22501:196"/>
hearts, to be made partakers of Christ (which is the desire of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and also in our wils a setled resolution to acknowledge him to be our Saviour, and to rest upon him alone for salvation, which is the will and purpose of application. Having thus received and embraced Christ by a lively assent or beliefe, and so having the condition of the promise, which is faith; in the next place wee proceed to actuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by speciall faith; which is farther to be confirmed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which are the seales of that righteousnesse which is by faith; and by the practise of piety or leading of a godly life; whereby wee are to make, as our election, and calling, so also our justification sure unto us.</p>
               <p>§. V. But come we to his argument drawne from the seven prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative<note place="margin">The first dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.

Answ.</hi> That justifying saith, which is a grace infused in our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we deny to justifie by way of disposing: that faith, which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regeneration, and is not infused, we deny to justifie at all. And such is that faith whereof he speaketh; and therefore hee reckoneth without his host. From our assertion he should rather have concluded thus. That, which is but a preparative disposition to justification, doth not justifie at all: that faith which goeth before regeneration, is but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative disposition to justification, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth: therefore that faith, which goeth before regeneration, doth not justifie at all. Or thus: a preparative disposition to justification doth not justifie: but faith, as all confesse, doth justifie: therefore it is not a preparative dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to justification.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument, faith doth but begin justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not justifie alone.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. VI. Yea but he will prove by <hi>authority of Scriptures, by testimonies of Fathers, and by reason, that faith doth not justifie alone, because it is but the beginning of justification: and therefore other things must accompany and follow it to perfect our justification. Answ.</hi> That it is the beginning of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the root of all sanctifying graces, I have already confessed. But the concurrence both of other inward graces, and of outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto sanctification, doth not hinder, but that faith doth justifie alone. Neither doth faith justifie, as the beginning of justification on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: first, because there are no degrees of justification before God; for in the first act it is perfect: and to that act continued throughout this life, faith, as I shewed before out of divers of the Fathers sufficeth. I say, sufficeth to justification: and therefore is not the beginning onely, but also the continuance and consummation thereof: for as in the first act it justifieth, so also in the continuance of justification, for by it we<note n="a" place="margin">Rom 5. 2.</note> stand, and by it we live<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</note>, and so long as we have faith, it is imputed unto us for righteousnesse even from faith to faith<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note>, as it was to <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 15 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had long continued in the faith.</p>
               <p>§. VII. His first proofe is <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Hee that commeth to God,<note place="margin">His first testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</note> must beleeve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him. <hi>Therefore faith is the first motion of comming to God,</hi> which wee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confesse. But he should have done well, to have told us, what is
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:22501:197"/>
meant by comming unto God. For to come unto Christ is to beleeve in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 35, 37, 44, 65. And if that bee the meaning of the holy Ghost in this place, then to come unto God is to beleeve in him by speciall faith, otherwise the Apostle should enunciate <hi>idem per idem.</hi> And then the meaning is this, hee that would beleeve that God is his God, and that he will be gracious unto him, must first beleeve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him. Or thus, wouldest thou beleeve that Christ is thy Saviour, then must thou first beleeve that hee is the Saviour of all that truely beleeve in him. Or, it may be, that the word <hi>come,</hi> in this place is to bee expounded by the word <hi>seeking.</hi> He that will come unto God, that is, hee that will seeke God, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him. For these words, <hi>comming, returning, seeking,</hi> which properly betoken the actions of the body, are by a Metaphore<note n="c" place="margin">Esa. 21. 12.</note> translated to the actions of the soule, whereby is meant, sometimes our conversion and turning unto God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. 30. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Esa.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. 5. &amp; 5. 15. <hi>cum</hi> 6. 1. &amp; 7. 10. And if that bee the meaning of this place, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else can bee gathered from it; but, that faith is the beginning of our repentance and turning unto God. Sometimes the whole study of piety, whereby wee endevour to know God, and to serve him. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28. 9. If thou seeke him, that is, if thou endevour to know and to serve him with an upright heart and with a willing mind, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 4. &amp; 15. 12. &amp; 17. 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 2, 3. whereupon godly and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men are said to bee seekers of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 26. &amp; 24. 6. &amp; 40. 16. <hi>Esa.</hi> 51. 1. And thus, faith is the beginning of all piety and of the true worship of God. Sometimes it signifieth affiance in God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Esa.</hi> 11. 10. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 6 And so faith is the cause of affiance: for by faith wee have affiance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12.

three of these degrees are referred. First, sending of Preachers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Preaching. Thirdly, hearing, by which faith commeth. The second is justification by faith.

For where the Apostle saith, how shall they callupon him, in whom they have not beleeved, how shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard, and consequently by hearing knowne, this degree he leaveth out; which proveth, that men cannot beleeve in God, who have not heard of him, nor by hearing knowne him. Thirdly, his inference is of no force at all, For by this place it is not proved, that faith is the first beginning of justification: but this is proved, that as the word begetteth faith, which doth justifie, or as the Apostle speaketh in other words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30, whom the Lord doth call, them he doth justifie: so faith begetteth invocation and all other dueties of sanctification, for whom God doth justifie, hee doth sanctifie. Now sanctification is the beginning of glorification in this life: for by it the Lord beginneth in us a spirituall and eternall life: and as glory is <hi>gratia consummata,</hi> so grace is <hi>gloria inchoata.</hi> So that from this place compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13, 14. wee may be bold to set dowue the degrees of salvation in this order, Election, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Iustification, Glorification, and that either begun in this life, which is sanctification, or consummate in the life to come, which is our eternall salvation.</p>

and dignity, <hi>ut sint Dei filii:</hi> that they are the Sonnes of God not onely after, but when they doe receive him, For of them that receive Christ, even by the first degree of faith, it is said, that they are borne of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 1. Whosoever beleeveth, that Iesus is Christ, is borne of God: hee doth not say, is in possibility to bee hereafter; but hee speaketh in the time past, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are borne of God. For indeed regeneration in order of nature, though not in time, goeth before faith, which the Spirit, when hee doth regenerate us, worketh in us. <hi>Iansenius</hi> well observeth, that the parts of this text understood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> sence, cannot well stand together: that those who are said to have received Christ should have power given them wherby they may be made the Sonnes of God. For if they have received him, they are already the Sonnes of God, and need not to bee made Sonnes of God. And on the contrary, if they are in possibility to be made Sons then now they are not, and if they be not Sonnes, then they have not yet received him. And further he observeth, that of them, who are here said to have power given them to be the Sons of God, in the next verse it is said, that they are born of God. Besides, those who have not yet received Christ by faith, are notwithstanding in possibility to be made the Sons of God, whiles they are capable of faith, and are in possibility to beleeve. The place to which he referreth us, is 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. Ye know, that hee, who worketh righteousnesse, is borne of God: from whence this may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that working of righteousnesse is an evident signe or marke of him that is borne of God: not that working righteousnesse is the cause to make a man Gods child, but an evidence to declare that hee is the child of God. For he that is borne of God committeth not sinne 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. as a servant of sinne, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 34. and hereby we doe know that we are passed from death to life, that is, that wee are justified, because wee love the brethren, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. Hereby the sonnes of God are manifest and the sonnes of the Devill; hee that worketh not righteousnesse is not of God, nor hee that loveth not his brother, <hi>vers.</hi> 10.

And although it be the beginning of sanctification and of all other graces: yet it is not onely the beginner, but the continuer also of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, purifying still the heart, and working by love; by which we stand, by which wee live, being by the power<note n="y" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> of God <hi>through faith,</hi> preserved unto salvation. And although it be termed by some the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as it is) of inherent righteousnesse; yet it alone, as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by diuers testimonies of the Fathers, sufficeth to justification. And therefore by it wee have not a partiall or inchoated, but a perfect and plenary justification.</p>
               <p>§. XI. <hi>To these testimonies</hi> saith he, <hi>naturall reason may be added;</hi> and<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reasons.</note> well may hee call it naturall, for there is little art in it: and although it bee very simple, yet it is double containing two slender proofes. The former, <hi>because faith is the foundation of hope and charity: but neither hope nor charity is the foundation of faith. For a man may beleeve that which hee neither hopeth for, nor loveth, but hee cannot hope for, or love that, which hee doth not beleeve.</hi> And what then? therfore faith is the beginning of other graces. And what then? therefore it followeth, that it doth not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie alone, for it is but one among many: but it doth not follow, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not justifie alone. And where hee saith that faith is the foundation of hope, and that a man cannot hope for that which he doth not beleeve; this overthroweth a maine Doctrine of the Church of Rome maintained by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in other places, that a man may hope well for the remission of his fins, and for his salvation, but without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall revelation he may not beleeve it. His second reason hath no sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in it. <hi>In bodily diseases,</hi> saith hee, <hi>the beginning of health is, for a man to beleeve, that hee is sicke, and to beleeve the Physitian, that taketh upon him to cure him, and yet not that faith alone is entire health.</hi> Where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> compareth justification to health recovered from sicknesse to which not justification may bee compared, but sanctification. For the disease of the soule, as well as of the body, is not onely a privation or absence of health, but also an evill disposition or habit: which is cured by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary disposition or habit: for as the whole body of sinne is cured in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:22501:199"/>
some measure by the grace of regeneration or sanctification: so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall members thereof: as infidelity by faith, despaire by hope, hatred by charity, pride by humility, uncleannesse by chastitie, drunkennesse by sobriety, &amp;c. Secondly, he compareth the beleefe of a sicke man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that the Physitian will cure him, which is no health at all, nor meanes of health, but in conceit, for many times it proveth otherwise, (the promise of the Physitian being deceiveable and the event uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) to the faith of an humbled sinner grounded on the infallible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, which are alwayes performed, to them that beleeve.</p>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ying faith doth not justifie by way of disposing. And therefore if it be proved, that feare doth dispose a man to justification: yet that doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove justification by faith alone. For we have confessed, that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in adultis</hi> there are preparative dispositions going before faith and justification, whereof feare is one. But these preparatives doe not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: and therefore, for all them, faith may, and indeed doth justifie alone. Secondly, you are to understand, that this feare, which goeth before grace, is no grace: neither is it that sonne-like feare, which is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith and love, but the servile feare as he confesseth: which is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and fruit of the Law, working on those who are under the Law, and keeping them in some order for feare of the whippe. Neither is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>timor Dei</hi> the feare of God, but <hi>metus supplicii;</hi> the object where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of or the thing feared is not God, but punishment: or if it be of God, it is not to feare him, but to be affraid of him. From which our Saviour hath redeemed those that beleeve, that they may worship God in some measure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without this feare. Neither doth it <hi>per se,</hi> and in its owne nature tend to justification, which is the exaltation<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 18. 14.</note> of a sinner, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to despaire, which is the lowest dejection of a sinner. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Law by working this feare is a Schoolemaster unto Christ (for when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But to say that feare doth concurre unto justification in the same manner as faith doth, is against reason and against common sence, unlesse hee speaketh onely of the legall faith, which as it is wrought by the Law, so it worketh feare. For feare driveth to the humiliation, faith tendeth to the exaltation of the humbled soule, and by it indeed the soule is exalted. Therefore as humiliation goeth before exaltation; so feare before faith. Againe, as feare goeth before faith, so sinne goeth before feare. For sinne maketh a man guilty, the Conscience being by the Law convicted of guilt, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the soule; the soule terrified, either sinketh in despaire, being left to it selfe: or prevented by God according to the purpose of his grace, by which it was elected in Christ, seeketh to God, who is found of them that sought him not.

               <p>§. II. But as this discourse proving that feare is a disposition to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is impertinent; and affirming that feare concurreth to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the same manner that faith doth, is false: so are some of his allegations also impertinent. Because they belong not to this servile feare which goeth before faith and and justification, but to the Sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like feare, which is a fruit both of faith and love and a consequent of justification. As namely, his first place i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the feare of God, which the Sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> in that chapter from the tenth verse to the end doth so highly extoll, is not this servile feare, but the filiall feare: by which is meant true piety it selfe, which as he calleth it there the beginning, so also the<note n="b" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> Crowne and fulnesse of Wisedome. But the place is not rightly translated in the Latine, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth follow. For the Greeke text is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the wrathfull man cannot be justified, or as some editions doe read, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> unjust wrath cannot be justified, according to that of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> the wrath<note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 1, 20,</note> of man doth not worke the righteousnesse of God. And that the former part of the vers speaketh of wrath, is proved by the latter, which is the reason of the former, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the sway of his wrath is his ruine, and by the words going before: where the feare of the Lord is present, it turneth away wrath and represseth anger.</p>
               <p>§. III. So his second, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111. 10. and third, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 7. where it is said, that the feare of the Lord is the beginning of Wisedome, and by Wisedome saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is meant perfect justification, hee should say sanctification or godlinesse. For as the wicked man is <hi>Salomons</hi> foole: so the godly man is the onely wise man. And in this sense <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> prayeth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 12. Teach us O Lord so to number our daies that wee may apply our hearts to Wisedome, that is, to true godlinesse, and to the same purpose <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, <hi>c.</hi> 28. 28. the feare of the Lord it selfe,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:22501:200"/>
is Wisedome, and so <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 27. Now in these places the Hebrew word <hi>Reshith</hi> which is translated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> beginning, may fitly, as in many other places, bee translated the head, that is a chiefe or principall part, or the top: and the meaning is, that the feare of God is a principall part of godlinesse, and as you heard even now, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2. 18. the Crowne of Wisedome. Otherwise I cannot conceive how feare, which is a fruit both of faith and of love, should truely be said to bee the beginning of godlinesse; which by consent of all is the prerogative of faith. And yet faith it selfe doth not justifie, as it is the beginning of inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and much lesse feare which concurreth with it not to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but onely to sanctification. Now that servile feare is not meant in these places, it is evident, not onely because such commendations are given unto it, as belong not to servile feare; but also because they that are indued with this feare are pronounced blessed, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 112. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 128. 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 14. whereas those who have the greatest measure of servile feare are accursed; and contrariewise they are happy who are most freed from it. The blessednesse promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the faithfull in his seed, is by <hi>Zachary</hi> expounded, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75. to be this, that being redeemed from the hand of our enemies wee should worship the Lord without feare. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> testifieth that there is no feare in love, but perfect love casteth out feare, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the feare mentioned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 27. where it is said, The feare of the Lord is a well-spring of life to avoid the snares of death, is the sonne-like feare of which <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh in the words next going before. In the feare of the Lord<note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 14. 26.</note> there is strong confidence. Fifthly, the feare of the Lord mentioned; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 21. is the son-like feare, which in that <hi>Chapter</hi> from the tenth <hi>verse</hi> is highly commended. Of this feare it is said among other things, that it is gladnesse, and a crowne of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that it maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy and gladnesse, <hi>verse</hi> 11, 12. which are things repugnant to servile feare.</p>
               <p>§. IV. But let us see how he proveth his unlike likenesse, that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> proofes from Scripture.</note> feare doth in a manner justifie as faith doth, <hi>viz.</hi> by Scriptures, by Fathers, by Reason.</p>
               <p>First, because <hi>as it is said of faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>so without feare we cannot please God. Answ.</hi> This is true of the sonne-like feare, which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable companion of justification: though <hi>Bellarmines</hi> allegation of <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. 22. proveth it not, as I have shewed. But of the servile feare it may be truly said, that they who please God most, have the least of it. For the greater a mans love is, the lesse is his feare, and perfect love expelleth this feare, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 18. But though without the true feare of God we cannot please him; yet that doth not prove that feare doth justifie. For the like may be said of the obedience of the Law, of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of charity, of repentance, of perseverance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. and of the like. Neither doth faith justifie, because without it no man can please God, but because by it alone wee receive Christ, in whom God is well pleased and reconciled unto us, that is, because by it alone wee are justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:22501:200"/>Secondly, because as faith is the beginning of justice, so seare is the beginning of wisedome. <hi>Answ.</hi> of this comparison neither part is to be understood of justification, but of sanctification or righteousnesse inherent. For as faith is the mother of grace; of all both internall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and also of externall obedience: so the true sonne-like feare of God is a principall part of true piety. But what doth this make for servile feare, which is found in them who have no grace?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>because as faith doth justifie by making us seeke God and to come unto him: so also feare. Answ.</hi> If by seeking of God be meant the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God: then that which causeth it, is the cause of sanctification. But servile feare in it selfe serveth rather to drive men from God: though in the gracious dispensation of Gods providence it be made sometimes a meanes to draw them to him. And this he proveth by <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34. when he he slew them they sought him; and <hi>Psalm.</hi> 83. 16. fill their faces with shame, and they shall seeke thy name, and <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. 5. from the example of the Ninivit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s. The thing I consesse, that by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile feare men are often times forced to seeke God: how beit that which is forced, many times is fained: as we see in the example of the Israelites, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 36. who, though by the judgements of God were brought to make semblance of repentance; yet they did but dissemble, for their hart was not upright with God, neither were they stedfast in his covenant, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. But his proofes I allow not. For the first place speaketh of Gods judgments: the second, of shame: the third, of the faith of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivites, none of feare.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>because as by faith Christ is formed in us, so by feare:</hi> the <hi>protasis</hi> he proveth, <hi>because</hi> Paul <hi>saith</hi> Gal. 4. 19. <hi>my little children of whom I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in birth againe, untill Christ be formed in you.</hi> But Christ is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in us by justification, but by regeneration, whereby we are renewed according to his image: the <hi>ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>dosis, because</hi> Esay <hi>saith, C.</hi> 26. 18. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Septuagint, <hi>from thy feare we have conceived, and have brought forth the Spirit of Salvation.</hi> But why doth hee flee from the Latine translation, unto which hee is bound? which maketh no mention of feare: but onely saith, we have conceived, and have brought forth the Spirit of health as some editions read: which last words are not read to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Greeke, nor in the true editions of the Latine, but divided by a note of distinction: <hi>peperimus Spiritum: salutes non fecimns.</hi> Thus <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> for his owne advantage eiteth the fomer part out of the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> and the later out of the vulgar Latine, and that corrupted, when neither of both agreeth with the originall. From which, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would argue, he should make himselfe very ridiculous. The words are, we have conceived, we have travailed, we have, as it were, brought forth wind (so <hi>Pagninus, Vatablus, Tremellius,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Salutes non fecimus in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> no salvations have we wrought on the earth: which words being a complaint, cannot import that they had from the feare of God (which is not here mentioned) brought forth the Spirit of salvation. So farre is this place from proving that Christ by feare is formed in us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>as faith doth justifie, because the just man shall live by his faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:22501:201"/>
Hab. 2. 4. <hi>so of feare it is written, that the feare of the Lord is the fountaine of life, Prov.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Answ.</hi> The former place speaketh both of the life of grace, which is our vivification, and the life of glory to which wee are intitled by faith. The latter, as I have shewed, speaketh of sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like feare, which, as all other habits of grace, may bee called fountaines of living well, which all arise from one common spring, which is faith, and are all not causes and much lesse preparations, but fruits of faith and consequents of justification.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>as faith doth justifie by purging of sinnes, so feare. Answ.</hi> To the proposition. Faith doth justifie by absolving from sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and removing the guilt. And it purgeth also from the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by sanctifying and purifying the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. To the reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that feare which expelleth sinne <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. is as I have shewed the feare of sonnes and not of slaves: neither doth it concurre to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but to sanctification.</p>
               <p>§. V. To the testimonies of the Fathers affirming (some of them)<note place="margin">His Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> that feare serveth to prepare and to dispose men to sanctification; and likewise to his reason, <hi>that it is the nature osfeare to flee from evill, and to seeke remedies whereby evill may be avoided,</hi> I willingly subscribe. But though feare be one meanes among many to dispose or prepare men for sanctification, or yet for justification: yet neither it nor any of the rest doth justifie, and therefore doth not disprove justification by faith alone. Legall faith working feare is a preparative to the Evangelicall justifying faith: but is so farre it selfe from justifying, that it pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth accursed those that are endued therewith.</p>

Neither can there be any sound hope of eternall life untill a man doth truely beleeve, that the promise of salvation doth belong unto him: and that he cannot beleeve untill he have the condition of the promise, which is justifying faith: and therefore of necessity justifying goeth before hope. As for that hope which goeth before justifying faith, it is evident that it doth not justifie; neither is it an habit of grace infused, but a naturall affection, such as is in all men who attempt any thing. As the Apostle saith,<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 10.</note> he that plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ploweth in hope: and hee that thresheth, thresheth in hope.

And by that argument our Saviour putteth him in comfort that hee should be cured, because his sinnes which were the meritorious cause of his sicknesse were forgiven. By which glad tydings hee would have him to be assured by speciall saith of the remission of his sinnes, and in that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance to be confident. So that although the word <gap reason="foreign">

If it be said, that wee make repentance to be the fruit of faith, which we define to be a full assurance of Gods favour, &amp;c. I answere that that definition agreeth onely to speciall faith. Not that all speciall faith is a full assurance, but that every virtue is to be defined according to the perfection of it, and as it is in it selfe considered in
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:22501:202"/>
the abstract. Otherwise we acknowledge degrees of assurance. And if any of our Divines have held the speciall faith to be the onely justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, they are to be understood as speaking of justification in the court of conscience, and as judging them onely to be justified and to have remission of sinnes, who are in their owne consciences perswaded, and in some measure assured thereof. But besides and before the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith, whereby wee are justified in our owne conscience applying the promise of the Gospell to our selves, a formall degree of faith is to bee acknowledged being the condition of the Evangelicall promises, by which we aprehend, receive, and embrace Christ, as hath been shewed, and by which we are justified before God. This degree of faith in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature goeth before repentance, though in time repentance see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to goe before faith, as being sooner discerned. But in order of nature, as well as of time, repentance goeth before speciall faith. Because no man can be assured of Gods favour in remitting his sinnes, who hath not repented thereof.</p>

First, by the parable of a creditour who having two debtors, whereof the one owed him five hundred pence, the other fiftie, and neither of them having any thing to pay, he freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave them both their debt. Our Saviour ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>fore demanding of the Pharisee, who had invited him, which of these debtours would love the creditour most; the Pharisee truely answered, I suppose he, to whom he forgave most: which answer, approved by our Saviour, plainely proveth that love was not the cause of forgivenesse, but forgivenesse of love, and the forgiveing of more the cause of greater love, and the forgivenesse of lesse the cause of lesse love: and consequently, that the greater love was not the cause of greater forgivenesse, but the effect of it. This pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable our Saviour applying to the Pharisee that invited him as the lesse debtour, and to the woman, which had been a notorious sinner, as the greater debtor, to both which he had forgiven their debts, they having nothing to pay, sheweth, that her grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er love was an evidence of her greater debt forgiven. Secondly, by the antithesis in the same verse, but to whom little is forgiven, hee loveth but a little. It is therefore plaine that the forgivenesse is the cause of love, and the forgiving of more, of more love, and the forgiving of lesse, of lesse love. And as lesse love is a token of the lesse debt forgiven, so greater love of more forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: hee speaketh therefore of her love, not as the cause going before, but as the effect following after justification.</p>

I deny the consequence: the love of the brethren is not the cause, but the fruit of our justification, whereby it may be knowne. And this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth manifestly out of these words which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath fraudulently omitted. <hi>Nos scimus quia translati sumus, &amp;c.</hi> wee know that wee are translated from death to life, because wee love the brethren.

                  </gap> that we are already passed or transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life.

Now God loveth no man actually whom hee doth not justifie, and reconcile unto himselfe in Christ; for untill then wee are in the state of enemies. Neither doth any that is not justified nor reconciled to God in Christ, love him: or if hee doe then doth hee love God before God loveth him. Gods love therefore goeth before our justification, and our justification goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our love of God. Neither is this onely true, that God loveth us before wee love him, but before wee can love him aright, wee must bee perswaded of his love towards us, which perswasion is faith, from which love proceedeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, <hi>that God indeed lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth men first, and by loving them maketh them just but by little and little and by certaine meanes. For whom hee loveth, hee first calleth to faith, then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireth into them hope and feare and love inchoated, lastly, he justifieth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth perfect charity. Reply,</hi> First, that which he speaketh of making just by little and little may agree to sanctification, but to justification it agreeth not; for thereof there are no degrees. Secondly, It would bee knowne, whether this beginning of charity, which he saith goeth before justification, bee the same which in justification is infused, differing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in degree, If it be not the same, how is it <hi>charitas inchoata</hi> and if it be not infused, as well as that in the act of justification, why doth he say it is inspired? If it bee the same, then <hi>gratia gratum faciens</hi> is inspired before regeneration, before which wee are nothing but flesh, and in our flesh there is no good thing. And by this reason justification shall bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the perfecting of that charity which before was begun: neither can a man bee truely said to bee justified by charity, who is not endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore the Papists doe never attaine to that which they call justification, which indeed is not justification, but the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sanctification. Or if they say they doe attaine unto it, and that they have no sinne, they are lyars, and there is no truth in them.</p>

Now no men have the Spirit of God, but they who are regenerated and justified: for the Spirit of truth the world cannot receive. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>this is true of perfect love, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love and inchoated</hi> which even now out of the Counsel of Aureng he confessed to be inspired of the holy Spirit, <hi>may be had without the Spirit; but not without Gods speciall helpe.</hi> Which words discover unto us one of the depthes of Satan in the mystery of iniquity. For the Papists, as they doe wonderfully extenuate originall sinne, so doe they use to magnifie
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:22501:204"/>
the strength of nature corrupted. They doe not acknowledge that, which the Scriptures plainely teach, that by nature <note n="c" place="margin">

And further the privative corruption which they cannot deny to be in originall sinne, they confesse by the halves, or not so much: for the privation which is in originall sinne is not onely of the act, which they doe not wholly confesse but of the power and the habit it selfe. So that in us by nature there is a meere impotencie to that which is spiritually good, in respect whereof wee have lost <hi>bonum possibilitatis</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth. Wherefore that wee may bee ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to beleeve, to hope, to love, to feare God, to purpose amendment of life, &amp;c. it is necessary that wee should bee not holpen, or loosed, but renewed, regenerated, created a new, and raised from the grave of sinne.</p>
               <p>§. VII. And here I am to mention two things, both for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note place="margin">Whether the beginnings of grace be graces</note> of true though weake Christians, and also for the detestation of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. These beginnings of faith, of hope, of love, of amendment of life, the Papists doe not acknowledge to be graces infused, but the fruits of nature assisted with Gods special helpe, by which, they being holpen of God doe prepare and dispose themselves to the grace of justification, which is given to man according to their owne preparative dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But forasmuch as these beginnings of faith and other vertues are not the fruits of nature (for in our flesh there is no good thing, and that which is borne of the flesh is flesh; the very disposition of our nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enmity against God) but of the regenerating spirit: the weake Christians therefore; though the graces of God in them are weake and small, even as a graine of Mustard-seed: yet if they bee true and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they are to be perswaded, that the Lord, who in his children accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the will for the deed, will accept of them, as the fruits of his spirit; seeing hee professeth, that hee will not quench the <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 12. 20.</note> smoaking flaxe, nor breake the bruised reed. And surely, if the Spirit of God bee the author of no charity, but that which is perfect, then is he author of none in this life, wherein wee receive but the first <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> fruits of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. The Papists doe not hold themselves to bee justified untill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity bee infused into them, by infusion whereof all sinne is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. So that in any one of them being justified no sinne remaineth. And therefore whiles sinne remaineth in them (as it doth alwayes even in the best, during this life) they are not justified. No marvell then that Papists cannot be assured of their justification, seeing they may bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that they are never justified because they never attaine to perfect righteousnesse in this life, and because sinne doth alwayes remaine in them.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. Our third argument I propound thus:<note place="margin">Our third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note>

               <p>Therefore before reconciliation and justification no man can love God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth <hi>that a man may love God, though God be angry with him:</hi> which is in respect of Gods children, who are justified and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto him; but the question is, whether those that are not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and justified, can love God: wee know that Gods anger may stand with reconciliation.

Gods children therefore may love God, where they know him to be justly angry with them: but they that are enemies, as all are untill they be reconciled, doe not love God: but the very disposition of their corrupt nature is <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> enmity against God.</p>
               <p>§. IX. His fifth disposition is Penitencie, which, as he saith, is a sorow<note place="margin">His fifth dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, is Peten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> for sinne and a detestation of it: which I deny not, ordinarily to be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in the children of God to repentance. But this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the godly sorrow which some call contrition, which is not to be found in naturall men, which is a sorrow conceived, not so much for the punishment deserved, as for the offence of God, whom they have displeased and dishonoured being so gracious a God unto them. This proceedeth from faith and from love. Of this it is said, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> godly sorrow worketh repentance never to be repented of. As for that sorrow, which is conceived not for the offence of God, but for the shame and punishment which follow sinne, which some call at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, it is of the same nature with servile fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Iudas;</hi> yet God is pleased sometimes to use it as a meanes to draw his elect unto him. But though contrition dispose men to repentance, and attrition be used sometimes as a preparative to faith, because humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is the way to exaltation: yet neither of both justifie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for all them, faith alone doth justifie.</p>
               <p>§. X. But let us examine his proofes: wherein, though his premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<note place="margin">

Therefore God hath given to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles penance unto life. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. The sorrow which is according unto God worketh penance to salvation that is stable. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 27. when a wicked man shall turne himselfe from his wickednesse, hee shall quicken his soule. <hi>What can be more cleare? if penance be given of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, that is, to obtaine life, if sorrow for sinne undertaken for God worke pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to salvation, if he which doth penance doth quicken his owne soule: how doth faith alone justifie, or how doth penance not justifie? Answ.</hi> When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider your arguments, I wonder at your confidence. The word which in the vulgar latine is in the two first places translated <hi>poenitentia,</hi> and by the Rhemists penance, in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is not sorrow for
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:22501:205"/>
sin, but repentance it selfe, which importeth a change of a mans mind and disposition, and is not a forerunner, but a consequent of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God: which in the first place is called repentance unto life, because though it bee no cause, but a consequent of justification, yet it is the way to life, and a necessary forerunner to glorification. The godly sorrow in the second place is commended as an excellent disposition to the renewing ofrepentance in the faithfull not to bee repented of. The third <hi>Bellarmine</hi> readeth thus: when a wicked man shall turne himselfe from his wickednesse, hee shall make alive his soule, as if a wicked man could either turne himselfe from his wickednesse, or quicken his owne soule, or as if a dead man could restore himselfe to life. But then is the wicked turned, when God doth turne him: and then is his soule quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when God doth quicken him. The words are, when the wicked turneth from his wickednesse, hee shall preserve his soule from death; that is, as it is expounded in the next verse, he shall live. Howsoever, this place speaketh not of any foregoing disposition, but of repentance it selfe, which in order of nature never goeth before justification, though many times it be discerned before it, as the cause many times is knowne by the effect. But not whatsoever is necessary to salvation, doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. All the graces of sanctification, and namely repentance, have their necessary use: But justification is ascribed onely to faith, because it is the onely instrument ordained of God to receive Christ, who onely is our righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>§. XI. His sixth disposition is a purpose and desire to receive the<note place="margin">His sixth dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, a desire and purpose to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> Sacrament: by which, as he conceiveth, justification is conferd. <hi>Answ.</hi> If we did hold with them (as we doe not) that the Sacraments doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and that without them no man could be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and therefore also that they who would be justified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought to desire and purpose to be made pertakers of the Sacrament: yet what would this hinder the justification by faith alone? which if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> disprove not, all that hee saith is impertinent. How much more, if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sacraments doe conferre grace according to the Popish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, nor the desire of the Sacrament be a disposition to justification. All that in this case can truely be said is, that forasmuch as God in his great mercy hath ordained the Sacraments, as effectuall meanes to confirme our faith, and to seale unto us our justification, that it is a signe of a prophane and unsanctified heart, to neglect or to despise such holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God.</p>
               <p>§. XII. His seventh disposition, is the purpose of a new life, and of<note place="margin">His seventh dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of a new life.</note> observing all the commandements of God, without which wee ought not to be made pertakers of the Sacraments. <hi>Answ.</hi> This purpose of a new life, is that which the Scriptures call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> repentance; which is a fruit of justifying faith and a consequent of justification. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those <hi>adulti,</hi> which come to the Sacraments, ought to bring with them this purpose; it followeth, that they ought first to be justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and then to receive the Sacrament as a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith. So that this purpose;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:22501:206"/>
though it be necessary to salvation, yet neither doth justifie, nor dispose to justification. The place, which hee citeth out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. is an exhortation to both the parts of sanctification, <hi>viz.</hi> mortification, in those words, cast from you all your transgressions: vivification, in those, and make you a new heart and a new spirit. But of justification he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not. Neither are we any where exhorted thereto, or to the parts thereof, which are not our acts, but the actions of God himselfe, who onely remitteth our sinnes and accepteth of us as righteous in Christ by imputation of his righteousnesse.

But though true justifying faith be never alone, but is alwayes accompanied with other graces, yet it justifieth alone: though it never be without other graces, yet it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth without them, &amp;c. his consequence therefore I deny: which hee laboureth to prove thus: <hi>If the whole force of justifying were in faith alone, insomuch that other virtues though present, conferre nothing to justification: then faith might justifie as well in the absence, as in the presence of the rest: but that it cannot doe: therefore the force of justifying is not wholly in faith, but partly in it, and partly in the rest. Answ.</hi> This consequence also I doe deny, and doe referre you to the similitude of the eye heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which though it be not alone, yet doth see alone: and though whiles it liveth it cannot be severed from the other parts of the body, yet it seeth without them against which similitude <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might as well argue after this manner. If the whole force of seeing were in the eye alone, insomuch that the rest of the members being present, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre nothing to the act of sight: then the eye might see as well in the absence as in the presence of the rest. But every body knoweth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequence of this proposition. For though to the act of seeing other members doe not concurre with the eye, as any causes thereof; yet to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:22501:206"/>
the true being of the eye their presence is necessary, for it cannot be a true living organicall eye and instrument of sight, that hath not union with the other parts, and is not animated by the same soule. Even so I answere concerning faith: that although to the act of justifying other graces doe not concurre with faith, as any causes thereof: yet to the true being of faith their presence is necessary. For it cannot be a true lively justifying faith, which is severed from all other graces of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and is not wrought and made effectuall by the Spirit of regeneration.</p>
               <p>§. II. Now he commeth to prove the antecedent of his argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that conditionall proposition: <hi>if faith may be separated from hope and love and the other virtues, witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

An Enthymeme is an unperfect Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, which is to be made up or perfected by adding that part of the Syllogisme which is wanting. In this Enthymeme, though the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent be a conditionall proposition; yet the proposition or Major of the Syllogisme, which also is conditionall, is wanting, and ought thus to be supplyed:</p>
               <p>If faith alone doth justifie, then it may justifie being severed from hope and love and other virtues.</p>
               <p>But it cannot justifie being severed from hope and love and other virtues:</p>

               <p>This assumption he endevoureth to prove by three arguments, but to no purpose. For though w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As the hand which receiveth the almes, releeveth the poore man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the almes, which it doth receive. And yet I doe not conceive that therefore the hand and the almes be relatives. But we confesse, that justifying faith is not without his object: yet that object, by apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>tively, is not righteousnesse inherent (as here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> against his owne conscience doth suggest) but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:22501:207"/>
of Christ by which wee are justified: betweene which, and faith there is such a relation; that as justifying faith is called the faith of Christ, or faith in Christ, faith in his bloud: so the righteousnesse of Christ by which wee are justified is called the righteousnesse of faith. And further I confesse, that whosoever is justified by righteousnesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, is also in some measure just by righteousnesse inherent, though he be not justified before God thereby. But whereas he saith, that wee will easily admit this argument, that where faith is, there is also inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent justice, and consequently that justifying faith cannot be severed from other virtues, because wee teach, that by every sinne faith is lost: I doe much marvell at his impudency: for though he and his consorts doe wickedly teach, that by every act of infidelity faith is lost: yet wee are so farre from granting, that faith is lost by every sinne, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently hold, that true justifying faith is never totally or finally lost, by any sinne whatsoever that is incident to the faithfull and regenerate man. Some indeed have taught that by hainous offences, which doe <hi>vastare conscientiam,</hi> waste the conscience, faith is lost: yet that is farre from saying, it is lost by every sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>againe,</hi> saith he, <hi>if faith doth justifie relatively, then it cannot be in a mans minde, but justice also must be there, and without love there is no justice. Answ.</hi> Without love there is no justice inherent, but that is not it to which faith when it justifieth hath relation, but that which faith having justified us bringeth forth in us as a consequent of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>moreover,</hi> saith he, <hi>if faith severed from all other virtues doe justifie alone, then it may also justifie being accompanied with those vices which are contrary to those virtues. But this cannot be imagined, that a man should be justified, and yet remaine a wicked man. Answ.</hi> If by vices he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand certaine vicious dispositions, which though they doe not reigne in the faithfull, yet remaine in them as their infirmities: I confesse, that justifying faith may and doth stand with such. But if he meane the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary habits of sinne, which reigne in the hearts of the wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinners; I professe, that justifying faith cannot stand with such. For where these doe reigne the man is wholly unregenerate: and where regeneration is not, there faith, which by regeneration is wrought, cannot be. It is therefore against the nature and being of a true justifying faith, to harbour in a soule unregenerate.</p>
               <p>§. IV. To this argument he saith we answere, that they assume that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> proofes that faith may bee alone.</note> which is impossible, <hi>viz.</hi> that faith may be alone: which I beleeve not to have beene the answere of any of our Doctors, for a man arguing <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, may suppose that which is impossible, and yet the argument be of no lesse force. But our assertion that faith cannot be alone, which before I have made good in the second <hi>Chapter</hi> of this booke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against <hi>Bellarmines</hi> objections, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. hee laboureth <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Luther</hi> saith, that faith justifieth both before and without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I rejoyne: it justifieth before, because in order of nature it goeth
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:22501:207"/>
before: without, because, though Charity be present with it, yet it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth without it: even as the eye, though the eare be with it, yet seeth without it. Secondly, <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, that the seed of faith remaineth in the greatest falles of the faithfull, and therefore without Charity. I rejoyne: <hi>Calvin</hi> saith no more than S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth, <note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>

                  </note> that the seed of God doth alwaies remaine in those that are borne of God: which seed of God is, as well the seed of Charity, as of Faith, and both the one and the other remaine in the greatest fals of Gods children; as wee see in <hi>Peter,</hi> in whom, though he fell most grievously, in denying and sorswearing his Lord, yet the seeds, yea the habits of faith and love did remaine, as I have proved <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>De persever. c.</hi> 10. §. 7.</note> elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Secondly, saith he, <hi>because our argument assumeth, not that faith may be alone: but that if faith did justifie alone, it would doe so though it were alon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> this reason doth not confute our assertion, that faith cannot be alone, but taketh away that answere which he falsely, I thinke, assigneth to us. But this consequence of his, I have denied and disproved.</p>
               <p>His third reason, which is but the second to disprove our assertions, <hi>if it bee true,</hi> saith he, <hi>that true faith is never alone, then it is because faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth those other graces, even as a good Tree bringeth forth good fruit. And if this were so, then faith should goe before love and other graces, if not in time, yet in nature. But faith cannot be conceived to be in nature before justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or justice infused, or those graces wherein justification consisteth,</hi> because these are relatives, as they say, God justifying and faith receiving justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: for relatives are <hi>simulnatura, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> The relatives that we meane, are Christs righteousnesse imputed of God, and faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, or receiving it, which though they bee <hi>simul natura</hi> in respect of the one to the other, yet both of them are before the other graces in order of nature. <hi>But if justifying faith be before charity, and there be no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse without charity, then</hi> (saith he) <hi>the same man may be just, and not just at the same time.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that such an absurdity as he imagineth, that the same man, at the same time, should be a sinner in himselfe, and righteous in Christ: a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner according to the Law, because he hath broken it; but righteous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>of those causes</hi> (he meaneth reasons) <hi>which may be given why faith alone doth justifie. All which,</hi> as he saith, <hi>may be reduced to three heads.</hi> The <hi>first, is the authority of Gods word.

               <p>
                  <hi>The second is the will of God justifying: namely because it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to grant justification upon the onely condition of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is the nature of faith it selfe, because it is the proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y of faith alone to apprehend justification, and to apply it unto us and to make it ours.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these I have rendred other causes; the chiefe and principall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this: because we are justified not by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves, but onely by the righteousnesse of Christ which being out of us in him is imputed onely to them that beleeve, and is received onely by faith.</p>
               <p>§. II. But these three causes or reasons which he mentioneth, will not<note place="margin">The first cause authority of Scriptures.</note> easily be remov'd: the first the authority of the Scriptures, this being the maine doctrine of the Gospell. Yea, (but saith <hi>Bellarmine) it is no where said in expresse termes that faith alone doth justifie when we,</hi> saith he, <hi>have expresse termes, that a man is justified by workes, and not by faith onely,</hi> Iam. 2. 24. <hi>Answ.</hi> To the place in the Epistle of <hi>Iames,</hi> I shall answere fully in his due <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> place. Onely here I say thus much. That Saint <hi>Iame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of the justification of a sinner before God, by which he is made or constituted just, (of which our question is:) but of that, whereby a just man already justified before God, may be approved declared and knowne both to himselfe and others to be just. And that the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh not, either of workes as causes, but as signes of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or of the habit of true faith: but of the profession of faith, or faith professed onely: and concludeth, that a man is justified, that is, knowne and approved to be just, not onely by the profession of the true faith, but by workes also: a godly conversation being, as it were, the life and soule of the profession, and without which it is dead. But though in expresse tearmes it be not said in so many words and Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that faith doth justifie alone: yet this doctrine is by most necessary consequence deduced from the Scriptures. And what may by necessary
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:22501:208"/>
consequence be deducted out of the Scriptures, that is contained in the scriptures, as all confesse. Wherunto may be added, that the Fathers so conceived of the doctrine of the scriptures, who with one consent, as you have heard <note n="b" place="margin">Supr. cap. 9.</note> have taught according to the scriptures, that by faith we are justified alone. And the Papists must remember, that by oath they are bound to expound the scriptures according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the fathers.</p>
               <p>§. III. Now that this doctrine is contained in the Scriptures, I<note place="margin">Our first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> have plentifully proved before, <note n="c" place="margin">Supr. cap. 8.</note> and something here shall bee added. There are but two righteousnesses onely mentioned in the Scriptures, by which wee can bee justified, either that which is prescribed in the Law, which is a righteousnesse inherent in our selves, and performed by our selves; or that which is taught in the Gospell, which is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ inherent in him and performed for us. The former is the righteousnesse of the Law, or of workes: the latter, is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of faith. A third righteousnesse by which wee should bee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified cannot be named. And betweene these two there is such an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position made in the Scriptures, that if wee bee justified by the one, we cannot by the other. If therefore the Scriptures teach that wee are justified, by faith and not by workes, it is all one, as if they said, that wee are justified by faith alone. <hi>If it bee all one to say, by faith and not by the workes of the Law, or by faith alone: then</hi> saith Bellarmine, <hi>I demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> obiect.</note> 
                  <hi>all workes and every Law be excluded, or not. For if all workes be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then faith it selfe, which Ioh.</hi> 6. 29. <hi>is the worke of God, and if every Law, then the Law of faith, and consequently faith it selfe; and so to be iustified by faith, shalbe nothing else, but to be justified without faith. Answ.</hi> it is plaine, that by the Law is meant the Law of workes, and by the workes of the Law all that obedience which is prescribed in the Law. Now in the Law, which is the perfect rule of righteousnesse, all inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is prescribed. Then, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> faith it selfe and the act of faith is excluded from the act of justification. I answere, first in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Apostle opposeth faith to workes, <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ro.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 5</note> and therefore faith is not included under workes. Secondly, faith, as it is either an habit or an act, and so part of inherent righteousnesse, doth not justifie, but, as hath beene said, relatively, in respect of the object, which being received by faith doth justifie, as it was the br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. IV. Againe the Scriptures teach, that we are justified, <hi>gratis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ</hi>

To the word <hi>gratis, Bellarmine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, <hi>that it excludeth our owne merits,</hi> (which indeed can be none) <hi>but not the free gifts of God, as love, and penitencie, and the like: for then faith also should be excluded.</hi> That followeth not; for when wee are justified by faith onely, we are justified <hi>gratis: gratis</hi> saith the Apostle, freely, by his grace through the merits of Christ by faith bringing onely faith to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:22501:209"/>
as the Fathers have taught, and that not to bee any essentiall cause of our justification, but onely to be the instrument and hand to receive Christ, who is our righteousnes and therfore it is the condition required on our part in the covenant of grace. The rest, as love, and hope, and repentance, &amp;c. being not the conditions of the covenant, but the things by covenant promised to them that beleeve. Vpon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith (which is also the free gift of God) the Lord promiseth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins and justification, and to those who are redeemed and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, he doth by oath promise the graces <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>§. V. And by this the second head is also proved: namely, that it is the<note place="margin">The second cause, the will of God.</note> good pleasure of God to grant justification upon the condition of faith alone. If ye looke into all the promises of the Gospell, ye shall find that they interpose only the condition of faith. See <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 38, 39. <hi>Ro.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. and so every where. Before the incarnation of Christ, it was the good pleasure of God, by faith onely to justifie the faithfull, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe hath confessed. And doth he require any other condition of us? are not we justified as they were? By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is, by faith in him, <note n="*" place="margin">Esa. 53. 11.</note> my righteous servant shall justifie many.</p>
               <p>Yea, but the Scriptures (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) much more plainely exact the condition of Penance, and of the Sacraments to justification, than<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> of faith, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 27. The wicked if hee repent of his sinnes shall live. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 4. unlesse yee repent, ye shall likewise perish. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. unlesse a man be borne a-new of water and the holy Ghost, he shall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of God. <hi>Answ.</hi> Many things are required to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are not required to justification: which as they be necessary forerunners of glorification, so are they the fruits of faith and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of justification <hi>viz.</hi> repentance and newnesse of life, which is the thing mentioned in these places. Againe happinesse (which consisteth partly in justification or remission of sinnes, which is <hi>beatitudo viae</hi> and partly in eternall life which is <hi>beatitudo patri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>) is oftentimes attributed to those things which are not the causes of happines, but the notes and markes of them that be happy. There is but one happinesse properly, and that is to be in Christ, who is eternall <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 12. 20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>7.</note> life, whom whosoever hath, hath eternall life. Of this happinesse Christ alone is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and the cause, and faith the instrument of our union and communion with Christ. All other virtues and graces are but the fruits, and consequently the signes and markes of faith, or of our being in Christ by faith. And therefore are not so many beatitudes (though they are blessed that have them) but so many notes of one and the same happinesse. It is true, that if we be sorry for our sinnes, because by them we have displeased him who hath been so gracious a God unto us, if we confesse them, crave pardon for them, and forsake them, all which are duties of repentance, the Lord hath promised to forgive them. And
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:22501:209"/>
yet these are not causes of our justification before God, but fruits of faith by which we come to be justified in our owne conscience. By faith we obtaine remission of sinnes, and by these duties of repentance which are the fruits of justifying faith we attaine to the assurance of it. That prayer which somuch prevaileth with God, is the prayer of faith. <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 10 14.</note> That repentance which is to life is caused by faith, without which it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to please God: and therefore the Disciples, when they understood that the Gentiles were brought to beleeve in Christ, conclude, that God had given them repentance unto life, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. As for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: the justification which is assigned to them, doth not hinder justification by faith onely, but serveth to seale and to assure it.</p>
               <p>§. VI. The third cause or reason proving that faith doth justifie<note place="margin">The third cause because it is the property of faith onely to receive Christ.</note> alone is, because it is the property of faith to apprehend and to apply the promise of justification to our selves. For the clearing whereof I desire the reader to call to minde what hath beene said concerning the two degrees of justifying faith. For by the former wee apprehend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace Christ who is our righteousnesse offered in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospell to our justification before God. By the other wee apply the promises of the Gospell to our selves, that we may be justified in our owne consciences. Both which actions of receiving and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promises to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>elves, cannot be ascribed to any other grace, but are proper to faith onely.</p>
               <p>To this argument <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shapeth two answeres, the former<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> first cavill.</note> whereof is a meere cavill at the word apprehension, which wee make proper to faith: as if by apprehending we did meane the first act of the understanding, when it conceiveth the object. But this point I cleared before in the first question concerning the nature of faith: where I shewed, that this apprehension whereof <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaketh, goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all judgement of the minde. And that the understanding having first conceived and apprehended the object, judgeth of it either by withholding the assent, if it be doubtfull, which is called doubting; or by giving assent, either weakely, which is opinion; or firmely which is knowledge: this firme assent or knowledge is grounded either upon the evidence of the thing; which is either manifest in it selfe, and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the cleare intelligence; or manifested by discourse which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or science: or else the thing being not evident, either to sense or reason, upon the infallible authority of God speaking in his word, which is Faith. By this beleefe we receive Christ, not onely in our judgements by assent; but also, if this assent be lively and effectuall, we receive, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and lay hold upon him, as our Saviour, with all our soules: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him, in our judgements, in our hearts desiring to bee made partakers of him, in our wils resolving to professe him to bee our Saviour, and to obey him as our Lord, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. VII. This is the apprehension whereof we speake, and which is<note place="margin">What it is to apprehend Christ.</note> peculiar to fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is evident. <hi>Be it,</hi> saith Bellarmine, <hi>that justification after a sort is apprehended by faith. Surely it is not so apprehended, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is had, and doth inhere: but onely that it is in the minde after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:22501:210"/>
                  <hi>of an object apprehended by an action of the understanding and will,</hi> and so saith he, <hi>love and joy apprehend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these things <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sheweth himselfe to be a diviner rather than a divine: we doe not say that in our justification before God, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is apprehended by faith, but the righteousnesse of Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to justification. And that this righteousnesse of Christ, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us, is as truely and really made ours by imputation; as our sinnes, though not inherent in him, were made his, when he truely and really suffered for them. By this hand of faith we receive Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. by it we receive and embrace the promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. by it we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remission of sinnes, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 18. By this mouth, as it were, <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 54.</note> of the soule we eate the body of Christ and drinke his bloud. That, which hee speaketh of justification being in the minde after the manner of an object apprehended by an action of the understanding and the will; may in some sort be verified of the apprehension of speciall faith, applying justification to the beleever. But to say, that after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner love and joy apprehend it, is against sense. For faith apprehendeth it by a perswasion, yea, by a firme perswasion, upon which follow, love and joy, not apprehending, but loving and rejoycing at that, which faith doth apprehend. But these two are not incident unto a Papist, who renounceth speciall faith. For canst thou love Christ, and rejoyce in him as thy Saviour, if thou be not by speciall faith perswaded, that thou shalt be saved by him? Seeing then unto our justification before God we are to receive Christ, as hath beene said, by a true and lively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: and unto justification in the court of our owne conscience, by a plerophory or assured perswasion we are to apply the promises to our selves; which are the peculiar acts of faith, and cannot be attributed to any other grace: it followeth therefore from the proper nature of faith, that by it alone we are justified.</p>

                  <hi>our confession,</hi> as he saith, <hi>doe apply the promises, and justification it selfe to the receiver: therefore</hi> saith he, <hi>faith doth not justifie alone, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an instrument applying.</hi> In this argument he greatly pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but without cause. For first, when we say, that faith alone doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, we meane, that in us nothing concurreth to the act of justification with faith; but without us, we acknowledge many things to justifie. Secondly, faith justifieth alone, <hi>ut manus accipientis;</hi> the Sacraments, <hi>ut manus dantis.</hi> Thirdly, faith, doth actually justifie before God; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe not justifie before God, but serve to seale our justification to our owne consciences, neither doe they actually conferre grace, but confirme it, as the seales <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 11.</note> of that righteousnesse which is by faith. When as therefore the termes of washing, cleansing, sanctifying, saving, are attributed to Sacraments, these phrases are to be understood Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally. And this is our answere: as for those, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for us, hee hath good leave to make or to marre them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>

                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> first reason; because faith is a cause.</note> 
                  <hi>as the merit of justification, then faith doth not justifie alone, for love and penance and other good acts doe the like:</hi> but the antecedent is true, therefore the consequent. I deny first the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the proposition and the proofe thereof. For neither love, or penance, nor other good acts, doe either cause, begin, or merit justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And therefore though faith did justifie, as a cause, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the merit whereby justification is obtained, it might, for all them, justifie alone. This were sufficient to overthrow his whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But all his care is to prove the assumption, which hee endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in all the parts thereof. And first, that faith is a cause of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which we doe not deny: yea, we affirme, that nothing in us doth concurre to the act of justification, as a cause thereof, but faith onely. But you will aske, what cause? We say the instrumentall onely. If <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> meane any other cause, as no doubt but he doth; he should have done well to have named it, and to have proved it.</p>
               <p>§. II. He proveth faith to be a cause by the prepositions <hi>ex</hi> and <hi>per,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His first reason that faith is a cause; because the prepositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>ex</hi> and <hi>per</hi> are attributed unto it.</note> 
                  <hi>by and through,</hi> attributed to faith: whereto I answere, that these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles sometimes are used to signifie the instrumentall cause. As namely, when we are said to be justified or saved, through or by the word or the Sacraments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 2.

                     </gap>llarmine</hi> in another place, is not fitly accommodated to the favour of God (which is the efficient cause of justification) but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the formal as <hi>per gratiam,</hi> or meritorious, as <hi>permeritum filii,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall, cause as <hi>per fidem &amp; Sacramenta:</hi> where you see, by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> confession, <hi>per</hi> is attributed to faith as to the instrumentall cause. It is also attributed to the matter and merit, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10, 19. When as therefore it is also attributed to faith, it cannot be attributed in the same sense, as to the death and obedience of Christ in propriety of speech;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:22501:211"/>
but of necessity it is to bee understood by a metonymy, faith being put for the object of faith, which is Christs righteousnesse. And this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appeareth, when justification by the preposition is attributed both to Christ and to faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. 25. wee are justified <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the redemption which is in Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by faith in his blood, by Christ we have accesse to God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

As it is said of the cure of the cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16. that the name of Christ, by faith in his name had healed him. Thus I have shewed before, that the same benefits of justification and salvation, which properly we receive from the death and obedience of Christ are attributed to faith, not properly, but relatively and meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymically. Not that faith it selfe worketh them, but the object, which it, as the instrument, apprehendeth.</p>
               <p>§. III. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will prove, that in these, and such like places<note place="margin">His first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the contrary.</note> the prepositions by and through doe signifie a true cause, <hi>first by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For when the Apostle,</hi> Rom. 3. &amp;. 4. Gal. 2. &amp; 3. <hi>and elsewhere doth prove, that a man is not justified by workes, nor by the Law: without doubt he excludeth the force and efficacie of workes and of the Law in justifying, and not a relative apprehension alone. For no man could doubt, but that the Law and works did not justifie by apprehending righteousnes relatively. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the saying of the Apostle had been very foolish, if his meaning had beene, that justice is apprehended by faith, and not by the Law or workes. Even as a man should speake foolishly, who should say, that the almes is received by the hand and not by the heele. Neither did they, whom the Apostle confuteth, looke to be justified by their workes relatively, but by the merit of them. And therefore that which the Apostle denyeth to works, he ascribeth to faith. Answ.</hi> This manifestly proveth that the question of justification by faith or by workes, is thus to bee understood, whether wee are justified by the righteousnesse of Christ alone apprehended by faith (which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the Gospell, the righteousnesse of faith) or by a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse inherent in our selves which is the righteousnesse of the Law, or of workes. For if the question should bee understood of faith it selfe, there would be no more opposition betweene faith and workes, than is betweene the first and second justification of the Papists which are so farre from opposition, that they are sub-alternall, the one proving the other. For if we be justified by righteousnesse inherent, wee must bee justified both by habituall and actuall righteousnesse, neither of them alone sufficing in <hi>adultis:</hi> and therefore if by the one, then by the other also.</p>
               <p>Againe, Faith being but one grace among many, cannot as it is an habit inherent in us, by it owne worthinesse or merit justifie or sanctifie alone; but there must be a concurrence of charity and of other graces, neither can the habits of grace suffice to the sanctification of one come to yeares, unlesse they bring forth the fruits of obedience: neither are the fruits of obedience (called good works) of any account before God, unlesse they proceed from the inward habits of faith and love. But faith
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:22501:211"/>
considered relatively, as the instrument apprehending Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, it self alone sufficeth to justification, as the Fathers before have testified. This is the worke <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 6. 29.</note> of God, which with God is in stead of all workes, that wee beleeve on his Sonne. For hee that truely beleeveth is reputed as if he had fulfilled the whole Law, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> Christ being the end of the Law for righteousnesse to every one that beleeveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. <note n="d" place="margin">Photius apud Oecumen. in Rom. 10 4.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he therefore, saith the Apostle, that beleeveth in Christ fulfilleth the Law, because Christ hath fulfilled it for him, Christs obedience being imputed to him, and accepted of God in his behalfe, as if hee had performed the same in his owne person.</p>

Secondly <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by other places where the prepositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is used, indevoureth to prove, that faith is deciphered as a true cause. <hi>For if,</hi> saith he, <hi>in all other places the preposition by or through doth signifie a cause, why should it not betoken a cause, when a man is said to be iustified by or through faith?</hi> I answer, first, that the preposition is often used to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no cause at all, as where it is attributed to wayes and meanes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and times, waies: as <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Time, whether all time, as <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Secondly, that the preposition is often used to signifie the instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cause: as in that Hebrew phrase, by the hand of his servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32, 16. as God commanded by the hand of <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 9. 35. &amp; 35. 29. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 36. &amp; 10. 11. &amp; 26. 45. <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 37, 45, &amp;c. By the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron. Psal.</hi> 77. 20.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Iesse</hi> sent by the hand of his sonne <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So God speaketh by the hand of his Prophets, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 25. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29. 25. By the mouth of his Prophets, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 70. So by his Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> as his instruments. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 22. &amp; 2. 15.</p>
               <p>Thus God wrought miracles by the hands of <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> 19. 11. or as himselfe speaketh. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that faith is no such cause of justification, as is usually meant by the preposition, joyned either with other causes of justification, or with faith upon other occasions. And first to mention those which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith he will here omit, as that we are justified by Christ, by his blood, by his death, by his obedience: it may not be thought, that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:22501:212"/>
when it is said that wee are justified by or through Christ, and by or through faith: or by or through the bloud, the death, the obedience of Christ and by or through faith: that faith, though the same preposition be prefixed before it, should signifie the same kind of cause. When the Apostle saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. that we are justified by the grace of God; there <hi>Bellar.</hi> noteth the formall cause of our justification, confounding Gods grace and our charity: freely, that is, saith he, by the bounty of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the efficient by the redemption wrought by Christ Iesus, which noteth the meritorious cause, by faith in his blood: we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that faith is a distinct cause from the rest. For neither is it the formall, for there is but one, and that one is charity, as they teach; nor the efficient <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for that is Gods bounty and justice, nor the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the meritorious cause, for thath onely is the merit of Christ.

For justification consisteth wholly upon imputation of Christs righteousnesse which faith, as the hand doth receive.</p>
               <p>§. VI. For the better understanding the manner how faith doth<note place="margin">The difference of the acts of faith justifying and sanctifying.</note> justifie, wee are to distinguish the acts of faith both in justifying and sanctifying. The act of faith in justifying is the elicite and immediate act of faith, which is <hi>credere &amp; credendo Christum recipere &amp; amplecti:</hi> to beleeve, and by beleeving to receive and embrace Christ. The acts of faith in sanctifying and producing morall dueties, are immediate acts or <hi>imperati,</hi> which faith produceth by meanes of other virtues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by faith, such are <hi>sperare, confidere, amare, timere, obedire, pati, &amp;c</hi> Of justification the man indued with faith is not the efficient, but the subject and the patient, who receiving by faith (which is his onely act) the righteousnesse of Christ, is thereby justified, God imputing to the beleever the righteousnesse of his Sonne: and therefore though to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve bee his owne act, yet hee is not said in the active to justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by faith, but in the passive to bee justified by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. 28. &amp; 5. 1.</p>
               <p>But in the duties of sanctification and in all morall duties, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:22501:212"/>
man is the efficient of them, and his faith (as it is said of arts &amp; other habits) is the <hi>principium agendi,</hi> the principle wherby he worketh and of them faith under God is the prime cause, and as some call <note n="f" place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Such actions are the most of those which <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. are so highly commended, which though they were the fruits of justifying faith; yet were the acts of faith, not as it justifieth, but as it sanctifieth, fortifieth, or otherwise qualifieth them who are endued with it, and this efficiencie of faith, in Greeke and Latine is oftner sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified without the prepositions, than with, (As <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) though the sence be the same. Of justification therefore faith is but the instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cause, justifying relatively, that is in respect of the object which it doth receive; being the onely instrument to receive that object which alone doth justifie. But of the dueties of sanctification and other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall actions, such as for the most part are mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. whereof the faithfull man is the efficient; justifying faith, which purifieth the heart and worketh by love, and other virtues, as affiance, &amp;c. is the prime cause, working them not relatively, by apprehending the object, but effectually producing them as <hi>principium agendi,</hi> wherby <hi>Bellarmines</hi> dispute out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. is confuted. <hi>For there it is said,</hi> saith hee, <hi>that by faith the Saints overcame Kingdomes, wrought righteousnesse, obtained the promises, stopped the mouths of Lyons, &amp;c. Where the particle</hi> by <hi>doth not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie apprehension, but the true cause. For faith was the cause of</hi> Abels <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offering,</hi> of <hi>Noahs</hi> preparing the Arke, of <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, &amp;c. All this I confesse: but that which he would inferre therupon, that faith therefore doth not justifie relatively by way of apprehending the object, I have already answered, for that which hee spake before of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding relatively, was idle and frivolus.</p>
               <p>§. VII. The second part of his assumption was, <hi>that saith is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His second reason; because faith is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Iustice.</note> 
                  <hi>of justice and consequently the inchoated formall cause of justification.</hi> So that now belike the seven dispositions shall be the inchoated formes of justification, the entire forme being but one, <hi>viz.</hi> charity; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the disposing faith, and the disposing feare, and so of the rest, shall be inchoated charity, which is ridiculous. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as allwayes, by justification understandeth sanctification; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and of all inherent righteousnesse, wee acknowledge faith to bee the beginning, and consequently the beginning of that righteousnesse, by which we are formally just. But of justification, not the beginning only but the accomplishment and perfection is to be attributed unto faith because no sooner doe we by faith lay hold upon the righteousnesse of Christ, which is most perfect, but wee are perfectly justified thereby. And therefore the Fathers, as you heard before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if it be lively and perfected by Charity, it shall be perfect justice: if not, it shall at the least be unperfect and inchoated justice. Answ.</hi> If the question were concerning the approbation or justification of the act of faith, or the habit, I would acknowledge that the Lord doth accept the same, though unperfect in it selfe, as righteous. As the zealous act of <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 106. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has</hi> was counted unto him for righteousnesse throughout all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the Apostle speaketh of the justification of the person, who cannot by one habit, and much lesse by one act of faith be formally just. But forasmuch as by faith in Christ the beleever receiveth the perfect righteousnesse of Christ: this faith, in respect of the object doth fully justifie the beleever; and is therefore counted to him for righteousnesse, not that it selfe is his righteousnesse, nor that he is righteous in himselfe, (who still in himselfe remaineth a sinner) but in Christ. And such was the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of all the faithfull, that, not in themselves, but in the promised seed, all that beleeve in him should be blessed, that is, justified. The Greeke word used sometimes by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. 14. and retained by the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. is very signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to signifie, that not in themselves, but in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seed they should be justified and blessed, for so the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. useth these words promiscuously, as also <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture foreseeing, that God would justifie the heathen through faith, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before the Gospell unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> saying, in thee (that is in thy seed) shall all nations be blessed. This blessednesse therefore, this justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is obtained by faith: and therefore is faith counted righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because it receiveth it. As for faith it selfe, absolutely considered without relation to its object, we, according to the Popish doctrine, are justified by it neither in the act of justification, nor before. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for untill it be, as they speake, formed with Charity it cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie: nor in the act, for charity alone is the formall cause of justification, and then only are we formally justified when Charity is infused; or else there are more formall causes of justification than one: which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> according to the doctrine of the Councill of Trent, doth utterly deny.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. His second testimony, 1 <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 3. 11. another<note place="margin">His second proofe out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11.</note> foundation can no man lay, besides that which is laid, which is Christ Iesus. <hi>By foundation,</hi> saith hee, <hi>Augustine and other interpreters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand faith in</hi> CHRIST. But <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe (say I) in expresse termes saith, that this foundation is Christ himselfe; who most properly is called the foundation of his Church. If therefore saith bee but the beginning and a part of justification, because in <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> conceit it is called the foundation; then Christ himselfe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of our faith, and our perfect Saviour, who most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:22501:213"/>
is the foundation, <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Esai</hi> 28. 16. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20.</note> shall afford us but a beginning and a part of our justification. But be it that faith is called the foundation: yet I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, that it is called the foundation relatively, because Christ, whom it apprehendeth, is the foundation, than that Christ should bee called the foundation, because faith is. Sometimes faith is put for the object of it, and so is hope: and thus some understand, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23, 25. But that Christ should bee put for faith, I suppose is not usuall. But whereof is it the foundation? it is the foundation, the beginning, the root, the fountaine of Sanctification, and of all inherent righteousnesse: yet of justification it is not, but Christ onely, who alone is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all our happinesse. <hi>Augustine</hi> indeed by foundation understandeth <note n="k" place="margin">De fide &amp; operibus c. 16.</note> not onely Christ himselfe, but faith also working by love; which as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> said in the last argument, is not (as here he speaketh) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but the perfection of justice. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> whom hee quoteth speake not of faith but of Christ onely. Howbeit if faith must be held to be this foundation, I doubt not, but that according to the Scriptures, <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> we are to understand the doctrine of faith concerning Christ, which often times is called faith, which foundation the Apostle laid, when hee preached the Gospell, and whereupon other prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are to build. This argument therefore was farre fetched, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to conclude the point. The foundation is Christ, and not faith. Or if faith, then either the habit of faith working by love, which is not the beginning or foundation of justification, but of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: or the doctrine of faith, of which the question is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>

For we having received Christ by faith, hee dwelleth in our hearts by faith and by his Spirit, applying unto us not onely the merit of Christ his death and resurrection to our justification; but also the virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his death to mortifie sinne in us, and of his resurrection to raise us to newnesse of life.</p>
               <p>The testimonies of the Fathers serve all to prove, that saith is the foundation and beginning of a godly life, which because we doe freely confesse he might have forborne to prove.</p>
               <p>§. X. The third part of his assumption was, that faith doth obtaine<note place="margin">His third reason because faith doth obtaine, and after a sort merit iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> remission of sinnes, and after a sort merit justification, and therefore justifieth not by receiving and apprehending the promise. <hi>Answ.</hi> In the antecedent of this reason <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contradicteth the Councill of <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> Trent which hath decreed, <hi>nihil eorum quae justificationem precedunt, sive fides, sive opera ipsam justificationis gratiam promeretur.</hi> None of those things which goe before justification, whether faith, or workes, doe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the grace of justification. But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ought to have proved three things, which because he could not prove, he taketh for granted. The first is, that by other things, besides faith, we doe merit justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which notwithstanding God doth grant us <hi>gratis,</hi> that is freely, and without merit. For if faith did merit it, which nothing else in us can
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:22501:214"/>
doe, it would follow, that faith doth justifie alon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. The second, that faith doth not obtaine remission of sinnes by receiving and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the object which is Christ. But the Scriptures say plainely, <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10 43 <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39.</note> that by beleeving in Christ, that is by receiving of him, we receive remission of sinne. The third, that <hi>impetrare est quodammodò mereri,</hi> to impetrate, is after a sort to merit: for then, what by faithfull prayer we begge of God, we should be said to merit: and in like manner the beggar, should by begging merit his almes.

               <p>§. XI. The first, out of <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 50. where our Saviour telleth the<note place="margin">His first proofe <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 50.</note> Woman, to whom he had said, thy sinnes are forgiven thee, that her faith had saved her: <hi>for</hi> saith he, <hi>it could not wel be said, that her faith had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her from her sinnes,</hi> that is, <hi>justified her, if it conduced no more to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than onely to receive the pardon. For who would say to a poore man, who onely put forth his hand to receive the almes, thine hand hath releeved thee: or to a sicke man, who received a medicine with his hand, thy hand hath cured thee. Answ. Bellarmine</hi> before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. alleaged this place to prove, that the great love of this Woman towards Christ had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the remission of sinnes, which, if it had beene true, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that not her faith, but her love had saved her. Secondly, when our Saviour saith, thy faith, namely in me, hath saved thee; his meaning is, that himselfe being received by faith had saved her. As for the similitude of the hand: I say thus, that if releefe by almes, or cure by Phy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>elatively, the party is releeved, or cured. For such gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises hath God made to us, that if we shall but put foorth the hand of faith to receive Christ, wee shall bee justified and saved from our sinnes. And such is the accompt that he maketh of this instrument by which onely we receive Christ, that for our comfort he may say unto any true beleever, as hee did to the woman, thy faith hath saved thee. For as when the people of Israell <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. i4, 15.</note> were bitten by the fiery Serpents, the Lord having promised safely to all that should but li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Not that the hand absolutely doth releeve or cure, but relatively in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the almes, or of the medicine, which it doth receive. Nor that the eye of the body did cure those who were stung, but the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent which was a figure of Christ, beheld with the eye: Nor the eye of the soule, which is faith, doth absolutely and by it selfe justifie or save,

Answer.</hi> Though the woman of Canaan, and the blind man by prayer obtained their desires; yet it was the prayer of faith, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calleth it, which was effectuall and prevailed with Christ, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16. and therefore to faith, I confesse, the efficacie is to be ascribed. And although it may well be thought, that our Saviour, when hee used the same words, <hi>thy faith hath saved thee,</hi> to the woman which had the issue of bloud, and to the blind man, which hee used to the sinner, whose sins he had forgiven: that he, being the Physitian of the soule, used them in the same sence, to assure them of a greater blessing, than the bodily cure: <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2. yet I doe not deny, but that by faith and by the prayer of faith, the health both of the body and soule is obtained, for as by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or apprehending by faith the righteousnesse of Christ, which hee had and performed for us, wee are justified: so by beleeving the divine power and goodnesse of Christ many were cured of their bodily disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And yet as it was not their faith apprehending the power and goodnes of Christ, which did heale them, but the power and goodnesse of Christ which by faith they apprehended, as it is said <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16. his Name, by faith in his name, hath made this man strong: so is it not our faith absolutely, whereby wee apprehend the righteousnesse of Christ, which doth justifie us, but the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith. And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will have the like efficacie to be ascribed in justifying unto faith, as in obtaining bodily health, I take him at his word, for hereby it is evidently proved, that faith alone doth justifie, for our Saviour for the obtaining of bodily health required faith onely. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 50. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 36.

               <p>The proposition is to bee denyed, for before men can please God, they must bee reconciled unto him and justified by faith, therefore our pleasing of God is not a cause, but a fruit of our justification, and it is evident, that before that promise was either made to him by God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by him, <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, and therefore not by the merit of that beleefe.

And therefore whosoever doth hope <note n="u" place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 3.</note> to become like unto Christ in glory, he must endeavour, in some measure, to resemble him in grace. We exhort therefore our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that they doe not abase the doctrine of predestination, with those who were called <hi>predestinatiani,</hi> as to thinke, that either because they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they are elected, they shall be saved, howsoever they live: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thinke, that they are not elected, they cannot be saved, though they should live never so godly: as if godlinesse, if they be elect, were needlesse, or if not, bootlesse. But forbearing to prye into Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counsels, (which are to be adored and not searched into) to have recourse to Gods word. For the <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the revealed things to us, that wee may doe them. For there we shall finde these two things: first, that where God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the end, hee hath also ordained the meanes. And therefore as it is necessary, that the end should be accomplished, because decreed by God: so it is as necessary in respect of the same decree, that the end should be atchieved by the same meanes which God hath preordained. Now, whom God hath elected, them he calleth <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note>, whom he calleth (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpose) them he justifieth by faith, whom hee justifieth by faith, them he sanctifieth by his Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom hee calleth, justifieth, and sanctifieth, them, and no other, he glorifieth.

                  </gap>ry in respect of the same decree, that they should attaine to salvation by these degrees: that is, first they must be called and converted unto God, they must bee justified by a true faith, they must in some measure be sanctified by the holy Spirit. The second thing is, that in the word the Lord revealeth his purpose concerning those that live well or ill. Thou thinkest, because thou hast a conceit that thou art elected, thou canst not be damned, though thou live never so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly. But be not deceived, for God hath revealed his purpose concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning impenitent sinners, who live and dye in sinne unrepented of <note n="y" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 5, 6.</note>, that there is no inheritance for them in the kingdome of God. As for example, thou art a drunkard and wilt not be reclaimed from this sinne, and yet presumest that thou shalt be saved, because thou hast a conceit, that thou art elected. But be not deceived; no drunkards shall inherit the kingdome of God. On the other side, thou hast a conceit, that because thou art not elected, thou canst not be saved, though thou
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:22501:219"/>
shouldest live never so godly. But the Scripture is plaine, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever truely beleeveth in Christ, whosoever unfainedly repenteth him of his sinnes, whosoever walketh uprightly before God making Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his wayes, hee shall bee saved.

For redemption is as well from the dominion of sinne, as from the guilt of it. As for those, who commit sinne,<note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 34.</note> that is, in whom sinne raigneth, they are the servants of sinne, and therefore not actually redeemed by Christ; for whom the Sonne freeth,<note n="m" place="margin">vers. 36.</note> they are free indeed.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tion and sanctification. In the question of justification we hold, according to the Scriptures, that if our owne workes or righteousnesse should bee obtruded unto the Lord as the matter or merit thereof, whereby wee should bee both acquitted from our sinnes and so delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from hell and also entituled to the Kingdome of heaven, they are not onely to bee rejected, but also detested as<note n="t" place="margin">Esa. 64. 6.</note> menstruous clouts, as dung,<note n="u" place="margin">Phil 3, 8, 9.</note> as losse. But in the question of sanctification, where they are considered, both as fruits of faith and the Spirit, as consequents of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereby wee testifie our thankefulnesse to God, gather testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to our selves of our justification, benefit and edifie our brethren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and also as necessary forerunners of glorification, whereby we are fitted and prepared for Gods Kingdome (unto which by justification wee are entituled) and as the way wherein we are to walke towards our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countrey, and as the evidences according to which our Saviour will judge us at the last day, &amp;c. wee doe acknowledge they are highly to be esteemed of, as those things wherein our sanctification doth in good part consist. For wee doe teach, that our sanctification is partly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, consisting in the habits of sanctifying graces, faith, hope, charity, humility, the feare of God, &amp;c. which is the first justification of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists: and partly actuall consisting in our new obedience, or, which is all one, in good workes; which is their second justification. This then is that which we doe hold, that although good works doe not concurre with faith unto the act of justification, as any cause thereof: yet of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity they must concurre in the subject, that is, the party justified, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary fruits of faith, as necessary consequents of justification, as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry antecedents of salvation. And this is that, which not only we, but <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> himselfe often citeth out of <hi>Augustine: Bona opera accedunt justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato, non praecedunt justificandum:</hi> or thus, <hi>bona opera non praecedunt justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum sed sequantur justificatum,</hi> good workes doe not goe before, but follow after justification, which is a pregnant proofe, that they are no causes thereof.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving thus avoided the calumniations of the<note place="margin">In what sense we deny works to justifie.</note> Papists, wee are now to dispute the question: which is to bee understood, not of justification before men, whereby we are declared or knowne to bee just: but of our justification before God, whereby hee maketh us just: nor of workes, as fruits and consequents, but as of causes of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For we doe confesse, that men are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>declarativè,</hi> that is declared and knowne to be just to themselves or others by good works, as the proper fruits of faith, and undoubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of justification: but wee deny that we are justified before God by good works, as any causes therof.

               </p>
               <p>§. II. And first I prove it by all the arguments which I used before, to prove the five severall points already handled. For first, if justification
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:22501:221"/>
is not to be confounded with sanctification, as if it consisted in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse inherent in our selves, or performed by our selves; then are we not justified before God by workes, But the former hath beene clearely proved; therefore the latter is to be confessed.</p>
               <p n="2">.2 If wee bee justified by the meere grace of God, and that freely, without respect of any workes done by us; then are we not justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by works. For the holy Ghost maketh such an opposition<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene grace and workes, that if we be justified by the one, we cannot be justified by the other. But the antecedent hath beene formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore the consequent cannot be denyed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we be not justified before God by righteousnesse inherent in, or performed by our selves, but onely by the righteousnesse of Christ through f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ith, then are we not justified by workes. But the first I have demonstrated by many undeniable arguments: therefore the second must be granted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we be justified by imputative righteousnesse, that is to say by the righteousnesse of Christ imputed to them that beleeve, the Lord imputing righteousnesse unto them<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> without workes; then it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that wee are not justified by workes, but that is most true, as hath plentifully beene proved; therefore this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we be justified by faith alone, then not by workes. But we are justified by faith alone, as hath beene proved; therefore not by workes. The arguments reduced to these five heads, which were very many, and impregnable, might satisfie any reasonable man, who is not wilfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to his owne erroneous conceits, though I should adde no more: but because wee have to deale with men unreasonable I will adde some.</p>
               <p>§. III. And first out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. He that worketh not, is not<note place="margin">Foure other reasons.</note> justified by workes: he that beleeveth, worketh not, as the Apostle there sheweth. And againe, to whom faith is impured unto righteousnesse without workes, they are not justified by workes: to all the faithfull faith is imputed unto righteousnesse without workes, therefore none of the faithfull are justified by workes. The assumption is thus proved: If to <hi>Abraham</hi> his faith was imputed for righteousnesse without works, then are all the faithfull justified without workes: for <hi>Abraham</hi> is by the Apostle propounded as a patterne: therefore as he was justified so are we, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22, 23. 24.</p>
               <p>But to <hi>Abraham</hi> his faith was imputed for righteousnesse, as the Apo stle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. Therefore all the faithfull are justified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The true doctrine of justification is taught in the Scriptures: justification by workes is not taught in the Scriptures: for the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation taught in the Scriptures, is an action of God justifying a sinner, but this by workes, is neither an action of God, neither is it the justification of a sinner, but the action of the justitiary himselfe, who by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and practise of good workes increaseth his inherent justice, or fanctification: which hath no affinity with that justification, which is taught in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:22501:221"/>3. None that are justified by faith are justified by workes; all the faithfull are justified by faith, therefore none of the faithfull are justified by workes. The proposition is evidently proved by that opposition which the Apostle constantly maketh betweene faith and workes in the question of justification: asfirming that men though abounding with works of grace, are justified by faith without workes, and saved by faith and not by workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If any be justified by workes, then either the regenerate man or the unregenerate: but neither the unregenerate, as the Papists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: nor the regenerate, for they are justified already. Neither doe the Scriptures acknowledge any sorts or degrees of justification before God.</p>
               <p>§. IV. 5. All that are justified by workes, are justified by that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<note place="margin">Our sifth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which they performe to the Law: But none are justified by the obedience which they performe to the Law: therefore none are justified by workes.</p>
               <p>The proposition is manifest. Because the Law being a perfect rule of all inherent righteousnes, there neither are nor can be any good works, which are not prescribed in the Law. Yea, whatsoever worke is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Law is sinne.</p>
               <p>The assump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ion may bee proved by many undeniable arguments. First, by all those places, which plainely testifie, that by the workes of the Law, that is, by obedience done to the Law, no man living shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. For by the workes of the Law wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all duties prescibed, and all that obedience which is required in the Law.</p>
               <p>2. Those that are accursed by the Law are not justified by their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of it. For to bee justified, is to bee blessed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be justified, and to be accursed, are things repugnant.</p>
               <p>But all men whatsoever, even those which seeke to bee justified by their obedience to the Law, are by the Law accursed. Therefore no man is justified by his obedience performed to the Law. And this is the Apostles argument, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. as I have shewed before<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 4.</note>. All transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Law, are by the Law accursed.</p>
               <p>All men since the fall are transgressours of the Law, Christ onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> excepted; this assumption the Apostle omitteth, because hee taketh it for granted, as being a truth received among the faithfull in those times, though in these dayes denied by the justitiaries of Rome, but elsewhere it is by the Apostle expressed, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. all have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Wherefore as God hath concluded all under sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. so the Law hath concluded them under the curse.</p>
               <p>3. All that are justified by their obedience to the Law doe perfectly fulfill it, by a totall, perfect, and perpetuall obedience: for he that doth not so fulfill it, by doing the things commanded, though he did nothing that is forbidden; by doing all, though he did the most; by continuing in doing all, and in that measure and degree, which the Law requireth, though he sinned but once in all his life, and that either by omission, or
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:22501:222"/>
comming short of his duety, is a transgressour of the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subject to the curse of the Law, because hee hath not continued in all things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them. And he that offendeth in one is guilty of all, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>To whom the perfect fulfilling of the Law is impossible by reason of the flesh, they cannot be justified by their obedience performed to it.</p>
               <p>To all, even the most regenerate, the perfect fulfilling of the Law is impossible by reason of the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. as elsewhere I prove at large. Therefore none though regenerate can bee justified by their obedience performed to the Law.</p>
               <p>§. V. Sixthly, That Doctrine which is repugnant to the Scriptures is false.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of justification by workes, is repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is false.</p>
               <p>The assumption is thus proved, because the Scriptures in all places where they treat of justification before God, doe from the act of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication exclude workes. The places of Scripture which we produce to this end, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reciteth (at least some of them) with purpose<note n="d" place="margin">De justif. li. cap. 19</note> to answere them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>§. VI. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> before he maketh answere to these testimonies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> preamble to his answere, in which he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth three things: first, what is meant by the Law of workes and by the Law of faith.</note> noteth three things. First, what the Apostle meaneth, by the Law of workes, and by the Law of Faith. Secondly, what difference there is betwixt the justice of the Law: and the justice in the Law. Thirdly, what the Apostle meaneth by workes, when he saith a man is justified without workes. For the first: he cavilleth with <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and others, as though they understood simply by the Law of workes, that which requireth workes, and by the Law of faith, which requireth faith: as if the Law of faith did not also require workes, and the Law of workes did not also require faith: whereas our writers distinguish the two covenants of God, that is, the Law and the Gospell, whereof one is the covenant of workes, the other, the covenant of grace: doe teach, that the Law of workes is that, which to justification requireth works, as the condition thereof: the Law of faith that, which to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requireth faith, as the condition therof. The former saith, doe this, and thou shalt live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17. the latter, beleeve in Christ, and thou shalt be saved, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. But the Papists, whiles they teach that in the Gospell perfect righteousnesse is required in us to justification and salvation as the condition thereof, as much or rather more than in the Law: they doe either confound the Law and the Gospell, making either of them to be the Law of workes;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 8, 9.</note> or else as the Apostle speaketh of the false teachers of the Galathians, they teach another Gospell than that which Christ and his Apostles taught: which whosoever doth, though he were an Angell from heaven, he ought to be held accursed. But you will say, is not obedience to the Law required in the Gospell? I answere, it is not required unto justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and salvation as the condition: but the ability of performing obedience is the grace of the New Testament, which is promised<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</note> to those that beleeve. And therefore our new obedience is required, as the fruit of our redemption, and as the way wherein wee being justified are to walke towards our glorification, and as the cognizance of them that shall be saved.</p>
               <p>§. VII. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> having rejected our exposition, setteth downe<note place="margin">

That the Law of workes is the letter or the doctrine, whether of the Law or of the Gospell prescribing what is to be done, but affording no helpe to performe the same. And that the Law of faith is the Spirit, or the grace of the New testament promised to those that beleeve, whereby they are enabled to performe that which is commanded. Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betweene the letter and the Spirit, as it is propounded by Saint<note n="f" place="margin">De spir. &amp; lit.</note>

So that <hi>lex fidei</hi> (the Law of faith) according to this exposition, is as well opposed to the Gospell, as it signifieth the doctrine thereof, as to the Law. But the difference betweene the Law of workes, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and the Law of faith which is the Gospell, in the question of justification, whereof the Apostle treateth, is to bee fetched from that righteousnesse, which either of them requireth to justification. For both of them require righteousnesse therunto. The Law requireth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of workes: the Gospell, in which without the Law is revealed the righteousnesse of God (by which we are justified) teacheth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of faith, <gap reason="foreign">

And this explication fitly agreeth to the scope of the Apostle, teaching that by the doctrine, not of the Law but of the Gospell, all boasting is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As if the Apostle had thus argued: The true doctrine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excludeth all boasting. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. but the Law of workes, that is, that doctrine which teacheth justification by workes doth not exclude all boasting.

And therefore that righteousnesse which men have in or by the Law, doth not fulfill the righteousnes of the Law, which the Apostle calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. These two distinctions <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath devised to shift off onely two of the places cited, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 3. 27. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. both which, distinctions being rightly understood, make against himselfe, as I have shewed.</p>
               <p>§. IX. Now he commeth to the third thing, <hi>viz.</hi> what is meant by<note place="margin">Thirdly, what is meant by workes.</note> workes. For saith he, <hi>our adversaries by workes, which the Apostle exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>

                  <hi>from justification, understand all works, whether done before or after faith; yea; faith it selfe considered as a work, which opinion to be most absurd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ignorance of the Scriptures, Augustine,</hi> saith hee, <hi>teacheth.</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">De gratia &amp; lib. arb. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Men not understanding what the Apostle saith, we make account that a man is justified by faith without the workes of the Law, have thought, that hee had said, that faith is sufficient to a man, though he live wickedly, and have no good workes, which, be it farre from that Vessell of Election to thinke.</hi> And farre bee it also from us so to thinke. But although faith alone doth not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto the perfection of a Christian who is to bee saved, yet it alone sufficeth unto justification: wherein wee have had the consent of many of the Fathers. And although to the act of justifying nothing in us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth with faith, but it alone sufficeth: yet in the party justified, there must concur with faith, both inward graces and also outward works. But here the Papists are divided among themselves. Some of them thinke that by the workes of the Law, are excluded, not the workes of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall but of the ceremoniall Law: others, that the workes of the morall Law are also excluded; not all, but such as goe before faith, such as are done by the strength of nature without grace and without faith. I answere first to both joyntly, that not onely the workes of the Law are expressely excluded, but all workes whatsoever indefinitely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 9. and more specially, the workes which wee have done in righteousnesse, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. the workes which God hath prepared for the regenerate, that they should walke in them. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 9, 10. Againe, in him that is said not to worke, workes are not to bee distinguished, but all are understood to be excluded: but hee that is justified by fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. X. To the former severally, I answere, first, that when the holy<note place="margin">Some of the Papists under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law onely.</note> Ghost nameth the Law indefinitely, he meaneth either the whole Law which is called<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 11. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Mishmereth</hi> the observation of the Lord or his charge, containing three branches, the morall; the ceremoniall and the judicial Law, or the chiefe part, which is the morall Law. And that the Apostle meaneth it especially, because he speaketh of that Law, by which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the knowledge of sinne, and which was common both to Iewes and Gentiles, unto which the whole world was subject. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19, 20. whatsoever the Law saith, it saith to them who are under the Law, that every mouth may bee stopped, and all the world may become <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> obnoxious to the judgement of God. Therefore by the deedes of the Law there shall no flesh, that is, neither Iew nor Gentile be justified in his sight: for by the Law commeth the knowledge of sinne.<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is evident, that the Apostle in that place speaketh of that Law, which forbiddeth morall offences mentioned<note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> from the tenth verse to the ninteenth, and by which all both Iewes and Gentiles are convicted to be under sin, <hi>ver. 9. &amp;</hi> 19. Secondly, it is unreasonable to be thought, that any man, who was a transgressour of the morall Law, should looke to bee justified by the observation of the ceremoniall Law which was
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:22501:224"/>
but a by-law, being but an appendice of the first table of the morall Law, as the judiciall was an appendice of the second table. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Apostle professeth, that whosoever would be circumcised, was bound to the performance of the whole Law. Therefore the observer of the ceremoniall law, could not be justified, without the observation of the morall law. Thirdly, this answer which is given by some of the Pontificians, is rejected by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justis. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</note> and the greater part of learned Papists, who with us following the interpretation of <hi>Augustine</hi> and other of the ancient Fathers, doe confesse that by the workes of the law, which the Apostle excludeth from justification, are meant the<note place="margin">

               <p>§. XI. But then say I, all good workes whatsoever are excluded. For in the Law, which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse, all good workes are prescribed: and therefore those which proceed from faith. For if charity, which is the fulfilling of the law, proceedeth from faith unfained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <note n="p" place="margin">

                  <item>2. The question concerning justification by workes, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be understood of good workes: for of those which are not good, no question ought to be made. But workes done before or without faith are not good. For whatsoever is not of faith is sinne: and without faith it is impossible to please God. Neither can the fruit be good, whiles the Tree is bad. Neither can it be imagined that a man should bee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the workes of the law going before faith, unlesse it bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed, that a man without faith and before grace, is able to fulfill the law.

For as in the first act of justification wee are justified by faith without respect of workes; so our justification is continued unto us without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our workes.

For that which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is also verified of all the godly: for, saith hee, that a man having not workes should bee justified by faith, it is no unlikely thing: <note n="u" place="margin">

                  <item>5. When the Apostle excludeth workes from justification, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee understood to exclude them from the first justification only of the Papists, for that as themselves teach is meerely habituall, consisting in the habits of grace. Now it is a senselesse thing to imagine, that the Apostle would so seriously labour to prove, that habituall Iustice is not actuall, or that good works are no part of habituall righteousnesse, nor doe concurre to habituall justification.</item>

               <p>§. XII. Notwithstanding <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will prove <hi>that good workes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going before faith are excluded,</hi> first, out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.

                     </gap>w,</hi> saith hee, <hi>such onely are those which are wrought by the strength of free-will: for to works done by grace, that which is given is not simply</hi> merces, <hi>wages, but grace also, yea grace rather than wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, the meaning of the Apostle is this, to him that fulfilleth the Law whether it bee by strength of nature, or by helpe of grace, if any such were, to him the reward of justification and salvation would bee due by Gods covenant, Doe this, and live. But to him that fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the Law (which was the case of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and still is the case of the best) but beleeveth in him that justifieth the ungodly (such as he doth judge himselfe to be in himself) he is justified <hi>gratis,</hi> or of grace, his faith being imputed unto him for righteousnesse without workes: this place therefore proveth justification by faith without workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this assertion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is confuted both by other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and by himselfe also in other places. For first there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards due to him that fulfilleth the condition of the covenant, that is, to him that fufilleth the whole Law, for he that doth not fulfill the Law doth transgresse it, and to him that transgresseth, not reward but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is due. But to hold that a man before or without grace is able to fulfill the Law, is meere Pelagianismes.

               <p>§. XIII. Secondly, <hi>from the scope of the Epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians, which was to perswade men, that without the faith of Christ neither the Iewes by the Law, nor the Gentiles by their Philosophie could bee justified or saved.</hi> Which is untrue. For the Apostle writeth not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving either Iewes or Gentiles, but to Christians, who were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perswaded of that truth. Neither was there ever any beleeving Iew, who held, that they might be justified by the works of the Law without faith, neither any beleeving Gentiles, who thought that by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall works they might be saved without faith. That question therefore the Apostle doth nowhere dispute. But whereas many of the beleeving Iewes being zealous of the Law, and many of the beleeving Gentiles being misse-led by the Iewes were perswaded, that they were to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not onely by faith in Christ, but also by the observation of the Law that is to say by a righteousnesse inherent in themselves, and to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by themselves: The Apostle therefore sheweth, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, whereby we are justified, is the righteousnesse of God,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. 3. 21.</note> and that neither Iewes nor Gentiles are justified by inherent righteousnesse wich is prescribed in the Law, to which end he proveth at large in the three first chapters of the Epistle to the Romanes, that both Iewes and Gentiles were sinners, and therefore were not to be justified by inherent righteousnesse, which is the observation of the Law, but were to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified freely by the grace of God through the redemption which is in Christ, by or through faith that is to say, by the righteousnesse of Christ both active and passive apprehended by faith. This righteousnesse of Christ is that righteousnesse of God by which we are justified which is revealed in the<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 3. 21.</note> Gospell as being the principall argument thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. for so the Apostle saith,<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> that we are justified through the redemption that is in Christ: that wee are justified by his bloud, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. reconciled to God by his death, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and constituted or made just by his obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. Of the scope of the Epistle to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians I am shortly to speake. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his whole disputation impudently perverteth the Apostles scope, as if the question, which he disputeth, were not this: Whether faith doe justifie without workes, which every where he affirmatively concludeth; but whether workes doe justifie without faith, which the Apostle never mentioned nor meant; though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes him to conclude it negatively, <hi>viz.</hi> that workes without faith doe not justifie. And to this scope hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the whole discourse of the Apostle to aime. By this Sophisticall tricke <hi>Bellarmine</hi> seeketh to avoid the force of the Apostles arguments, as if he concluded not against them, we conclude that a man is justified
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:22501:225"/>
by faith without workes; but thus, wee conclude that a man is not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by workes without faith, neither the Iewes by the workes of the Law, nor the Gentiles by their morall workes without faith as if with faith they did justifie. And this he maketh to be the Apostles meaning, that workes done before or without faith doe not justifie; but procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from faith, they doe justifie: and so is not ashamed to make the Apostle to contradict himselfe. But the Apostle doth constantly teach, that a man is justified by faith without the workes of the Law; by faith, and not by workes, and maketh such an opposition betweene faith and works in the question of justification, that if we bee justified by the one, we are not justified by the other<note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.</note> for if by faith, then of grace; and if of grace, then not by workes; or if by workes, then not of grace. It is therefore a most shamelesse and Antichristian perverting of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles doctrine, to make him teach that works proceeding from faith doe justifie, and that we are justified both by faith and by workes: when hee plainely teacheth the contrary.</p>

                  </note> example of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. For if <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent precedent of faith and obedience, and is propounded as a patterne
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:22501:226"/>
for the matter and forme of justification, was not justified by his works, which proceeded from his faith; but notwithstanding that he aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with workes of grace, hee was justified by faith without workes: then all the faithfull in like manner, though abounding with workes of grace proceeding from faith, are not justified by their workes of grace, but are justified by faith without workes: but the antecedent is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the testimony of the Apostle, therefore the consequent is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>was justified by faith, not by workes going before faith, because they could not bee truely just, unlesse it were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of externall righteousnesse: and therefore if he had beene justified by them</hi> (which he could not have beene, unlesse they were truly just) <hi>hee should have had glory, but with men, not with God.</hi> But when we reply, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> at that time, whereof the Apostle speaketh, that he was justified by faith and not by workes, and that righteousnesse was imputed unto him without workes, was a man regenerate excelling in the grace of faith and abounding in good workes which he wrought by faith: And therefore when hee denieth him to bee justified by workes, he plainely teacheth, that the faithfull are not justified by workes proceeding from faith, but although they abound with workes of grace proceeding from their faith, yet they are justified by faith without workes.</p>
               <p>To this unanswerable argument taken from the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Bellarmine</hi> frameth two answeres, but such as men use to make when they are brought to a meere <hi>non-plus.</hi> First, he saith, <hi>that</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>indeed at that time, whereof the Apostle speaketh, was regenerate, and through faith wrought many good workes: Notwithstanding the Apostle, when hee saith that hee was justified by faith and not by workes, doth not reject his workes wrought by faith; but affirmeth, that they were not wrought without faith, because if they had beene such, they would not have justified him. Therefore he excludeth the workes which Abraham might have wrought not by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. III. Where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> first taketh that for granted, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">

                     </gap>ed.</note> professedly disputeth against, and concludeth the contrary: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by workes. As if the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, when he argueth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by faith without works, had beene this; that he was justified by workes, but yet such, as were not without faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he inverteth the question, and perverteth the disputation of the Apostle for the mainetenance of his owne errour. As if the question were not, whether faith doe justifie without workes, which the Apostle affirmatively concludeth: but whether works doe justifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith: which question the Apostle doth not once mention, which I desire the readers to take notice of. For if the question which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle disputeth, be not this, whether works doe justifie without faith; but this, whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> faith doth justifie without workes, then are the Papists evidently confuted by the disputation of the Apostle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He supposeth that faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> endued with abundant grace,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:22501:226"/>
might doe good workes without faith, and without grace: and that the Apostle excludeth such workes, not which <hi>Abraham</hi> did, but such as the might have done, but did not. For it is certaine that the faithfull, as when they sinne through infirmity, doing that evill, which they would not doe, may say with the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. Not I, but sinne that dwelleth in me: so when they performe any good worke they may say with the same Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. Not I, but the grace of God which is with me.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is against sense to make the Apostle dispute that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by such works as he might have done, but did not: but more senselesse when he maketh the Apostle to dispute that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by his sinnes. For how doth he prove that they who have faith may worke sometimes without faith? by two instances, as namely, first, <hi>when they sinne.</hi> As if the Apostle had said, though <hi>Abraham</hi> were a faithfull man, yet some workes he might doe not of faith, as namely when he sinned (for sinnes are not of faith) and by such workes hee was not justified. And the like is his second instance, <hi>when they doe workes purely morall without relation to God, for such, if they be not of faith, are sins.</hi> But these morall duties in the faithfull, because they are not workes of the flesh, must needs bee the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. 21. and although perhaps performed to men, yet are done in obedience to God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither doth the Apostle distinguish betwixt <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes, as if hee were justified by some, and not by others; but in generall deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to have beene justified by any workes at all. And that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth because his faith was imputed for righteousnesse. As if hee had said: to whom faith is imputed for righteousnesse, he is not justified by workes: to <hi>Abraham</hi> faith was imputed for righteousnesse, therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by workes. The proposition is thus proved: to him that worketh, that is, to him that fulfilleth the Law, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not imputed or reckoned of Grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, that is, that doth not fulfill the Law, but beleeveth on him that justifieth a sinner (as all are and as hee acknowledgeth himselfe to be) who therefore can merit nothing but punishment, his faith is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or imputed for righteousnesse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By this example of <hi>Abraham, Bellarmine</hi> is notably confounded in two other respects.</p>
               <p>§. IV. For first, whereas justification before God is but one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confounded in two respects. The first.</note> the Lord by imputation of Christs righteousnesse to a beleeving sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, doth absolve him from his sinnes, and also accepteth of him as righteous in Christ, not onely in the first moment of justification, wherein being a sinner in himselfe he was first constituted righteous in Christ: but also in the continuance of justification; wherein the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, being still a sinner in himselfe, is continued in the favour of God by the merits and intercession of Christ: and though a sinner in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, yet beleeving in him, that justifieth a sinner, is made the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God in Christ. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> notwithstanding maketh two justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:22501:227"/>
the first, wherein a sinner is made righteous by infusion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall righteousnes: the second, when a just man maketh himselfe more just by the practise of actuall righteousnesse, that is to say, of good works (which two are degrees of sanctification, and not of justification) and saith, <hi>that the Apostle in the Epistle to the Romans speaketh only of the former, wherein workes going before faith are excluded from the act of justification.</hi> So that in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit, when the Apostle saith, that a man is justified by faith without workes, his meaning is, without workes going before justification. But what the Apostle speaketh of other men, hee affirmeth of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> at what time he was a man regenerate, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> consesseth, and abounded with good workes, which as the same Apostle testifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he wrought by faith. And yet of him the Apostle saith, that he was justified by faith and not by works; that the Lord imputed unto him righteousnesse without workes; that his<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> justification or blessednesse consisted in the remission of his sinnes, and imputation of righteousnesse: and being a sinner in himselfe, as all mortall men are, hee was in Christ the promised seed made blessed through faith. By the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore we learne first, that that distinction of justification is forged. For <hi>Abraham,</hi> as when hee first beleeved was justified by faith without workes: so afterwards, when hee abounded with good workes hee was justified by faith and not by workes. And undoubtedly if ever any man attained to the second justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which the Papists ascribe to workes, <hi>Abraham</hi> had it then, when the Apostle affirmeth that he was justified without workes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that workes are excluded from justification, not onely those which goe before faith, but also those that follow, and are wrought by it.</p>
               <p>§. V. The second respect: when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> endeavoureth to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile<note place="margin">The second respect.</note> the seeming difference, betweene the Apostle <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. and Saint <hi>Iames Chap.</hi> 2. hee saith, <hi>that Paul speaking of the first justification,</hi> saith, <hi>that a man is justified by faith without workes, namely going before justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but</hi> Saint Iames <hi>speaking of the second justification,</hi> saith, <hi>that a man is justified by workes and not by faith onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But both the Apostle use the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> for the proofe of their assertion: <hi>Paul</hi> proving that a man is justified before God by faith without workes, demonstrateth his assertion by the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> who, though hee were most fruitfull of good workes, yet he was justified by faith without workes. And as <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, so are all the faithfull. Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> concluding that a man is justified, that is declared and knowne to be just by workes, and not by profession of faith onely; proveth also his assertion by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated his faith by his workes. By which though he were declared and knowne to be a just man, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith; yet by them he was not justified before God, but by faith only, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth. This example therefore of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth prove, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth not speake of the first justification which is habituall, nor of workes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going before justification, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was a man long before rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:22501:227"/>
and justified, and his workes were such as hee wrought by faith. But that this is a false and counterfeit distinction of justification it may further be proved. For if this be true, that the Apostle excluding workes from justification, speaketh of the first justification, which they say is meerely habituall, then the Apostle must bee thought to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> have taken all these paines to prove, that to habituall righteousnesse good workes doe not concurre, or that habituall righteousnesse is not actuall, which nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no proofe. And againe if onely workes going before grace be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culded from justification, then the Apostle must be thought to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured seriously to prove, that we are not justified by such workes, as are not good: which needeth no proofe, for how should a man be justified by that which is not just? This example therefore of <hi>Abraham</hi> is as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, abundant matter of much victory, wherein we may truely and seriously triumph.</p>
               <p>§. VI. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> second answere is, <hi>that the Apostle speaketh with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond answere refuted.</note> 
                  <hi>if</hi> Abraham <hi>was justified by workes not proceeding from the grace of faith, as they thought who to their owne strength attributed righteousnesse: then surely he had glory, but not with God. And because it is evident enough, that</hi> Abraham <hi>had glory even with God: thence hee gathereth, that hee was not justified by workes without faith, but by faith from which good workes truly proceed:</hi> hee should have said, by workes which proceed from faith, if he meant to contradict us: for we doe confesse, that he was justified by faith from which good workes did proceed; but withall we say, that he was justified by his faith and not by his workes.</p>
               <p>But in this senselesse answere of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> there are many absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for first by incredible impudencie hee taketh for granted, that which the Apostle disputeth against, namely that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by workes, <hi>viz.</hi> such workes as proceeded from faith: secondly, hee perverteth the question, as if the Apostle disputed, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by workes without faith, or not proceeding from the grace of faith, as they forsooth thought, who to their owne strength attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteousnesse. As though either <hi>Abraham</hi> had any good workes which did not proceed from grace, or the Apostle would busie himselfe to prove that he was not justified by such as he had not, or as if the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries among the Iewes did attribute righteousnesse to their owne strength, when the Pharisee himselfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11. gave thankes to God for it, or as if they thought that <hi>Abrahams</hi> righteousnesse proceeded from his naturall strength; when they knew, that God did chuse <note n="a" place="margin">Nehem. 9. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and by his preventing grace called him out of Ur of the Caldeans, where <note n="b" place="margin">Ios. 24. 2.</note> they served other gods. Thirdly, hee doth againe contradict the Apostle, in saying that <hi>Abraham</hi> had glory with God, which the Apostle plainely denieth: the word in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth not glory, but glorying or boasting. If <hi>Abraham,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, was justified by works, then had he wherof to glory or to boast: but he had no cause to glory or to boast before God. Fourthly, his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting of the Apostle maketh against himselfe. For if <hi>Abraham</hi> had beene justified by workes done without grace, hee had more cause to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:22501:228"/>
glory and that before God, than if his workes proceeded from grace. For in that case it might have beene said to him: what hast thou, which thou hast not received? And if <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note> thou hast received it, why dost thou glory or boast, as if thou hadst not received it? wheras therfore the Apostle denyeth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had whereof to glory before God, he is to be understood, as speaking of his workes proceeding from grace; by which if <hi>Abraham</hi> had beene justified, he had whereof to glory, but not before God. But being justified by faith without workes, all matter of glorying was taken away. By what Law? of workes? No, but by the Law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. For by grace we are justified and saved, not by workes, lest any man should boast, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. And that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction maketh against himselfe, appeareth further by that which himselfe saith <note n="d" place="margin">§. <hi>excludi.</hi>
                  </note> in the same Chapter out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. But unto him that worketh the reward is not imputed according to grace, but according to debt. Whence he proveth, that by workes which the Apostle exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from justification, he <hi>meaneth such workes, whereto not grace is given but wages rendred.</hi> And <hi>such are onely those,</hi> saith hee, <hi>which are wrought by the onely strength of free-will. For to the workes which are wrought by grace, that which is rendred is not simply</hi> merces <hi>wages, but it is also grace, yea grace rather than wages.</hi> If therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> had beene justified by workes done by the power of his owne free-will, and not by grace, hee might have gloried, that he had made God a debtour unto him. But to <hi>Abraham</hi> his faith was imputed unto righteousnesse, and therefore his reward was of grace and not of debt. For to him that worketh, that is, fulfilleth the Law of God, the wages is not reckoned of grace, but of debt, as being due <hi>ratione pacti</hi> in respect of the covenant, Doe this and thou shalt live. But to him that worketh not, that is, that fulfilleth not the Law, (which the Apostle maketh to have beene <hi>Abrahams</hi> case) but beleeveth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>

And this also confuteth the doctrine of the Papists concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Merit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> the merit of good workes proceeding from grace: unto which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here saith the reward is not rendred as of debt, but onely to such as are wrought by strength of nature. But he and his fellowes, when they treat of merit, ascribe to works of grace merit of condignity. In respect whereof the reward of eternall life is due unto them in justice, not onely in respect of Gods promise or covenant, but even in respect of the workes themselves. For every good worke proceeding from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity absolutely deserveth, as they teach, eternall life: insomuch that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is no lesse due to the good workes of the faithfull, than hell to the sinnes of the wicked.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. As to the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> so to these three places, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. wherein all workes of all men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally excluded from the act of justification, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth <hi>that in them all those workes onely are excluded, which are done before faith.</hi> But we will speake of them severally.</p>
               <p>And first to that <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>that in that Epistle there</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:22501:228"/>
                  <hi>are two questions handled: the former speciall, whether the ceremonies of the Law doe belong to Christians, so that without them they cannot be saved. The other generall, whether by the Law and strength of Nature justification can happen to any man without grace and without the faith of Iesus Christ. Vnto both which the Apostle answereth negatively.</hi> And afterwards he saith, that the <hi>state of the Question in that Epistle is, whether workes doe justifie without faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I reply, that no such question is mentioned in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, nor the contrary concluded; as being altogether heterogeneous, and besides the purpose of the Apostle, which was to reclaime the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians from their errour: who thought that besides faith the workes of the Law must concurre to justification. For both the false teachers, <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 15. 5.</note> who seduced them were Christians, who, lest they should suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for the Crosse of Christ, perswaded them to bee circumcised, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. and the Galathians themselves, who were seduced, did not cease to bee Christians, neither were they perswaded to renounce the faith of Christ, but were made to beleeve, that unto their faith in Christ they were necessarily to joyne the workes of the Law, that by them both they might be justified. Against this assertion the Apostle disputeth directly, proving that a man is justified by faith, and not by the workes of the Law. But if he had disputed against the other, that workes without faith in Christ doe justifie, or that workes done by the knowledge of the Law only by the strength of nature doe justifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith in Christ; his disputation had beene to no purpose. For the Galathians and their Teachers would in their owne defence have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that they did not from justification exclude faith in Christ, (God forbid!) but did adde unto faith the observation of the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring (as the Papists now doe) to bee justified not by faith alone, but both by faith and workes together. And therefore as in the Epistle to the Romanes, so here, the question is not, whether wee bee justified by workes without faith in Christ (which asser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ion never any Christian held) but whether by faith without workes, which the Galathians and their teachers would have with faith to concurre unto the act of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. To which purpose call to minde the words in the very place alleadged. Wee saith the Apostle, speaking of himselfe and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> knowing that a man is not justified by the workes of the Law, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>l. ib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 8. §. 7. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> by the faith of Iesus Christ, even we have beleeved in Iesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the workes of the Law. For by the workes of the Law shall no flesh be justified. For if the faithfull, such as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> bee justified by faith, and not by workes: then are they justified without workes: Neither doe the workes of the faithfull concurre unto their justification.</p>
               <p>§. IX. But for all this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will prove, that in the Epistle to<note place="margin">

For the Apostle when in the question of justification hee excludeth workes, doth not distinguish of workes, whether proceeding from nature, or from grace, as if by the one wee were justified, and not by the other; but generally excludeth all even those, which are commanded in the Law of God, thereby mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all inherent righteousnesse whatsoever, even charity it selfe which is the <note n="f" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5.</note> end of the Law, and proceedeth from faith unfained. For the Law is a perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse, whencesoever it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Neither are the Papists able to produce any one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein the Apostle, either affirmeth, that wee are justified by workes proceeding from grace; or propoundeth this question to bee disputed, whether workes doe justifie without faith: but even whether faith doth justifie without workes; alwaies concluding the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that wee are justified by faith without workes; thereby, teaching, that workes doe justifie before God, neither without faith, nor yet with it,</p>

For the better understanding of this needfull point worthy<note place="margin">That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences make against justification by works of grace.</note> to be insisted upon, and for the satisfying of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> objections, wherein hee pleaseth himselfe; wee are to take notice, that there are two wayes to life eternall, which God hath propounded to man: the one in the state of innocencie: the other, after his fall. The former, was the covenant of workes, or of inherent righteousnesse to be performed by himselfe; the Sacrament whereof was the Tree of life. But when man had broken this covenant and was fallen from the state of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into the state of disobedience and corruption, it being now not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that he should be justified or saved by inherent righteousnesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the covenant of workes: the Lord therefore in his infinite mercie and love of mankind made with man, being now a sinner, the covenant of grace in the promised seed; that whosoever truly beleeveth in him (though in himselfe a sinner, as since the fall all are) should bee justified and saved by his righteousnesse. The faith in this covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the justification of sinners and salvation by Christ, was profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the beginning after the promise was once made, by all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches and ancient beleevers, who had testimony that they pleased God, <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> and by faith in the Messias wrought those things which were pleasing to God, which without faith in Christ they could not have done. And it was represented and figured in the sacrifices, which were types and figures of Christs sacrifice, even from the <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 4. 9.</note> beginning. And the same was afterwards confirmed by Sacraments: <hi>viz.</hi> Circumcision which was ordained to bee a seale <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> of that righteousnesse which is by faith: and the passeover, which was a type of Christ our passeover, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 8.</note> who is immolated for us; and prefigured by the propitiatory, which covered the Arke, in which were the two tables of the Law; by the Scape-goate, which did beare away the sinnes of the people, by the high Priest, who was a type of Christ in many respects; but most plainely by

And finally, they that seeke to be justified by the Law are fallen from grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. according to all the consequences alleaged by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> From when I argue thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>To them that are debtours to the whole Law, Christ is become of none effect, to them the covenant of grace is disanulled, and the promise made of none effect, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They that seeke to be justified by the workes of the Law, that is, by righteousnesse inherent whatsoever, whether before or after grace are debtours to the whole Law.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore to them that seeke to bee justified by righteousnesse inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, Christ is become of none effect, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The proposition is thus proved: Those that are debtors to the whole Law are subject to a double yoake of most miserable bondage opposite to the liberty of justification: the former, in that they are to be subject to the fearefull curse of the Law, if at any time they transgresse it, though in the least degree, as wee doe very often, and sometimes in an high degree: the other, to be excluded from justification, if they doe not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:22501:231"/>
perfectly and perpetually fulfill it, which by reason of the flesh is utterly impossible to us. Now Christ came to free us from this double bondage of the Law, himselfe being made a curse for us, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all righteousnesse in our behalfe, that by the imputation of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and of his obedience, wee might not onely bee freed from the curse, but also bee entituled to the Kingdome of heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him that remaineth under this double yoake of bondage, Christ profiteth nothing. I come to the assumption: those that seeke to bee justified by the workes of the Law, that is, by righteousnesse inherent, are debtours to the whole Law; for neither are they free from the curse, if they breake it, as all doe. And therefore the Apostle concludeth <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> them who are of workes, that is, who seeke justification by righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse inherent, are under the curse. Neither can they be justified, unlesse they perfectly keepe it. Therefore they, who seeke to be justified by the workes of the Law, that is by inherent righteousnesse whatsoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going before, or following grace, to them Christ is become of none effect, to them he dyed in vaine, to them the covenant of grace is disanulled, to them the promise is of none effect, &amp;c. So that whether you conceive of workes as going before, or following grace, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the Apostle are one and the same.</p>
               <p>§. XII. Indeed if the popish doctrine were true, that Christ hath<note place="margin">Christ hath not merited for us that we should be justified by our owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, or saved by our owne merits.</note> merited for us the infusion of that righteousnesse by which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as hee hath done that by which wee are sanctified, and that hee hath merited for our workes to make them meritorious of eternall life: then those consequences would not be so strong against the workes of grace, as of nature. But the Scriptures teach us, that Christ doth justifie and save us, by his blood and by his obedience, that is by his owne personall righteousnesse and merits, and not by any satisfaction of ours purchased by him, nor by any merit of ours by him made meritorious. For if his satisfaction and merits for us be full and perfect, what need we to patch to them the ragges of our owne satisfactions and merits? But if that were the end why Christ died for us, that wee by his merits should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine both inherent justice whereby we should be justified, and also me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our owne whereby we should be saved, as the Papists teach: then, either that righteousnesse and those workes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ich wee have by grace, are sufficient to justifie and to save us, or else Christ died in vaine for us. But neither is that inherent righteousnesse, which we have from Christ sufficient to justifie us, nor those good workes of grace which wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme sufficient to merit eternall life, as I have in this treatise abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved; neither did Christ dye in vaine, for that to imagine were blasphemy. Therfore that was not the end why Christ our Saviour died for us. I say againe, if Christ dyed to this end, that he might merit grace for us, whereby we might in our owne persons satisfie the Law, and so be justified thereby; then he merited not onely that we should perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perpetually without any omission or intermission in all our life fulfill the Law, and be alwayes and altogether without sinne, which by reason of our sinfulnesse is utterly impossible, wee having beene sinners
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:22501:231"/>
from the wombe, yea in the wombe: but also that wee should in our owne person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> satisfie the penalty, which cannot be done but by punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eternall, or that which is equivalent, for where hath beene guilt of sinne, as in all hath beene, there the Law cannot be satisfied without the punishment threatned in the Law. And therefore if this were the end of Christs death, it must be confessed, that he died in vaine: but this consequent is Blasphemous, and therefore the antecedent is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
               <p>§. XIII. To the fourth place which is <hi>Ephesians</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His answere to <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</note> vouchsafeth no severall answere, but sleights it over with that common answere, <hi>that it excludeth onely workes done before faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this place ought not so to bee sleighted. For it doth <hi>ex professo</hi> teach, that salvation and all the degrees thereof, as namely justification, are to bee ascribed wholly to the grace of God in Christ through faith, and not to any workes or deserts of ours whether going before or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing justification. For first, it may seeme needlesse, that the Apostle should tell the Ephesians, whom before in the same Chapter hee had convicted to have beene before their conversion children of wrath as all are by nature, dead in sinne, bondslaves of Satan, living according to to the course of this world in all manner of sinne, untill God in his abundant mercies in Christ (by whose grace they were saved) quickned them together with Christ: that hee I say should tell them, that they were not justified by the workes which they had wrought before their conversion. Secondly, when the Apostle saith, you are saved by grace and not by workes, will they say hee excludeth onely workes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore salvation? why then hee excludeth all. And that distinction with which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contenteth himfelfe, as a sufficient answere, cannot be fitted to this place. If it be said, that the Apostle by Salvation meaneth justification. I confesse that among the degrees of Salvation hee doth specially meane justification, whereby we receive the right to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance<note n="p" place="margin">Tit. 3. 7.</note>, and are intitled to the kingdome of heaven, and saved in hope. But from hence it is inevitably proved, that by what wee are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, we are saved; and by what we are saved we are justified. But we are saved, as the Apostle here saith, by the free grace of God through faith, not of any workes of ours whatsoever, or whensoever performed: therefore in the like manner we are justified. What then? will you say, if we bee neither justified by good workes nor saved for them, are they therefore to bee neglected? I answere in the third place, that good workes, though they be excluded from the act of justification, or merit of salvation: yet they are not excluded from the conversation of the faithfull, but are therein required, as necessary fruits of our regeneration and consequents of our justification, as also being the way, wherein wee are to walke towards our glorification. As the Apostle sheweth in the next words, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. for wee are, saith he, Gods wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>kemanship created in Christ Iesus unto good workes, which God hath preordained, not that wee should bee justified by them, or saved for them, but that wee should walke in them, as the way to eternall life: where we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:22501:232"/>
that those words being a prevention of a secret objection, <hi>viz.</hi> if wee be not justified by good workes nor saved for them, are they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be neglected? No, saith the Apostle, they that are justified are the workemanship of God created unto good workes, which God hath prepared, that we being justified and regenerated should walke in them. And therefore the Apostle speaketh manifestly not of workes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace, but of such good workes as are consequents of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fruits of our regeneration, wherein we being regenerated and justified are to walke, as in the way, to our glorification.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. The next place, <hi>viz. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. which is like to the former, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shifteth off with the like common answere, <hi>that it speaketh of workes going before faith.</hi> But hee may not carry it so. For the Apostle having (as hee had done, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.) signified, that all of us before our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version lived in all manner of sinne: But after that the kindnesse and love of God our Saviour to man appeared: not by the workes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which wee have done, but according to his mercie hee saved us, &amp;c. Where as in the former place he useth the phrase of <hi>saving,</hi> unto which, as I said, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> distinction cannot bee fitted. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the workes which he excludeth, hee doth expressely call the works of righteousnesse: which terme cannot agree to the works of such men as the Apostle describeth <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and such are all men unregenerate.</p>

But if</hi> the Apostle had spoken of the same workes, whereof he spake <hi>ver.</hi> 7. the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification used <hi>vers.</hi> 8. would have been but an idle repetition, and the exposition which we give, was long since delivered by <note n="p" place="margin">In locum.</note>

               <p>The assumption is proved out of the text. The proposition, because the word <hi>gratis</hi> is so expounded by all sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>. thou art saved freely without any good workes of thine, which words exclude all merits, as well from sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as from justification. And so doe those words of the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. To avoid this evident truth <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>De justif. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> coyneth a twofold distinction. First, that the word <hi>gratis</hi> may bee understood, as opposed to merits of condignity, going before justification: and so it excludeth not the dispositions and preparations, which the Papists teach goe before justification which according to their doctrine, are but merits of congruity. But it is evident, that not onely merits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, but all merit whatsoever, yea and all respect of our owne worthinesse and well doing is excluded: so that <hi>gratis</hi> is as much as without any cause in us, or any desert of ours, or worthines in our selves. And thus the councill of Trent <note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> it selfe expoundeth this word. We are therefore said to be justified <hi>gratis</hi> freely, because none of those things which goe before justification, whether faith for workes, deserve the grace of justification: for if it be grace, then is it not of workes: for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it were of workes, then grace were not grace, as the same Apostle saith, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, saith he, <hi>it may bee understood as opposed to our owne merits or good workes done without grace, for those that proceed from grace, are not opposed to grace, and therfore not excluded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I reply: we cannot have any good thing but by gift from God: and what good thing we have from God, that is called ours, as our faith, our Charity, our Hope, our good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>orkes: Neither can wee without grace merit any thing but punishment. It is therefore absurd to understand the Apostle as excluding merits without grace, when as if we should doe all that is commanded (which cannot be done without grace) we must confesse that we deserve not so much as thanks, because we have done but what was our duty to doe. Neither can wee bee said to be justified <hi>gratis</hi> if there be any meritori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>us cause of justification in our selves, though received from God In regard of our selves indeed wee are justified <hi>gratis:</hi> but it is not <hi>gratis</hi> in nor without paying a great price in respect of Christ. And therefore to those words justified freely by his grace, is added, through the redemption whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>h is in or by Christ. By the word <hi>gratis</hi> therefore the Apostle signifieth tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in us there is no materiall cause, no merit of justification, but onely in Christ. And where he saith that grace cannot bee opposed to grace: I say it may, as in that opposition which is of relatives, as of the cause and the effect. For the effect cannot be the cause of its owne cause, and therfore works which are the fruits and effects of justification cannot bee the causes thereof.</p>
               <p>The other argument is from the word <hi>grace.</hi> For if our justification be of grace, then not of workes, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. and if of workes then not of grace. So <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. you are saved by grace not of workes. For to him that worketh, the reward, that is, justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or salvation is not imputed of grace, but it is rendred as of debt, but

And having little to say to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion it selfe, he intermingleth many impertinent discourses. Impertinent I say to the question, though not to his purpose: which was to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate us, as though we held all those assertions, which he laboureth to confute.</p>
               <p>In his fourth booke therefore, which is <hi>de justitia operum,</hi> he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth two maine questions to be disputed, unto which divers others are coincident. The former, concerning the necessity of good workes; the other, concerning the truth of them. As if we, either denied that good workes are necessary or that they are truely good. To the former, hee referreth three questions: the first, whether the faithfull are bound to keepe the Law of God: as though wee taught, they were not: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond concerning the difference betweene the Law and the Gospell, as if we taught that the difference standeth in this, that by the Law good workes are necessary, by the Gospell not.

                  </gap>o farre as concerneth this present controversie of justification by workes, passing by the rest as impertinent. As touching therefore the first principall question which concerneth the necessity of good works:
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:22501:234"/>
the Reader will beare me witnes by that which before I have delivered, that we hold good workes necessary in many respects, and that we urge the necessity of them by better arguments than the Romish doctrine doth afford: we confesse, that they are necessary, <hi>necessitate presentiae</hi> for persons come to yeeres, that are already justified, and are to bee saved: as necessary consequents of justification, and as necessary forerunners of Salvation onely we deny them to be necessary <hi>necessitate efficientiae,</hi> as causes either of justification or Salvation.</p>

For after he had in the first Chapter calumniated us, as if wee denied good workes to bee necessary to Salvation: in the Chapters following hee proveth they bee necessary, because as hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth his proofes in the Argument of his booke, we are bound to keepe the Law of God. And that he proveth by discussing the other two questions concerning the difference betwixt the Law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and concerning Christian liberty. But by these arguments <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> neither proveth his owne assertion, nor disproveth ours. His asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that good workes doe concurre unto justification as a cause thereof, which we deny. He argueth they be causes: why? because they are necessary. As if every thing that is necessary were a cause. But whereto are they necessary? to salvation, saith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Why, but the question is of justification. Now many things are required to salvation, which doe not concurre to justification, as namely <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> confession, <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, <note n="c" place="margin">He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In all this discourse therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is farre from concluding the point in question.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding it will not be unprofitable: if I shall make a short excursion to follow him in his discourse, but not to answere every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is not worth the answering.

               </p>
               <p>§. III. His intent in the first is to disprove that difference, which<note place="margin">Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Gospell.</note> we make betweene the Law and the Gospell: from whence he had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the former Chapter, that we deny the necessity of good works. The difference was this: That the Law propoundeth justification and salvation upon the condition of our fulfilling the whole Law. But the Gospell promiseth justification and salvation upon the condition of faith only; excluding works as the causes, by which we are justified, or for which we be saved: which difference if it be true, as it is most true,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:22501:234"/>
plainely proveth justification by faith only, and disproveth justification by workes.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding whereof, wee are to distinguish the<note place="margin">The accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the words Law, and Gospell, either in a large or strict sense.</note> termes both of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospell:</hi> which are used sometimes more largely, sometimes more strictly and properly.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth: the promises of remission of sinnes though they be in the Prophets, they doe not belong to the Law, but to the Gospell. And so the covenant of grace it selfe, which the Lord made with <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 22. 18.</note>

This doctrine teacheth us, that our gracious God out of his meere grace having elected his children in Christ before all times, did in the fulnesse of time send downe his Sonne to save us: and that the benefit of the Messias might be applyed unto us, vouchsafeth unto us the Gospell of grace, by which according to the purpose of his grace given unto us in Christ before all secular times, <note n="m" place="margin">2 Tim. 19.</note> he calleth us working in us the grace of faith: being endued with faith hee imputeth unto us the righteousnesse and merits of Christ, making us partakers of redemption, reconciliation, justification, and adoption, and so freeing us from hell: and from all the enemies of our salvation, hee entituleth us unto the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And that wee may be fitted and prepared for his Kingdome into which no unholy thing may enter, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 27. hee hath promised to them that beleeve, that being redeemed, reconciled, justified, adopted, and so entituled to the kingdome of heaven, hee will give them grace to worship him without feare in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our life, that is, in the voluntary, upright, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant obedience of his Law. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the things which God in this Covenant of grace hath promised to give, as namely faith and new obedience, are also required of us <hi>Deo dante quod jubet,</hi> God giving to us what he requireth of us: the one, as the antecedent condition whereby we are entitled or have right to his kingdome, being saved in hope: the other as the consequent and fruit <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note> of the former, whereby we being entitled to Gods kingdome, are prepared and fitted for it: without which, though none who are <hi>adulti</hi> are saved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. yet none are saved by it, or for it; it being the way to the kingdome, but not the cause of it, nor the title that we have unto it: and therefore necessary, as I have said <hi>necessitate presentiae,</hi> as <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> but not <hi>necessitate efficientiae</hi> as any true or proper cause thereof.</p>
               <p>§. V. These things thus premised, it will be easy to answere <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His disproofe of the difference which we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</note> arguments taken from the difference betweene the Law and the Gospell to prove the necessity of good workes. And they are two: the former disproving the supposed false difference, the other proving the pretended true. As touching the former: having first propounded an idle distinction of the divers acceptions of the word <hi>Gospell,</hi> that it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth either the doctrine which Christ and his Apostles taught, or the grace of the new Testament, which is the quickning Spirit, or the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the holy Ghost working in the hearts of the elect, or the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart, (which I therefore call idle, because as soone as he hath propounded it, he confesseth, that the word Gospell in the Scripture
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:22501:235"/>
doth never signifie any other, but the Doctrine) hee proveth, <hi>that in the Gospell is contained the Doctrine of good workes, and divers Lawe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, divers comminations and divers promises made upon condition of good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which we doe confesse to be true as the word Gospell is taken in the larger sense. But as those promises and Doctrine of grace contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Bookes of the old Testament, did not belong to the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly which is the covenant of works, but to the Gospell which is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace: so in the books of the new Testament, divers precepts, comminations and promises are contained, which belong not properly to the Gospell, which is the covenant of grace and Law of Faith, but to the Law of works. For even as the Preachers of the Gospell at this day, doe in their preaching intermingle many things appertaining to the Law either for the preparing of their auditours, who are not yet justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the terrour of the Law; or for directing those that doe beleeve, to lead their life according to the rule of the Law: Even so our Saviour Christ, and his Apostles in their doctrine intermixed legall precepts, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall promises and threatnings, as the necessity of their auditours requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But upon all this being granted, what will he inferre? he saith in the title of this Chapter (though in the Chapter it selfe he doth not expresse it) that from hence is proved the necessity of good works; which we deny not. So pertinent a disputer is this great Master of controversies.</p>
               <p>§. VI. And forasmuch as the promise of eternall life, as of a reward,<note place="margin">Whether the promise of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation made to our obedience doe prove the merit of good workes.</note> made to our obedience, is the principall ground, whereon the Papists build their Antichristian doctrine of the efficiencie and merit of good workes, I will endeavour to cleare this point. We are therefore to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that eternall life is vouchsafed to the faithfull in three respects. First, as the free gift of God without respect of any worthinesse in us. Secondly, as our inheritance purchased by Christ. Thirdly, as a free reward promised and given to our obedience. In the first respect, our salvation and all the degrees thereof, is wholy to be ascribed to the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">Eternall life three waies promised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first, as a free g ft.</note> favor of God in Christ. In the second, to the mercy of God and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ. In the third to the mercies of God redoubled and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, and not to any desert of ours. For as touching the first, God before the foundation of the world was laid, of his free grace Elected us in Christ, <note n="o" place="margin">Epbes. 1. 6.</note> graciously accepting of us in his beloved without respect of any goodnesse in us; whom, when he foresaw fallen into the state of perdition, <hi>ex massa perdita humani generis</hi> did chuse us in Christ, in him, and by him to be justified and saved. And as out of his undeserved love he did chuse us; so by the same grace, whom he hath elected <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. 10. 13, 14. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13, 14.</note>, he hath called; whom hee hath called, he hath justified; whom hee hath justified, hee hath sanctified; and whom hee hath called, justified, and sanctified, he hath glorified, according to the purpose of his grace <note n="q" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> given unto us in Christ before the world began. As therfore all the degrees of salvation are wholly to be ascribed to the grace, that is, the gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in Christ, (for by his grace we were elected, called, justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, regenerated and sanctified) so also by his grace wee are saved <note n="r" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 8, 9.</note> and not of works.

It was of Gods free grace, that hee elected any of us, that being elected hee called us, that being called and endued with faith hee justifieth and adoptet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But this is a multiplication of his grace upon us, that to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to the Practice of Piety, whereby wee are fitted for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, he doth promise to reward our good works with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happinesse, and in the end doth crowne his owne blessings with blessednesse, which, though hee bee pleased for our encouragement to call a reward, yet is it not deserved by us, but freely bestowed by him, as his free gift granted unto us in Christ before all times, as our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance purchased by Christ: as his bountifull reward of his owne gifts, which as hee freely promiseth, so in his good time hee freely bestoweth, as his <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. IX. To this purpose let us consider the Lords dealing with<note place="margin">The example of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the Lord at his first comming towards the Land of promise, made divers gracious promises, which afterwards hee often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. But when upon that Commandement of tryall to offer up his onely sonne, <hi>Abraham</hi> had by Gods speciall grace notably approved <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 22. 16, 18.</note> his faith and obedience; hereupon the Lord doth sweare, that he will bestow upon him the things which before hee had promised, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that his obedience, for so hee saith, because thou hast done this thing, and againe, because thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:22501:237"/>
promises which God long before had made unto him, and oftentimes repeated? Nothing lesse, so God in his eternall Counsell hath to the Elect designed eternall life, as his free gift by Christ, Christ by his merits hath purchased it to bee our inheritance, God hath graciously promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bestow freely this inheritance on them that beleeve in Christ: when as therefore God doth promise to reward our piety with eternall life, wee may not thinke that by our piety it is deserved, which God long before had decreed and promised, and Christ our Saviour had purchased for us. But though it bee a reward, yet it is a most free, and undeserved reward.</p>
               <p>§. X. When the Papists therefore object, that if eternall life be the<note place="margin">Objection, if eternall life bee the reward of our obedience, then our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience doth merit it.</note> reward of our obedience, then our obedience doth deserve it: I answere, first, thou canst deserve nothing at Gods hand, by that which he hath freely given, and much lesse that, which hee freely bestoweth on thee: Secondly, if thou shouldest doe all that is required of thee, thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest deserve nothing thereby: for where is debt and duty, there is no<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> merit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. Thirdly, we doe not all that is commanded but come short of our duty, and that which we doe is unperfect, and defective in respect of manner and measure; and therefore in justice deserveth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, rather than reward: and consequently the reward, when it is given, is to bee ascribed to Gods undeserved<note n="b" place="margin">Psalm 62. 12. Ephes. 2. 7.</note> mercie and not to our merit. Fourthly, Sanctification, and the duties thereof are not causes of Salvation, and therefore in <hi>serie causarum,</hi> in the chaine of the causes of Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. they are left out: and where they are mentioned, they are inserted, not as a cause of Salvation, but either as the way unto it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. or as the markes and cognizances of them that shall be saved, or as the evidences according to which God will judge. As marks, I say for they are <hi>occulta praedestinationis indicia futurae faelicitatis praesagia,</hi> as<note n="c" place="margin">De gratia &amp; lib. arbitr.</note> 
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh. Our Saviour setting downe the end of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospell saith, that a man being thereby called, may by faith obtaine remission of sinnes, and inheritance among them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. so also <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32.</p>
               <p>§. XI. And thus are wee to expound many Testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Places wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 17. The Spirit it selfe beareth witnesse with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God, and if Children, Heires of God, and coheires with Christ, who shall be glorified with Christ, if hee hath given us grace not onely to beleeve<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note>, but also to suffer with him and for him, he doth not say that our suffering doth make us sonnes and heires of God who shall be glorified with him: but the Spirit beareth witnesse, that if we suffer with him, we are the sonnes and heires of God, who shall be glorified with him. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. If we suffer, wee shall reigne with him; if we patiently suffer, it is (not a cause, but) a signe that we shall reigne with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus. But how shall we know, who they are that shall be saved by Christ? <hi>that walke not after the flesh but after the Spirit:</hi> where walking after the Spirit, is not the cause of salvation, but a signe
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:22501:237"/>
of their being in Christ, which is the cause. Christ is the foundation and cause of all our happinesse; and faith is the only instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee receiving Christ are united unto him: all other graces and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto which happinesse any where is ascribed, as it is to many, <hi>Matth. 5. 3. &amp;c. Psalm. 112. 1. &amp;c.</hi> are but notes of our being in Christ by faith, and presages of our future happinesse. Thus in the same chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. If by the Spirit yee doe mortifie the deeds of the body, that is, of the flesh, as the vulgar Latine rendreth it, and as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. Ye shall live. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13. Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: that is whosoever hath this grace given him unto him truly to worship God, it is an evident signe and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance unto him that he shall be saved, and so of the like: <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">In Rom. 8.</note>, this is the signe of justification in a man, that by that which dwelleth in him he that is justified may appeare to be the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>§. XII. As evidences, according to which the Lord will judge.<note place="margin">Or of eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> For so it is often said, that God will judge men acccording to their workes. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34, 35. Come ye blessed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world, for when I was hungry you gave me meat, &amp;c. this rationall particle <hi>for,</hi> though it be called causall, and the sentence, where it is used is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the rendring of the cause, doth not imply a cause properly so called, but any argument or reason, as I have shewed heretofore: as here it implyeth an argument from the fruits, as signes and evidences of their bleessednesse in Christ by faith. The causes of this sentence of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are set downe, <hi>vers.</hi> 34. First, because they are blessed of God, that is, justified. Secondly, because elected, for whom God in his eternall purpose hath provided this kingdome. Thirdly, in that it is called the inheritance purchased for them that truely beleeve in Christ, who as soone as they beleeve are by justification blessed, as being entitled or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving right to this Heavenly inheritance: and this is implyed in the Verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, inherit, shewing that they come to that kingdome by right of inheritance. Salvation therefore is given, as a fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> gift of God depending upon election and justification, and as an inheritance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Christ for all true beleevers: and therefore not merited by them that are saved. But because God hath promised salvation to all that have true faith in Christ, which is a secret and inward grace, and many men deceive themselves with a vaine opinion and profession of it therefore the Lord will judge of men according to the fruits thereof: when as men therefore professing the true faith, doe demou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>trate their faith by good workes, and namely by the workes of charity and mercie, they give good proofe of their election, whereby this kingdome was prepared for them, and of their redemption by which Christ purchased this inheritance for them, and of their justification, whereby, they are entituled to this kingdome, and so are blessed of God. And therefore according to these fruits Christ pronounceth the sentence of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Three other answeres to the foresaid obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>

objection for by that which hath beene said, it appeareth. Fifthly, that eternall life is not deserved by our obedience, because it is the free gift of God depending upon Gods free election. Sixthly, because we come to it, as to an inheritance purchased by Christs merits, and not by ours. Seventhly, though it be a reward, yet it presupposeth no merit of ours, because it is a free and undeserved reward, whereby the Lord out of his meere bounty doth crowne his owne gifts. <hi>Ea enim est Dei bonitas</hi> saith learned Casaubon<note n="f" place="margin">Ad annal. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

Thus much may suffice to have answered his former Argument, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that difference, which wee make according to the Scriptures, betweene the Law and the Gospell, in respect of justification.</p>

Thirdly, that to the precepts hee hath added Counselles tending to perfection? Answ.</hi> This difference is suitable to the rest of their wicked and Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine, which in this whole treatise I confute, wherby as they confound justification and sanctification; so also the Law and the Gospell: saving that in the Gospell they say greater perfection is required of inherent righteousnes to justification, than the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcribeth: and so make it a Law of workes as much or rather more, than the Law it selfe.</p>

                  <hi>and a light burden.</hi> If <hi>Petor</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exclaimed against those, which sought to impose the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> upon Christians <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. what shall wee thinke of our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Rabbins that impose an heavier yoake, than the Law it selfe. For whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>the Gospell is the easier, because of the grace of the newe Testament accompanying it:</hi> yet the difference is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in respect of the doctrine it selfe, and the letter, which if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ire more perfect obedience, is in it self the heavier burden.</p>
               <p>II. This difference, by confounding the Law and the Gospell, doth make void the covenant of grace, which God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and performed in Christ: which was concerning Iustification by faith, which as it could not be disannulled<note n="s" place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note> by the Covenant of works: so much lesse was it repealed, but renewed and ratified in the Gospell. But if in the Gospell were taught justification by works and not by Christs righteousnesse apperhended by faith, the Covenant of grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> should in the Gospell be repealed, rather than renewed. For the covenant of works promiseth justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and life upon condition of perfect and perpetuall obedience: the covenant of grace, upon condition of faith. And these two, in the Article of justification are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> incompatible. If therfore the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doe teach justification by workes, it maketh void the covenant of grace, and thus the popish gospel overthroweth the Gospel of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="476" facs="tcp:22501:240"/>Thirdly, This difference overthroweth a maine benefit, which we have by Christ, and without which we can neither be justified nor saved, which is this: that he hath freed us from the rigour of the Law, which standeth in an exaction of perfect righteousnesse to be inherent in us, and perfect obedience to be performed by us unto the acceptation either of our persons or actions, which by reason of our corruption is impossible unto us. And therfore miserable is their estcate, who are in bondage to the Law, either subjecting them to the curse, if they offend in the least degree, when in many things wee offend all: or excluding them from justification and salvation, if they yeeld not perfect and perpetuall obedience, which by reason of the flesh is impossible. From this curse Christ hath freed us in being made<note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> a curse for us, bearing the punishment due for our sinnes: and from this exaction of perfect righteousnesse to be performed by our selves, hee hath freed us in being made unto us of God<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 23. 6.</note> even Iehovah our righteousnesse, performing perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law for us. But if the Gospell, which they call the new Law, require more perfect obedience, than the old Law unto justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and salvation: then doe wee continue in that miserable estate, neither doth our blessed and most perfect Saviour availe us any thing. Neither will this free us from this bondage, that with the newe Law the grace of the new Testament, whereby we should be enabled to obey the Law is conferred. For first, it is conferred onely to those, who are already justified: and secondly, to whom it is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is not given in such perfection in this life, but that ever they are sinners in themselves, sinne alwayes abiding in them. So that still, if wee must be justified by no righteousnesse but that which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in us, we remaine in that fearefull bondage: seeing we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either to free us from the curse in respect of our former sinnes, or to entitle us to the kingdome of heaven; our best righteousnesse being unperfect, and stayned with the flesh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the righteousnes required in the new Law to justification, is either the same with that, which was prescribed in the old Law, or more perfect. If the same, how then are we not justified by the works of the Law? If more perfect, then the Law of God was not perfect; which the Scriptures testifie to be so perfect, as nothing can bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereto. Neither did our Saviour Christ perfect the Law by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more perfection unto it, in respect either of the precepts, or the counsells, which the Papists conceive to have bin added by Christ to the precepts. For as touching the precepts: he did but more perfectly explaine them, freeing them from the depravations of the Scribes and Pharisees, who rested in the outward letter, as if the Law were not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, nor did forbid any more, but the grosse sins, which in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the Law are expressed. And as for the Counsells; they are also mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties for omission wherof men may according to the sentence of the Law be condemned, as not to love our enemyes, not to forbeare swearing in ordinary talke, not to give a mans goods to the poore,

and to follow Christ, when hee is thereunto required. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 23. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 23. These things are so manifest, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

               <p>§. XXI. The second difference is, <hi>that the Law commeth alone, but</hi>

                  <hi>the Gospell is accompanied with grace.</hi> Which is not a difference of the doctrine and letter of the Gospell from the Law, but of the covenant of grace from the covenant of works. For in the covenant of grace, as justification is promised to them, that being called doe beleeve: so sanctification to them, that are justifyed. Which as it proveth the concurrence of Good workes with faith in the party justified, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents thereof: so it excludeth them from being any causes of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. But as touching this second difference two popish errours are to bee avoided. First, in respect of the covenant of workes. For though that covenant doth not promise, nor afford the grace of sanctification, wherby a man should be enabled to performe the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which grace is promised in the covenant of grace, and given to them that beleeve; yet wee are not so to conceive, that they who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the time of the law were void of grace, nor all that live under the Gospell, are endued with grace. For the covenant of grace hath alwayes bene in force from the beginning: so that to the faithfull, who beleeved in the Messias which was to come, the grace of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was given, according to the covenant of grace, so that in the old Testament, even under the Law, there were as excellent examp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of holynesse, as have bene in the time of the new, under the Gospell. So also the Law hath its use, even among those that live under the Gospell, insomuch that untill men doe beleeve, they are under the Law, and not under grace. Secondly, in respect of the grace of the new Testament: that it is not promised in such perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life, where wee receive but the first fruits<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> of the Spirit, as that wee may expect to be justified by it, or saved for it.<note place="margin">The other 6. differences.</note>

               <p>These three differences of the Law doe not agree to the Law Morall, which belongeth to all nations, which did not consist of shadowes and figures, which was not to be changed, no not by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, because it was, and is, a perfect, immutable, and perpetuall rule of righteousnesse. The other three, <hi>viz.</hi> the sixth, seventh, and eigth arise, as hee saith, from the second. The sixth, that <hi>the Law of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>Moses had no power to justifie, neither was it given, that it might justifie; but that it might shew the disease, and stirre up men to seeke the physitian. But the Law of Christ, that is, the Gospell hath power to justifie, and was given to that end.</hi> For as hee alleageth out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>it is the power of God to salvation to every one that beleeveth,</hi> (he doth not say that worketh.) For therein is revealed the righteousnesse of God from faith to faith, as it is written, the just man shall live by faith. This is a true difference of the Law of faith from the Law of workes: but agreeth not to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> new Law, which is a Law of workes, as well as the old, conteyning the very same morall precepts with the morall Law; in<note place="margin">7</note> the observation whereof not our justification but our sanctification consisteth, prescribing also the same righteousnesse <hi>viz</hi> Charity, which is the summe of the Law. The seventh, that <hi>the Law of Moses is a Law of fearefullnesse, and bondage: but the Gospell, the Law of love, and of liberty,</hi> which is true. For the obedience of men, who are under the Law, is forced by the terrour and coaction of the Law working servile feare in them. But the obedience of men, who are under grace, that is of men justified, is voluntary and cheerfull proceeding from faith, and from some measure of assurance of Gods love and favour to them in Christ. Therfore this voluntary obedience is no cause, but a consequent of justification, not onely before God, but also in the court of our owne conscience; that is, not onely of justification it<note place="margin">8</note> selfe, but also of the assurance thereof in some measure. Of the eigth, which confuteth the first, I have already spoken.</p>

So that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though hee be come neerer the question, yet he is not come home to it. But perhaps it will be said, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> prevented this objection, when he first<note n="a" place="margin">

His argument may thus be frarned. <hi>If faith did justifie alone, then it would save alone: but faith doth not save alone without good workes, which are necessary to Salvation in those that are come to yeares.

<pb n="480" facs="tcp:22501:242"/>
(which as he absurdly teacheth, is lost by any act of infidelity) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, both their justification and Salvation. Yea but saith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, their justice cannot be lost, nor their Salvation, whiles they have faith, if they be justified by faith onely.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe saith (though false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that the faith of them, who are justified, may be lost, and with it their Salvation: and therefore by his doctrine a man bee justified by faith, and yet not be saved by it. Secondly, it is denied by some of the Fathers, who, though they teach, that faith alone sufficeth to justification (as you have heard:) yet deny that it alone sufficeth to Salvation, because some other things, as namely good workes are thereunto required. To the assumption, that saith alone doth not save: If such a faith be meant, as is alone, severed from Charity and void of workes: I doe confesse, that it neither saveth, nor yet justifieth, I doe not say, alone, but not at all. But if he speake of a true lively faith in Christ, which purifieth the heart and worketh by love, (of which onely we speake) and understand it relatively, as we doe: then I constantly affirme, that faith in Christ alone, that is, Christ alone received by faith, is the onely meritorious cause of our Salvation: and that neither workes, nor any other graces, are causes of salvation, unlesse hee meane <hi>caussas sine quibus non,</hi> which are no causes.</p>

                     </gap>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans affirme, that salvation, as well as justification, is to bee ascribed to faith alone. Answ.</hi> Wee can deny, what either <hi>Luther,</hi> or those that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lutherans doe affirme without warrant of Gods word: therefore this was but a slender proofe. Howbeit, we doe not deny that assertion of <hi>Luther,</hi> nor the like; which, though full of true comfort, yet are most maliciously calumniated by the Papists, as if hee taught men not to care what sinnes they commit, so that they can say, they have faith. Whereas <hi>Luther</hi> delivereth speeches of that kinde to comfort, the distressed consciences labouring under the burden of sinne; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them, that although their sinnes bee many and great, yet they ought not to despaire, if they can finde in their heart to beleeve in Christ. Which is most true. For though our sinnes be many, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God are more; though great, yet the merrits of Christ are greater. And though the Lutherans doe say, that salvation as well as justification is to bee ascribed to faith alone; yet that is no proofe of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> consequence, but a flat deniall of his assumption, which it behoveth him to prove. Upon these things thus premised, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inferreth, that all the testimonies, which afterwards (namely in his fourth Booke) he was to alleage out of Scriptures, and Fathers, to prove, that good <hi>workes are so necessary to salvation, even to men that are justified, that without them faith alone doth not save them: doe also prove, that faith alone doth not justifie, which is the thing</hi> saith hee, <hi>which wee have undertaken to prove:</hi> which notwithstanding wee doe constantly deny, protesting against this inference of <hi>Bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>mine,</hi> and affirming, that although good
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:22501:242"/>
workes be so necessary to salvation, as that that faith which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them doth not save a man; yet that doth not hinder our asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that faith doth justifie alone, because they doe not concurre to the act of justification at all, and much lesse as the causes thereof, for they follow justification, though ordinarily they goe before salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and howsoever that faith, which is alone, severed from charity and destitute of good workes doth neither justifie, as I have shewed heretofore, nor save: yet notwithstanding faith relatively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that is, Christ received by faith doth save alone.</p>

Hee therefore that would goe to heaven, had need to goe the way which leadeth to it, that is, the way of good workes, which God hath prepared for us to walke in them. And that is the meaning of this place: yee have need of patience, as of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary fruit of faith, that having by faith runne the race <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> that is set before you, <hi>viz.</hi> Of patience, you may come to the end of your faith, which is the salvation of your soules.<note place="margin">His second testimony. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</note>

But the Apostle saith, that godly sorrow worketh repentance, even such repentance as is a forerunner unto salvation; or as the faithfull speake, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. That God had given the Gentiles repentance unto life, and therefore such a repentance as was not to bee repented of. For the Apostle seemeth to have relation unto his owne words, <hi>verse</hi> 8. that he had repented, that hee had made them sorry. But when hee understood that their sorrow had brought forth in them repentance, he did not repent thereof. Repentance therefore which is unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is indeed a necessary and undoubted forerunner of salvation, and salvation a certaice consequent of repentance: necessary I say, because without it a sinner cannot bee saved, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3.

For that our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">His fifth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</note> which presently is momentany and light worketh above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure exceedingly an eternall weight of glory in us. <hi>What could bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more plainely? If patience in tribulation doth worke a weight of eternall glory, who can deny, but that there is some relation betweene patience and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Vnlesse perhaps to worke salvation be not to worke something, or that upon the working, there followeth no relation. Answ.</hi> If the Apostle had said, that patience in affliction doth worke an eternall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hee might from thence have had some colour, that patience hath a relation of efficiency to salvation, and yet but a colour. But when the Apostle doth not once mention patience, how could hee bee so confident, as to aske, what could bee spoken more plainely? The
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:22501:244"/>
Apostle speaketh of affliction, both light and momentany, and saith, that it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> worketh unto us an eternall weight of glory. Here then wee are to consider, in what sence affliction, which in it selfe is evill and miserable, should worke glory and happinesse; being light, should worke that which is most ponderous; being momentany, should worke that which is eternall, whether as a cause, properly and in it owne nature causing or working: or as an occasion, which besides, or rather contrary to it owne nature, which is evill, is to us sanctified of God to be a meanes and occasion of our so great good. And to this purpose let us consult with other places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. and <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 12. In the former place, the Apostle saith, wee rejoyce in afflictions, knowing that affliction <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth patience, and so Saint <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 3. Not that affliction in it selfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth patience, but rather the contrary, as appeareth in men unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, whom it maketh to murmure, and sometimes to blaspheme God, which the Divell by experience well knew, when hee moved God to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But afflictions are said to worke patience in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because the holy Ghost sanctifieth their afflictions to them, and excercising them thereby worketh in them patience: and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth? Patience worketh <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but that by patient bearing of affliction hee is found and knowne to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is a sound, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and upright Christian. For therefore God sendeth tryals of all sorts, that those who are <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may bee knowne. Now when men have beene by patient bearing of afflictions found to bee <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, hee shall receive the Crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. The meaning therefore of this place is, neither that affliction cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth patience, nor patience salvation: but that when the godly are afflicted, the holy Ghost by affliction, where with they are exercised, worketh patience in them, and patience worketh probation, because by patience, when they are tryed, they are knowne to bee sound and approved, and probation worketh hope of salvation. For when upon try all men are found to bee approved, they shall receive the Crowne of life, which God hath freely promised to give them. And it is to be observed, that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:22501:244"/>
                  <hi>as a condition and cause (and therefore hath relation to salvation) from the conditionall particle If, and from the</hi> antithesis <hi>of the words going before, if you live according to the flesh, you shall die. Answ.</hi> The conditionall particle used in conditionall or connexive propositions alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth a necessity of consequence; insomuch that the connexion, if it bee not necessary, is not absolutely true, but the necessity of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency it implyeth none. And as for the necessity of consequence, that ariseth not onely from causes, but from all other arguments. And whereas from the Antithesis hee would prove, that as to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, causeth death: so to mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the Spirit, causeth life: I answere, that in both the parts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion or consequence is equally, that is, necessarily true: for if it were not necessary, it were not absolutely true, but it is absolutely true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the authority of the Scriptures which are infallible; which is sufficient to make good the Antithesis. But hence it followeth not, that the condition of either part should be taken from the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; seeing it may bee taken from any other. This sufficeth for the Antithesis, that if by the Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> ye mortifie the deeds of the flesh, it is an evident argument, that you shall live: but if you live according to the flesh, it is an evident argument, that you shall dye: therefore though the condition of the latter part bee the cause of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: yet it is not so in the former, for sinne is the meritorious cause of damnation; but our obedience being a duety, and yet but unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, cannot merit salvation. A servant not doing his duety, but the contrary, is punished. A servant doing, or rather but endeavouring to doe his duety, is rewarded. In these two the arguments are not the same. A servant that doth not his duety deserveth punishment, and his disobedience is the meritorious cause of his punishment. But by doing his duety, especially if it bee done unperfectly (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes our case) he doth not deserve reward, and therefore if hee bee rewarded, it is to be ascribed to his masters bounty, and not to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. Such an Antithesis the Apostle maketh betweene the reward of sinne, and of godlinesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Death is the due wages of sinne, but eternall life (which is the reward of godlinesse) is the free gift of God. And further, as I said before, when I formerly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this allegation: In this and many other such conditionall speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the antecedent is not the cause, but a signe, token or presage of the consequent. If God have given you grace to mortifie the deeds of the flesh, it is an evident token, that you shall live. If God hath adorned you with his grace, it is to be presumed, that he will crowne his owne grace with glory.</p>

The Spirit beareth witnesse with our spirits that we are the sonnes and heires of God and coheires with Christ, if we suffer with him, that wee may also bee glorified with him: where is no relation at all of efficiency, betwixt our sufferings and glory.

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:22501:245"/>
I spake in answere to the last argument) <hi>which doth</hi> not, as hee saith, <hi>point out the cause,</hi> but the evidence by which the holy Ghost doth assure us, that wee are the sonnes and heires of God, and coheires of Christ, who shall bee glorified with him; namely, if we suffer with him. Secondly, <hi>from the reason which is added concerning the excesse of glory to our sufferings</hi> which to my understanding doth plainly confute it. For if the sufferings of this life be not condigne (as the Vulgar readeth it) to the glory that is to come; how should they merit it <hi>ex condigno,</hi> as they arrogantly speake? But the scope of the Apostle in this place, is to encourage the faithfull to suffer for Christ; which he doth by two arguments: the one from the happy event, which is assurance of glorification, testified by the holy Spirit; who testifieth unto us, that if we have grace from God to suffer with Christ, that we are the sonnes and heires of God and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires of Christ, who shall bee glorified with him.

To which both censure and doctrine of the Fathers, wee doe most willingly subscribe. And wee should greatly wonder, how this great Master of Controversies, could bee so idle, so impertinent, so fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous a disputant; but that, as I said before, these his discourses, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the necessity of good workes, though they bee impertinent to the maine Question, because they prove not that which is in controversie betwixt us: yet are not impertinent to his purpose, which was to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate us, and to beare the world in hand, that wee are such as deny the necessity of good workes. But if the question were tryed by voices of the Fathers, innumerable testimonies might bee produced out of their writings; wherein they teach, that wee are justified by faith and not by workes; yea in direct termes affirming, that which is the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, that we are justified by faith <note n="t" place="margin">See <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> alone. But that workes are necessary, as causes, either to salvation, or (which is the question) to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; not any one pregnant testimony out of the ancient Fathers, is, or as I suppose, can bee produced. But to prove the necessity of good workes by way of presence, I shall not need to recite the severall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, seeing I have my <note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 7. cap. 1.</note> selfe delivered more to prove and to urge the necessity of good workes, than can be gathered out of all these testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies put together.</p>

                     <hi>De justif. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> hee put off to this place. Should he not then from the necessity of good workes prove, that faith doth not justifie alone. But in stead of proving that, hee endevoureth to prove, that faith doth not save alone. Thus craftily hee glydeth from one question to another for his owne advantage: because hee knew, that more is required to salvation, than was required to justification. For sanctification commeth betwixt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and salvation. And although we are justified without works going before justification: yet we are not saved without workes going before salvation; they being the way, which God hath prepared for them that are justified to walke in towards their glorification. I might therefore, according to the Lawes of disputation, hold him to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, or refuse to give him answere. But he is so farre from proving, that faith doth not justifie alone, that hee is not able to prove, that it doth not save alone, disputing in that sence, according to which we doe hold, that faith doth justifie alone. Now, for the understanding of our sence and meaning certaine distinctions heretofore propounded, must for avoiding of calumniations bee here repeated. First, that wee doe not meane that faith is the onely grace which doth sanctifie, as the Papists will needes misunderstand us: but that to sanctification not only other graces doe concurre with faith, but good workes also. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that besides faith, the said graces and good workes be forerunners of our salvation. Secondly when wee say, faith alone, wee doe not meane that faith which is alone, being a solitary, an idle, a counterfeit and dead faith severed from charity and other graces and destitute of goodworks; but we meane a true and lively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aith which purifieth the heart and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by love, which cannot be severed from charity and other graces, as I have heretofore proved. And therefore wee hold, that although in respect of the act of justifying or saving it alone: yet in respect of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, it never is, nor (if it be a true justifying and savingfaith) can be alone. Thirdly, when we doe say, that faith alone justifieth and saveth, wee speake with relation to the object, or relatively, meaning, that the object, which faith alone receiveth, doth justifie and save us, when wee say therefore, that we are justified or saved by faith alone, our meaning is, that we are justified only by the righteousnesse of Christ which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith alone, and not by our owne righteousnesse: and that wee are saved by the merits of Christ alone received by faith, and not by our owne workes or merits: and consequently, that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by faith is the onely meritorious cause of our salvation.</p>

necessarily be present with saving faith (which hee confesseth wee doe hold) how can it be supposed without implying a contradiction, that it can save, being not onely destitute of all good workes, but also accompanied with all maner of sinne: this is sufficient to overthrowe his whole dispute. Secondly, I deny the consequence of his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. For justifieing and saving faith, though it justifie and save alone, yet it never is nor can be alone. Even as the eye in respect of his being, cannot (if it be a true living eye) be alone, severed from other parts of the body: yet in respect of the act of seeing, unto which no other part doth concurre, it seeth alone. Even so faith, which is the spirituall eye of the soule, in respect of its being, cannot (if it be a true lively faith) be alone, severed from the other graces, which are with it fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members of sanctification: but yet in respect of the Act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying and saving, unto which no other graces concurre with it as any causes therof, it justifyeth and saveth alone; because it alone, and no other grace doth receive Christ unto justification and salvation. Thirdly, we do not say that the presence of good workes is necessary to salvation onely as they are the fruits and signes of faith: but also as necessary forerunners, <hi>as causa sine qua non,</hi> as the way to salvation; and as the evidence, according to which the sentence shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. Which consideration disproveth the proofe of his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: which is, that according to our doctrine good workes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the act of saving onely by accident, whose presence addeth nothing to the virtue of faith in justifying and saving, and so their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence detracteth nothing from it, and therefore being taken away, faith never the lesse saveth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Things whose presence is necessary, cannot be said to bee present by accident. For such may be present or absent; but that which is necessary cannot be otherwise, the thing being safe. But we hold the presence of workes not to be contingent, but necessary; both in respect of salvation, as the way to it, and as <hi>Causa sine qua non;</hi> and of faith, as the unseparable fruits of it, without which it is said to be dead. For what will it profit a man, saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Iam. 214.</note> if hee shall say, that hee hath faith, and hath not workes, will that faith save him? For as the body without the Spirit is dead, <note n="z" place="margin">Iam. 2. 26.</note> so that faith, which is in profession onely, and is without workes is dead.</p>
               <p>§. XVII. But this reason of his hee doth illustrate by two unlike<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his unlike likenes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> similitudes. For, saith hee <hi>even as fire, because by its heat alone it heateth, if from the fire were taken away all other qualityes, which are by accident joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with heat, it would still without doubt heat. And as a father, because by the onely relation of paternity hee hath reference to his sonne, if from him, who is a father, all other attributes were removed, as knowledgen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:22501:247"/>
                  <hi>be saved, although hee have no good workes, and have many ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In the former similitude hee compareth a Christian man to fire, faith to heat, and other graces and good workes to such other qualityes as in fire by accident concurre with heat. In which simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude nothing is like. For neither doth a Christian man justifie or save others by faith, as fire by his heat doth heat other things, neither is hee justified or saved by his faith, as it is a quality inherent, but as it is the hand to receive Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> neither are other graces or duetyes of sanctification which wee call good workes, to be compared with, I know not what, accidentall qualityes concurring with heat; but to those unseparable qualityes of fire, <hi>viz,</hi> light and drynes. For even in the fire that is inflamed, there doe concurre necessarily with heat drynesse and light, neither were it a true fire without them: and yet the act of heating is to be ascribed to the heat of the fire properly, and not to the light or drynesse of the element: so in a true Christian that is justified, there doth concurre necessarily with faith, both other sanctifying graces answerable to the drynesse of the fire, and also the light of a Christian conversation, without which hee is not to be held a true Christian, or truely justified; and yet the act of justifying or saving is not to be ascribed, either to other graces, or to good workes, but onely to faith receiving Christ, or rather to Christ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by faith. In the other similitude he compareth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which faith hath to salvation, unto that relation with is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene father and sonne. But faith and salvation are no such relatives. Neither are the graces of the sanctification or good workes to be compared to those accidentall adjuncts attributed to a father, which may come and goe, as being not necessary to the being of a father; but rather to those properties of the humane nature, as reason, will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, wit &amp;c. For although a man cannot become a father without these: yet his being a father is not not to be ascribed to these.</p>
               <p>§. XVIII. And whereas hee would seeme to take away the answeare of his adversaties, (who alleage, <hi>that his supposition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,) both because in his first booke he had proved, that saith may truely and indeed be severed from charity and good workes: and also because at least in conceit, it may be severed from them; which he saith is sufficient for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of an hypotheticall pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>position: neither can his adversaries deny it, who teach thah faith and workes have that relation, which is betweene the cause and the effect:</hi> Hereunto I reply First, that I have formerly not onely answered his arguments which hee produced to this purpose; <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 6. Cap. 2. &amp; 3.</note> but also proved by unanswereable arguments that true justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith cannot be severed from charity and good workes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I said even nowe, his supposition implyeth a contradiction, and therefore is impossible. Impossible, I say, that workes being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to bee present <hi>necessitate presentiae,</hi> should in the same speech be truely supposed to be absent. Thirdly, If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can conceive, that true justifying and saving faith may be without charity and good
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:22501:247"/>
workes, then hee may also conceive, that that faith may save which is severed from charity, and destitute of good workes.</p>
               <p>His assumption I grant: for wee teach, according to the Scriptures, that that faith, which is alone severed from charity and good works, doth justify or save, neither alone nor at all, and doe ascribe lesse to such a faith, than the Papists themselves doe. But his conclusion is faulty, as contayning more than can be inferred upon the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: that good workes are necessary not onely in regard of presence, but also of some Efficiencie, which was not so much as mentioned in the antecedent of the proposition, which the conclusion should gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, and say no more. Thus much of the necessity of good workes.</p>

Hee had in the first booke propounded five principall arguments to prove that faith doth not justifie alone. The Fifth and last was, that good workes also doe justifie, and therefore not faith alone. This assertion hee laboureth to prove by divers arguments. The first from the necessity of good workes, which I have answeared. The second from the verity of the justice of workes, namely that the good workes of the faithfull and regenerate are truely good, which wee doe not deny, wee say indeed, that the seeming good workes of men unregenerate are not truely good: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit. But the good workes of the regenerate, being the workes of grace, and the fruits of the Spirit, wee acknowledge to be truely good. But will it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followe, that therfore they are, or may be justified by workes? Nothing lesse. Hee must prove that the workes of the regenerate are not onely truely good, but also purely and perfectly good, and not onely that, but that they are also perpetually and universally good. For if they faile in any one particular (as in <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note> many things we, saith <hi>Iames</hi> the just, offend all) they cannot be justified by their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:22501:248"/>
he hath not continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them. unlesse therfore he can prove, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some, but all the workes of the faithfull are not onely truely, but also purely and perfectly good (which is impossible to be proved) he cannot possibly conclude, that they are justified by them: will you then know, to what end serveth this discourse? The subtile Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, because hee would seeme to have the better end of the staffe, chooseth rather to confute our pretended errours, than to defend his owne.</p>
               <p>§. II. But indeed this whole dispute is defensive: serving to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is indeed defensive.</note> a piece of one of our arguments against justification by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse: because our obedience is neither totall, nor perfect, nor perpetuall. Not totall, because wee neither doe nor can fulfill the whole Law of God. Not perfect, nor pure, because it is stayned with the flesh. Not perpetuall, because interrupted, either by omission of duetyes or commission of sinnes. To the two former <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, (the third being unanswerable) and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the contrary assertions; setting downe the state of the question thus: <hi>Whether men justified may by the helpe of Gods grace so fulfill the Law of God, that their workes are not onely not to be called sinnes, but also deserve truely and properly to be called just.</hi> But this question commeth short of that which hee ought to prove, in two respects. For first if the just, meaning all the just, are justified by their workes, hee must proove that not onely some choice men may by the speciall help of Gods grace fulfill the Law, but that all doe; or else hee must confesse that they are not justified by their obedience. Neither is it sufficient, that their workes be not sinnes or truely just, unlesse their workes, not some, but all, be not onely truely, but also purely good. But of this question so propounded by him, he saith that we (whom hee calleth heretickes) hold the negative; The Papists (who are no heretikes) hold the affirmative; whose assertion hee setteth downe in three articles.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, that the Law of God to just men is absolutely possible, not indeed by the onely strength of nature, but by the help of divine grace.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That the workes of the righteous are simply, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely just, and after their maner prefect.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, That a man is truely justified by workes. Thus you see how, as it were by chance, hee stumbleth upon the maine question (where unto his whole dispute ought to be referred) bringing it in as a proofe of the verity of the justice of good workes; wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> by it selfought to be either proved or defended, otherwise all this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the verity of good workes is impertinent. These three he saith hee will prove in order. And in all three I must have the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to followe him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>§. III. And first of the possibility or impossibility of fulfilling the Law. Concerning which, what wee doe hold, may appeare by
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:22501:248"/>
these distinctions, for first, wee doe not hold, that it is absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible:<note place="margin">Whether the faithfull doe or can fulfill the Law.</note> for God, if it so please him, can enable man perfectly to fulfill the Law, as hee did in our first creation, and as hee will doe at our full redemption. But in this estate, since the fall, to a man living in the flesh, it is not possible. And thus<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Augustine,</hi> if the question bee whether God bee able to make a man to live without sinne, doth freely confesse it, but if the question bee, whether God ever enabled any man to be without sinne, that he denyeth. The second distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concerning the regenerate and the unregenerate. For unto the unregenerate being fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> the Law through their owne fault is impossible. But the regenerate may bee said to keepe the whole Law, and that in three respects. First, in regard of their faith: for hee ithat truely beleeveth in Christ hath fulfilled the Law: <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> for Christ is <gap reason="foreign">

The like hath <hi>Sedulius,</hi> that faith standeth for the perfection of the whole law, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. Secondly, in respect of our new obedience. Thirdly, in respect of Gods acceptation, accepting of our syncere, though weake endevour, and pardoning our defectivenesse therein; which being forgiven, our obedience is reputed, as if wee had performed all. For as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,<note n="h" place="margin">Retract. Lib. i. cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Omnia ergo mandata facta deputantur, quando quicquid non fit, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitur.</hi> All the Commandements are esteemed as done, when that which is not done, is pardoned. But the question is properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of our new obedience, in regard whereof another distinction is to bee acknowledged, betweene the keeping or observing of the law, and the fulfilling of it; which the Papists feeme to confound. For all the faithfull by their new obedience keepe the law according to the measure<note n="i" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 7.</note> of grace received; but none fulfill it. Their new obedience consisting <hi>In studio pretatis &amp; justitia,</hi> in the study of piety and righteousnesse, whereby they are studious of good workes. This study standeth in a syneere desire, an unfained purpose, an upright endevour to walke in the obedience of all Gods Commandements.

               <p>§. IV. But that the law is possible to the faithfull, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoureth to prove, by Scriptures, Fathers, and Reason. Out of the Scriptures he produceth three sorts of testimonies: the first of these, <hi>Which testifie that the law is not onely possible, but also easie:</hi> as first, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 30. For my yoke is easie, and my burden light. Secondly, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 3. And his Commandements are not grievous. To the former I answere; that by the yoke and burden of Christ wee are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the yoke of the law exacting perfect obedience to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us unto justification, or for default thereof subjecting us to the curse; for this was the chiefe yoke of bondage which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. From which our Saviour hath<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> made us free: but by the yoke and burden of Christ we are to understand his Law and Doctrine evangelicall, which may bee reduced to two Heads, the Law and Doctrine of faith, the Law and Doctrine of obedience, and that twofold, the obedience of his precepts, which is called our new obedience, and <hi>Obedientia cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> which is the taking up and bearing our crosse. The law of faith resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cteth our justification; the Doctrine of our new obedience, respecteth our sanctification; the obedience of the Crosse is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian patience or <hi>Tolerantia crucis.</hi> And these yokes or burdens Christ is it seemeth, would have men comming unto him to take upon them, by learning of him (which argueth, that by them Christs Doctrine or Discipline is meant) that they might bee eased from those yokes under which they labour, and those burdens under which they are wearied. And these are of two sorts, the guilt of sinne which is a most heavie yoke or burden under which the guilty conscience la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth: and the corruption of sin wherewith men being overladen are wearyed. From the former men are freed in their justification by the law of faith, which is easie and light, Christ having taken our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon him. For even as the Israelites in the wildernesse, when they were bitten by the fiery serpents, had no greater burden or taske laid upon them than to lift up their eyes towards the Brasen Serpent, and were cured:<note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 4, 5.</note> Even so wee, when wee are stung by the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and labour under the guilt of sinne, and desire to bee eased or
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:22501:250"/>
cured thereof: this charge our Saviour layeth upon us, to lift up the eye<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 40.</note> of faith to him that was figured by the brasen Serpent, and wee shall finde rest unto our soules. From the second men are freed in their san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by Christs Law or doctrine of obedience both active and passive. The active is our new obedience, whereof as of sanctification there are two parts: mortification, whereby we dye to sinne, and our vivification wherby we live to God, both which the Doctrine of Christ doth teach. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. The grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all, teaching us, that we should renounce all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wordly lusts (there is mortification) and that wee should live soberly, and justly, and holily in this present world, there is our vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 24. Those that have learned Christ have been taught to be put off the old man and to put on the new.</p>
               <p>§. V. This yoake also is easie to the faithfull, and this burden light.<note place="margin">Christs yoke easie in respect of our new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> First, because the faithfull being freed from the terrour and coaction of the Law are enabled to obey God with willing minds, as not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but under grace. Secondly, because as the Lord promised in the Covenant of grace, which is the doctrine of the Gospell, to give grace to the heires of promise, wherby they are enabled to serve him, with upright hearts and with willing and constant minds: so doth he assist them with his grace making them both able and willing to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because the new obedience required of us doth not consist in the perfect performance, which the Lord doth not expect from such weakenesse as is in the best of us, but in the sincere and upright desire, purpose, and endeavour to walke in obedience, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of grace received.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because our unperfect obedience is accepted of God in Christ, and the wants thereof pardoned by the intercession of Christ, who with the odours<note n="p" place="margin">Apoc. 8. 4.</note> of his own sacrifice perfumeth the incense of our prayers and of other duties making them acceptable unto God. And this was figured by that ceremony of the golden<note n="q" place="margin">

               <p>Fifthly, because if through humane frailty, the flesh prevailing against the Spirit, the faithfull doe at any time offend, as in many things we all doe: we have an Advocate with the Father, Christ Iesus the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and he is the propitiation for our sinnes, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 2.

If the former, then,</hi> saith hee, <hi>it ceasseth to be a Law. For it is no Law which doth not binde. If the latter, then it is a hard y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ake and a heavy burden which cannot be borne.</hi> To the former I answere, that remission is of guilt contracted, and therefore it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly surmised, that there should be remission where was no guilt. To the latter: that according to the Law of faith the guilt contracted is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the faithfull returning unto God, confessing their sinne, and craving pardon in the name and mediation of Christ. Which proveth the Law of workes to bee an hard yoake and heavie burden: but the Law of faith to be easie and light. For by the Law of workes the guilt is contracted, and by the Law of faith it is remitted.</p>

               <p>Secondly, because affliction worketh patience, and patience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and probation hope, and hope of eternall glory makethus to swallow all the difficulties of this life, and with patience and comfort to beare afflictions, yea to rejoyce and to triumph in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. &amp; 8. 37.

So that this is the meaning, to him that loveth God, the Commandements of God are not grievous, but he delighteth in them according to the inner Man, yeelding voluntary and cheerefull obedience thereto, not in perfection, but according to the measure of grace received. For when the Love of God is shed<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> abroad in our hearts by the Spirit of God assuring us in some measure of Gods love towards us, then are our hearts enlarged to love God againe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enlarged<note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>Of this sort he citeth three testimonies, the first, concerning the Love of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 23. If a man love me, he will keepe my word.

From hence he argueth thus: <hi>They that are able to love God and their neighbour, are also able to fulfill the Law: the faithfull are able to love God and their neighbour, therefore they are able to fulfill the Law.</hi> The proposition hee proveth by these three testimonies of Scripture. The assumption, thus. <hi>If we cannot love God and our neighbour then can wee not be the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or friends of Christ, but it is absurd to say, that none can be the disciples or friends of Christ: therefore we are able to love God and our neighbour.</hi> The proposition of this prosyllogisme he proveth out of, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 35. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>you shall be my friends if you doe the things that I command you. Now the thing which he did command was, that they should love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> To this long discourse a short answere may suffice: we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that all they who love God and their neighbour doe keepe Gods

commandements according to the measure of their love: but wee deny, that any can fulfill the Law of God, who have not a full and perfect love, and that to the perfection of love, such as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, none can attaine in this life. For our knowledge is but in part, therefore our love: our regeneration is but in part (wee being but partly spirituall and partly carnall,) and therefore our love.

For there doth not remaine in us any thing which may be added <hi>ad totum</hi> to that which is all; for if any thing remaine which might bee added, then it is not <hi>totum</hi> all.

               <p>But it is strange, that he should alleage the example of S. <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 7. as one that had kept the Commandement forbidding concupiscence: when in that chapter hee doth not onely confesse, that by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 7, 8.</note> hee was convicted to bee a sinner, in that hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence: but also that that habituall concupiscence might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare exceedingly sinnefull, it did take occasion by the Law to worke in him all manner of actuall concupiscence.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. But <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit is, that concupiscence in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">Whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence in the Apostle were a sinne.</note> 
                  <hi>was no sinne, because he did not consent to it.</hi> Whereto I answere, first, that as he was carnall <note n="b" place="margin">

for so hee saith: I delight in the Law of God after the inward man; <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> but I see another Law in my members warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of sin which is in my members. Whereupon he cryeth out, <hi>v.</hi> 24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? meaning therby the flesh, or the body of sin. Secondly, though the Apostle had not consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to concupiscence, yet both the habituall concupiscence it self remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him after his regeneration, and the actual concupiscences going before co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arising from thence, were sins. The habituall is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apostle a sin, and is noted to be the sinning sin, which taking occasion by the Law to send forth evill concupiscences (namely which the Law forbiddeth) was exceedingly sinfull. As for those <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or first motions of sinne in the thought or affections going before consent, and arising from our owne concupiscence: they are those very sinnes which are directly forbidden in the tenth Commandement, for those which are joyned <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 5. 28.</note> with consent, are forbidden in the former Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither could <hi>Paul,</hi> who had beene trayned up in the Law, bee ignorant of that which the very heathen knew by the light of nature, that evill concupiscence, accompanyed with consent, was a sinne. But that which is forbidden in the tenth commandement, the Apostle had not knowne to bee a sinne, except the Law had said, thou shalt not lust, or thou shalt not have any evill concupiscence.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludeth, that <hi>because the Law hath beene kept by many, it is possible.</hi> Neither doe we deny it to bee kept by the faithfull, in respect of their upright walking in all the Commandements of God, but wee deny it to be perfectly fulfilled by them. Their new obedience which they performe with upright hearts and willing mindes, hath the title of perfection given unto it, and is a perfection begunne in respect of the parts (for even an infant that is formed in the wombe is perfect in respect of his parts) and is accepted of God in Christ, the Lord not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to the faithfull their imperfections.

                  </gap>, that is a sinne. But that which is besides the Law is not conformable unto it; therefore it is a sinne, and a transgression of the Law, which whosoever committeth, hee doth not fulfill the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Things forbidden in the Law are against the Law. Those, which they call veniall sinnes, are forbidden in the Law.

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 19. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>if thou wilt be perfect, goe and sell all that thou hast, &amp;c.</hi> The second of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who saith, <note n="b" place="margin">De panit. hom 8.</note> 
                  <hi>that many exceed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> The third of <hi>Augustine,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">De verbis Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoli serm. 18.</note> who saith, <hi>no great burden is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon Virgins: greater love hath imposed a greater weight. As if they should say, what dost thou command? that we should not bee adultresses? Is this that, which thou commandest? In love to thee we doe more than thou commandest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere by distinction. For when he saith a man may doe more than is commanded; that <hi>more</hi> may be understood either <hi>extensivè,</hi> to things not commanded at all; or <hi>inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>sivè,</hi> in respect of things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but done in greater perfection, than is commanded. And thus he meaneth either some speciall Commandement, or the whole Law. If he meane the whole Law, I deny the antecedent. For I have proved that no mortall man is able to fulfill the whole Law, and much lesse to doe more. The Law of God is a perfect rule of righteousnesse, unto which nothing can or ought <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2: <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 6.</note> to bee added. And to him that goeth about to adde to Gods Law God will adde <note n="e" place="margin">Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:22501:259"/>
hee addeth nothing but will-worship and sinne. And to such it will be said, Who required these things at your hands? Neither is that obedience to God, which God hath not required. And this is the case of all the religious Orders among the Papists, who professe greater perfection, than God hath required: the severall Religions being so many by-wayes misleading them from that way, which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to heaven. And this overthroweth all their superarrogant workes of supererogation. For there can bee no workes of supererogation over and above the Law, unlesse first the whole Law be fulfilled, and then more bee added thereunto. Neither of which can bee done. If hee meane either things not commanded, or the duties of any one speciall Commandement, then I deny the consequence. For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things not commanded; it is manifest, that they who are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to will-worship, doe many things not commanded, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding neglect the things commanded, making the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God of none effect <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 15. 6.</note> through their traditions. And this is the condition of all popish Votarles, who though they should fully observe the rules of their severall Orders, yet would bee very farre from fulfilling the whole Law of God. If hee meane some speciall Commandement, as by his proofes it seemeth hee doth, then also I deny the consequence. For though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> man should doe more than is required in some speciall Commandement; yet hee would bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in respect of others: and hee that faileth in any, is guilty of all.</p>
               <p>§. II. But I suppose it would be hard for any Papist to shew, that<note place="margin">Whether in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny morall due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more can be well performed than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> in respect of any necessary morall duety more can bee laudably performed, than is by duety required. For whatsoever can be done, it is either commanded of God, or forbidden, or neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor forbidden. If it be forbidden, it is evill, and not to be done. If it bee commanded, it cannot bee done in greater perfection, than God in his Law doth require it to be done. If it be neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor forbidden, then it is in it owne nature indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But because our liberty is not a loose licentiousnesse, but a true liberty, bounded with the Lawes of piety and charity; therefore we are so to use or forbeare the use of these things, as that therein wee doe not offend against either piety or charity. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee shall use these things as meanes or helpes to performe the dueties either of piety or charity, or refuse them as impediments to either, having either in the using or refusing respect to the glory of God, to the good of our selves or of our brethren: wee shall doe more than is commanded in respect of the particular thing it selfe, which is simply neither commanded nor forbidden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not more in respect of the generall lawes of piety and charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as they command us to love God with all our soules, and our neighbour as our selves, and forbid the contrary vices: so they command all the meanes and helpes which may bee used for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

duties of piety and charity, and forbid both all impediments of the dueties commanded, and also all provocations to the evils forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Now in these things which are neither simply commanded nor forbidden, counsels have place, either for the using or refusing of them, as shall bee most for Gods glory, the benefit of our brethren, and our owne spirituall good: which counsels as it is a vertue to obey, so to disobey them is a sinne: and consequently the observer of them doth no more than hee ought to doe. And therefore the Papists whiles they enjoyne the observation of the counsels onely to them who would seeme to live in a state of perfection, they teach all others to sinne by disobeying them, as not being tyed to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them. As for example, not to sweare in ordinary commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, not to revenge, nor to resist evill, to blesse them that curse us, to pray for them that persecute us, and many such like, among which they reckon the eigth beatitudes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which a good part of the power of Religion consisteth. So that to sweare ordinarily in common talke, to seeke private revenge and such like are no sinnes with the Papists.</p>
               <p>§. III. But let us come to his proofes. The first whereof is, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His first proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But it is evident by that which before I have said, that this was not a precept or counsell given to all, that would aspire towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is the duety and property of all true Christians) but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of triall directed in speciall to that rich Iustitiary, to discover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his owne imperfection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. Or if it had been but a counsell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the popish co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ruction, given to one that had already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all the Comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ements (which no man can bee said to have fulfilled untill he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ave fulfilled his course) then had it been no sinne for him not to obey this counsell, nor any hinderance to his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For having fulfilled all the Commandements, as the Papists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, he might enter into life, though he did not this, which here hee is advised unto. But he sinned in disobeying this precept of triall; which if he had obeyed, hee had done no more than in duety he was bound to doe, having received a speciall Commandement to that purpose. Neither had hee fulfilled those Commandements, which hee saith hee had kept from his youth, otherwise than accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the interpretation of the Scribes and Pharisees; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently according to their righteousnesse, which whosoever doth not <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5: 20.</note> exceed shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven, and much lesse had he fulfilled all the Commandements of God. For by diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying this Commandement of Christ, he plainely bewrayed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a transgressour of the first and last Commandements: yea, that he did not truely affect and prize his owne salvation, but being a meere worldling preferred the love of his pelfe to the love of God, and desired rather to enjoy his worldly wealth for a short time, than to obtaine and for ever to enjoy the heavenly treasures, which Christ
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:22501:261"/>
promised him, if hee would follow Him. And for this his sinne in disobeying Christ his entrance into heaven was hindered. Insomuch that of him, and all such as he was, our Saviour giveth this <note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 19 24.</note> censure, that it is easier for a Camell to goe through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man (that setteth his heart upon riches, as this man did) to enter into the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>§. IV. As for their counsell and vow of voluntary poverty:<note place="margin">Counsell of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> though I will not insist thereupon, it being another controversie: yet thus much briefly will I say. First, that it hath no ground in the Scriptures; and therefore being obtruded as a matter of Religion, it is meere will-worship, which is neither acceptable to God, nor availeable to themselves. Secondly, as it is practised among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists it is nothing worth, being done neither out of the love of God, nor of their neighbour: but out of a Pharisaicall conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their works of supererogation to make God their debtour. For as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, If I should bestow all my goods to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eed the poore, and have not charity, it would profit me nothing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. Thirdly, it is repugnant to the Scriptures and namely to the eigth, the fifth and second Commandement. In the eigth Commandement (as I could shew) there is required a moderate desire of temporall blessings, avoiding the contrary extremes of cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing too much, or of affecting voluntary poverty. And accordingly wee are to frame our prayers and our practice. Our prayer, as our Saviour <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 11: <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 3.</note> hath taught us to begge of God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, that portion of temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, which God in his wisedome doth know to bee expedient for us, that is, as <hi>Agur</hi> prayeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30, 8. Give mee neither poverty (or beggary as the Latine rendreth it) nor riches; feed mee with food convenient for me. Where <hi>Lechem ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>qqi</hi> is the very same with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Our practice, not to live idlely upon the sweat of other mens browes, as Friars mendicants and other lusty beggars doe; but every mans duety is, to worke with his hands the thing that is <note n="k" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 28.</note> good, that is, to earne his living by the lawfull workes of his lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not onely that hee may eate his owne bread, which our Saviour teacheth us to begge of God, and the Apostle, to labour for, that we may eat our owne bread, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 12. And the Psalmist promiseth as a blessing to him that feareth God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 128. 2. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine owne hands: but also that hee may have to give to others, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 28. Therefore the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 34, 35. exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the faithfull, by labouring in their lawfull callings, to support the impotent, and to remember the words of our Lord Iesus, for though the Papists esteeme them to live in a state of perfection who live in voluntary beggary; yet our Saviour was wont to say, it is a more blessed thing to give than to receive. And therefore a more blessed estate it is to be able to give, than to live upon the almes of others.</p>
               <p>The fifth Commandement teacheth us to honour our private and our publike parents in the Church and common wealth, and the common mother of us all, that is, our Country: all which we are to
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:22501:262"/>
honour with our service and with our goods as occasion is offered, and need requireth; and not to behave our selves, as if we were borne for our selves alone, neglecting others whom we ought to honour. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this their counsell the Papists teach men (especially when they take young men or women into their Cloisters against the liking of their parents) to breake the Commandement of God as the<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 4, 5, 6.</note> Pharisees did. Neither can they truely say, that they helpe others with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> for their devotions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are superstitious and Idolatrous: or if they were good, they needed not to goe into a Cloister to performe them, which might and ought to be afforded in a lawfull calling.</p>
               <p>The second Commandement under that one kind, of making to our<note n="m" place="margin">Non facias tibi.</note> selves images, forbiddeth willworship aud all devised meanes of Gods worship<note n="n" place="margin">Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 22, 23.</note> according to the doctrine and inventions of men: as all the religions of those manifold orders among the Papists, are willworship and superstition. And under that one kind of worshipping of Images or of God by them he condemneth all false and counterfeit worship, and namely hypocrisie, but the seeming poverty of popish votaries is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall. For under the profession of voluntary poverty they live in all ease and aboundance. For although the severall Monks and Fryers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that they have nothing in their owne proper possession, yet they are rich in the common possessions of their Monastaries, which being many times very large are imployed for the maintenance of them. So that a carnal man who maketh no conscience of living incontinently in single life, and maketh account that he was borne for himself alone, hath reason to choose this monasticall life above all others, as most likely to give contentment to his idle and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rnall disposition. Now then to obtrude this vowed poverty, which as it hath no ground in the scriptures, so it is repugnant therunto in so many respects, as a matter not only of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also of satisfaction both for themselves and others, of merit, of perfection, of supererogation, is a thing to bee detested as most wicked and Antichristian.</p>
               <p>§. V. As for his other testimonies: it is plaine, that <hi>Chrysostome</hi>

But though a man were able to doe more than that one Commandement requireth: yet it would not follow, that hee were therefore able to doe more than the whole Law requireth. But indeed in respect of that one Commandement more cannot bee done lawfully, than that Commandement prescribeth: or if more should be done, it would not be done in obedience to that Commandement. Indeed if you respect onely the outward letter of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Fathers did, it being a prohibition of the externall act of adultery: it cannot be denyed, but that all, who are not adulterers, have fulfilled that Commandement. But if these two things be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered: first, that the Law is<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> spirituall, and therefore forbiddeth not onely the outward act of adultery, but all uncleannenesse whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ust after her, hath broken this Commandement:
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:22501:262"/>
and secondly, that this Commandement, as all the rest, hath two parts, the negative forbidding all uncleannenesse, the affirmative, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all<note n="q" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.</note> chastity both outward, and also inward, which is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or cleannenesse of the soule from all the lusts of the flesh: it must be granted, that nothing can bee added to the perfection of chastity, which this Commandement prescribeth: <hi>Yea, but the chastity in single life is more than is commanded. For the Law forbiddeth women to be adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses: but they that follow this cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which is to observe chastity in that condition wherein wee live, whether it be in single life or in marriage. Indeed no where is it simply either commanded or forbidden to live, either in single life, or in wedlocke, it being in its owne nature a thing indifferent. But chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in both is absolutely required. For there is a chastity of wedlocke, as well as of single life: though the Papists most wickedly oppose wedlocke to chastity.

                  </gap> and this is
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:22501:263"/>
pure and perfect chastity, which we cannot attaine unto whiles wee are infected whith originall or habituall concupiscence, the other is called continencie, which is a virtue restrayning and repressing the concupiscences of the flesh, which <note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> warre against our soules maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a continuall warfare against them. To this, those who have the gift of continencie in some measure attaine; but notwithstanding come farre short of that purity, which the Law of God requireth.</p>
               <p>§. VI. As for the vowed chastity among the Papists: it is so<note place="margin">The vowed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life among the Papists a sinfull state.</note> farre from being a state of perfection, or supererogation, as that it is, for the most part, a sinnefull state, and that in three respects. First, in respect of making the vow. For it is sinne to vow that, which a man doth not know to be lawfull, or not in his owne power, then doth hee sinne with an high hand, not onely resolving, but also vowing to sinne, and to continue therein. Secondly, in respect of the performing the vow, when the thing vowed, <hi>viz.</hi> continencie in single life, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not to be in their power, and yet to performe their vow of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, live in incontinency and uncleanenesse. Many times it falleth out, that a man at the first doth not know the thing vowed to be either not lawfull, or not in his power: yet because he doth not know it to be lawfull and in his power, he sinneth by rash vowing: but when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it doth appeare to be, either unlawfull, or not in his power, he is not bound to keepe that vow, which rashly he made, but hee is bound to breake it: for by performing it he addeth sinne to sinne, and many times a greater sinne to a lesse, that is to the rashnesse of his vow, the incontinencie of his life. And this is perpetuall among the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish votaries, who never dissolve their vow, though the performance of it bee never so wicked. Thirdly, because the vowed single life among the Papists being for the most part so filthy and abominable, that all the world cryeth shame upon them for their filthinesse: yet by them is obtruded unto God, as a matter not onely of religion, and satisfaction, but also of merit, of perfection, and supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And the like might be said of their vow of blinde obedience. For simple and absolute obedience is onely to bee vowed and performed to God. But to vow the like towards any sinfull man, who either doth, or at least may command that which is unlawfull, as sometimes they doe, to murther Princes, or to attempt other traiterous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp;c. and to thinke that in so doing he doth merit and supererogate, it is to forsake God.</p>
               <p>§. VII. His second reason: <hi>If the Commandements were impossible, they would binde no man. And so the precepts should bee no precepts: for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>it cannot bee imagined, how any man should sinne in that which hee cannot avoid, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>His reason is thus to be framed,</l>
                  <l>To that which is impossible no man is tyed:</l>
                  <l>To the Commandements all men are tyed:</l>
                  <l>Therefore the Commandements are not impossible.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:22501:263"/>The assumption, which no man denyeth, he proveth, because <hi>if they did not binde, they were no precepts, neither were the transgression of them a sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition he proveth, because it cannot bee imagined how a man should sinne in that which he cannot avoid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I answere,</hi> as heretofore, by distinction. That the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are said to be impossible, either simply, or by accident. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning of his conclusion be, that the Commandements bee not simply and absolutely impossible, then I grant all, for wee never held that the Commandements are simply impossible: for to man, both before his fall, and after his resurrection, they were and shall be absolutely possible. But since the fall they are impossible in respect of the perfect performance in and by our selves, not simply, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the flesh, that is to say, through our owne default. For if wee would not have sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> the Law had beene possible unto us: but by our voluntary sinne we lost both <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> possibilitatis,</hi> and also <hi>possibilitatem non peccand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Now it were absurd to imagine, that our fault should free us from obedience. Howbeit, even after the fall there is a distinction to be held betweene men unregenerate in the corrupt state of nature, and the regenerate in the state of grace. To the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate the Law is impossible through their owne default, which doth not lessen their sinne: for they sinne voluntarily and many times of malice, as the devils also doe: who though they have brought upon themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es a necessity of sinning, so that they can doe no other but sinne: yet this doth not, as I said, extenuate their sinne (for they commit sinne with greedinesse) but rather aggravate their finfulnesse. Those that are habituated in sinne, in whom custome is become as it were another nature, they can no more of themselves ceasse from sinning, than a Black-moore can wash away his blackenesse, <hi>Ier. 13. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. VIII. Yea, but saith <hi>Bellarmine, It cannot bee imagined, how a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s that a man doth not sinne in that which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid.</note> 
                  <hi>man should sinne in that, which hee cannot avoid. Answ.</hi> That seemeth to be true in respect of the liberty of contradiction, but not in respect of the liberty of contrariety. In respect of a sinfull action a man hath liberty to doe it or not to doe it: which wee call the liberty of contradiction. But he hath not liberty to doe that which is good, his naturall will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him onely to sinne. So that although a naturall man may abstaine from this or that sinfull act: yet he sinneth in whatsoever he doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he doe any other but sinne. If therefore they doe not sin, who are not able to fulfill the Law, then all Infidels, yea all naturall men, who c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n doe nothing but sinne, should be exempted from sinning, which is absurd. To the regenerate man, as I said before, the Law is possible, both in respect of his faith. For he that truely beleeveth in Christ hath fulfilled the Law in Christ. Secondly, in regard of his new obedience: and that in three respects. For first, his new obedience, though it be not compleat; yet it is <hi>obedientia inchoata:</hi> and though it be not a fulfilling of the Law, yet it is an acceptable keeping thereof. Secondly, though it be unperfect, and stayned with the flesh, yet being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ntyre, that is, sincere
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:22501:264"/>
and upright, it is in Christ accepted as perfect. Thirdly, because the imperfection thereof being covered with Christs perfect obedience, and cured by his intercession, is remitted. Now all is esteemed done, when that which is not done, is remitted.</p>
               <p>§. IX. His third reason: <hi>If God should command things impossible, he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, God should be more cruell and more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish than any tyrant, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>should be more cruell</hi> (horresco referens) <hi>and more foolish than any tyrant: in exacting atribute from his owne friends, which none were able to pay, and making such Lawes, which he knew none were able to performe. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is blasphemous, therefore the antecedent.</hi> To the proposition I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere as before by distinction. That if God should command things simply impossible, there would besome colour for his blasphemous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. But the Lord commandeth nothing, but what to man in his first creation was absolutely possible: neither doth he exact any tribute which he did not make us able to pay, nor make any law which we were not able to observe. And although now wee cannot in our selves fulfill it; yet God was not tyed to accommodate his Law, like a <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule, to our weakenesse contracted by our owne default: but it became him, to propound such Lawes as were answerable to our first integrity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing what we were, and not what we are: that seeing from what wee are fallen, we might seeke to bee repaired in Christ, who is the end of the Law for righteousnesse to every one that beleeveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. The covenant of workes God made with man in his state of integrity, when he was able to keepe it. But after the fall, because it was not possible that man should performe that covenant in, and by himselfe, he in great mercie made with man the Covenant of grace in Christ. But lest any man should either through ignorance or pride neglect the benefit of the Messias: it pleased God to renew the Covenant of workes, not to that end that men should be justified or saved thereby, but that it might bee a meanes to drive them unto Christ. And fo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe hath taught<note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>De iustif. l</hi> 4. <hi>c,</hi> 4. §. <hi>Sextum discrimen.</hi>

               <p>Againe a distinction is to be made, as in the answere to the second reason, of the parties to whom the law is given. For to the wicked and reprobate, who are Gods rebellious subjects, the law is indeed impossible through their owne default: and yet God exacteth most justly that righteousnesse in which hee did create them: hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth most justly an accompt of those talents which hee committed to them, though now they be not able to pay. The debt is duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of the debtour, though through his own default hee bee not now able to make payment. As for the elect, whom the Lord hath, before they were, loved in Christ, hee hath given his law to them, not to this end, that either by the observation thereof in their own persons they should bee justified, or by the breach thereof they should bee condemned (for then who could be saved?) But the use of the law to them before their conversion is, that it might bee unto
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:22501:264"/>
them a Schoolmaster unto Christ: and after their conversion and justification, it might bee a rule whereby to frame their lives and conversation: aspiring alwaies towards that perfection which the law prescribeth, though they cannot fully attaine unto it. Why then, saith <hi>Augustine,</hi>

                  <note n="x" place="margin">InCantic serm. 50.</note> to be repeated againe and againe. Neither was the commander ignorant, that the weight of the commandement doth exceed the strength of men, but hee judged it profitable, that hereby they should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished of their owne unsufficiencie, and that they might know to what end (or perfection) of righteousnesse they should aspire. Therefore by commanding impossible things hee did not make men transgressors, but humble, that every mouth may bee stoppod<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 3. 19. 20.</note> and the whole world made obnoxious to God.

In the first it is said, that Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that the justification of the Law might be fulfilled in us. In the second, we are taught to pray, that Gods will may bee done upon earth, as it is in heaven. In the third, that Christ is made to all that obey him the cause of eternall salvation.

Whereby the law of the Spirit of life we understand the virtue and power of holynes or sanctification not in us, but in Christ Iesus, (for so hee saith, though they doe not observe it, who understand this place of sanctification and righteousnesse inherent) who by his righteousnesse and merits hath delivered us from the power of sinne and of death. But the Apostle, as in the former chapter <hi>vers.</hi> 24. so here in the singular number speaketh of himself, teaching by his owne example every true Christian to apply the benefits of Christ to himself. For that which was impossible for the law to doe, that is, to justifie us, in that it was weake through the flesh; God sending his owne sonne in the likenes of sinfull flesh, that is, in the humane nature subject to passions and infirmities, and that for sinne, that hee might take away the sinne of the world (for so saith <hi>

               <q>
                  <p>All that are truely justified have the holy Spirit, Rom. 5. 5. &amp; 8. 15. 1 Cor. 3. 16. Gal. 3. 2. Tit. 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all that are truely justified fulfill the Law.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The proposition hee proveth thus, <hi>Whosoever have the fruits of the Spirit, Gal. 5. they fulfill the Lawe: All that have the Spirit have the fruits of the Spirit: Therefore all that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit fulfill the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This second proposition hee proveth, because <hi>against those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the fruits of the Spirit, as charity, joy, peace, &amp;c. There is no Law, that is, the Law hath not whereof to accuse them, as the breakers thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whosoever is justified, by the helpe of the Spirit he fulfilleth the Law: and if he doe not fulfill the Law, then hath he not received the Spirit, neither is he truely justified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the proposition of the first syllogisme, I answere, that those who have received the Spirit doe keepe the Law. But none fulfill the Law, who have not the fulnesse of the Spirit; and none have the fulnesse of the Spirit, in whom the flesh remaineth lusting against the Spirit. In whom this conflict is, as it is in the best, They cannot doe the things that they would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. And much lesse can they fulfill the Law, from which they are so farre, as that the good things they would, they doe not; and the evill things which they would not, they doe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
               <p>And so to the proposition of the second syllogisme, that those who have the Spirit, have the fruits of the Spirit, but not without measure, nor in full measure, but according to the measure of the gift of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. Having received but the first fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23.</p>
               <p>As for his third prosyllogisme, that against such there is no <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 5. 23.</note> law, the meaning is not, that those which have the fruits of the Spirit doe never transgresse the law, for in many <note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note> things we offend all: but the words are to be understood, either of the fruites of the Spirit, that against such there is no law, but against the contrary fruites of the flesh: or of the persons indued with the fruites of the Spirit, and then the meaning is, either as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. That the law is not given to such: or as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18. That those who are led by the Spirit, are not under the law; that is, they are neither under the curse, not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the terrour and dominion of the law, as if they needed thereby to bee forced to obedience, but they are, as it were, a law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, willingly performing obedience to that which the law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth, according to the measure of grace received; not but that sometimes they faile, the flesh prevailing against the Spirit. Not under the curse, nor subject to the accusation and condemnation of
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:22501:266"/>
the Law, because in Christ, who hath freed them from the curse, their sinnes are forgiven. <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> Who then shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods children, seeing it is God that doth justifie, who shall condemne, seeing Christ who dyed for us, maketh also intercession for us. But this doth not prove, that therefore the faithfull sinne not. But this proveth, that when having sinned they confesse their sinnes, God is just to forgive them, because wee have an Advocate with the Father; Christ Iesus the righteous, and hee is the propitiation for our sinnes. In this forgivenesse of our sinnes, and Gods acceptation of us in Christ, and not in our obedience doth our justification consist. But he that fulfilleth the Law needeth not remission of sinnes, which all doe need. And therefore desperate is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conclusion, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is justified fulfilleth the Law; and whosoever doth not fulfill the Law (which no man doth) is not justified.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. And such also is his last argument, which may thus bee<note place="margin">His sixth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because the righteous sinne not.</note> framed.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whosoever sinneth not fulfilleth the Law.</l>
                  <l>Of every justified man it may be verified, that he sinneth not.</l>
                  <l>Therefore every justified man fulfilleth the Law.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The proposition he proveth, because he that sinneth not, doth not transgresse the Law: and he that doth not transgresse the Law, doth fulfill it.</p>
               <p>First, I answere to the proposition and the proofe thereof: that they are true, if understood of continued acts; as thus, hee that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, that is, that never sinneth: hee that transgresseth not the Law, that is, that never doth transgresse it, doth fulfill it. For none doe fulfill the Law but they who continue in all the things that are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them, which is duely to bee marked. For the Papists seeme to bee of this opinion, that by any one act of obedience, wherein a man sinneth not, hee doth fulfill the Law. And so they feare not to say, that every worke of charity doth absolutely merit eternall life; wherein they doe grievously erre; imagining, that as one act committed against charity doth absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserve damnation: so any one act proceeding from charity doth absolutely merit salvation. But who knoweth not, that the whole law of God is copulative, and so to bee understood. As therefore in a copulative proposition consisting of many, suppose twenty parts; if any one bee false, though all the rest be true, the whole propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is false, and to be denyed. So if a man should keepe all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and transgresse any one though it were but once, hee is a transgressor of the law, and is, as <note n="p" place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, guilty of all; and by the sentence of the law is subject to the curse, because he hath not <note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> continued in all the things which are written in the Booke of the law to doe them. Hee that would bee thought to fulfill the law, must not onely abstaine from all the things forbidden, but hee must also doe the things commanded, hee must doe all, hee must continue in doing all. And thus if the proposition and the proofe thereof bee
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:22501:267"/>
understood, he that sinneth not, he that transgresseth not the Law, that is, he that never sinneth, he that never transgresseth the Law doth fulfill it, are true, but otherwise they are false and to be denyed.</p>
               <p>§. XV. I come to the assumption, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth thus. <hi>Whosoever is regenerate and borne of God sinneth not.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The proposition he proveth out of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. Whosoever is borne of God sinneth not, neither can he sinne, because he is borne of God. Yet I will not answere him as he answereth us,<note n="r" place="margin">

                  </gap>, or doe not sinne at all, for to that erroneous sense both <hi>Iouin.</hi> and <hi>Pelag.</hi> did abuse that place, as <hi>Bellar.</hi> here doth: but his meaning may be explained out of his own words in the same Epistle, for as in the fifth chapter. <hi>v.</hi> 18. When he saith, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>everis borne of God sinneth not, he meaneth, as appeareth by the words going before, that he sinneth not unto death: that is committeth not that unpardonable sin, for which we are not to pray, <hi>v.</hi> 16. so here, when hee saith, whosoever is borne of God doth not commit sin, his meaning may be collected out of the next verse going before <hi>vers.</hi> 8. compared with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 34. he that is borne of God worketh not sinne, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for hee that worketh sinne, he that is a worker of iniquity, is of the Devill, as hee saith <hi>vers.</hi> 8. He that worketh sinne, saith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 34. is the servant of sinne, and therefore in him sinne reigneth. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fifth chapter when hee saith, he that is borne of God sinneth not, he meaneth, that he doth not so sinne as he had said <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>viz.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death: so here when it is said he cannot sinne, his meaning is in that manner, as a worker of iniquity, as the child of the Devill, as the servant of sinne, in whom sinne reigneth.

Now it may be expected that I should propound and mainetaine ours. But this taske I have already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in handling the third question of this controversie concerning the matter of our justification, where among many other arguments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that we are not justified by any righteousnes inherent in us, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, but onely by the righteousnesse of Christ which is out of us in him, we used this<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> for one. By what righteousnesse we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Law is satisfied: By Christs righteousnesse alone the Law is satisfied, and not by that which is inherent in us, or performed by us. And this assumption wee prove, because wee are not able to sati fie the Law, neither in respect of the Commandement, it being by reason of the flesh impossible unto us; nor in respect of the penalty, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be satisfied by us, but with endlesse torment. So that, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all this discourse of the possibilitie of the Law is nothing but a defence against a piece of one of our arguments.</p>
               <p>Now I should follow him to the second point, which hee propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">His discourse concerning the perfection of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But that our best righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is unperfect and stained with the flesh, I have fully proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and have answered all the arguments which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produceth here, in my fourth<note n="y" place="margin">

Here one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I signifie againe, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> falleth very short in his proofes: for where he should prove, that the workes of the faithfull are simply and absolutely just, and perfect: as hee propounded the question; hee now seemeth to prove this, that the good workes of the righteous are truely good, which we deny not.</p>
               <p>§. XVII. Yes but you Protestants, will they say, doe teach, that<note place="margin">Whether the best workes of the faithfull be sinnes.</note> the best workes of the faithfull are sinnes, &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> We doe not say that their good workes, as namely their prayer or their almes, &amp;c. are sinnes: but that in them, they being otherwise good, there are some imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and staines which are sinnes: in respect whereof the faithfull man in doing that, which is good, sinneth, according to that, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 20. We doe confesse that the duties which the faithfull performe are good workes, and so called in the Scriptures, though not purely and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good; but having their imperfections, and being stained with the flesh. Even as we call a man regenerated, a just or a good man, though he be not perfectly just, being partly flesh and partly spirit. Thus a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell wherein there is wax mixed with hony before it be clarified, is truly
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:22501:268"/>
called a vessell of hony, though not <hi>sinceri mellis,</hi> of pure or sincere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. A cup of wine wherein is a mixture of some water with wine, is truely called a cup of wine though not <hi>vini meraci,</hi> of pure wine. In like manner a wedge of gold, wherein there is some drosse, is truely called a wedge of gold, though not of pure gold. An heape of corne in the floore wherein there is perhaps as much chaffe as wheat, is truly called an heape of wheat. A field, wherein are tares and other weeds, as well as corne, is notwithstanding called a corne field, the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being taken from the better part. Verily, whiles we live in this world, we are as gold wherein there is much drosse, and never are fully refined untill wee are to bee translated into the celestiall house of God. Whiles we are in the Church militant, as it were in Gods floore, we are mingled with much chaffe, and are never perfectly cleansed from the chaffe of our corruptions, untill we are to be translated into the Lords Granaries. And such as wee are, such also are our actions: such as the tree is, such is the fruit. But if hee will prove that men are justified by their workes, hee must prove, not onely that they are truely good, but also purely and perfectly good: and not onely, that some of their workes are truely and purely good, but that all their workes are truely and perfectly, and not that onely, but also perpetually good. For if any of his workes bee sinnes, he cannot be justified by his workes. But this can never be proved. Neither doth hee goe about to prove that all the actions of justified men are good, but some onely, and these not purely, and perfectly, but truely good.

The Title of this Chapter is, that good workes are not onely just, but that also they doe justifie. In stead whereof he presently propoundeth this assertion to be proved, that by good workes a just man is more justified, and made more just. But this is not the Question. For we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that a man already justified before God, by the practise of good works increaseth in righteousnesse inherent, and is made more holy and just. The thing which we deny is this, that good workes doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with faith unto the act of iustification before God, as any cause thereof. Against this assertion he ought to have disputed, if he would seeme to contradict us. But he hath altered the question, because he is not able to mainetaine the contradictory of our assertion; and maketh the question to be this, whether by good workes men are justified, that is to say, made more just, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of righteousnesse inherent. But we deny, that there are any degrees of justification, or that a man may be more justified, or that justification doth ever signifie increase of righteousnesse: wee reject their new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found distinction of justification into the first and second, and acknowledge no other justification, but that, which in the Scriptures and Fathers is called the justification of a sinner: and thereby wee understand a continued act of God: who, as when we being sinners did first beleeve, did justifie us; so remaining sinners in our selves he doth still justifie us, by imputation of Christs righteousnesse, acquitting us from our sinnes, and accepting of us as righteous in Christ. And this justification, which is onely acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Scriptures and Fathers, is every where ascribed to faith. Whereas the first justification of the Papists is ascribed to charity as the onely forme; the second to workes, as to the merit thereof. But all this ariseth from their erroneous and wilfull confounding of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sanctification. For their first justification is that, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:22501:269"/>
call regeneration, and is the first act of Sanctification, by which we are habitually sanctified, for they make it to be nothing else, but the infusion of the habits of grace: Their second justification, is their actuall fanctification, or exercise of good workes, whereby their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse or sanctification is increased. But the question is not of sanctification, but of justification; which the Papists by their wicked doctrine, confounding it with sanctification, have wholly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, it being the maine benefit of the Messias, by which we are both freed from hell, and entitled to heaven. Neither is the question un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of justification before men, but before God. For before men we doe confess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. II. But let us examine his proofes; the first and principall is out<note place="margin">The place of <hi>Jam. 2. 14. &amp;c.</hi> fully discussed and cleared.</note> of <hi>Iames</hi> 2. which being the onely place of Scripture, whereupon with any shew of probability they ground their doctrine of justification by workes: I will not content my selfe to answere <hi>Bellarmines</hi> cavils alone: but I will endevour to stop the mouthes of all the Papists, who use to vaunt of this place, especially of the 24. verse; where they bragge, that their assertion is expressed, and ours confuted in plaine termes: <hi>yee see then that a man is justified by workes, and not by saith onely.</hi> Which words are a consectary or conclusion deduced from the example of <hi>Abraham:</hi> who though he were justified by faith without works as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth; yet was hee also justified by workes and not by faith onely, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> affirmeth.

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, but onely by faith: which no doubt was the Apostles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For as I have shewed heretofore, if this be a good disjunction, that we are justified either by faith, or by works; (that is, either by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of Christ which is out of us in him apprehended by faith or by the works of the Law, that is, by righteousnes inherent in our selves all which is prescribed in the Law) as undoubtedly it is; for a third thing cannot be named, whereby we might be justified, and by both we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; (for if by faith, then of grace; and if of grace, then not of works, and contrary wise <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5. 11. 6.) then it followeth necessarily, that if we are not justified by workes, we are justified by faith alone. Hence ariseth this great controversie between the true Catholiks and the Papists: we affirming, that we are justified by faith without works, or by faith alone; The Papists contending, that wee are justified by workes and not by faith only: we alleaging the authority of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles, to the <hi>

<pb n="531" facs="tcp:22501:269"/>
the seeming difference betweene the two Apostles. Some,<note place="margin">How it may be reconciled. a <hi>Erasm. Cajetan Musculus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> a when they were not able to untye this Gordian knot, have sought, with <hi>Alexander,</hi> to cut it, by questioning without just cause the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Epistle of Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> But the Papists and wee are thus farre agreed. First, as they doe not deny those Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which were never questioned; so we acknowledge this of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> though it hath beene questioned, to bee canonicall. Secondly, that the two Apostles, acted by the same Spirit of truth in penning their Epistles, could not possibly deliver contrary assertions: and consequently, that they onely are to bee esteemed to hold the truth, who fitly reconciling the seeming variance betweene the two Apostles, doe teach that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is agreeable to both. Here then I am to demonstrate, both against the Papists, and for our selves: against the Papists three things. First, that the doctrine which they ground upon this place of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> is contrary to that of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Secondly, that their expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> they make him contradict the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> Thirdly, that their doctrine cannot be grounded upon this Text. For our selves two things. First, that by our exposition the two Apostles are easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. Secondly, that the assertion of the two Apostles, according to our doctrine, not onely <hi>may</hi> well stand together, but also of necessity <hi>must</hi> goe together. For the first: wee have the same controversie with the Papists, as I have noted before, which the Apostle maintayned against the justiciaryes of his time. And their opposite doctrine to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which they would gladly father upon Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> standeth in those six maine errours, which I have plainely and fully confuted in this treatise. And namely in this particular; they affirming, that men are justified by workes, which the Apostle every were constantly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. To the second, whiles they understand the two Apostles to speake in the same sense, of faith, of workes, of justifying; as namely, that both speake of a true justifying faith; of workes, as causes of justification; of justifying, as making just by righteousnesse inherent: they make the one directly to contradict the other. For if <hi>Paul</hi> affirme, that men are justified by a true faith without workes, and <hi>Iames</hi> deny it: If <hi>Paul</hi> deny, that we are justified by workes, as the causes of justification, and <hi>Iames</hi> affirme it: If <hi>Paul</hi> deny, that wee are made just before God by workes, and <hi>Iames</hi> affirme it; how doe they not contradict one another?</p>
               <p>§. IV. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> hopeth to salve the matter with his new-found di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction<note place="margin">

                  </note> of the first and second justification: <hi>that Paul speaking of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, wherein a man of a sinner is made just, excludeth workes done by the strength of nature without faith and without grace: and that</hi> Iames <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the second justification, wherein a just man is made more just, saith, that by the workes of grace proceeding from faith a man is justified.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Such a distinction might be applyed to sanctification, which is partly habituall, the which they call their first justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="532" facs="tcp:22501:270"/>
fathers. Neither can any such distinction possibly bee applied to that justification, which the Scriptures teach, as I have showed <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 8. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. §. 5.</note> heretofore. Secondly, if there could be such a distinction, I would say, that Paul, when hee denyeth <hi>Abraham</hi> to have been justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by workes did speake of the second justification, wich <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth. For <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was said to be justified by faith without workes, did abound which workes, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, and yet was not justifyed by them. And that <hi>Iames</hi> when hee speaketh of <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot, whom hee affirmeth to have been justified by workes, speaketh of the first justification, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also affirmeth. If therefore <hi>Paul</hi> say, that in the first justification none are justified by workes, and <hi>Iames</hi> affirme that some are, as namely <hi>Rahab:</hi> If the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> say, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in his second j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>stification was justified by workes, and <hi>Paul</hi> doe as planiely deny it, how are they reconciled? Againe saith <hi>Bellarmine, Paul from justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation onely excludeth the workes done without grace;</hi> Iames <hi>includeth onely the workes of grace.</hi> I answeare, that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from justification <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes, which as else where <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 17.</note> hee testifieth, he wrought by faith: And <hi>Iames</hi> includeth the workes of <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot, which was done, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, without grace going before. Where I desire the reader to observe what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answeareth. As <hi>Paul,</hi> saith hee, <hi>when he did speake of the first justification, brought the example of Abraham, which was indeed of the second, that hee might prove, as it were</hi> à majori, <hi>from the greater, that a sinner cannot bee justified by workes done without faith, if righteous</hi> Abraham <hi>was not made more just by his workes done without faith: even so</hi> Iames, <hi>when hee did speake of the second justification, brought the example of</hi> Rahab, <hi>which is of the first justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hee might prove</hi> à majori, (hee should say <hi>à minori,</hi> if my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke faile me not) from the lesse, <hi>that a just man is made more just by his workes and not onely by faith, if</hi> Rahab <hi>of an harlot was made just by workes and not onely by faith. Answ.</hi> Thus then hee maketh the Apostles to argue. If <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes would not have justified him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, much lesse would the good workes of the wicked. And if <hi>Rahab</hi> by her worke of mercie was of an harlot made just: how much more shall the good workes of the righteous make them more just?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities noted.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. V. Where by the way you may note diverse absurdities, which I have partly touched before. First, that the Apostle forsooth bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Abraham</hi> as an example of justification by workes: when it is most evident, that hee bringeth him as an example of justification by imputation of righteousnesse without workes, and maketh his example the exemplar or patterne of all others, who in like maner are justified by faith without workes, or by imputation of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Paul</hi> produceth <hi>Abraham</hi> as an example to prove, that a just man is more justified by his workes; for which there is no colour <hi>praeter impudentiam asseverandi,</hi> the contrary is proved, that
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:22501:270"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the justification of a sinner applyeth, what hee saith, to <hi>Abraham.</hi> For hee proveth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by workes, because the Scripture saith, <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 4. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse. Now to him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but beleeveth on him that iustifieth the ungodly (which was <hi>Abrahams</hi> case) his faith is counted for righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apostle when he excludeth <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes from iustification, doth not exclude his good and gracious workes, but such as hee did, or might have done without grace, that is to say, gracelesse workes. But no doubt the Apostles intent in producing the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also hath observed; was this: If <hi>Abraham</hi> who did abound with so many notable works, which hee wrought by faith, was not iustified by them but onely by faith: then it is certaine, that none are iustified by workes, though their workes be never so gracious.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He supposeth, that gracious <hi>Abraham</hi> might have done good workes without grace, and that the Apostle denyeth him to have bene iustified by such workes, as hee might have done, but did not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, By an impudent devise, whereof there is no colour, hee maketh the Apostle from the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> to argue <hi>à ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jori.</hi> If <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes would not have iustified him, unlesse they had proceeded from faith: then much lesse can the workes of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and unregenerate men done without faith iustifie them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He shamefally inverteth the Apostles question, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth his whole disputation; As if the Apostle disputed this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether workes doe iustifie without faith (which hee doth never so much as mention;) and not, whether faith doth iustifie without workes, which is indeed the question.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Where hee saith; that the Apostle excludeth workes onely from their imaginary first iustification, which is meerely habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; hee conceiveth, that the Apostle tooke all these paines, to prove, that workes are no part of habituall righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Where hee saith, that the Apostle excludeth from iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication workes of nature and not of grace, it is as much as if hee should have said, that the Apostle doth so seriously labour to prove, that men are not justified by such workes as are not good, but evill.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it is evident, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from the act of justification all workes in ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>all, whether done before grace or after; of all men, whether unregenerate, or regenerate, even of <hi>Abraham</hi> himself. Yea more specially the workes of the faithfull and regenerate. First, Because he speaketh of good workes, even the workes of righteousnesse which wee (the faithfull) have done <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Secondly, The question being, whether faith doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie without workes, or whether faith and workes together; the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:22501:271"/>
Apostle must be understood to exclude those workes from the act of justification, which with faith concurre in the party justified. Even as <hi>Abraham,</hi> though his faith was accompanied with store of good works yet he was justified, and so are all the faithfull, by faith without works.</p>
               <p>If therefore St. <hi>Iames</hi> doe affirme, that men are justified in the same sence that <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth the same; and that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his workes, which <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth; he is made to contradict the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. VI. But as the Popish doctrine is repugnant to the doctrine of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> so neither can it bee grounded upon this text,<note place="margin">The Popish doctrine not grounded on <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.</note> which may appeare by a briefe Analysis thereof. Where first, you are to consider the occasion of this discourse, and thereupon the scope of the Apostle therein. The occasion was the dissolute life of many<note place="margin">The Analysis of that passage beginning at the foureteenth <hi>verse.</hi>
                  </note> Christians, who, as <hi>Iude</hi> speaketh <hi>vers.</hi> 4. did turne the grace of God into wantonnes, vaine men, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> calleth them <hi>vers.</hi> 20. who, when they had learned, that a man is justified by faith without workes, hereby tooke occasion to cast of all care of good workes. As if it were sufficient for them howsoever they lived, to professe them selves to believe.</p>
               <p>The scope therfore and intendement of the Apostle is, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning justification by faith alone, but according to <hi>Pauls</hi> direction <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. to perswade all those, who professe themselves to believe, to be studious of good workes. And that hee doth by this argument: because, howsoever faith doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie alone, yet the profession of faith alone without good workes will not justifie nor save a man; but is altogether vaine and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or state of the question, which hee propoundeth to argue, manifestly appeareth by the proposition, wherein the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is propounded, and by the conclusion wherein the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concluded, the proposition, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. What profit my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if a man say hee hath faith, and hath not workes, will <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> that faith save him? Marke the wordes: if a man shall say, hee hath faith, that is, if a man shall professe himself to believe, and hath not works, that is a conversation answerable in some measure to his profession; will that faith, which is in profession onely justifie or save him? this interrogation implyeth a most Emphaticall negation: wherein hee doth not onely deny that faith, which is onely in profession, and doth not worke by love, doth justifie or save a man; but also, for the truth of his deniall, hee doth appeale, as it were, to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; sor so much is meant by the interrogation. The question then is not, whether true faith doe justifie alone, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it; but whether that faith, which is alone, and by it selfe; <hi>vers.</hi> 17. without workes, without a Christian conversation, be a true justifying or saving saith. This the Apostle denieth, and so doe wee. In the rest of the discourse hee proveth this negative assertion by an argument from the contrary, namely that this fruitlesse faith is not a true faith, because it is dead. Where the Apostle argueth to
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:22501:271"/>
this effect: That faith, which is dead, doth not iustifie or save a man: The faith which is profession onely, and is alone without workes is dead. Therefore that faith which is in profession onely, and is alone without workes, doth not iustifie or save a man.</p>
               <p>The assumption hee proveth in this whole discourse, where the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lusion is alwayes this, that the faith which is alone and without workes is dead, and therefore that is the question wich is disputed and concluded.</p>
               <p>§. VII. Now that the faith which is alone and without workes<note place="margin">That the faith which is with out workes is dead, proved by five argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> is dead, hee proveth by five arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first <hi>à par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> That charity which is onely in word and not in deed is vaine and unprofitable <hi>vers.</hi> 15. 16. Even so <hi>pariratione,</hi> that faith which is in profession only having no works to accompany it, is dead, <hi>vers.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second argument is taken from the effects. For a true lively faith may bee demonstrated by good workes: and that which cannot be demonstrated by good workes, is but a dead faith. And this hee proveth <hi>vers.</hi> 18. against the carnall Gospeller, as it were, by the partyes owne testimony, or forced confession, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to make experience, which kind of proofe is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thou professest the faith having no workes: I also professe the faith and have workes, come now to the tryall, hee that hath a true faith may approve it by the fruits: shewe then they faith, if thou canst, by thy workes (which thou knowest thou canst not doe) and I by my workes will approve my faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third argument is from the subject. For a true justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is not common to all men. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 2. and much lesse to Devils, but is proper to the Elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. But that faith, which men professe without charity and without good workes is common to Devils. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. Thou professest, that thou believest that there is one God, thou doest well: but if this thy beliefe be not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with charity and good workes; know this, that the devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves who hate God, doe, though with horrour, knowe and perforce believe the same.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth argument to prove, that faith onely professed, or which is in profession onely, is not a true and a lively, but a conterfeit and a dead faith; is a twofold example, of Abraham, and of <hi>Rahab,</hi> who were justified, that is, declared and knowne to be just by their workes. For in this sence, as the word is often used in the Scriptures as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. VIII. But wilt thou know O vaine man, that faith, that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 20. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> that faith professed or in profession onely without workes is dead, or that the faith which is without workes is knowne to be dead. For the life of faith it self doth not depend upon workes as the cause, but is thereby knowne as by the effects. You see againe what the question is which hee will conclude: namely that the faith which is without workes, or which is in profession onely without workes, is not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely but a dead faith, and consequently not a justifying faith. For a justifying faith is like the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Rahab:</hi> but that faith which is in profession onely and wanteth workes is not like the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Raba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> For though <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified by faith without workes as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> proveth, yea by faith alone as the Papists themselves confesse; yet the faith by which hee was justified was not alone, but was fruitfull of good workes, by which both hee and his faith were justified, that is knowne to be just and upright.</p>
               <p>§. IX. <hi>Vers.</hi> 21. was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father, saith hee, justified<note place="margin">The example of <hi>Abraham, Verse</hi> 21.</note> by workes, when hee had offered his sonne <hi>Isaack</hi> upon the Altar? Of which wordes the meaning is not, that <hi>Abraham</hi> by that worke was justified before God, or made just, for long before, the holy Ghost gave him this testimony <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousnesse: not, that then hee first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or was then first justified: for when hee first left his countrey, which hee left by faith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8. hee had believed, and his faith no doubt was imputed to him for righteousnesse: but that by that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke after hee was proved, hee was approved and knowne to be a righteous man. For upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> approbation of his faith and obedience, when he was tryed, the Lord gave him this testimony, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. Now I know, that thou fearest God &amp;c. Did not God know it before? Yea no doubt, but hee speaketh after the maner of men. He had tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, by a commandement of tryall hee had proved his faith and obedience; not that hee did not know, but that he would make it knowne to <hi>Abraham</hi> and others. As on the contray, God is said 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31. to have left <hi>Ezechias</hi> to try him, that hee might know, that is, that hee might make knowne
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:22501:272"/>
all that was in his heart, when as therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> being tryed, had by that act of offering his sonne approved his faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Lord saith, Now I know, that is, now by this tryall it is made knowne, that thou art a just man and one that feareth God. And in this sence, as it is most manifest, hee is said by his workes to have been justified, that is, knowne, declared, approved to be a just man.</p>
               <p>§. X. Hereupon St. <hi>Iames</hi> inferreth <hi>vers.</hi> 22. Doe you not see,<note place="margin">Verse 22.</note> how faith did co-operate to or with his workes? The <hi>verbe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be understood two wayes, either that faith with other graces did co-operate to the bringing forth of this worke, as namely with the feare of God, and love of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. though faith was the principall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. Or else, that faith did co-operate with his workes, not to justifie him before God, but to manifest, declare and approve his righteousnes. In which sence we must understand the word <hi>Faith,</hi> as in the proposition (<hi>vers.</hi> 24.) for faith professed: or the profession of faith which doth concurre together with workes to make a man, truely justified, to bee knowne. And in this sence faith doth co-operate with works, and may be said to justifie by declaring a man to be just, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> holdeth the contrary. For that a man may bee acknowledged to be a man truely justified before God by faith, two things must concurre; the profession of the true faith, and a Christian conversation, neither of which alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
               <p>It followeth in the same verse: and by workes was faith made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Which words</hi> saith Bellarmine <hi>cannot signifie any other, but that his righteousnesse, which was begunne by faith, was perfected by good works. Answ.</hi> But <hi>Iames</hi> doth not say, that his righteousnesse, but his faith was perfected, and whereas hee saith the words cannot signifie otherwise, I say they may be understood two other wayes. First, that faith by workes is perfected, because by workes it is manifested, and perfectly knowne, in which sence Gods strength is perfected in our weakenesse 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. Secondly, because workes bring the fruits and effects of faith to be perfected, when it bringeth forth good fruits according to his kind. For when any thing hath attayned to the end (as it hath when it doth effectually produce those uses or fruits, for which it was ordayned) it is said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be perfect. Now the end of our justification by faith is our sanctification. For when faith was wrought in us (that is to say, in our regeneration) we were the workemanship of God created unto good workes, which God hath preordayned that wee should walke in them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. Faith therefore may then bee said to be perfected, when it doth effectually bring forth the fruit of good workes: whereby a man is not made, but declared to be just.</p>
               <p>§. XI. <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. And this appeareth yet more plainely by that which followeth. And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse.
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:22501:273"/>
This Scripture was fulfilled <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. above 30. yeares before his offering of Isaake: and here againe it is said to have been fulfilled in this act, that is, the truth of that testimony, which was given him so long before was then manifested, when by this worke hee evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that hee was indued with a true lively iustifying faith. And to the like purpose the same sentence might, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, be applyed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in respect of any other notable fruit of his faith: that then also that sentence was verified, <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God &amp;c. For then it was declared and manifested, that hee was indued with a true iustifying faith. As for that conceipt of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> that if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word be well scanned, it will appeare, that the meaning of the words is, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing God was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ust worke, it is but a poore shift. For <hi>Paul</hi> understandeth it of <hi>Abrahams</hi> person, and maketh that text his principall ground of the iustification of the faithfull by imputation of righteousnesse without workes. And <hi>Iames</hi> likewise understandeth it of <hi>Abrahams</hi> person: shewing that by this act of offering his sonne the truth of that testimony was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, that hee was indued with a true faith, by which hee was iustified.</p>
               <p>It followeth in the same verse, and hee was called the friend of God. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Esai.</hi> 41. 8. that is, by this act hee approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee such a one.</p>
               <p>§. XII. Hereupon Saint <hi>Iames, Verse</hi> 24. inferreth this consecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Verse 24.</note> or conclusion: you see then by this example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that a man who is justified before God by faith alone, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and that by imputation of righteousnesse without workes; is also justified by workes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that is, by them, as by fruites and effects hee is declared and approved to bee just, and not by faith professed onely. Hee doth not say, a man is justified by workes as causes, but as the effects. For that, and not the other is deduced from the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. XIII. The other example is of <hi>Rahab, Verse</hi> 25. For though<note place="margin">

               <p>Concerning this example of <hi>Rahab, Bellarmine</hi> hath foure Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: of which never an one agreeth with another. First, <hi>That</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab <hi>was not declared to bee just, because shee was an harlot:</hi> which is false. For though shee had beene an harlot, yet now she beleeved, and by her faith was justifyed before God, and by her worke which shee wrought by faith, was justified, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, that is, declared to bee just.

For either the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of the habit of faith, or of the profession of it.

               <p>And thus have you heard what is to be alleaged against the Papists. First, that their doctrine concerning justification by workes which they would build upon this Text, is repugnant to the Scriptures. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that by their exposition they make Saint <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. XVI. Now for our selves, I will shew, that by our exposition<note place="margin">Our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two Apostles.</note> the seeming difference betweene the two Apostles is manifestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: and that by our Doctrine their Assertions, not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is easily made, if we consider two things, first, the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the Parties, with whom the two Apostles had to deale. For the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> having to deale with Pharisaicall Iustitiaries, who sought to bee justified by a righteousnesse inherent in themselves, and by an obedience performed by themselves, proveth by invincible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that a man is justified by faith without workes. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> having to deale with carnall Gospellers, vaine men, turning the grace of God into wantonnesse, who having heard, that faith doth justifie without workes, did cast off all care of good workes, thinking it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to professe themselves to beleeve, though their life were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute. Against these Saint <hi>Iames</hi> proveth, that vaine is the profession of faith without good works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> that the faith, which is without works, is not a true, liuely justifying faith, but a dead and counterfeit faith: that whosoever is justified before God by faith, must also be justified, that is, declared and approved to bee just, not onely by profession of his faith, but also by the practise of good workes. Wherefore in this respect there is no more difference betweene the two Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> than betweene <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But that by sanctification is meant justification: and by sanctity, justice, it is plaine by the antithesis, for he opposeth sanctification to iniquity.</hi> His argument is thus framed: Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication may and must bee increased by good workes, which is proved by this text, and not denyed by us.</p>
               <p>Iustification is sanctification. And that he proveth, because what is opposed to iniquity is justification: sanctification is here opposed to iniquity. Therefore here sanctification signifieth justification. <hi>Ans.</hi> That justification and sanctification are by no means to be confounded. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large in the first <note n="p" place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> question, for this is the source of all their errours in the doctrine of justification. The Apostle doth carefully distinguish them. For having in the former chapters treated of justification by faith without works; that men should not abuse that doctrine to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse of life; in this, and the next chapter, he treateth of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shewing in this <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 6</note> chapter that sanctification is a necessary compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of justification. And therefore exhorteth those that are justifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> to the dueties of sanctification. The abuse he preventeth <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and 15. for wheras he had taught in the doctrine of justification, that where sinne abounded grace did superabound; he maketh this objection, what then? shall we continue in sinne that grace may abound? God forbid! So againe, by Iustification we are freed from the curse of the Law, and from the rigour and terrour or dominion it? what then? shall we sin, because wee are not under the Law, but under Grace? God forbid!</p>
               <p>The unseparable conjunction of these two benefits is shewed by the <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 6. 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> Sacrament of Baptisme for as it is a seale of that righteousnesse, which is by faith, unto us being baptized into the remission of sins: so it is the laver of regeneration, wherin, as the Apostle saith, we are baptized into Christs death and resurrection; that as he dyed, so we should dye unto sin: and as he rose againe never to dye any more: so wee should arise from the grave of sinne never to dye any more: for how should they that are dead to sinne live any more therein? And hereupon followeth his exhortation, that we should not let sinne reigne in us, nor give our members as instruments of unrighteousnes unto sin, &amp;c. And as he doth dehort us from suffering sinne to relgne in us: so he assureth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that sinne shall no more haue dominion over them, because they are not under the Law but under grace, and having prevented the abuse of that doctrine, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. he reneweth both his dehortation from suffering sinne to reigne in them, because if it did reigne in them, they must needes be the servants of it: when as in their redemption they were freed from the bondage of sinne, that they might become the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note n="s" place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> of righteousnesse; and also his exhortation <hi>vers.</hi> 19. that they
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:22501:276"/>
would yeeld their members, as seruants to holinesse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To his reason, <hi>that by sanctification here is meant justification, because it is opposed to iniquity:</hi> I answere, that both justification and sanctification are opposed to sinne and iniquity; but with this difference. In sin there are two things, the guilt, and the corruption or pollution. By justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is opposed to accusing and condemning <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. wee are freed from the guilt of sin and damnation: by our sanctification, which is opposed to pollution, wee are freed in some measure from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that it is to say, from the dominion of sinne.</p>

Answ.</hi> He should say his justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in both hee disputeth <hi>a posse ad esse:</hi> it is possible for a man to fulfill the Law and consequently to be justified by workes it is possible, that a righteous man may performe some workes truely and purely good by multiplying whereof he may increase his justice. But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, whether some choise man one of a million, can fulfill the Law, and bring forth workes purely good; but whether every one that is justified doth fulfill the Law, that is, doth continue in all the things which are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them. Whether the workes, yea all the workes of every one, that is justified, be purely good. For if he should transgresse in any one particular, though it were but by omission, he hath not fulfilled the Law. If any of his workes were not truely and purely good, or if all his workes be not pure, then hee cannot be justified by workes. But he is so farre from proving these things as it were the <hi>esse,</hi> that he is not able to prove the <hi>posse,</hi> that any one mortall man is able to fulfill the Law; or that any one action of any one rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is purely and perfectly good. The contraries of both which I have plentifully proved before.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here remaineth the last, though not the least er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Papists in this controversie, which is concerning the efficacie of good workes. For the Papists not contented to affirme, that good works doe justifie; doe also teach that at the hands of God they doe merit or deserve the reward of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. And this, in effect, is the same with that, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> laboured to prove, when he disputed of the necessity of good workes unto salvation, not onely <hi>necessitate praesentiae,</hi> as the way to Gods kingdome, which we confesse; but also <hi>necessitate efficientiae,</hi> as causes thereof. For by the Efficiencie which they ascribe to workes, they meane no other but morall, which is, as they say, by way of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Howbeit the former assertion of the necessity of efficiencie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to containe a further degree of damnable errour; <hi>viz.</hi> that not onely good workes doe merit or deserve salvation; but also, that none can be saved without their owne merits: for so much is implyed in the terme of the necessity of efficiencie.<note place="margin">The state of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. But first we are to set downe the state of the controversie, in setting downe whereof the Papists are very sparing, because in this
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:22501:278"/>
point they differ much among themselves. But yet in this they do agree,<note n="a" place="margin">Concil. Trident sess. 6. cap. 16 &amp; can. 32.</note> that all the good works of the regenerate are truly meritorious of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Now for the explacation of the termes: by good works, which they say are meritorious, they meane all such works, as are qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those seven conditions, which<note n="b" place="margin">De justif. l. 5. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> requireth. First, that they be material<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fourthly, that they be free, that is, as they expound it, voluntary, proceeding from their freewill. Fifthly, persormed by men who are in the state of grace. Sixthly, having the promise of eternall reward. Seventhly, proceeding from the virtue of Charity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by all such workes they doe not onely meane all joyntly,<note place="margin">Quolibet actu charitate infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> said to merit onely, <hi>ex pacto,</hi> which ever happeneth when there is a great disproportion between the worke and the promised reward. As if a man should for a daies labour, which in commutative justice deserveth but <hi>denarium diurnum</hi> the day-penny, promise an hundred pound; this reward were due <hi>ex pacto,</hi> but yet not deserved by the labourer. The halfe of <hi>Herods</hi> Kingdome was due to the daughter of <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But there is nothing which can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly be called merit, but that which is of condignity, and doth for it selfe, and for its owne worth absolutely deserve the reward. That which is said to merit by way of congruity is not truely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly meritorious, nor that which is said meerely to merit <hi>ex pacto,</hi> as where is no proportion betweene the merit and the wages. For neither of these doth truely deserve that which it is said to merit. Wherefore the most, and the most learned of the Papists hold, that there is a due proportion betweene the workes of the faithfull proceeding from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and the heavenly reward, and that they condignely merit eternall life, not only in respect of Gods promise, but also for the worthinesse of the workes, which are so dignified, they say, by the merit of Christ, that they become truely meritorious, and doe in Iustice, according to their worth, deserve the heavenly reward, even as justly, as the sinnes of the wicked deserve the punishment of hell. In so much that our Rhemists<note n="g" place="margin">In Heb. 10.</note> say, good workes be meritorious, and the very cause of salvation, so farre, that God should be unjust, if he rendred not heaven for the same, unjust (they meane) for not rendring a just and equall reward. Where fore howsoever some like snailes, when they are touched, doe pull in their hornes: yet this undoubtedly is the Tenet of the learned Papists at this day:<note n="h" place="margin">Bellarm. de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stif. l. 5. c. 17.</note>

As for those, who heretofore have denyed the absolute merit of condignity, and have held either merits of congruity onely, or onely <hi>ex pacto,</hi> they are censured by some of the learned<note n="i" place="margin">Vasquez. in prima secundae. q. 114. disp. 214. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And first, I will speake of the name, and then of the thing: neither of which hath any ground in the Scriptures: and therefore both the name and the thing, of all true Christians, who desire not in matters of such moment as concerne our eternall inheritance, to bee wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The word <hi>mereri</hi> properly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to deserve, and <hi>meritum</hi> desert, or that which deserveth a reward: and that which doth not deserve, is not properly and truely called me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

<pb n="550" facs="tcp:22501:279"/>
ascribed to good workes, doth signifie or import the deserving of eternall life at the hands of God. There are words and phrases impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reward of workes both good and bad; but with this difference, that the eternall reward of good workes, as it was according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of grace given unto us in Christ<note n="k" place="margin">2 Tim 1. 9.</note> before all secular times, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended and preordained: and according to the Covenant of grace to them for whom Christ hath merited the same, freely promised; so it is freely bestowed as <gap reason="foreign">

And first wee alleage those testimonies, which ascribe the reward of good workes to Gods mercie, and not to our merits. As <hi>Exod. 20. 6. Psalm. 62. 12. &amp; 103. 4, 17. Gal. 6. 16. Mat. 5. 7.

                  <p>Eternall life is freely given of Gods meere mercie and grace; which is proved by the testimonies alleaged.</p>

For to him that worketh, and by his work meriteth, the reward is given, not according to grace, but according to debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4 And such is the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position between merit and grace, that what is of grace, is not of works: and what is of workes is not of grace, <hi>Rom. 11. 6.

Especially, seeing and also seeming that wee doe not all that is commanded, and lastly seeing that our service brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>§. VII. For the third: That which is done of meere duty by a servant to his Lord, there belongeth no reward in justice, as deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him. But all that we, who are the servants of God, can doe, though we should doe all that is commanded, is done of meere boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duety to our Lord. Therefore to all that we can doe, though we should doe all that is commanded, there belongeth no reward, as just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserved by us. But when we have done all that is commanded (I speak by supposition, as our Saviour doth) we must no lesse truely than humbly confesse, that wee are unprofitable servants: that is, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly gathered out of the parable, such as cannot deserve so much as thankes of our Lord. If therefore our gracious Lord shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of his bounty freely to promise, and according to his promise graciously to reward our imperfect obedience, which he might justly
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:22501:285"/>
punish: it is not our merit, but his great mercie that he doth not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it: more that he doth accept of it as well pleasing unto him in his welbeloved; but most of all, that he doth most graciously and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly reward it. From whence I reason thus:</p>
               <q>Whosoever are unprofitable servants they doe not merit no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> deserve the reward of eternall life of their Lord.</q>
               <p>All the faithfull, though they should doe all that is commanded, are unprofitable servants: Therefore none of the faithfull, though they should doe all that is commanded, doe merit or deserve at the hands of God, (the reward of eternall life. And if they, who doe all that is commanded, cannot merit; then much lesse they whose obedience is defective; as the obedience even of the best is. So saith <hi>Hierome</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Ad Ctest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contr. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag.</note> 
                  <hi>si inutilis est qui fecit omnia: quid de illo dicendum, qui explere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non potuit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. VIII. The assumption is proved, first, because our Saviour<note place="margin">All the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable servants.</note> commandeth his Apostles to confesse, as the truth is, that when they have done all that is commanded, they are unprofitable servants, and therefore they, who neither doe, nor can doe all, are impudent lyars, when they professe themselves to be profitable servants. Secondly, by a comparison of earthly Lords and servants. For if earthly Lords and masters owe not so much as thankes to their servants (who are indeed their fellow servants) for all the service which they can doe; though they doe not give them the will and the power to doe them acceptable service: how much lesse doth God, who being our abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lord doth also give us will and power to serve him, owe unto his servants the reward of the kingdome of heaven? And if servants by doing all possible service to their earthly masters, who are but their fellow servants, cannot deserve so much as thankes at their hands: how much lesse can wee, who serve the Lord of Lords, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the kingdome of heaven at his hands by our unperfect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective service of him. Thirdly, from the antithesis or opposition that is betweene <hi>debitum</hi> and <hi>merit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> duety and merit. For hee that doth but his duety, though he performe his whole duty, cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit a reward of his Master, but must confesse himselfe to be an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable servant: how much lesse can they merit an heavenly reward at the hands of God, who performe not their whole duty, but faile in many particulars, both by omission and commission, as the very best of us doe.</p>

                  <hi>which our Saviour would have us humbly to acknowledge; though by grace we become profitable, and therefore as he saith,</hi> agnoscenda est gratia, sed non ignoranda natura. Reply, <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth not speake
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:22501:286"/>
of our corrupt nature; neither is it his meaning that by nature wee are unprofitable servants, by grace profitable, but that by nature wee are servants, and by grace sonnes. For by nature corrupted wee are not the servants of God, but of sinne and Satan. But he understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the meaning of our Saviour to be, that the children of God, who are in the state of grace, should not glory in their workes, as if by them they did merit any thing of God, <hi>quia jure Domino debemus obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium.</hi> because by right we owe obedience to God. Neither should we thinke our selves exempted from continued obedience, because we are sonnes: for as we are sons by the grace of adoption) which we are to acknowledge) so by nature and creation (whereof we are not to be ignorant) we are servants. As therefore thou, who art a master, dost not content thy selfe with one worke of thy servant, and then biddest him sit downe and eate, but having done one worke thou exactest of him another, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. So God doth not require the use of one worke in thee: but whiles we live we must alwaies work. Secondly, our Saviour doth not speake of naturall men, as being unprofitable, because unapt to fulfill Gods Commandements: but directeth his speech to the faithfull, and namely, to his owne Apostles and Disciples, who study and endeavour to keepe all Gods Commandements, (which without grace cannot be done) requiring them to make this humble and true confession, that even when they have done all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, they are but unprofitable servants, such as are described in the parable, who deserve nothing at the hands of their master: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in doing all that is commanded, they doe but their bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that excludeth merit.

                  <hi>Replpy,</hi> This answere of <hi>Bellaamine</hi> is worthy to be observed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admired: first, for the impudencie of it, in that he fathereth this exposition upon <hi>Augustine,</hi> who in the place by him quoted, doth not once mention this Text of <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. nor hath one word to that purpose for which this exposition is alleaged; excepting the clause of Gods bounty, which, as it proveth this to bee that very testimony of <hi>Augustine,</hi> which he quoteth, so doth it evidently exclude merit. Secondly, for the force of truth, which forceth him to contradict his owne assertions, both here, and in other places. For first, hee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that hee which doth no more but his duty, doth not merit: and that wee doe no more but our duty. Whereupon it followeth, that we doe not merit. Secondly, where hee confesseth, that wee can doe no more than our duty, he renounceth all workes of supererrogation. And thirdly, in that he confesseth, that for the same cause wee are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable servants, he taketh away all merit of condignity. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he confesseth, that without Gods gracious promise we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no reward. Which proveth, that the reward is due onely <hi>ratione pacti,</hi> and not <hi>ratione ipsius operis,</hi> which afterward he denyeth. Fifthly, he confesseth, that such is the bounty and goodnesse of God, that to allure us to the performance of our duty, hee doth freely promise a reward. Now what God doth freely promise to give, he giveth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without desert. For eternall life, which in his word hee hath promised as a reward, in his eternall counsell hee purposed freely without any respect of our worthynesse to bestow upon us: and what in mercy hee either purposed or promised, Christ by his merit hath purchased for us. So that we attaine to heaven by a threefold right. By Gods free donation electing us in Christ, as his free gift. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Christs merit, as our inheritance: Thirdly, by Gods free
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:22501:287"/>
promise, as his gracious reward, whereby he crowneth not our merits, but his owne gifts and graces in us. God indeed hath promised free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reward our workes: but that our workes should merit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he hath no where promised, or taught.<note place="margin">His fourth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. in illu dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. XII. His fourth exposition is of <hi>Chrysostome: that the Lord doth not say, ye are unprofitable servants, but biddeth them say so:</hi> which is true. But what will <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inferre therefrom, that therefore they were not so? God forbid! For then our Saviour should have taught his Disciples to lye. Neither doth God allow of counterfeit humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But the meaning of our Saviour was, to teach his Disciples in humility to confesse the truth: that because they had but done their duty, if they had done all that is commanded, they should not bee lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with a proud conceite, that thereby they had merited: but should no lesse truly, than humbly confesse, that they were unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table servants, who by doing no more than their duty, could not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. And this objection is also answered by <note n="o" place="margin">De <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the Apostle making an opposition between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of sinne and the reward of righteousnesse, saith, that the one is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>That the Apostle did not say, Eternall life is the stipend of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as he said, Death is the stipend of sinne, least any man should thinke, that we so have righteousnesse of ourselves, as we have sinne of our selves: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eternall life is called grace, not because it is not the reward of merit, but that we have the merits themselves from grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the former, I reply, that when <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that eternall life might well be called a stipend, which hee maketh to bee all one with <hi>merces,</hi> hee meaneth a stipend or reward freely given; as if there were <hi>stipendium grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereas our obedience and our sufferings, are the sufferings and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of sinnefull men. And therefore if they will not still bee Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christians, they must acknowledge, that to satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e sor the punishment of hel, and to merit heaven are priviledges and prerogatives peculiar to Christ our head, whose sufferings and obedience, by reason of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his person, are of infinit valew and worth, not to satisfie or merit for himselfe (sor that needed not, seeing the man Christ by reason of the hypostaticall union was in the dayes of his flesh, as the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves teach, both <hi>Viator</hi> and <hi>Comprehensor,</hi> enjoying from the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of his conception the beatificall vision) but for the world, and for more worlds, if there were more. But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth instance first, <hi>that as the passion of Christ was much shorter than the paines of hell, yet because of the dignity of the person which suffered, was most worthy to be esteemed a ful satisfaction: so, though the passions of this time be short, and that glory be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, notwithstanding betweene these sufferings, and that glory, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, by reason of the dignity of charity whence they proceed.</hi> And this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have beene the meaning of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> distinction, that the Apostle denyeth the sufferings of this life to be equall to the future glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in respect of the substance of the worke, and considered in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>hemselves as they are humane, as they are short and light, they are no way equall to the future glory: yet as they are, as it were, divine, proceeding from the divine grace of charity, they have an equall, and as hee calleth it, an absolute proportion. Thus they make an idoll of charity: as if it being not onely finite, but also unperfect, and but begunne, were of sufficient worth and dignity to merit an infinite reward. And yet the Apostle speaking of the sufferings of the faithfull who as it was said in the verses going before are the sonnes and heires of God, endued with the Spirit, yea, of Martyrs who are endued with a great measure of charity, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be condigne to the glory which shall be revealed.</p>
               <p>His second instance is by <hi>comparison taken from the delights of sin, which are incomparably lesse, than the torments of hell: yet because of the contempt of God, they are worthy to bee punished with those torments.

But this allegation I fully answered <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. 7. cap.</hi> 5. §. 7.</note> before, it being his fifth testimony, whereby he would prove good workes to be necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the necessity of efficiencie. Here it shall be sufficient to shew, that merit cannot hence be proved. Yea but, saith hee, afflictions are said to worke this weight of glory: which must not bee understood physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that is efficiently; but morally that is meritoriously: whereto I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that a meritorious cause is an efficient cause: and that which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth meritoriously worketh efficiently, though not contrariwise. And therfore although from hence sufficiency were proved, yet merit is not. For I pray, what is here said to worke? Tribulation? But though tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation worke, as it and all things else doe worke together for the good of Gods children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. yet doth tribulation merit? Then is it a meritorious thing to be afflicted, and punished. For affliction is <hi>malum poenae</hi> the evill of punishment merited by sinne. Doth affliction then worke salvation?

               <p>§. XXII. In the sixth place <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleageth three testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies<note place="margin">Three Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> for us.</note> as objected by us, <hi>viz.

See <hi>Lib. 7. Cap.</hi> 3. §. 15. The second was the fourth Testimony, which he tooke upon him to answer. See my reply <hi>Lib. 7. Cap.</hi> 3. §. 13. The third was the fifth Testimonie, of which see <hi>Lib. 7. Cap.</hi> 3. §. 14. But though we doe not alleage the first against merit of workes; yet by<note place="margin">The first, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9.</note> by consequent it doth disprove it. For if workes doe not concurre to justification as the matter therof, then can they not be the merit of salvation, as hath beene said. Secondly, if in the question of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which concerneth our title to Salvation, they are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as things of no worth, yea as losse, then are they not meritorious of eternall life. And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> challengeth us to alleage any one Father, that understandeth <hi>Paul</hi> to speake of workes done after grace: I alleaged before Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> upon the place, who understandeth the Apostle as speaking of all, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he said all, both old and new, both past and present, and that I confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by reason. And when he saith, that <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the faithfull <hi>Eminentissimam,</hi> it is apparant, that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of that, which wee have by our obedience performed to the Law, but of that most eminent righteousnesse, which wee have by
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:22501:292"/>
faith. The other two places exclude workes from being any causes, as well of Salvation as of justification. And it is plaine, that the Apostle speaketh of salvation, and of all the degrees thereof, that it is wholly to bee ascribed to the grace of God, and not our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Reply,</hi> First, so long as they bee ours, though given of God, as all other good things are, we are apt to glory in them, as appeareth by the Pharisee, who boasteth <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 18. 11.</note> of his merits, though he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that hee received them from God; and therefore rendreth thankes for them. Secondly, the pleading of merit, is it selfe a proud boasting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 12. Thirdly, the Papists plead merit as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from their owne free will, which they require as a necessary condition of merit. Fourthly, If the good worke proceed meerely from Gods grace, then can we not by it merit any thing of God. But
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:22501:292"/>
the Papists teach, that by it they merit of God: and consequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, so farre forth as it meriteth, to proceed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>om the grace of God, and therefore when they plead merit, they glory in themselves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in the Lord.<note place="margin">Our second reason, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>heir doctrine derogateth from the merit of Christ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. Our second reason: That doctrine, which derogateth from the infinite and all-sufficient merit of Christ, is to bee renounced as false and Antichristian.</p>
               <p>The Popish doctrine of merits, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are to be saved by our owne merits, and that the faithfull by their owne workes doe truely and condignely merit eternall life, derogateth from the infinite and all-sufficient merit of Christ. Therefore it is false and Antichristian. The assumption they deny; yea, though indeed they doe derogate from the merit of Christ, yet they denounce <note n="c" place="margin">Conc. Trident. sess. 6. can. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>anathema</hi> against them that shall say so. But we not only say it, but prove it. For first; If Christ hath already most sufficiently and fully merited heaven for us, then our merits are needlesse: or if our merits bee needfull, as they teach, then are not Christs sufficient for us; which is no better than blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they who teach, that Christ hath not merited for all that beleeve, and as soone as they truely beleeve, the right of eternall life, doe greatly derogate from the merit of Christ. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe teach, that Christ hath so merited the right of eternall life to all the faithfull, that by him they have <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 24. &amp; 6. 47. 1 Ioh. 5. 12, 13.</note> alreadie eternall life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alreadie translated from death to life. </p>
               <p>But they who teach, that the faithfull are to merit the right of eternall life by their owne good Workes, doe in effect teach, that CHRIST hath not merited it to the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Therefore they who teach that the faithfull are to merit the right of eternall life by their owne good workes, doe greatly derogate from the merit of Christ.</p>
               <p>This assumption may thus bee demonstrated: That which a man hath already, he needeth not to merit. For to merit is to obtaine by desert that right which a man hath not yet. <hi>Nullus meret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the infinite merit of eternall life dependeth on the infinitenesse of the person who meriteth it: such an one is Christ, such are none of his members. Therefore to Christ alone it belongeth to merit heaven for his members: and not to his members; who are not to merit, but by faith to apprehend the merit of their Head.</q>

               <p>§. III. This argument, that the doctrine of merits is derogatory to the al-sufficient merits of our onely Saviour, is worthy to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon, and defended against all exceptions and cavils of the Papists; which indeed are many, but may be reduced to these three heads: for either they serve to shew, that their doctrine doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Christs merits: or that their doctrine setteth forth the glory of Christs merit, no lesse than ours: or that wee by denying their doctrine doe extenuate (such is their impudency) the merit of Christ.</p>

And what commendation soever our merits have, that wholly redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the praise of Christs merit. For hee is the Vine, wee are the branches. And as a branch ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>to say, that the fruitefulnesse of the branches detracteth from the glory of the Vine: so no man, that is not a very foole would say, that it is a derogation from the glory of Christ, if his servants by his Grace, by his Spirit, by faith and charity inspired from him, bring forth good workes, which are so truely just, that unto them is due from the just Iudge a crowne of Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> To which answere I assent in some particulars. First, that it is indeed a great honour to Christ, if his members doe bring forth much fruit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 8. As contrarywise, it is a great dishonour to him, when any of his members defile themselves with any crime, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. Secondly, that having union with Christ, as his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, wee have also communion with him, both in his merits to our justification and salvation; and also in the vertue of his death to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie sinne in us, and of his resurrection to raise us unto newnesse of life. By influence of which virtue from Christ our Head the holy Spirit enableth us to bring forth the fruites of good workes. But that these good works, though wrought by the Spirit, though proceeding from faith and charity, though acceptable to God in Christ, though graciously rewarded by him, are so perfect and of such value, that they should bee either satisfactory to Gods justice, or meritorious of eternall life, that we utterly deny; these being prerogatives peculiar to our Head, who onely hath both satisfied the justice of God, and also merited heaven for us: and that to this end, that neither satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction should be required of us for our sinnes (for which wee cannot satisfie, but by eternall punishment) nor merit of eternall life expected from us, which cannot bee merited but by a price of infinite value. For if there be need of either, then either Christ hath not fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or not sufficiently merited for us. And as it is a certaine trueth, that Christ did not to this end satisfie for us, that wee should satisfie, which to us is impossible, but that we should be freed from the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of satisfying Gods justice, as being already satisfied: so it is no lesse true, that Christ did not to that end merit heaven for us, that we should merit it, which to us is impossible; but that wee should bee freed from the necessity of meriting it, which Christ hath al-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently merited, and should rely wholly and onely on the satisfaction and merit of Christ.</p>
               <p>If they say, that Christ hath merited for us those graces and works by which wee are to merit heaven: I demand, whether Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did merit heaven for us or not? If so, then need not our merits. If not, then doe they not onely part stakes with Christ, but assume the greater merit, which is of glory, to themselves and leave the lesse, which is of grace, to Christ; and that not entire neither. For the obtaininig of righteousnesse, as they doe not wholly ascribe to their owne free will, so neither to Gods grace; but partly to God offering grace, and partly to their owne free will, which willingly accepteth of grace, when it might refuse it. And this willingnesse (whatsoever they pretend to the contrary) is in mine opinion the very root from whence their conceipted merit doth spring.</p>

                  </gap>y deny, and none of them shall ever bee able to prove, that Christ merited for us, that wee our selves should merit eternall life.</p>
               <p>For first, the power of meriting heaven at the hands of God is Christs peculiar: neither can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ny meere man, no not in the state of innocency, nor any Angell, not any meere creature merit any reward at the hands of God: because when they have done all, they have done but their duety. Much lesse can wee, who never doe all, and that which wee doe is stained with the flesh, and is mingled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold transgressions, if not of commission, from which none are free, yet at least of omission.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Christ died for our sinnes to free us from hell; and that hee in his owne person performed all obedience both <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 5. 9, 16.</note> passive and active, that thereby we might be justified and saved, wee read in the Scriptures. But that he dyed for our good workes to make them meritorious, or that he merited for us the power of meriting heaven, which power is proper to himselfe alone, and presupposeth infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of merit and worth, we reade not. The similitude which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> useth of the Sunne, whereby God doth illuminate the world, and of other secondary causes, which God doth use as meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to worke (which argue not Gods inability but his omnipotencie in giving such power to his creatures) to prove, that God his saving us by our owne merits, doth not argue the insufficiency of Christs merit, but the sufficiency in giving such power to our merits, is as meere a begging of the question as the former: taking for granted, that as God doth enlighten the world by the Sunne, &amp;c. (which all men know by experience) so hee doth save us by our owne merits: when as the Scriptures in plaine termes deny us to bee saved by our workes, but wholly and onely by the merits of Christ. Besides, the similitude is altogether unlike. For God doth not illuminate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour world by himselfe, but by the Sunne, nor performe those other actions by himselfe immediately, for which he hath ordained secondary causes, as his instruments, working ordinarily by meanes. But Christ by himselfe <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 20. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For how can we merit of God by that which is his? But indeed this evasion, which here is used to serve the present turne, is not suitable with the Popish doctrine, which teacheth men to part stakes with God, as I have said. First, in respect of grace, the efficacy whereof they divide betweene God and their owne free will. Secondly, in respect of their justification, for the first they ascribe after a sort to grace, the second which is increase of justice, to their owne merit.

His fourth Evasion, <hi>That though wee be saved by our owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; yet wee are no lesse beholden unto Christ, than if wee were saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, but rather more.

This soundeth well for mans praise, who would faine have a share in his owne salvation. But it becommeth u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If wee take any part to our<note place="margin">pEsay 42. 8.</note> selves, we doe not ascribe it wholly to God. It is very true, that we are beholden and bound to Christ, not onely for salvation it selfe, but also for those graces and good workes unto which eternall life is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as a free reward. But the more gifts and graces wee receive from Christ; the more we owe unto him, the lesse we can merit of him. If we call his graces our merits; and his gift and free reward our deserved hire, as the Papists doe, then doe we challenge unto our selves the praise, both of the one, and of the other. But if Christ in his owne person and by himselfe hath merited for us both eternall life it selfe, and those things also unto which it is promised, as a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: With what face can wee ascribe it to our owne merits? Or if we doe ascribe it to our owne merits, though but in part, how doe we not part stakes with God.</p>
               <p>§. VII. And whereas hee saith, it is a most honourable way to be<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> that we are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by our owne merits, because that is a more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way.</note> saved by our owne merits: I aske, whether more honourable to God, or to us? If to us; the Scripture teacheth us to strippe our selves of all honour in the matter of our salvation, and to ascribe all honour and glory to God. It were indeed more honourable for man to need no Saviour, than being utterly lost in himselfe to be saved by another. It were more honourable for man to be free from all sinne, and to bee indued with most perfect righteousnesse, and if it were possible to merit his owne salvation; than being by sinne fallen into the state of damnation, to need a Saviour. But now man having by his apostasie from God, lost that honourable estate wherein hee was created, and fallen into a state of misery: his glory, wherein hee is now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:22501:295"/>
is, that God (who gave no Redeemer to the Angels that fell) gave his onely begotten Sonne to redeeme him: his merit, as Gods mercy: his honour, that of a child of Satan, and of a firebrand of hell, hee is by Christ made the Sonne of God, and heire of eternall life. And for Gods glory, it is not to bee doubted, but that it was most honourable to God for the illustration of the glory both of his mercy and also of his justice, that man being fallen should bee saved by the merits of Christ: that being redeemed and justified, he should still bee subject both to inward infirmities and corruptions, and also to outward temptations, that in our weakenesse his strength might appeare, that we should not trust to our owne merits, or boast in our owne worthinesse, but should rely wholly on the mercies of God and merits of Christ; ascribing the whole glory of our salvation thereunto, and not to our owne merits, who can deserve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The impudency whereof is much the greater, because they are not able to alleage any Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or testimony of any of the ancient Fathers, testifying that Christ did merit for us the power of meriting. For it was not the purpose of our Saviour to communicate that power to his members, which is a peculiar prerogative of the Head: neither was it his meaning to
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:22501:296"/>
save us to that end, that we should be our owne Saviours. Neither is it credible, that hee would give us money, as it were, to enable us in our owne persons either to pay our debt, or to purchase our i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Againe if it had beene Christs purpose to give us wherewith to merit, then would he have infused most perfect righteousnesse into us, which should not have beene stained with any sinfulnesse, neither should need remission or indulgence But we are so farre from having this power to merit heaven, that the best of us had need to pray with <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Psal 143. 2. Psal. 130. 3, 4.</note> as being not more just than he, Enter not into judgement with thy servants O Lord, &amp;c. for if thou shouldest marke what is amisse, who should stand? and with the Apostles, as being not more holy than they, forgive us our trespasses, &amp;c. our chiefe righteousnesse in this life, consisting as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>

Now, whiles we are sinners in our selves, as all are, wee cannot merit any thing but punishment at the hands of God: and whiles wee deserve hell how can we possibly merit heaven?</p>
               <p>§. X. These were the arguments which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tooke upon him<note place="margin">Our third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> to answere, but could not satisfie. Now wee are to adde some others. Our third reason therefore is this: If we cannot merit so much as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall blessings at the hands of God, then much lesse eternall; But wee cannot merit so much as temporall blessings at Gods hands; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much lesse eternall.</p>
               <p>1. The assumption I prove thus, first by the confession of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 10. that he was lesse than the least of Gods mercies. Of <hi>David,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mankinde in generall, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 4. and concerning himselfe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18.

                  </gap>ch as a piece of bread, but must beg it at Gods hands, then can wee not merit eternall life of him. But the former is true, for therefore our Saviour hath taught us to make this daily praier, that God would give us day by day our daily bread. To this purpose Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">In Rom. 8. 18</note> saith well, that a man could not suffer any thing worthy the heavenly glory, though it were such as this present life is. But <hi>Chrys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </q>
               <p>The assumption is manifest: for therefore in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Kingdome of heaven is called our inheritance, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 14. 18. 5. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. and that an eternall and incorruptible inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.

For therefore are we adopted the sons of God that we may be heires, heires of God and fellow heires of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 7. and to the same end are we justified by his grace, that we might according to hope bee made heires of eternall life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe hath taught, as we have <note n="a" place="margin">De justif. l. 5. c. 17. § sed quanquam.</note> heard, that we are entituled to the Kingdome of heaven <hi>jure adoptionis.</hi> And in that <note n="b" place="margin">De justif. l. 5. c 14. §. quinta ratio.</note> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be the sons of God, wee begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>elicity, now we begin to be the sonnes of God, before wee begin to bring forth good workes. And hereby appeareth the truth of the proposition: for we have our right of adoption not by merit, but by the free grace of God, who hath predestinated <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 1. 5. 6.</note> us unto the adoption of children by Iesus Christ to himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. And this inheritance was prepared for us from the beginning of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25, 34.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that as it is called an inheritance, so also a reward, and reward presupposeth merit, for so the Councill of Trent <note n="d" place="margin">Sess. 6. cap. 16.</note> teacheth, that eternall life is to be propounded to the godly, both as grace, that is, a free gift promised by Christ, and as a reward duely to be rendred to their merits according to Gods promise. I answere, that eternall life is no such reward as presupposeth merit, for it is a free reward, freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, freely given. Neither can those things stand together, which the Councill of Trent hath conjoyned, that eternall life should both bee <hi>gratia</hi> a free gift, graciously promised and freely bestowed, and also a due wages to be rendred to desert, neither if it be the reward of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it is called <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. which is freely bestowed on the sonnes of God, it cannot be a mercenary wages which is due to hired servants.</p>

               <p>But good workes are not the cause of eternall life, therefore they doe
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:22501:297"/>
not merit it. The assumption I prove, first, from that received testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <note n="e" place="margin">Degratia &amp; lib. arb.</note> 
                  <hi>Bernard,</hi> that good workes are <hi>via regni, non causa regnandi. Quid autem hac conclusione firmius?</hi> saith <note n="f" place="margin">Epist. 19. 1109.</note> 
                  <hi>Cassander,</hi> who also saith, that <hi>Thomas Bradwardin</hi> and divers other Schoolemen deny good workes to bee the cause of the eternall reward, and that some who call them causes, doe meane <hi>Causam sine qua non,</hi> which properly is no cause.</p>
               <p>Secondly, true causes of salvation may bee trusted in for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Our good workes are not to be trusted in for the obtaining of salvation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they are not true causes thereof.</p>
                  <p>The proposition is <hi>Bellarmines:</hi>

               </q>
               <p>The assumption also in effect is his. For if it be most safe, as he truly saith, <note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. propos. 3.</note> by reason of the uncertainty of our owne righteousnesse (which none of them can be certaine of without speciall revelation) and danger of vaine glory, not to trust in our owne merits, but to repose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If our heart condemne us not, then have wee confidence towards God: and it is another thing to place affiance in our merits, which none but proud Iustitiaries and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall Hypocrites use to doe. Secondly, we must distinguish betwixt the innocency and justice of a mans cause, and the innocency and justice of his person. For the same men in the Scripture who for the justification of their persons desire the Lord <note n="o" place="margin">Psal 143. 2. &amp; 130. 3. 4.</note> not to enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them; for the justification of their cause have not feared <note n="p" place="margin">

               <p>§. XIII. Our sixth reason: those who cannot fully discharge their duety, much lesse can they merit. For they that merit must doe more than their duety. For they that doe but their duety (though they doe all that is commanded) must acknowledge <note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 17. 10.</note> themselves to be unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table servants. But if they faile in their duety and come short of that which is commanded, then can they merit nothing but punishment at the hands of God.

               <p>Our seventh reason. If good workes doe merit salvation, then wee are saved by them: but we are not saved by good workes, <hi>Ephes. 2. 8, 9. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. therefore they doe not merit salvation.</p>

And therfore that the reward it selfe is called <hi>gratia</hi> both because it is freely given, and because those workes to which it is given, are wholly to bee ascribed to Gods grace: and consequently, that the Lord, when he rewardeth our workes with eternall life, doth not reward them, as our merits, but as his owne gifts Than which what can be spoken more effectually against the merits of condignity? For if our good works be not our owne, as from our selves, how can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hey merit of him whose gifts they are. If they were our owne and from our selves, and were also perfect (as they are not) then perhaps it might be said, that when God rewardeth them, he rewardeth our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: but not being from our selves, but meerely by his gift, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth them hee doth not reward our merits, but crowne his owne gifts. It is plaine therfore, that whereas <hi>August.</hi> considereth good works two wayes, either as our merits, or as Gods gifts; he both constantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth eternall life to be rendred unto them, as to our merits, and also affirmeth, that it is given to them freely, as to the free gifts of God. And this is proved out of those very places which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleageth, in the first place he saith: <note n="d" place="margin">Epist. 105.</note>

And the like is to be said of the other places, some wherof I have before alleaged as being pregnant to our purpose. Wherein as in innumerable other places, <hi>Augustine</hi> doth not speake of the workes of naturall men, but of the workes of the faithfull and regenerate proceeding from grace, to which, not as to merits, but as to the free gifts of God eternall life is freely given.

But to this place this answere cannot be applyed, seeing <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh those words in the person of <hi>Iob,</hi> whose workes proceeded from grace, he being the most gracious man that was then upon the earth.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Gregory</hi> writing on the seventh Penitentiall <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 143.</note> Psalme, speaketh to this effect. If that felicitie of Saints be mercie, and is not acquired by merits, which hee had noted before out of the Psalme, what then shall become of that which is written, and thou rendrest to every man according to his workes? if it be rendred according to works, how shall it be esteemed mercie? But it is one thing saith he, to render according to workes, another to render for the workes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For in that it is said according to workes, the quality of works is meant, that whose workes shall appeare to bee good, his reward may be glorious. For to that blessed life wherein we live with God and by God, no labour may be matched, no workes compared: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, seeing the Apostle saith, The passions of this time are not condigne to the future glory. Where he teacheth these three things. First, that eternall life is not gotten by merits, no not of Saints. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That it is not given for our workes as the meritorious cause, though according to our workes. Thirdly, that our workes are not worthy of it, and therefore cannot condigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. VI. The sixt and last is <hi>Bernard,</hi> out of whom he citeth, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> by us, foure Testimonies. The first, <hi>de annunciat. serm.</hi> 1. where is an excellent passage against merits, out of which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth for us one onely sentence. But I will recite the whole place. Now as touching life eternall, we know, that the passions of this time are not condigne to the future glory, though <note n="s" place="margin">Nec si unus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sustin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>at.</note> one man should sustaine them all. Neither are the merits of men such, that eternall life should bee due to them by right, or that God should doe some injury, if hee did not give it. For to omit, that all our merits are Gods gifts, and so for them man is more a debtour to God, than God to man: what are all merits to so great glory? Finally, who is better than the Prophet—who held it necessary to say unto God, Enter not into judgement with thy servant O Lord: and a little after: when hee had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded speciall faith (whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>h the Papists cannot abide) he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aith, <hi>ipse peccata condonat, ipse donat merita, &amp; pramia nihilominus ispe redonat,</hi> hee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth our sinnes, he giveth us merits or good workes, and he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse giveth us the rewards.</p>
               <p>In which words are contayned six good arguments against merit of condignity.</p>
               <p>The first, If the passions of this life (even martyrdome it selfe) are
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:22501:301"/>
not condigne or worthy to the future glory though one did beare them all, then much lesse, are our actions or good workes: But the passions of this time, though one man should sustayne them all, are not condigne or worthy to the future glory: therefore much lesse are our good workes worthy of that glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Condigne merits are such that eternall life is due unto them by right, insomuch as God should seeme to doe wrong if he did not bestow it, as the Papists most presumptuously teach: But our good workes are not such, as <hi>Bernard</hi> here plainely testifieth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our good workes are not condigne merits of eternall life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Those things which bee the gifts of God, doe not merit of God, yea they are so farre from meriting at the hands of God, that they make men, who have them, debtours to God, and not God to them. But our good workes, which some call merits, are all of them the gifts of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Betweene merits of condignity and the reward there is an equall proportion: But what are all our good workes, which they call merits, to so great glory?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They who have condigne merits, may boldly appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement of God, and challenge their due reward: but the holiest man that liveth ought to say with <hi>David,</hi> enter not into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thy servant O Lord, for no man living shall be justified in thy sight, if thou enter into judgement with him.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If God doth give unto us both our good works or merits and also the reward, then our good workes doe not condignely merit everlasting life: but the antecedent is true, therefore the consequent.</p>
               <p>Of these six <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth onely the second, and that onely he answereth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Bernard</hi> teacheth, that eternall life is not due to merits by right absolutely, because they presuppose both the grace and the promise of God; but grace and promise being presupposed, eternall life is due by right, which he would prove out of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Reply, <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh with presupposall, both of Gods grace and promise; and teacheth that good workes, though procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from grace, though having the promise of reward; yet to them eternall life is not due by right, neither doe they merit it condignely, as is proved by the six reasons, whereof <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answeareth never a one. For in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> first reason he speaketh of the sufferings, according to the Apostles meaning, of the sonnes and heires of God, which they suffer for or with Christ; having this promise that if they suffer with Christ they shall be glorified with him: yet these, though one man should sustaine them all, are not condigne to the future glory.</p>
               <p>As for the second which he would seeme to answere, instead of explaining it, he plainely contradicteth it, saying that our merits are such as eternall life is due to them by right.</p>
               <p>In the third argument <hi>Bernard</hi> doth not onely presuppose, that the good works or merits, where of he speaketh, doe proceed from grace;
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:22501:301"/>
but from thence proveth, that because they are Gods gifts, they cannot merit of God; but the more a man hath of them, the more he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to God.</p>
               <p>In the fourth he sheweth, that betweene all our workes, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much proceeding from grace, and the future glory which is promised to them, there is no proportion.</p>
               <p>In the fifth he speaketh of them that are most godly, who have both grace and promise of glory, that they are so farre from condigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that if God should enter into judgement with them, none of them could be justified in his sight.</p>
               <p>In the sixth he setteth downe the degrees of grace freely bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us: that hee doth <hi>condonare peccata, donare merita, &amp; redonare praemia.</hi> Of his grace hee forgiveth our sinnes, of his grace he giveth us good workes, which hee calleth merits: of his grace redoubled upon us he graciously giveth the reward, which hee hath freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, as for his proofes out of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 6. I shall answere in their due <note n="t" place="margin">Infr. adar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum. 4.</note> place. Unto this Testimony <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another out of the same Sermon. It is necessary first of all to beleeve that thou canst not have remission of sinnes but by the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of God: then, that thou canst have no good worke, unlesse he also give it: lastly, that by no good workes thou canst merit, that is, obtaine eternall life, unlesse it also be freely given thee: <hi>nisi gratis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; illa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. VII. The other three places are these. First, <hi>Totum hominis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Psalm. 91. serm. 15. In cantic. serm. 61. In attercat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cum Diabolo.</note> 
                  <hi>meritum est, si totam spem suam ponat in eo, qui totum hominem salvum facit.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Proinde meritum meum, miseratio Domini.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Fateor, non sum dignus ego</hi> I confesse I am not worthy, neither can I by mine owne merits obtaine the Kingdome of heaven. But my Lord pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing it by a double right, the inheritance of his Father, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his passion, contenting him selfe with the one, hee giveth mee the other.</p>
               <p>To these three together <hi>Bellarmine</hi> frameth two mis-shapen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres. First, that <hi>Bernards</hi> meaning was, that our merits are not of our selves, but from Gods mercy, and that hee would prove out of his 68. Sermon on the <hi>Canticles: Merita habere cures, habita data noveris.</hi> And therefore, say I, his meaning was, that our good workes doe not merit: For being his free gifts, they make us indebted to God, as he teacheth, and not him to us. But indeed <hi>Bernard</hi> doth not speake of our workes or merits, either as from us, or as in us, but of the mercy of God in pardoning our sinnes for the merit of his Sonne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whiles God aboundeth with mercies in Christ, he saith hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want merits. For mans justice is Gods indulgence, and therefore blessed is the man, to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne: <hi>O solus</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">In Cantic. serm. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>verè beatus, cuinon imputavit Dominus peecatum—omnes enim pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caverunt—sufficit mihi ad omnem justitiam solum habere propitium cui soli peccavi.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="594" facs="tcp:22501:302"/>His second answere is conjecturall, that perhaps <hi>Bernard</hi> out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility (and perhaps not) was ignorant of his merits, and out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of his owne grace did not trust in his merits, but in the mercie of God alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> He knew that he had no merits, but Gods mercies in Christ, because he was not ignorant that he had many sins, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he was confident in the mercies of God and merits of Christ. Neither was he so uncertaine of such inherent righteousnesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as whereby he might hope to be justified and saved, as hee was certaine of the contrary.</p>
               <p>As for his allegation out of the 68. <hi>serm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Cantic.</hi> It is evident, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> of the Gospell were to bee saved by the justification of faith, were meant by those, who being called at the eleventh houre, were the first that in the evening received the gift of the wages appointed for the labour of the whole day: he addeth these words. <hi>Merces qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ex dono nulla est, quia debetur ex opere, sed gratuitam Deus omnibus ex fidei justificatione donavit.</hi> Wages indeed by gift there is none, because by the worke it is due: but to all by the justification of faith God hath given the same free. Whence I argue: No wages is of free gift. Why? because it is due to the worke.</p>
               <q>Eternall life is of free gift, which God giveth to all that beleeve by the justification of faith. Therefore eternall life is not wages.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Hilarie</hi> elsewhere saith, that the kingdome of God<note place="margin">In Mat. can. 5. 9.</note> is the wages of such as live well. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is <hi>merces</hi> indeed <hi>non debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta sed gratuita;</hi> not wages, but a free reward. For so in this very place he calleth it first, <hi>donum mercedis</hi> the gift of reward, secondly, <hi>gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> free, thirdly, in the words next following <hi>gratuitam mercedem,</hi> a free reward; and lastly hee saith, that the gift of grace doth give the reward of the Law well and blamelessely kept, to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve by faith, being of the last made the first, that is, saved. For the first which were made last, who murmured at this free reward, were of the many that were called, <note n="z" place="margin">Matth. 20. 16.</note> but not of the few which are chosen. Absurd therefore is his answere, who saith, that <hi>Hillarie</hi> saith no more, but that faith and justification by faith is the free gift of God, but that there is not a word to signifie that heaven is not the wages of good workes which notwithstanding is the thing to bee concluded from hence. So that according to this wife exposition, by the wages, which according to the parable is in the evening given to the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, is faith, or justification by faith, meant, and not eternall life which is the end of our faith and the reward of all our labours; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of all Writers, even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe is signified by the day-penny given to them who of the last were made first: For the day-penny was both the mercenary wages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for by those who were first; and the free reward, which the bounty of the Master of the vineyard bestowed freely on the last, who were made first, that is, saved.</p>

Therefore the forme of heavenly decrees doth proceed with men, not according to our merits, but according to Gods mercie. To this a frivolous answere is given, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of merits, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguished from Gods mercie: when <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and of all the faithfull who are endued with grace, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding are not able to doe or suffer any thing worthy of the future glory.</p>

               <p>To this an impudent answere is given, that they are said to hope in Gods mercie, who hope that their good workes, proceeding from the grace of God, are by his mercie made meritorious of eternall life.

                  <hi>Theodoret,</hi> The salvation of men dependeth on<note place="margin">11.</note> Gods mercie alone: for wee doe not attaine unto it, as wages: but it is the gift of Gods goodnesse, wherefore the Lord saith, <hi>Propter me salvabo,</hi> I will save for mine owne sake, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this the answere is shamelesse: that this place maketh not for our purpose. And why? For by salvation is not meant eternall life, but of our first vocation, wherof there is no shew. As though <hi>Theodoret</hi> did contend that we doe not attaine to our first vocation (by which we are as it were called into the vineyard) as wages. And againe, he speaketh of the Church, that is, of them that are already called, and no doubt, but that by the same grace, by which wee are elected, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, justified, wee are also saved: but that was free and undeserved, and therefore so is this.</p>

               <p>It is answered, that although the reward doe much surpasse the paines, yet it is a just reward. No doubt. But why just?

This translation therefore, as it is barbarous,
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:22501:307"/>
so it is impious, in making God beholden unto us. Yea but saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> this word being joyned with that of sacrifices. doth not onely signifie, that God is delighted with good workes, but that his favour is procured, and hee induced to reward them that doe well. <hi>Answer.</hi> The Apostle doth not say <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as in the text of the Apostle. For the sacrifice of Christ alone by it selfe is propitiatory; the sacrifices of the Law, onely as they were types of it. As for the spirituall sacrifices, whereof the Apostle speaketh, they are not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> acceptable and well pleasing in Christ, as being perfumed with the odours of his sacrifice. This therefore was but a poore and indeed a base shift, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was put to, who finding no releefe in the originall text of the Scripture, is faine to flee unto corrupt translations, as he doth not only in these two places alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alleaged; but also in that allegation of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> for <hi>placatur:</hi> and as afterwards wee shall see in citing <hi>Ignatius</hi> and other Greeke Fathers.</p>
               <p>§. III. And this is all the footing that the name merit hath in the Scriptures. For though, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> adde two other arguments: yet they belong not to the name but to the thing. So that here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might have begun his third Chapter with this transition, <hi>sed ut ad rem ipsam veniamus,</hi> Having spoken of the name, let us come to the thing. For his other two arguments, the one from the word <hi>Dignity,</hi> the other, from the name <hi>reward</hi> used in the Scriptures, doe not prove the use of the of the name <hi>merit</hi> in the holy Scriptures, but serve, in his conceit, to prove the thing; and are indeed two principall arguments which he bringeth to prove the merit of good workes, which it shall suffice to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in their due place.

Nothing can be added to this benevolence. Who is he that will say, let me heale thee, and I give thee a reward. Of this free reward wee have examples and Testimonies in the holy Scriptures; as first, that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the first place citeth <note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> very impertinently to prove the name merit, <hi>Gen,</hi> 15. 1. where the Lord saith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 127. 3. heritage and reward used promiscuously.

And so <hi>merces</hi> and <hi>gratia,</hi> as was noted before out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 46. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 30. Such a reward is our inheritance in heaven, which is therefore called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of inheritance, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24.

Among men wages hath place, because the labourer deserveth it, and he that hireth him is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the labour, and there is ordinarily a due proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the labour and the wages. But with God it is otherwise: we can deserve nothing of him, neither is hee benefited by our labours, neither is there any proportion betweene our workes and the reward of eternall life. The proposition therefore, though by him taken for granted, is by us to be denyed.</p>

For the first: I affirme, that from parables nothing can be proved that is besides the scope of them. The scope of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is to shew, that many who are first shall be last, and the last first, and that many are called but few chosen, as appeareth both by the last verse of the former Chapter, for proofe whereof this parable is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> propounded, for so he saith, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>For</hi> the kingdome of heaven, &amp;c. And also by the sixteenth verse of the Chapter, which is the reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parable. So the last shall be first, and the first last, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be called but few are chosen. The first are they who were called early in the morning, and hired for a certaine wages or hire, <hi>viz.</hi> for a penny by the day. But the first, in the sequele of the parable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the last. If therefore it bee alleaged, that to these eternall life was given for the hire of their labour; I say, it is not onely besides, but also contrary to the scope of the parable, which was to shew, that those who were first c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lled, were of the many that are called, but not
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:22501:308"/>
of the few that are chosen, and consequently, not of the few that are saved. The penny therefore that was promised by the housholder, and received by these workemen, doth not signifie eternall life as Saint<note n="l" place="margin">Regul. cont: 255. 256.</note> 
                  <hi>Basill</hi> supposeth. For though they received the penny, yet because they were called but not chosen, they missed of eternall life. Thus therefore I argue: Eternall life was not received by these worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for they were called, and not chosen. The penny, which was promised, was received by these workemen, <hi>vers.</hi> 10, 11, 14. therefore the penny, which was promised, is not eternall life. And this may be gathered out of the parable it selfe. First, because these we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e meere hirelings, who would not worke, but for a certaine hire, led onely by reward, for the obtayning whereof they trusted in their owne merits. Secondly, because after they had received their penny, they envied their fellow workemen, whom the Lord rewarded, not according to their merits, but according to his owne bounty, to which they trusted and not to their owne merit. Thirdly, because they murmured against the housholder, as if he had not dealt with them according to their desert, who had wrought twelve houres, and had borne the burden and the heate of the day. Fourthly, because being sharpely reproved by the Lord of the vineyard, they were sent away with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, saying to one of them, which was intended to all: take that which is thine, and bee gone: but whither doth hee bid them goe? <hi>Basil</hi> gues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this may further be proved by conference with the like place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 30. where our Saviour having told the Iewes, who were first called, that they should bee excluded out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the Gentiles from all parts of the world should be admitted, saith, and behold there are last which shall be first, meaning the Gentiles: and there are first, meaning the Iewes, which shall be last, that is, excluded out of the number of them that shall bee saved. For as elsewhere also he saith, Many are called <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 14. (of which number was hee that comming without his wedding garment was cast into utter darkenesse, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.) but few are chosen.</p>

For God in us doth crowne nothing but his owne grace; who, if he would deale strictly with us, there would no man living bee justified in his sight.

I rejoyne, that it is given to the works, according to the promise, that is, as a free reward.</p>
               <p>To the second hee saith, that eternall is more properly called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than inheritance, &amp;c. I answere, primarily it is the inheritance intended before all time in Christ without respect of workes, and in the fulnesse of time purchased by Christ, and so promised to all the faithfull: and yet in a secondary respect, that we might be allured to obedience and to good workes, by which we might be fitted for that heavenly inheritance, into which no uncleane thing can enter, it is also promised as a gracious reward, freely given of God, not merited by us. Even as a father having adopted a sonne, thereby intending to him and indeed entitling him to his inheritance; should upon his obedience, either already performed, or to be performed, promise to make him his heire. In this case, who seeeth not, that although the sonne come to his fathers patrimonie, both as his inherita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither is that the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable title, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here absurdly avoucheth, unlesse that we rre to thinke, that the mercenary title of an hired servant, is more honourable than the hereditary title of a sonne. For this is all the honour, which, by their doctrine, accrueth to the children of God, that they turne the adopted sonnes of God into mercenary servants, and the inheritance of sonnes into the wages of servants.

That they who were called at the eleventh houre, and so wrought but one houre, laboured as much as the first, who laboured all the day: which is not worth the confuting. For if in one houre they laboured as much, as the other in twelve, then deserved they as great a reward at the least. Why then did their fellow labourers expect a greater reward?

               <p>§ XI. Before I apply mine answer to the parts of his Syllogisme,<note place="margin">The answer.</note> I am to propound a twofold distinction concerning the reward of our inheritance. First, that it may bee considered either as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, or as our reward. Secondly, that it may be considered in respect either of the substance of it, as it is eternall life, or of the degrees of glory therein. As it is our inheritance, as it is eternall life, it is one and the same equally given to all that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e saved, and not given unequally according to the proportion of our virtues or workes. It is one and the same, first, in respect of the same merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause, which is the merit of Christ. For as by his righteousnesse we are equally justified; so by his merits we are equally saved, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made partakers of that inheritance, which by the same price of his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rits is equally purchased for all that truely beleeve. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is one and the same <hi>objectivè,</hi> in respect of the same object, it being the vision or fruition of the same God, who is the chiefe good. Thirdly, in respect of continuance, in regard whereof it is called eternall life, which is one and the same to all, being the same everlasting inheritance, and the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ternall fruition of
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:22501:310"/>
God and Fellowship, which we shall ever have with Christ, and by him with the whole Trinity. But however eternall life in respect of the substance be on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and the same equally procured by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ; yet it is not to be doubted, that there are divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory, where with God doth crowne the divers degrees of grace, which he hath bestowed on his children in this life. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all that shall bee saved shall have fulnesse of felicity, so much as they are capable of; yet some are more capable than others. Even as vessels of divers measures being put into the sea will all be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll of liquor, according to their capacity; yet some will containe a greater quantity than others. So all the Saints, though all full of happinesse, yet shall not all bee endued with the same measure of glory, but according to their capacity. This is that which heretofore I alleaged out of <note n="*" place="margin">

For although, according to the proportion both of habituall grace, and of actuall obedience (which we call good workes) the degrees of glory in the life to come shall bee bestowed: yet these degrees are not thereby merited; but God doth graciously crowne his greater graces, which hee freely bestowed in this life, with a greater measure of glory in the life to come. Besides, <hi>Bellarmin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> and other Papists doe teach, that God crowneth our good workes <hi>supra condignum,</hi> therefore those crownes cannot be merited <hi>ex condigno.</hi> Secondly, I deny his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, averting that eternall life it selfe is not bestowed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of our workes, but as it is wholly merited by the obedience of Christ; so is it equally bestowed upon all the faithfull, who are equally justified by the merits of Christ.</p>
               <p>§ XII. But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cavilleth with two answeres given,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> cavils.</note> as he saith, by our Divines, the former, that divers rewards are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to good workes both in this life and in the world to come, but not eternall life it selfe, against which he proveth, that good workes are rewarded with eternall life, and that there are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the world to come, which doe not belong to eternall life. Whereas no doubt the meaning of those, who gave that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, was this, that there are divers degrees of rewards given both in this life, and in the world to come, as namely the divers degrees of glory, but there are not divers degrees of eternall life, that is one and the same to all that are saved. We doe not deny but eternall life is the reward of good workes, and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might have spared his paynes in proving that, which we doe not deny; but we deny it to be given in divers degrees, according to the proportion of mens workes. The other answere, that et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rnall life is to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> given to good workes, no otherwise b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t as they are signes of faith; which also hee solemnely disputeth against, utterly mistaking the matter. For first, wee say, that God doth graciously reward the virtues and
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:22501:311"/>
obedience of his owne children, not as their merits, but as his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Secondly, we say indeed, that in the Gospell eternall life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to those that beleeve without respect of workes, and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on denounced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>gainst those that beleeve not: but because both faith and infidelity are inward and hidden, and many deceive themselves with an inward opinion, and an outward profession of faith: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord at the last day will proceed in judgement, according to the evidence of mens workes. So that the Lord pronounceth the sentence, according to workes as the signes and evidence of faith, but rewardeth both faith and them, as his owne gifts and graces. Howbeit more properly eternall life it selfe is rendred to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of faith, which is the righteousnesse and merits of Christ imputed to them that beleeve, by which the faithfull are equally justified, and equally entituled to the kingdome of heaven; but the degrees of glory are given according to the degrees of our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that is, to the degrees both of the habits of faith and other graces, and of the acts and exercise thereof, which wee call good workes. All which, being Gods owne free gifts, hee doth freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, crowning his greater graces, with greater glory.</p>

Secondly, any one sinne meriteth death, because it is a breach of the Law, yea, of the whole law, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 10. but not any one good worke can merit heaven, because it is not the fulfilling of the whole law: for there must be a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all duties. In so much that if a man should performe all the Commandements, and faile in one; the breach of that one maketh him guilty of all. Thirdly, evill workes are <note n="z" place="margin">Greg. Moral. lib. ult. cap. ult.</note> purely and perfectly evill, and therefore absolutely deserve death: but the good workes are not purely and perfectly good, as I have heretofore prooved. therefore death is the due stipend of sinne, but eternall life is the free gift of God. Fourthly, sinne is absolutely meritorious of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but so is not our obedience of Salvation. For though we could performe all the commandements by a totall, perpetuall, and perfect obedience, yet wee must acknowledge our selves unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:22501:312"/>
and much lesse could we merit thereby, because we have done but our duety; and where is no more but duety, there can bee no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Debitum non est meritum.</hi>

               <p>§ XIIII. His third argument is taken <hi>from those places which do so testifie eternall life to be rendred to good workes, that they place the very reason why eternall life is given in good workes.</hi> The places bee these, <hi>Matth. 25. 34, 35. Come, ye blessed of my Father, possesse the kingdome prepared f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These are they who came out of great tribulation, &amp;c. therefore they are before the Throne of God. In which places the particles, <hi>enim, quia, ideo,</hi> for, because, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are all causall. His reason standeth thus: To what things the causall particles are applied, they are causes of that to which they have relation; as namely of Salvation:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>To workes of charity the causall particles are applied:</p>
                  <p>Therefore workes of charity are causes of Salvation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To the proposition I answere, that causall particles doe not alwaies, nor for the most part, signifie causes so properly called. For that is a grosse er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>our of the Papists, as I noted before. The word <hi>cause</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is used properly to signifie that argument which hath relation onely to its effect, by virtue whereof the effect hath its being, either as <hi>from</hi> the efficient, or as <hi>of</hi> the matter, or as <hi>by</hi> the forme, or as <hi>for</hi> the end. Sometimes it is used generally to signifie any argument or reason whatsoever, which is not the cause of the thing, or of the being of that whereof it is said to bee a cause, but of the consequence or conclusion, and thus the rendring of any reason is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a rendring of the cause, though perhaps it bee from the effect, or any other argument. And forasmuch as persons are discerned and knowne by their effects, (for as our Saviour saith, By their fruits you shall know them) therefore it is usuall in the Scriptures from the effect to argue and declare the cause: As thus: God is mercifull, for hee rewardeth the godly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their workes. God is just, for hee rewardeth the wicked accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their sinnes. This man is elect, because he truely beleeveth and repenteth; this man truely beleeveth, because hee is fruitfull of good workes. This is a good tree, for it bringeth forth good fruite. To the woman that was a sinner <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 7. 47.</note> much was forgiven for shee loved much. In those and infinite more examples the cause or reason which is rendred is from the effect. Therefore the proposition is false.</p>

God had long before made this gracious promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> without respect of this or any other his workes, and had this act of obedience never beene, the promise of the promised seed in his posterity would have beene performed, so that the grace and love of God was the onely cause, why hee promised to send his owne Sonne, who should take on him the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not <hi>Abrahams</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. All that can truely bee said is, that upon this obedience God tooke occasion to renew his promise, and to confirme it by oath, for the further confirmation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith. So that his obedience was so farre from being the cause of the thing promised, as it was but the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of renewing the promise.

                  </gap>ing to this justice, is not therfore merited.</p>
               <p>More particularly justice is either in word or deed. God is just in his word, both in respect of his precepts which are just,<note n="b" place="margin">

And in this sense God is said to be just, when hee doth render unto us that which he hath promised. So in the places alleaged, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 12. Hee is just also in his workes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 145. 17. For God doth whatsoever he willeth,<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 1. 11.</note> and whatsoever he willeth, that is just. This justice by Philosophers is distinguished into <hi>distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>commutative,</hi> both observing equality; the former geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; the later arithmeticall. But this distinction doth not agree to the justice of God in respect of the later branch, which consisteth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, that is, in mutuall giving and receiving. For God giveth all things to all, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 25. but receiveth not any thing from any. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I have said before, and therefore cannot be a debtour to any, but to himselfe in regard o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> his promise. Thus then the justice of God, which is in fact, may more fully be distinguished: that it is either <hi>disponens,</hi> or <hi>remunerans,</hi> disposing, either as a just, but most free and absolute Lord of all; or as he is the just God, the Creatour, Governour, and Preserver of all things. Remunerating, as he is the just judge. As a most free and absolute Lord, hee disposeth things according to his absolute will and pleasure. Who possessing<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 14. 22.</note> all things by full and absolute right, may according to his pleasure dispose of them, doing with his owne what he pleaseth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 15. As hee is the just God, that is the Creatour, Preserver and Governour of all, hee disposeth of all things according to his goodnesse, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. 48. giving all good things

to all, not <hi>universa singulis,</hi> but such as are agreeable and fitting to all, according to their severall kind, nature, and quality. And from this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice the order of the whole <hi>Vniverse</hi> dependeth.

And as he is God of all and just to all in giving to all those good things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them: so is he after a more peculiar manner the God of the faithfull, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. even the God of their righteousnesse, <hi>Psa.</hi> 4. 1. as their justifier and Saviour, by the righteousnesse of God<note n="h" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> and our Saviour Iesus Christ, by imputation whereof he is just in justifying us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. and in remitting our sinnes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. and accepting of us as righteous in Christ unto eternall life: and to this justice of Christ and not to ours, doth the Lord in justice, as a just Iudge, render eternall life, being no lesse just than mercifull in saving us. And in this justice of God as well as his mercie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are wee to repose our affiance, both for our justification and salvation. For if wee truely beleeve in Christ, we have in him satisfied Gods justice, in him we have fulfilled the Law, and therefore remission of sinnes and eternall life is in justice due unto us, not for any merits of ours, but for the merits of Christ.

               <p>The proposition therefore is not true, unlesse it bee understood of commutative justice, which belongeth not to God. For the reward which God giveth to good workes, if it bee according to his universall justice; it is to bee ascribed not to our merits, but to his goodnesse. If according to his justice in word; not to our merits, but to his fidelity. If according to his justice, as he is absolute Lord; not to our merits but to his good pleasure. If according to his justice, as he is Creator, &amp;c. not to our merits but to his bounty.

For it is just, that the righteous judge should give to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, having kept the faith, that crowne of righteousnesse, which God hath promised, and which Christ hath purchased, and which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Christ his merit and righteousnesse imputed, is in justice due, not onely to the Apostle, but to all the faithfull, who are described by this note, that they love his comming.

Godlinesse is profitable for all things, having the promise of this life, and of that which is to come, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 12. he shall receive the crowne of life, which God hath promised to them that love him. Now, saith hee, <hi>a promise made with the condition of a worke, doth not onely make the thing promised a debt (for he that promised is bound to stand to his promises) but also causeth, that hee who shall fulfill the worke, may be said to have merited the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and may by right require it as his reward.</hi> His reason briefly is this: Eternall life is promised upon condition of good workes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good workes are meritorious of eternall life.</p>
               <p>I deny the consequence: though eternall life bee promised upon condition of good workes, yet good workes are not the meritorious cause thereof.</p>
               <p>First, The reasons of my deniall are these: first, because eternall life, before we had a being, was freely intended to all of us that shall be saved, not according to our workes, but according to Gods owne purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Iesus before all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because Christ hath merited it for all the elect: and there is no other meritorious cause of salvation besides him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because in Christ it is freely promised to all the faithfull, as their inheritance purchased by Christ, and therefore not to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by their owne merit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As it was a reward freely promised, so it is freely given, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the free gift of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Because, as it selfe is the free gift of God, so the graces and good workes to which it is promised as a reward, are the free gifts of God; of which the more we have, the more are we indebted to God: so sarre are wee from meriting any thing at the hands of God by them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Because all our workes are <hi>debita</hi> debts or dutyes, which we owe unto God: and therefore when we have done all, wee must say, we are unprofitable servants.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Because there can bee no merit of condignity, where is not an equall proportion betweene the worke and the reward.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Because our best workes are stained with the flesh.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Because God is our absolute Lord, and wee are his bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants:
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:22501:316"/>
to whom we owe our selves and whatsoever wee can doe: Neither are we able to render unto him so much as is due, and much lesse can we merit any thing from him.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Because God to all his creatures giveth all<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 17. 25.</note> good things, but receiveth<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 11. 35.</note> nothing from any, and therefore cannot be made a debtour to any of his creatures.</p>
               <p>Therefore though eternall life bee promised to good workes, yet it is not merited by them.</p>
               <p>Yea but saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the promise made with a condition of workes doth make the thing promised due. <hi>Answ.</hi> First, where the condition is fully performed, there the thing promised is due. But wee all faile in the fulfilling. And therefore if reward bee given to such as come short of their duety, as all doe, it must be acknowledged to bee of Gods grace, and not of our merit. Secondly, the thing promised is due not by merit but by promise, not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>espect of the worke done, which is a dutie, and that not so perfectly performed, but that it needeth pardon, but onely in respect of the promise: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee who hath promised hath bound himselfe to keepe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. But Gods promise was <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> non de debito,</hi> I say, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was freely to give eternall life, and so according to his promise he freely bestoweth it. Yea but, saith he, by performing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not onely the thing promised becommeth due; but he also that hath performed, may truely be said to have merited the reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. But this, say I, should have beene proved, and not taken for granted, being denyed by us, and disproved by all the tenne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even now produced.</p>
               <p>§. XXII. His sixth argument is taken from those places wherein<note place="margin">
                     <hi>

                        </gap>ellarmines</hi> sixth argument from those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthines.</note> mention is made of dignity or worthinesse. For as before hee had said in his second Chapter, to be worthy of reward, and to merit it is all one, according to that saying of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 7. the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is worthy of his hire. The places are these, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 3. 5. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them and found them worthy of himselfe, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5. that you may be counted worthie of Gods kingdome, for which allso ye suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, Luk. 20. 35. They that shall be accounted worthy of that world, and the resurrection from the dead. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 4. they shall walke with me in whites because they are worthy. His reason may thus bee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: whosoever are worthy of eternall life they doe merit or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it.</p>
               <q>Those that doe good workes are worthy of eternall life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they doe merit or deserve it.</q>
               <p>I answere by distinction. For there is difference betweene these two, to be worthy, and to be counted worthy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be worthy by a mans owne worth or merit, or by acceptation and grace or favour vouchsafed by another to be esteemed worthy: to be worthy in our selves, or to be accepted as worthy in Christ. If the word be understood in the former sense, I deny the assumption: if in the latter, I deny the proposition. For to be worthy, or rather
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:22501:316"/>
to bee accounted worthy of eternall life by mercie and grace, not <hi>dignitate sua, sed dignatione divina,</hi> not in themselves, but in Christ, which is the case of all the faithfull: and yet to merit and to deserve it by a mans owne worth, implyeth a contradiction.</p>
               <p>Against the assumption I say, that none of the faithfull, though fruitfull of good workes, is in himselfe, or by his owne worth or merit worthy of eternall life. This hath beene the confession of the faithfull in all ages, as I partly noted before. <hi>Iacob</hi> confesseth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. that hee was lesse than the least of Gods mercies, that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of them, though but temporall; what would he have said of eternall? <hi>David</hi> professeth himselfe unworthy of those temporall honours which God had vouchsafed unto him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> confesseth, that hee was not worthy to carry Christs shoes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. or to loose the latchet of them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 27. The Centurion, whose faith is so highly commended, professeth himselfe not to bee worthy, that Christ should come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his roofe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 8. The afflictions of this life, though one man did beare them all, are not worthy of the future glory, <hi>Roman.</hi> 8. 18.

               <p>§ XXIII. His seventh argument is taken from those places<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because God is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge.</note> where it is said, that God is a righteous judge, and no accepter of persons, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34. but <hi>acception of persons is a vice contrary to distributive justice,</hi> viz. <hi>when a judge giveth reward without merits, or a greater reward to lesse merits, or a lesse reward to greater merits. God therefore in the retribution of rewards considereth the merits of men, and according to the diversity of merits he assigneth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of eternall life.</hi> This argument, if it shall conclude the question, must thus bee framed: If God doe render to men the rewards of
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:22501:317"/>
eternall life, neither without their merits, nor greater rewards to lesse, nor lesse to greater merits; than God in the retribution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards considereth the merits of men; and consequently the good workes of the faithfull are meritorious of eternall life: but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is true, therefore the consequent. The assumption hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, because the contrary is repugnant to distributive justice. Thus therefore he proveth it. If God doe render rewards to men without their merits, or greater rewards to lesse merits, or lesse rewards to greater merits, then is he an unjust judge, and an accepter of persons (which God forbid.)</p>
               <q>But God is a righteous judge, and no accepter of persons, as is proved by the testimonies alleaged: therfore he doth not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to men rewards without their merits, neither doth he give greater rewards to lesse, nor lesse rewards to greater merits.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny the assumption of the former syllogisme, and the proposition of the second. The assumption was, that God doth not render to men rewards of eternall life without their merits, &amp;c. For that God doth give the reward of eternall life to some, at the least, without their merits, it is evident in the elect infants, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no merits of their owne, are saved only by the merits of Christ. And the like is to be said of all other beleevers, for whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by his merits hath purchased everlasting life. Therefore that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is so farre from being true, that the contrary thereof is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies true, <hi>viz.</hi> that God doth give the reward of eternall life, as his free gift to all that are saved without any merit of theirs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any other merit of eternall life but the merit of Christ, which is more than sufficient for all that beleeve.</p>
               <p>The proposition of the prosyllogisme hath two branches in both the parts thereof, of both which I deny the consequence, for as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the first, although God doe render to men the reward of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life without their merits, yet hee is not an unjust Iudge. For though they have no merit of their owne, yet they have the all-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient satisfaction, and the infinite merit of Christ, unto which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is in justice due. For the second: Although the Lord should give greater rewards to lesse offices and graces, and lesse to greater, yet were hee not unjust, nor an accepter of persons. For by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the workmen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. Wee learne, that the Master of the vineyard, though he gave the day-penny to them that wrought but one houre, which was as much as he gave them that wrought twelve houres, yet was not unjust therin. For in that which is free, and meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of grace, there is no injustice nor acception of persons. Indeed where the wages or hire is to bee rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as deserved and earned by the workemens labours, it is to bee distributed according to distributive justice. But where the reward is free and of grace, the rewarder may doe with his owne what <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 20. 15.</note> pleaseth him: GOD especially, to whom, in all things whatsoever hee doth, his will is the rule of justice.</p>

But wee acknowledge, that God will render to every man according to his workes, rewarding the good workes of the godly (which are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called merits, both themselves, and their reward being the free gifts of God) with eternall life, and the evill workes of the wicked (which properly are called their merits) with everlasting death.

                  </note> before I examine the particular testimonies, I am to admonish the Reader, that hee have an eye to the point in question. For that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Fathers doe often use the termes of <hi>merit</hi> or <hi>meriting,</hi> we doe acknowledge, but without any advantage to the Papist. For the Papist useth the words in the proper sense, for deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and desert. But merits with the Fathers signifie no more but good workes, or at the most good works, which God will reward: that is, either simply good workes, or with relation to reward. And the Verbe <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> merit,</hi> besides the generall sense of obtaining, or finding favour, which is very frequent, they use it more particularly for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing workes of grace which God will graciously reward. In which senses the use of the words, though unproper, were not to bee misliked in the Fathers, were it not that the after-writers have taken occasion thereby to use the words properly, for deservnig, and desert, and that in justice for the workes sake, as well in good workes, as in bad. I meane, that good workes doe as truely and as properly deserve eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as evill workes deserve everlasting death, which was not the meaning of the Fathers; who meant not, that a man doth deserve those good things at the hands of God, which by them hee is said to have merited. If therefore his allegation bee of merits and meriting used by the Fathers in the former, that is, the unproper senses, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are, hee shall proove nothing, but that the Fathers doe not dissent from us. And if they serve not to prove, either that the works of grace in themselves doe merit, that is, deserve eternall life, as the meritorious causes thereof: or that Christ hath by his merits made them meritorious, then doe they not at all make fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But I am confident, that they are not able to produce any one pregnant testimony of the ancient Fathers, affirming, either that our good workes doe truely and properly, that is condignely merit eternall life: or that Christ hath merited for our workes that they might bee meritorious of everlasting life.</p>

For having said before the words alleaged, that to our navigation in this life; the gift of governing, as it were, of our shippe is necessary, for we are all Merchants, &amp;c. for saith hee, in the next words after those which I alleaged last, many who from their youth have gathered geat store (namely of that heavenly wealth) in the middle of their life for the want of the skill of governing, and not able to withstand the tempests of temptations have made shipwracke, which saith he, is a miserable spectacle, <gap reason="foreign">

And thus God will repay the wicked for their demerits, and reward the godly according to their worthinesse, which standeth not <hi>in dignitate sua,</hi> but <hi>in dignatione divina,</hi> as I have said before.

                  </note> testifieth, wrote this booke when he was newly baptised, and as yet not accustomed or well versed in the Scriptures, and therefore if he should have written any thing therein contrary to that, which I have heretofore proved out of him, it ought not to prejudge those manifold pregnant Testimonies by mee cited before, which he wrought when he was of more mature judgement and of riper yeares. Notwithstanding out of this testimony such as it is, <hi>Bellarmin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> collecteth five conclusions against us. First, that a man (he meaneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o doubt a righteous man) hath the merits of eternall life; that is, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>Augustine</hi> to use the terme, that he hath good workes which God will reward with eternall life: and that we confesse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that eternall life is one and all our reward. But <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> doth not say <hi>un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> neither is it true. For temporall Blessings are also rewards <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>ad</hi> 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 10.</note>, though but petty rewards in comparison of eternall life: neither doth he say simply <hi>totum,</hi> but <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tum cujus promissione gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus.</hi>
                  <pb n="636" facs="tcp:22501:323"/>
For, temporall benefits we are to use, but not to set our hearts upon them: but spirituall blessings are those wherein <note n="e" place="margin">Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the reward of eternall life is given in justice, that we should not say, that it is given of meere liberality. But <hi>Augustine</hi> every where else teacheth, that it is given of grace, and that it is called grace, <hi>non ob aliud, nisi quia gratis datur,</hi> for no other cause but because it is fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ly given, and that it is not grace, <hi>si non sit omni modo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuita.</hi> Neither doth it hinder it to be of Gods free grace, that it is given in justice. For these two in the workes of God, especially in the worke of justification and salvation doe meet together. Grace and mercie in respect of us, in that he doth justifie and save us <hi>gratis</hi> by<note place="margin">f <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.</note> his grace: justice, not in respect of our merits, which in justice can merit nothing at the hands of God but punishment: but partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>pect of Christs merits, unto which eternall life is due; and partly in respect of his promise made in Christ to all that truely beleeve; which promise he is faithfull and just to performe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the reward is not given before they be found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it that shall have it, lest wee should fay, there is no dignity in workes. I answere, that our dignity standeth in Gods dignation or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in Christ: which dignity he vouchsafeth to all that truely beleeve in Christ. For to them Christ <note n="g" place="margin">Rom 10. 4.</note> is the end and complement of the Law: insomuch, that whosoever beleeve in Christ, they are esteemed to have fulfilled the Law: Wee acknowledge the dignitie of good workes, as being the fruits of the Spirit, and as being good, profitable, and necessary: but no dignity of merit doe we ascribe to them. And yet the faithfull are not therefore unworthy, nor desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of merits, so long as they are accepted in Christ, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his merits by faith: Unto which faith <hi>Augustine</hi> useth to ascribe merit. For indeed faith is that worke of. <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 29.</note> God, which hee requireth instead of all our merits, because by it wee are partakers of the merits of Christ: which whosoever hath is not without merits, nor unworthy of the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that it is a most unjust thing to desire eternall life of God the most just judge, before we merit to receive it. Where, faith he, he plainely condemneth all Lutherans, who will not by their workes merit eternall life, and yet by assurance of faith they presume it shall be given them. <hi>Answ.</hi> If by his word, <hi>petere,</hi> he meane desiring by prayer, I say we must desire it, before we be worthy of it in our selves. But <hi>Augustine</hi> hath the word <hi>poscere,</hi> meaning, that no man ought to challeng or demand eternal life as his due, before he hath deserved to receive it: To which I answere, that none can deserve to receive it by their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e merits, and that none but Pharisees will challenge it. But yet all that truely beleeve in Christ doe in him deserve it, yea in him they have it: and he that will not beleeve this, he maketh God a lyar, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10, 11. and therefore every one that knoweth himselfe
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:22501:323"/>
to beleeve, doth or ought to know, that he hath eternall life, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 13. He might have added a sixt collection, that nothing is more unjust, than that God should give rewards to men before they deserve them. But this sheweth the unsoundnesse of this Testimony, not beseeming <hi>Augustine.</hi> For what God giveth, he freely giveth; and in that which is <hi>grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

May not God doe with his owne <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 5. 15.</note> what pleafeth him: and therfore no unjustice, when he gave the whole dayes wages to them that had wrought but an houre, and therefore to such as had not deserved it. And if it be unjust with God to give the reward of eternall life to them that have not in their owne persons deserved it, what will he say of Gods dealing with the elect infants, who dying in their infancie are crowned with eternall life. This Testimonie therefore was but the assertion of an ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Divine. And yet this Testimonie alone with our <note n="k" place="margin">Mal. 686.</note>

               <p>And these were all the testimonies of the Fathers, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thought good to produce: which when the Reader hath compared with those which I formerly alleaged, let him pronounce <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> whether wee, or the Papists, have the consent of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie in this great question of merits.</p>

                  <hi>added one evident reason from those things which were prooved in the former booke. For it hath beene demonstrated, that the good workes of the just are truely just, that they satisfie the Law of God, that they justifie a man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth that they are truely meritorious.</hi> Whereunto I ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rne this answere. First, to the Antecedent: that it hath beene sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated, that the worke of just or justified men, though they may bee said to bee truely good, yet they are not pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ly good, that they doe not satisfie the Law of God, that they doe not justifie a man before God: so farre are they from being truely meritorious. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to the consequence, that although they were truely good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by them men did satisfie the law of God by doing all that is commanded: yet so long as men do but their duety, they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselves to bee but unprofitable servants, neither doe they merit any thing at the hands of God. For <hi>Debitum non est meritum,</hi> that which is debt is not merit. And if they could, (which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,) by their obedience satisfie the commandement for the time to come; yet how shall they satisfie the penalty for their sinnes past? wherefore a servant is well apaied, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> said, if he escape the whippe, though hee cannot deserve so much as thankes, which is but a verball reward. But hee prooveth the consequence, <hi>because the chiefe reason why wee</hi> (poore heretikes) <hi>deny merits, is because wee thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ke that no worke in this life is truely just; or doth satisfie the law, but that all our workes are mortall sinnes in their owne nature, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> Though wee were heretickes (which hee with all his complices shall never bee able to prove) yet would it not become him to belie us. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee denie the good workes of the faithfull to bee truely just, neither doe wee say, that they are sinnes and much lesse mortall sinnes, neither is that the chiefe reason why wee deny them to bee meritorious, as you may perceive by the reasons before alleaged, neither if that reason doe (as it doth) prove them not to bee merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, doth it follow, that therefore the contrary doth prove them to bee meritorious at the hands of God. For though they were not onely truely, but also purely good, though they were not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor stayned with the flesh, as all are; yet so long as they are our duties, so long as they are Gods free gifts, so long as there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene them and the reward, so long as they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with manifold sinnes and infirmities, and so long as all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before alleaged against merits stand in force: it followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, that we neither doe or can by all the workes wee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, merit any good thing, and much lesse the eternall reward at the hands of God.</p>

But that in a secondary respect, after the glory of God, wee<note place="margin">But in a secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary respect.</note> may and ought to have an eye to the eternall reward, it is confessed, or rather prosessed by us.

               <p>Secondly, by plaine direction of Scripture, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12, 13. the saving grace of God doth teach us to performe the duties of sanctification in expectation of the happines hoped for. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9.

               <p>Thirdly, By the examples of the godly in the Scriptures, as first of <hi>Moses,</hi> who by faith refused to be called the sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp;c. because hee had an eye <gap reason="foreign">

Of the example of all examples our Saviour Christ, whom wee are to imitate: who for the joy, that was set before him, endured the crosse, and despised shame, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In doing good workes, which is the way wherein we are to walke we have an eye to the end of our journey, which is the end of our faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. and of our sanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. that is, the salvation of our soules.

               <p>Fifthly, Because as the glory of God is the soveraigne universall end; so eternall salvation is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the supreme particular end of man, subordinate to the universall end. And therefore as in all our actions wee are to have respect to the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. so wee may have respect to our salvation, as subordinate unto it. And who knoweth
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:22501:326"/>
not, but that the finall cause, though it bee last in execution, yet is the first in the intention.</p>
               <p>§. V. The thing which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> covertly intendeth, is, that it is lawfull to doe good workes with an intention to merit eternall life thereby, to which end if his discourse <hi>de intuitu mercedis</hi> bee not refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is impertinent: and yet not any one of his testimonies or proofes doth conclude so much we are to performe good workes, indeed that wee may obtaine and may gather assurance that we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the gracious reward, which God hath freely promised, and will freely bestow upon all those that lead a godly life: but not that wee should merit any reward of God, as due in justice for the works sake. And this is one of the Papists chiefe quarrels against us, that wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth discourage the people from good workes, in that we teach they doe not merit; nor are to be done to that end, when notwithstanding wee use betterarguments than they doe, to encourage men to well doing. But we reply, that the Papists, by telling the people, that they are to doe good workes, that thereby they may merit eternall life, doe teach them to marre their workes, and instead of performing works meritorious, or well pleasing to God, to doe that which is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable in his sight, as being derogatory from the al-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient merit of Christ. For if Christ hath fully purchased by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of heaven for us, then our merits need not: or if they need, then Christ his merit is not sufficient for us. We are therefore in the performance of good workes to have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to doe good workes to that end, that by them we may merit eternall life, which is purchased by the alone merit of Christ.</p>

               <p>The first condition is that the worke be good. For if it bee bad, it<note place="margin">The three first conditions not controverted.

For if the good worke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Gods grace, it cannot merit at Gods hand, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. And it is the opinion of some Papists, as it was of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, that the virtue of meriting, which they conceive to bee in their workes, proceedeth from the power of their owne free-will, as I have shewed before. Neither needed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to have heaped up Testimonies of Scriptures and Fathers to prove that free-will is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to good workes, unlesse hee dispute of free-will by nature. For that all good workes doe proceed from the will free by grace, and are voluntarily performed by the faithfull, there is no doubt to be made.</p>

The fifth condition, that he, who must be thought to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">The fifth is, of a man in state of grace.</note> be in the state of grace, and the childe of God by regeneration and adoption which he proveth against the aforesaid Doctor of Lovaine. This condition is also necessarily required to every good worke, not onely meritorious of heaven (for how should he attaine to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of heaven, who is not the sonne and heire of God) but also good and acceptable unto God. For without faith it is impossible to please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and without it, whatsoever is done is sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. And it is certaine, that untill the person be accepted, his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot bee acceptable. Neither whiles the tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither is any man in Christ, but he that is endued with a true faith, whereby he abideth in Christ, and Christ in him. And this we hold, both against the Papists, that no works of men not regenerate, are good, and with the Papists against the Pelagians, that they are not meritorious: which point good leave hath he had at large to dispute<note n="d" place="margin">

selves and all that we have, or can doe, who may exact from us what he pleaseth without any reward; we could not expect any remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him, unlesse it had pleased him for our encouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to well doing, to promise a reward unto us. But we must remember, that his promise is not <hi>de debito,</hi> but <hi>de gratuito,</hi> not of rendring a debt, but of giving a free reward: for he needed not to make a promise for doing those things which he commandeth, which without a promise we are bound to doe: and therefore in that he promiseth a reward, it is of his free grace; and when according to his promise hee giveth the reward, it is wholly of his grace, and not of our merit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when there is no proportion of equality betweene the worke and the reward, but the reward incomparably exceedeth the worke; it is evident, that such a reward promised to such a worke, can no way be due to the worke, as merited thereby, but is wholly to be ascribed to the bounty of the Lord, who freelygiveth what he had freely promised.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when a superaboundant reward is promised to a small worke, and the party to whom it is promised is no way able either to doe, or so much as to will the performance of it, but receiveth wholly his will and ability to performe it from his Lord: the thing promised cannot be ascribed to his merit, but to the gracious bounty of his Lord.<note place="margin">Seventhly, that it proceed from charity.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§. V. The seventh and last condition is that a meritorious work must proceed from charity, which we acknowledg to be required in every good worke. But in the proofe hereof he falleth into a nice dispute, proving against <hi>Guihielmus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> that the vertue of meriting is to be ascribed more principally to Charity than to faith. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this bee but an idle dispute, seeing neither faith nor charity doth truely and properly merit: yet I durst be bold to affirme, that if to either merit were to be ascribed, that it were rather to bee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to faith. For by faith, the merits of Christ are applyed unto us, and not by charity. By faith, we are entitled to Gods Kingdome, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> wee are not. By faith, wee obtaine the inheritance, which by charity we doe not. By faith, we are saved and not by charity. Faith is the condition of the covenant of grace, upon which, and no other grace, salva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                  </hi> speaketh, the character of the faithfull, and none are saved without it: but yet they are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it, nor for it, but onely by the merits of Christ, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith alone. Salvation which is purchased by the merits of Christ is promised to faith, as that whereby we are made partakers of Christs merits; and are therefore said to be justified and saved by faith alone: but charity and the fruits thereof are the evidence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which God will save us. Christ is the foundation of our happinesse, yea, he is eternall life. Faith is the onely instrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are made partakers of Christ: all other graces are but notes and signes of our union which we have with Christ, and of happinesse
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:22501:329"/>
by him. By faith we have this inheritance, but it is had among those that are <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 18.</note> sanctified. When it is said, happy is shee <note n="g" place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Both faith and charity must concurre to every good act: for as a worke without charity is not good; so without faith it is <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> sin. But if you compare the graces together, it is certaine that charity proceedeth from faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and according to the measure of our faith, such is the measure of our love: for faith is the Mother-grace from which charity and all other graces, as from the root and fountaine doe spring and flow. It may seeme indeed, that sanctification and inherent righteousnesse doth more principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in love, because charity is the fulfilling of the Law: yet sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it selfe doth flow from faith, which purifieth <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</note> the heart, and worketh by love. But as for the grace of justification, whereunto me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (if wee had any) ought to bee referred (for justification is the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of us to the kingdome of heaven) neither charity, nor any other grace in us doth concurre unto it, but faith is all in all. I will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in his idle dispute: I confesse the point, that to every rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable or, as he calleth it, meritorious worke charity is required.</p>
               <p>§. VI. Now let us recapitulate his seven conditions. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Whether these conditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring doe make a worke meritorious.</note> he shall not finde me refractary, I doe confesse, that all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these conditions are required to every rewardable worke. For first, it must be good. Secondly, it must be done in obeysance to God. Thirdly, it must be done by men in this world. Fourthly, it must bee voluntary and not forced. Fifthly, it must bee performed by a man who is in the state of grace. Sixthly, the expectation of the reward is to bee grounded on Gods promise. And lastly, it must proceed from charity. But now say I, that not any one of these conditions, nor all of them put together can make a worke meritorious of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life before God. They are common notes and markes of all good workes whatsoever: but the proper notes of merits are such, as I set downe in the beginning of this discourse concerning merits. For workes are not therefore meritorious, because they are materially good, nor because they are in obeysance to God, (for that is our duty and debt which wee owe to God) nor for that they are performed by such as are <hi>viatores</hi> and pilgrims in this world, nor because they are wrought by men in state of grace, nor because the expectation of the reward is grounded on Gods promise, which is of a free reward and not of wages merited by us, nor lastly, because they proceed from charity. For our charity, by reason of the imperfection thereof, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand in judgement to satisfie the justice of God, and much lesse to merit. And whatsoever, or how great soever it is, it is not only a due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we owe to God, but the onely debt which wee owe, or ought to owe to our brethren, and that for Gods sake, to omit that we receive it, as a free gift from God, and therefore by it we cannot merit of him.</p>

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> propoundeth a distinction of eternall glory or happinesse, saying, <hi>that it may be considered either as it is an inheritance, or as it is a reward: and saith, as it is an inheritance it is due</hi>

Secondly, this distinction contradicteth three of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions: first, the maine assertion, which in this plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> he laboureth to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that the good workes of the godly doe condignely merit eternall life, even for the workes sake. For as it is our inheritance or as it is eternall life (which hee calleth the first degree of eternall glory) himselfe confesseth both here in the seventeenth Chapter, as also before in the fourteenth, that it is not rendred to the merit of our workes, but is due to the persons of the faithfull <hi>jure adoptionis,</hi> by the right of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are the sonnes and heires of God; which right they have before they bring forth good workes, which (as hee truely saith) doth manifestly appeare in regenerated infants, which dye in their infancy. And therefore it is evident by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne confession, both in this place, and also in the fourteenth Chapter, that our heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (which is eternall life it selfe) is not merited by our workes, but is purchased by the merits of Christs our Saviour, and therefore is one<note place="margin">As it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> and the same to all that are saved. For as I have said heretofore, as the merit of Christ is equally imputed to all that beleeve, so the reward of Christs merit in respect of the substance, as it is the eternall inheritance or eternall life, shall equally be given to all that beleeve.</p>
               <p>§. IV.

For that which truely hee saith here and in the fourteenth Chapter, that the first degree which is our heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or eternall life it selfe or salvation, is due to the persons of the faithfull by right of adoption, and not to their workes; confuteth that

assertion of his in his twentieth Chapter, that eternall life even in respect of the first degree is rendred to the merit of good workes. And againe, that which he truely saith in his nineteenth Chapter that God doth reward good workes <hi>supra condignum,</hi> above their desert and that <hi>incomparabiliter &amp; ineffabiliter,</hi> as he citeth there out of<note n="g" place="margin">Ad Monim. lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius,</hi> confuteth that which here he laboureth to prove, good works doe condignely merit the rewards of heavenly happinesse, meaning thereby the degrees of eternall glory; and that not onely <hi>ratione pacti, sed etiam ratione operis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that there bee divers degrees of heavenly glory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God doth crowne his children in mercie and loving kindnesse; neither is it to be doubted, but that to those whom God hath endued with greater measure of grace, causing them to bee more fruitfull of good workes; and making them more excellent instruments of his glory and of the good of his chosen, he will give them a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of glory, crowning as I have said before, his greater graces with greater glory. For as all that beleeve in Christ are equally justified, but not all equally endued with grace: so all the faithfull shall bee equally saved, but not all equally made partakers of glory. And as the greater measure of grace is the free gift of<note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if the good worke also be grace, how can it deserve a reward, and so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from him that gave it? For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath taught us in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this seventeenth Chapter, that if the worke bee much
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:22501:331"/>
lesse than the promised reward, it should not be a merit of condigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in respect of the worke. If, saith hee, the Master of the vineyard should promise to a labourer for his dayes worke, not the day-peny, but an hundred crownes, and yet the heavenly reward given to a good worke doth incomparably surpasse the unequall proportion, that is, betweene an hundred crownes and a daies worke.</p>
               <p>§. VI. In his second argument he trifleth egregiously. He saith,<note place="margin">His second reason.</note> there is a proportion betweene the fountaine and the river running from it. Grace is the fountaine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. and eternall life is the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which maketh glad the City of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46. 5. where accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Latine it is thus read, <hi>Fluminis impetus laetificat Civitate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if it must bee allegorized, then as by the fountaine grace is to be understood, according to that of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. so by the river should be understood perseverance and increase of grace running to eternall life, as the sea, wherein the course of all rivers endeth. And therefore such as is the proportion of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the sea, such is of grace or of a gracious worke to eternall life.</p>
               <p>This was his first analogy; the second is no lesse ridiculous. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> saith he, <hi>there is a proportion betweene the ascent and descent of water, for it doth ascend as high as it doth descend; and therefore the grace of the Spirit which descended from heaven will ascend as high.</hi> No doubt, if it be conveyed in a close conduit pipe.</p>
               <p>§. VII. His third Reason, <hi>Eternall life is the day-peny of those that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His third reason.</note> 
                  <hi>labour in the vineyard,</hi> Matth. 20. <hi>But the day-peny is the just hire of the dayes labour. So is eternall life.</hi> The day-peny which was given to those that wrought but one houre doth signifie eternall life, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by proved not to bee an hire rendred as due to equall labour, but as a free reward bestowed by the bounty of the Lord, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> may doe with his owne what he pleaseth. For if it were the just wages for the whole dayes labour, then he that wrought but one houre should have had but one twelfe part of the wages.</p>
               <p>His fourth Reason, <hi>Seed in vertue physicall is equall to that thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the seed, and containeth it; Grace is the seed, and eternall life that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the seed, therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This argument is grounded upon a similitude of grace, and seed, which are not like in those things for which this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is brought. For neither is seede the meritorious cause of that whereof it is the seed, as hee supposeth grace to bee, nor grace the seminall cause of eternall life: for seed is the <hi>materiale principium.</hi> But grace, meaning grace inherent, is neither the <hi>materiale principium,</hi> nor the meritorious cause, nor any other cause of salvation, unles it be <hi>

And further, the doing of good workes is compared to sowing of seede, which hath relation to the great harvest, as also the committing of the dead bodies of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the earth. For even as he that casteth his seed into the ground, doth it in hope <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 10.</note> of increase at the next harvest, or as hee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the dead body to the earth <note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 36. 42.</note> as seede, doth it in hope of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease at the great harvest: so hee which soweth in righteousnesse to the <note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> Spirit, shall of the Spirit reape everlasting life. And as the seed cast into the ground is not cast away, but is recompenced with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease at the harvest: And as the body, though sowne in corruption doth not perish, but riseth in <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 42.</note> incorruption at the great harvest: so he that soweth the seed of good workes, though hee may seeme to cast them upon the waters, as <note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 11. 1.</note>

But as the increase in harvest is not to bee asscribed to the merit of the sower, but to the blessing of God; and as the raising of the dead body to incorruption <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 38.</note> at the last day is not to bee attributed to the merit of committing it, as seed to the earth, but to the merit and power of CHRIST in whom <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 22.</note> wee are made alive againe: so the reaping of everlasting life at the great harvest, is not to bee asscribed to our merit, but to the merit of Christ, who hath purchased it for us, and to the undeserved mercie of God, who crowneth his owne graces in us.

I say, in respect of themselves, for in respect of Christ our surety, hee exacted such a punishment, as did fully satisfie his justice for our sinnes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he never punisheth properly, that is, <hi>in ordine justitiae,</hi> by way of vengeance to satisfie his justice, the sinnes of the faithfull, which he hath punished in Christ: neither doth hee exact or expect any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from them for their sinnes, for which our Saviour Christ hath fully satisfied his justice. Notwithstanding, it cannot bee denied, but they are many times <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 34. 19.</note> afflicted, and the judgements of God inflicted upon them: but yet when wee are judged, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32.</note> wee are not punished by way of vengeance, but wee are chastized of the Lord, that wee should not bee condemned with the world. Now if God from our Saviour hath exacted such a penalty, is satisfied for the sinnes of all the Elect; it may bee thought, that hee will exact from the wicked a lesse punishment, than will satisfie his justice. Some say, that God will not render to the wicked <hi>secundum rigorem justitiae, quos justè posset annihilare:</hi> but that also may bee questioned; seeing of those, who shall bee condemned, our Saviour saith, that it had beene better for them that they had not beene borne.</p>

Secondly, the increase of justice is condignely merited by good workes: wee deny not, but that by the practice of pietie and exercise of good workes mens inherent righteousnesse is increased, according to that, <hi>Luk. 19. 26. habenti dabitur,</hi> to him that hath (that is, doth exercise his talents) it shall bee given, but that hee shall <hi>ex condign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

but also for the dignity of the worke, which is in proportion equall to the reward: insomuch that it were unjustice in God, if he should not render heaven to their workes, which doe as properly deserve heaven, as the workes of the wicked deserve hell; and that by their workes they deserve not onely eternall life it selfe, which they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
