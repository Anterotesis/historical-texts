            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For if he look for plaine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, what they affirme and we deny; he shal not find them expressed: if he take the differences to be implied, as that whatsoever Mast. Smyth affirmeth we deney, and what he deneyeth we affirme; then is the Reader much abused, &amp; we injured; who hold in that book, truth &amp; error to be unequally mixed. Seing then neyther expresly nor implicitly the Reader can see the <hi>Differences:</hi> what are they but delusions?</p>
            <p>The many questions which he asketh in the end, conteyning the summe of al his book, manifest the Authors frawd: for if he know &amp; dare say wherin we differ, what need he desire our <hi>direct answer?</hi> It became him to refute, &amp; not for to fish with hooks of demands, wherin we would differ from him.</p>
            <p>Ther was one onely difference between M. Smyth and us, when first he began to quarrel; though synce he have increast them, and increaseth dayly, with deadly feud and open opposition, as al men may see.</p>
            <p>That difference was this. He with his followers breaking off co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us, charged us with synn for using our English Bibles in the worship of God; &amp; he thought that the teachers should bring the originals the Hebrew and Greek, and out of them translate by voice. His principal reason against our translated scripture was this.

               <hi>a written translation</hi> (sayth he) <hi>or interpretation is as wel &amp; as much an human writing, as an homilie or prayer, written &amp; read.</hi> The like impietie he hath also printed in his book, saying <hi>A translation being the work of a mens wit &amp; learning, is as much and as truly an humane writing, as the Apocrypha (so commonly called) writings are, and seeing it hath not the allowance of holy men inspired, but is of an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den authoritie, it may be iustly called Apocrypha &amp;c. And therfore not to be brought into the worship of God to be read.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this point of the translation was the onely difference, as it is known to al that then heard his publik protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; so his words in writing shew it. <note n="‡" place="margin">In a reason annexed to the 1. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>Translations written</hi> (sayth he) <hi>are not refreyned in the case of scandal, for we desired that they might be refreined for our sakes, that we might keep communion, &amp; it would not be yeilded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So if we would have layd aside our translated Bibles, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (they say) should have been kept with us.</p>
            <p>Now for the true differences on our part, at that time and stil, they are thus. We agree with M. Smyth herein, that <hi>Onely canonical scripture is to be used in Gods worship;</hi> &amp; that <hi>no apocryphal writing is to be used in Gods worship.</hi> But we disagree &amp; deney, that <hi>every written tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is an Apocryphal writing;</hi> affirming that <hi>the Scriptures in English and other languages, rightly translated out of the Originals, are Canonical; &amp; so to be read in the Church in the worship of God.</hi>

            <p>Touching the first, namely, the vse of translated scriptures in the worship of God: M. Smyth thus summeth vp the difference, in the forefront of his book.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>We hold</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the worship of the new testament properly so called, is spirituall, proceeding originally from the hart: and that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reading out of a book</hi> (<hi>though a lawful ecclesiasticall action,</hi>) <hi>is no part of spiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: but rather the invention of the man of syn, it being substituted for a part of spiritual worship.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>We hold that seing prophesying is a part of spirituall worship: therefore in time of prophesying it is vnlawfull to have the book as a help before the eye.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>We hold that seing singing a Psalm is a part of spirituall worship; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnlawful, to have the book before the ey, in time of singing a Psalm.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Here first let the reader observe, that the mayn and true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which was between M. Smyth and us, about the translation, is not mentioned: but is brought in after, as by the way, in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling these matters; and other points never controverted between vs, are made heads of the differences. In which doing, M. Smyth hath graced the very portch of his building, with imposture and frawd.</p>
            <p>2. In saying, of himself and his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>We hold</hi> &amp;c. he giveth the reader to vnderstand, (vnlesse he meant to delude him,) that they whom he dealeth against, hold <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary:</hi> wheras he neither dooth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18551:5"/>
nor is able to produce any proof hereof against us; neyther (I dare say) can he tel what we hold, of these points. Thus secondeth he his fraud with injurie; and maketh these two, as <hi>Iachin</hi> &amp; <hi>Boaz,</hi> the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for to bewtifie the temple of his book.</p>
            <p>Now because his whol battel against the translated Scriptures, is cheefly out of this bulwark of <hi>spiritual worship,</hi> wherin he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched himself, and flyeth therto at al assayes, when other shifts fayle him: I wil begin with it, as himself also dooth, and come to Translations anon.</p>

               <p>Wheras the word <hi>Worship</hi> is diversly used, somtime more largely, somtime more straightly; by reason wherof it hath not at al tymes a like proper signification: M.

And though he treateth of this thing at large, handling the <hi>fountaine,</hi> the <hi>helps,</hi> the <hi>essence</hi> or <hi>nature,</hi> with the <hi>parts and kinds of worship:</hi> yet the divers use of the word which was needful first to be shewed, (if he meant not to deceiv,) he hath quite omitted; that, therfore I wil first manifest.<note place="margin">The homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</note>

                  <hi>Worship,</hi> in our English tongue, and as it is used to expresse the original scriptures, is diversly taken. Somtime largely, as when it expresseth the Greek word <hi>latreuo;</hi> as Philip. 3, 3. <hi>we ar the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision which</hi>

               <p>Also when it expresseth the Greek word <hi>sebomai;</hi> as Act. 18, 13. <hi>to</hi>

                  <hi>worshipper of God.</hi> And so both it &amp; the Greek answer to the Hebrew <hi>jar</hi>é; which properly signifieth to <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>reverence,</hi> as Mat. 15, 9. <hi>in vaine they</hi> 
                  <note n="”" place="margin">sebontai.</note>

So <note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 1. 9. Ion. 1. 9.</note> Iob. and Ionas, as the Hebrew sayth, <hi>feared,</hi> as the Greek translateth, <hi>Worshipped</hi> God.

               <p>More strictly and properly, <hi>worship</hi> is vsed to English the Greeke word <hi>proskuneo;</hi> as Mat. 2. 2. <hi>We are come to</hi>

                  <hi>worshipped the Dragon,</hi> &amp;c. And so both it and the Greek word, doe expresse the Hebrue <hi>hishtachavah,</hi> which properly signifieth to <hi>bow downe</hi> or <hi>prostrate ones self. Exod.</hi> 20. 5.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>worship of God</hi> generally, comprehendeth the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all duties required in the first <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 6—15.</note> table of the Law: specially and properly, to worship is to bow downe &amp; supplicate vnto God.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the word being thus distinguished; let vs now see how M. Smyth dooth deal in the point. He, where he <note n="†" place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. pag. 18.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to handle <hi>the nature or essence of spiritual worship, and the essentiall causes and kindes thereof,</hi> sheweth these things <hi>in two particulars; first in the essentiall causes;</hi> 2. <hi>in the proper kindes or parts of the worship of the N. testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The essential causes are matter and forme. The matter of Gods worship</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is the holy scriptures, which conteyneth the word of God or the Gospell, the subiect whereof is Christ Iesus: The forme or sowl that quickeneth it, is the spirit Col.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>with Ephe.</hi> 5. 18. 19. 20.</p>
               <p>Then he <hi>illustrateth</hi> this, <hi>by the ceremoniall worship of the old testament.</hi> And the <hi>matter</hi> of that he maketh to be <hi>beasts, incense, oil, fat, corn, wine,</hi> and the like <hi>creatures whereof the sacrifices</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wer made, with all the actions thereto perteyning.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18551:6"/>I wil not here stand to scan the good order which M. Smyth hath used in handling the <hi>nature and essence of worship,</hi> whiles omitting the efficient causes, obiects and ends, which properly perteyne to the discourse of actions: he insisteth vpon <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> which he calleth <hi>essentiall causes:</hi> so taking that which is more vnproper, &amp; difficult. But seing he hath chosen this way, I will follow him therein.</p>
               <p>And first I observe, how he intending to shut out the reading of the scriptures from spirituall worship; yet maketh the scriptures to be the <hi>matter of worship:</hi> now how the <hi>matter</hi> of a thing, should be shut out and vnlawfull to be there, it requireth some skill to know. Secondly, the <hi>scriptures</hi> being (as he sayth) the <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> the <hi>form</hi> of this action of worship; (though properly the spirit is the <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 2. 4 &amp; 11. 28.</note> efficient cause;) it would be knowne why M. Smyth in an other place sayth that <note n="*" place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. pag. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>actions of administring the Church or kingdom</hi> of Christ, <hi>are not actions of spirituall worship properly so called,</hi> making those actions to be <hi>admonition, examination, excommunication, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, absolution &amp;c.</hi> are not these to have the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> as well as <hi>prophesie</hi> which th' Apostle sayth, is a speaking <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to edifying to exhortation and to comfort?</hi> Are we not aswell bound to the scriptures in <hi>admonishing,</hi> as in <hi>exhorting</hi> and must not the same spirit give life vnto both?</p>
               <p>Let Paul himself be our example: he teacheth that <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>the whole scripture is profitable,</hi> as for <hi>doctrine</hi> so for <note n="†" place="margin">elenchon.</note> 
                  <hi>rebuke</hi> or conviction, and for <hi>correction;</hi> and he in practise, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and opposing against Elymas, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 13. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>O ful of all subtilty and of all mischief, child of the Divil &amp;c.</hi> did this by the <hi>holy spirit,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is noted then to be <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>ful.</hi> In preaching to the men of Antiochia, <hi>he admonished</hi> them <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 13. 40. 41.</note> by the word of the prophet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakuk: in preaching to the Iewes in Rome, he <hi>rebuked</hi> them <note n="”" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 25.—28.</note> by the word of the prophet Esaias; And Peter in his Sermon at Ierusalem <hi>pacified</hi> their pricked consciences, by the promise of God, to them and to their children; Actes 2. 37. 39.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18551:7"/>
So the word and spirit were <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of their rebukes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, pacifications, &amp;c. even as of their other doctrines &amp; exhortations, and therfore by Mr Sm. owne grounds, were spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worship; and so his first plot where he made <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>actions of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, difference, plea &amp; strife,</hi> not to be actions of spiritual worship; is a wagmire wherinto this his conceipt of prophesie or preaching to be spirituall worship, is sunk, and by it overthrown. And sure the Prophets and Apostles and Christ himself never observed this new coyned difference, for <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 7 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> they in their prophesying or preaching of the word, did intermixe rebukes with comforts, admonitions with exhortations, and opposed against syn and synners vsually in their sermons, as the whole historie of the Bible sheweth. Now by Mr Smyths divinitie they worshipped not God, when they spake by way of <hi>opposition, difference, plea</hi> or <hi>strife,</hi> in their doctrine; but when they spake to <hi>edifying exhortation</hi> or <hi>comfort;</hi> this was the <hi>worship of God properly so called.</hi> If this distinction be not true, then M. Sm. is a deceiver, properly so called; who to make things serve his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall humour and hide his blasphemies against our reading of the holy scriptures in the Church, hath digged thus deep to find a pit whereinto to fell the righteous; though himself by Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be fallen into the same.</p>
               <p>And here, by the way I will briefly note M. Smyths methode in contriving of his book for the advantage of his cause. The three offices of Christ, in prophesie preisthood and Kingdome; he redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vnto two, 1. kingdome and 2. preisthood; <note n="‡" place="margin">Differenc. p, 27.</note> comprehending prophesie vnder the preisthood as a branch of it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>with</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>Whereas by the same ground of Deut. 33. 10. he mought have made the kingdome also a branch of the preisthood; for the Preists were to teach Iaakob Gods judgements and Israel his law, as well in cases of <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 17. 8. 9. 11. 12.</note> controversie plea and strife, (which M. Smyth maketh <hi>actions of administring the Kingdome;</hi>) as in other doctrines of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and comfort. But I find in the scripture that Moses (not Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron the Preist,) is made a figure of Christ <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22—26.</note> as a Prophet; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets there were many in Israel of other tribes then Levi: seing then Moses &amp; the Prophets caried types of Christs prophesie; Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron

                  </note> Iewish Church, above the Gentiles in many respects: this proud Gentile disgraceth them extremely, saying <note n="†" place="margin">Charact. of the beast p. 16.</note> that their <hi>Ministerie worship</hi> &amp; <hi>government</hi> was <hi>carnal;</hi> that <hi>faith and repentance was not required to the matter,</hi> that is, the people of that Church, <hi>but onely a carnall holynes;</hi> with many such like vituperies, which out of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hart he uttereth against them.</p>
               <p>But for their worship which we have in hand, let him shew if he can, what one thing we have which they had not before vs. He maketh the <hi>parts</hi> of our worship to be three, <hi>praying, prophesying, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> all these they had, and vttered them by the spirit, as the scriptures every where manifest: and though they had many carnal rites with these, as sacrifices, incense, &amp;c. yet was not their worship carnal: for we have also some carnall rites, as washing with water in baptisme, the eating of bread &amp; wine in the Lords supper; have we therefore a carnall baptisme, a carnall supper? if not, neyther had they a carnal worship, though carnall rites were adjoyned unto their worship. But as God whom they worshipped was a spirit, so worshipped they him in spirit, and with faith, exspecting that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which God made vnto them of salvation by Christ; as Paul te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed of the whol body of that Church; that <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 26. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the twelve tribes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly serving</hi> (or <hi>worshiping</hi>) <hi>day and night, hoped to come vnto it:</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further, that the gentiles are of the same, or <note n="†" place="margin">Sussoma Ephe. 3. 6.</note> one joynt body with them; fellow-heyres, and partakers of the promise in Christ.</p>
               <p>M. S. having shewed (as he thought) the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of the Iewes worship, inferreth vpon it thus. <note n="*" place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. pag 19</note> 
                  <hi>Hence it followeth</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that the worship that beginneth in the book or translation commeth not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the spirit, but from the letter or ceremony, and so is not properly of the new Testament, but of the old,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>If this followeth, upon the former description of their worship and ours, I think it comes a great way behind, that few wilbe able to see it.

salt, come from the book, any otherweise then our praying, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ministring of the sacraments dooth or must doe. Did they look on a book when they kindled fyre on the altar, or cast salt on the sacrifice? if not, how followeth this halting inference?</p>
               <p>That the worship performed in reading the scriptures procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>originally from the spirit,</hi> even from God, whose spirit is in his word, and who hath commanded it to be read: and that such reading is not the ministerie of the letter spoken of, 2 Cor. 3, 6. shall through Gods grace, anon be proved; in handling the second point, of the scriptures.</p>
               <p>Here next followeth to be considered Mr Smythes allegories &amp; opening the worship of the new testament, by the type in the old.</p>

Levit. 24. 1.—9. <hi>At the brazen altar were offred sacrifices propitiatorie and eucharisticall, signifying, prayer, thanksgiving, prophesie. At the golden altar was perfume, signifying prayer, thanksgiving, preaching the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Upon the table of shew bread was the candlestik, and</hi> 12. <hi>loves with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense. The candlestik signifyed the Church; shining by doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The shew bread, signified the</hi> 12. <hi>tribes or Church, present before the Lord, fed with Christ &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the holy place with the altar and Preists, did properly signify</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Church, Worship, and Saints, Rev.</hi> 11. 1, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>under the new testament: so the court without the holy place whither all the people came, &amp; the typical service performed there, did signifie the confused as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of antichristian persecutors, &amp; their ceremonial worship, Rev.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>which the spirit in that place caleth gentiles or hethen in these respects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The parts of typical service performed in the court, were reading and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sik, wherein the Levites were cheif agents; though the preists also and any</hi>

                  <hi>of the people might read and sing. The scriptures read and tunea musically, are prophesies, prayers, thanksgivings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this discourse God would let the Reader see, how M. Smyth is given over to blindnes of hart, in judging spiritual things: by that blyndnes which is in him in discerning carnal things, &amp; which are set before al mens eyes.</p>
               <p>For, to make the legal shadowes serve his fansie, he placeth the <hi>brazen altar</hi> in the holy place or tabernacle with the golden altar, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and candlestik: wheras the scripture sheweth it was set in the court-yard of the tabernacle <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 40. 6. 28. 29.</note> before the doore, and that a good distance off, having the <hi>Laver</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">ver. 30. 32</note> between the tabernacle and it, in which the preists did wash when they went into the tabernacle. And to this place <hi>at the dore of the tabernacle,</hi> did <note n="“" place="margin">

The boards of the tabernacle were but <note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 26. 15. 16.</note> ten cubits high, (the brazen altar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="“" place="margin">

Can any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man now think, that this was within the tabernacle, which was so low &amp; little a place? would the Lord have the curtayns to be <note n="”" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 1. 29.</note> embrodered with cherubims, the boards to be covered with gold, that al mought be dight with smoke and swoot; &amp; continually in danger to be set on fyre? yet M.

With like discretion he placeth the candlestik upon the table, though Moses plainly tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that it (being very great, of a <note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 25. 39.</note> talent of gold, about 160 pound weight,) was <note n="†" place="margin">

But his eye sight fayled not so much in the shadow, as his hart was blinded in the shadowed thing. For he maketh the 1 <hi>tabernacle,</hi> 2 <hi>altar,</hi> &amp; 3 <hi>Preists,</hi> to signifie the 1 <hi>Church,</hi> 2 <hi>worship,</hi> &amp; 3 <hi>saincts</hi> under the new testament: the 1. <hi>court</hi> of the tabernacle, he wil have to signifie the assemblies of Antichrist; the 2 Israelites there assembling, to signifie the antichristian perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors:

3 the typical service in the court, as <hi>reading</hi> the scriptures, &amp; singing them with musik; to signifie the <hi>ceremonial worship</hi> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristians. For none but antichristians (as he thinketh) do read the scriptures in their worship. Behold unto what great impietie he abuseth the word of God.

                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 11—21.</note> rideth on the heavens in his glorie with a garment dipt in blood, and a sword for to slay them, and fil al the fowles of the aier with their flesh.</p>
               <p>The worship and service commanded by God unto his people, and his good word to instruct them, by which he caled them <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 2 4—7.</note> from the service of Divils: this false prophet maketh to signifie the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of antichristian idolaters, which <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 9, 20</note> worship Divils.</p>

               <p>So then the Israel of God which according to his wil worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and served him <note n="“" place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 27—29</note> with song and sacrifice; the prophets, preists, Levites, yea Christ himself and his Apostles, which often went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worship God and teach the people; these al were figures and significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of antichristian persecutors; excepting the preists one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whom M, Smyth of his courtesie, maketh figures of Christians, when they did their service in the holy place. By this interpretation, when Zacharie the priest was <note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 1. 9. 10. &amp;c.</note> in the temple burning incense, and the whole multitude of the people were without in prayer, wayting for his coming out to <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 6. 23. Lev. 9. 22.</note> blesse them: he &amp; his service, signified Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and their worship of God; they with their prayers, signified antichristians and their worship of the Divil. Yea God himself is highly blasphemed by this wretched exposition: for seeing by types &amp; figures he taught his people how for to serue him, &amp; led the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18551:10"/>
earthly signes to heavenly things signified; how can it be sayd or thought without blasphemie, that the publik worship of the whol congregation appointed by God himself, did signifie hellish things, and antichristian idolatries?</p>
               <p>But what may we think induced M. Sm. to this impietie? Even Satan deceived him by one place of scripture which he <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 21.</note> citeth in his book; viz. Rev. 11. 2. where Iohn was willed in a vision, to <hi>castout the court which is without the temple, and not measure it, for it is given to the gentiles.</hi> Hence doth M. Smyth gather that the Israelites which were wont to worship in the courts of the Lord, did signifie the <hi>gentiles,</hi> that is the Antichristians, and consequently the court must betoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichrists Church, and the worship Antichrists worship. Thus one dark scripture is alleged to overthrow the cleare doctrine that shineth throughout al the prophets. Yet even this place it self mought have taught him better. For first the commandment to <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11. 1.</note> measure the temple, altar, and worshipers, signified the restoring or repayring of Gods Church and people, after some destruction &amp; desolation; as the like visions shewed <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 3. 5. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 1. 2.</note> to Ezekiel and Zacharie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the destruction of Solomons temple, do manifest. Secondly, wheras the <hi>court</hi> and the <hi>holy citie</hi> was not mesured here by Iohn; as before by <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 48. 30. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2, 2.</note> the other prophets, they were, and as afterwards <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 21. 15.</note> Iohn did see: it may teach us, that as yet there was not a ful restauration of Gods Church and worship, from the defection of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in that the court is here sayd to <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2</note> 
                  <hi>be given to the gentiles,</hi> &amp; <hi>the holy citie</hi> should be troden under foot of them, &amp; a time limited how long, <hi>two &amp; fourtie moneths:</hi> this argueth that the court was not made, nor the citie builded for them: but by Gods permission, for the chastisement of men, was given unto them for a season, during which tyme his <hi>two witnesses</hi> should prophesie against them. And thus it is said of the figure the first temple and city, <note n="†" place="margin">Jer. 12. 7.</note> I have <hi>given</hi> the dearly beloved of my sowl, into the hands of her enemies.

Smythes base account of Israel to be but a <hi>carnal people,</hi> brought him to this dotage; to make them in their assemblies and worship, to be figures of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian persecutors.</hi> This being thus cleared; the reader may tast, how unsavoury and bitter M. Smythes wormwood is, who to abolish the reading of Gods word out of his worship and service; would make the reading of it in the Church of Israel, to signify it should be read in the Churches of Antichrist, but not of Christ.</p>
               <p>Having handled thus the <hi>essential causes,</hi> of Gods worship, with the types in Israel; next folow the parts and kinds of the same, which M. Sm. sayth are 1. <hi>praying,</hi> 2. <hi>prophesying,</hi> 3 <hi>&amp; singing psalmes.</hi> Psal. 50. 14. 17. 1 Cor. 11. 4. and 14. 15—17. 26. Iam. 5. 13. Rev. 19. 10.</p>
               <p>Worship, properly so called, whereof he would seem to intreat: is not so large as here he makes it: and if he mean worship in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, it is more large then these three particulars do expresse.</p>
               <p>Worship strictly taken, for that which in Greek is <hi>proskunesis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth a prostrating or supplicating vnto God: &amp; is in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture applied and annexed vnto prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 8. 9. vnto thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18551:11"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 26. 27. vnto offrings &amp; sacrifices, (after whichit was performed,) 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 29. with 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 29. unto the bringing of first fruits, with acknowledgement of Gods goodnes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 2—10. vnto confession praysing and blessing of God; <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 20. <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 20. 21. and sometimes it is set downe absolutely, where these or some of them, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 31. Wherefore it is truely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applyed vnto all manner supplication or calling on the name of God. But that it may fitly be applyed unto <hi>prophesying,</hi> no scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that I know of, manifest; neyther will the nature of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bear it.</p>
               <p>Prophesying (to speak properly of it, as is meet in such contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,) is one of the extraordinary gifts of God vnto his Church by his spirit; as we have example in Israell, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 25. 26. as was foretold by Ioel to be at Christs coming, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 28. 29. and as was fulfilled vpon the Apostles &amp; members of the primitive Churches. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4.—17. <hi>and</hi> 19. 2.—6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Now why M. Sm. should choose out this one gift, and neglect all others (except singing a Psalme:) and make it above the rest, properly worship, I cannot tel. If he vse it for that which generally is called the <hi>preaching of the word,</hi> it is not fit in this place, where propriety is by himself plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, and should in deed be vsed. He mought have seen in the same 14. to the Corinthes, fowr wayes of teaching noted by the Apostle, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>eyther by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesie, or by doctrine;</hi> and examples of these fowr, in the Christians practise: For Paul spake of revelations to the Church of Corinth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1. 2. &amp;c. and Iohn by revelation, to the Churches in Asia. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. 2. 4. 9. 10. &amp;c. and by knowledge the same man spake to the Church in generall, when he reported that which they had seen, heard, handled and knowne to be true; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 35. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1. 3. and Peter dooth the like; 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. 18. by prophesie, when by secret instinct of the spirit, they wer moved to speak somthing which tended to the edifying exhortation &amp; comfort of the Church, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3. 29. 30. 31. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 6. by doctrine, when they scanned the scriptures and gathered doctrines, and exhortations from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. 4. 7. &amp; 7. 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 4. 3. 4. <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 4. 17. 18—21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:18551:11"/>And this latter is the surest way and safest now for the Church, when by the scriptures they are taught the wil of God: the other extraordinarie and miraculous gifts being ceased. Therfore the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists and ordinarie ministers of churches are not exhorted to <hi>prophesie,</hi> but to <hi>feed,</hi> preach, read, teach, exhort comfort &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 13—16. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4, 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1, 9. though <hi>prophesie</hi> was not to be despised, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5, 20. Even as the Preists and Levites in the Law, were not appointed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to prophesie but to <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Eze.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 1. 1. 2.</note> extraordinary to them or any other of what tribe so ever. Although therfore the preaching of the word now among us, may be called prophesying, for the like use and effects in the church: yet have we not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gift or exercise, any more then of tongues: which we attayn by ordinary labour and stvdie, they had without studie. <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 4. <hi>and</hi> 19, 6.</p>
               <p>But however M. Sm. taketh the word, I deney <hi>prophesying</hi> to be <hi>worship properly so called:</hi> and wil consider his reasons, vvhich are tvvo, 1. <hi>praying &amp; prophesying are ioyned togither</hi> (<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 19.</note> sayth he) <hi>as parts of worship,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 4. <hi>and men must be uncovered at both of them.</hi> Agayn, 2. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying and Psalmes are coupled togither for the same purpose.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
               <p>The first reason is insufficient, for in 1 Cor, 11, 4, <hi>praying &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying</hi> are joyned indeed togither, but not as <hi>parts of worship</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so caled, that is of the glosse, not of the text. The thing there spoken of concerneth al ecclesiastical actions: &amp; tvvo differing ech from other are named, to imply al the rest. For Paul speaketh of the habit of men and women, vvhich became them to have in al publik meetings: vvhich vvas, that vvomen should be veiled, men unvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on their heads: and this not onely because of the vvorship of God: but also <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>because of the Angels,</hi> which are not to be worshiped; and because of the man, <note n="*" place="margin">ver. 7.</note> whose glorie the woman is: yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>nature</hi> it self, which by giving women long hayr, teacheth them therby, that their heads should be covered. And by the man <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>having on</hi> (or <hi>over</hi>) <hi>the head,</hi> is not meant the having of a hat, cap, or bonnet upon his head, for that was lawful even in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18551:12"/>
the Preists having <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 28. 40. Ezek. 44. 18.</note> bonnets upon their heads, by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and to this day, the Eastern countries put not off their bonnets or tucks when they pray or worship. But it was the having of a covering or veil (called by the Apostle <hi>peribólaion &amp; catacálum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>) which was a signe of <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 4. 8.</note> dishonour and subjection, unmeet for men which were principal in the assemblie, &amp; caried Gods <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>vers.</hi> 7.</note> image and glorie upon them; but meet for women, which were inferior to men, both by <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 9.</note> creation and otherweise, and therfore were to have <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>power</hi> upon their head, that is, a veil, signifying the power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which men had above them, as in al places, so cheifly in the church assemblies, wher women mought <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11. 12.</note> not speak, for the same cause. And that it was a shame and dishonour for men to have their heads covered, appeareth by other scriptures; as Ier. 14. 4. <hi>the plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ashamed they covered their heads.</hi> So David &amp; his men in their sorow and affliction <note n="†" place="margin">2 Sam. 15 30.</note> had their heads covered; and Haman <note n="*" place="margin">Est. 6. 12</note> in his mourning covered his head; where the Greek hath the very phrase (<hi>kata kephales</hi>) which th'Apostle <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 4.</note> here useth. And that among the Greeks also, (such as the Corinthians were) the like custome was for men to cover their heads in dishonour, reproch, and grief; <note n="†" place="margin">Plutar. in vita De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenis.</note> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane histories do record. But bonnets or miters on the head, were a sign <note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 28. 40. Zach. 3. 5.</note> of honour: even as with us, the masters wear hats, when ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants stand bareheaded. Whereas therfore the Apostle willeth wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be veiled or covered, it is not onely for the worship of God properly so caled, but because of Gods worship in general, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of reverence and submission to men and Angels. So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, because men must be unveiled at prayer and at prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, therefore these two actions are of one and the same nature: for they mought not be veiled in the Church at al; unlesse perhaps in extraordinary time of mourning and sorrow, they covered their heads, as I have shewed examples in Israel.</p>
               <p>The other reason from 1 Cor. 14, 26. where <hi>prophesying &amp; psalms are coupled togither</hi> (as M, Smyth sayth) <hi>for the same purpose;</hi> is more weak and lesse to the purpose. For prophesie is not named there; but if it had been named, it would not have proved it <hi>worship</hi> properly, any more then <hi>tongues, revelations, interpretation, doctrine,</hi> which there are named, be parts or kinds of worship. And if because things
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18551:12"/>
are named togither we must therefore count them of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>fayth, hope, and love</hi> coupled togither, and many other things in other scriptures, must be esteemed the same: which is vanitie to affirme. Yea in this <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor, 14</note> very chapter, Mr. Smyth mought have learned the contrarie; for it is sayd <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>if al prophesie, and one that beleeveth not come in, he is rebuked of al &amp;c. and so he wil fal down on his face and worship God, and say plainly that God is in you indeed.</hi> wher Paul sheweth a difference between <hi>prophesie &amp; worship,</hi> as in name so in gesture, by faling down, whereas at prophesie they <note n="†" place="margin">ver. 30.</note> sate. And if men should kneel or prostrate themselves at the ministerie of the word and sacraments, it were liker idolatrie then seemly behaviour in the church: but at worship properly so caled, kneeling, bowing, falling down &amp;c, are the most fit gestures: so as one is put some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for another, as when Mathew sayth the leper<note n="”" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 8, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>worshiped</hi> Christ, Luke recording the same sayth, <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 5, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>he fel on his face and besought him.</hi> And how often throughout the scriptures is bowing and falling down joyned with worship? So in Israel, at the ministerie of the word, the people <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 5, 6, &amp; 9, 3</note> 
                  <hi>stood up;</hi> but at the worship of the Lord they <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down.</hi> Moreover worship being directed unto God himself, (for he that boweth, kneeleth, prayeth &amp;c. doth these things unto God, as by the Angel it is commanded <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 19, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>worship God:</hi>) and prophesie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed unto men, (as Paul sayth <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14 3.</note> 
                  <hi>he that prophesyeth speaketh unto men;</hi>) also the next end of worship, being the glory of God (Ex. 23, 14—17. with Ioh. 12, 20. Act. 8, 27.) but the next end of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie being the edifying exhortation &amp; comfort <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 3.</note> of the church, these things may teach us that prophesie is not worship properly so caled, that is <hi>proskunesis:</hi> but onely in a general sense, as <hi>latreia</hi> or <hi>sebasis,</hi> even as reading the scriptures (which is for mens edifying, exhortation and comfort as prophesie is) and al other like ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical actions. And this word <hi>latreuo,</hi> Paul <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 1, 9.</note> applieth to himself, in his preaching of the gospel; of vvhom we may learn vvhat manner of vvorship prophesie is.</p>
               <p>Whereas therfore M. Smyth hath accused us of idolatrie, for reading the scriptures in the church (vvherein vvee doe but that God commanded, in that manner and to that end) and the man himselfe calleth and esteemeth prophesie

                  <hi>The publishing of the covenant of grace, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to of the seales: is onely one concrete action or part of worship: for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of the covenant giveth being to the seales: otherweise, breaking bread and baptising are but putting of seales to a blank.</hi> Here first I note by the way, how M.

But it was Satans policie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18551:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to disgrace the reading of Gods book, and seek to thrust it quite out of the worship of God; that men mought prophesie (as now they use to speak,) out of their harts; and honour that as Gods proper worship; and so the serpents word if it were mixed with the Lords, mought the more easily be unespied, the scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing absent.

                  <hi>word</hi> together with his <hi>spirit:</hi> that his people should not be deceived by such as <note n="†" place="margin">Mic. 2. 11 1 King. 22. 24.</note> walk in the spirit, and ly falsly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Singing of Psalmes.</hi> M. Sm. wil have to be the third part of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; because <hi>praying and singing Psalms are put together</hi> (<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> sayth he) <hi>in the same sense,</hi> (that is, as parts of worship.) <hi>1 Cor. 14. 15 17. Iam. 5. 13. Act. 16. 25.</hi> And <hi>prophesying and psalmes are coupled together for the same purpose. 1 Cor. 14. 26.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here agayne M. S. omitteth the needful distinction of Psalmes and singing of them. For some Psalmes are written in the Bible, as canonical scripture, given to the Church for to be read, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and sung: which M. S. himself granteth, even of the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>It may be read in the Church and sung in tunes.</hi> And this singing is with harmonie of voices. An other kind of Psalm there is, which one man vttereth in the Church, and others hear him: of which sort the Apostle speaketh, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 26. when ye come togither, as every one of you hath a Psalm, or hath doctrine, or hath a tongue, or hath a revelation, or hath interpretation, let all things be done to edifying.</hi> This kind is far inferiour to the other, as being utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by men subject to err as wel in singing as in teaching, and it is to be tried by the psalms in scripture, and other authentik books. This was an extraordinary gift as strange tongues and the like. Yet M. S. loving to handle things confusedly, that his error might lesse appeare, speaketh here of singing Psalms as of one sort, and nature. Again, that he might make all serve his own fansie, he describeth singing of Psalms to be <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the shewing of our thanksgiving to God, by the manifestation of the spirit,</hi> Philip. 4. 6. 1 Cor. 14, 15—17. Wheras we find in the scripture many Psalms directly penned for <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 1. &amp; 49. &amp; 78. &amp; 91. &amp;c.</note> doctrine and instruction to the Church, as othersome are for thanksgiving to God: yea matter of all sorts, historie of things past, prophesie of things to come, rebuke, threatning, comfort, lamentation, and what not, is mixed in songs of the scripture, and why such Psalms
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18551:15"/>
might not by the spirit be suggested to Christians in Pauls time, (as wel as thanksgivings,) I know not any reason at all. So that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of prayer &amp; song mentioned togither, are insufficient to prove them both of one nature properly; as before is noted of prophesie: rather we are to distinguish praying, singing, prophesying, as three severall gifts and works of the spirit: and all of them Gods worship and service in the Church according to their severall kinds and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But it seemeth strange vnto me, that M.

               <p>HAving ended the point of <hi>worship,</hi> with the nature &amp; parts of it: it remayneth now to see, how this thing is applied by M. S. against reading of the scriptures.

For as the sound of the voice affecteth the eare and understanding of the hearer; so the sight of the letter affecteth the eye &amp; understanding of the reader: and as far dooth a book differ from an image, in this respect, as a man from a bell. A bell when it soundeth in the eare, yeeldeth no distinct articulate voice, for the edifying of the hearer; but a man when he speaketh, is vnderstood of the hearers, &amp; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable voice dooth edify: so an image when it is looked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, affoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a man no edification (no not if it were an image sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unlesse it had a <note n="†" place="margin">Iob. 4. 16</note>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: therfore the book of the law is called the similitude of an heavenly thing. Heb. 9. 19—23. Holy scriptures or writings began with Moses, Exo. 24, 4. and 31. 18. Ioh. 1. 17. 2 Cor. 3, 7. Before Moses, holy men prophesied out of their harts, and received and kept the truth of doctrine by tradition from hand to hand. 2 Pet. 2, 5. Jude ver. 14, 15. Deut. 31, 24. When Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses had written the law, he caused it to be put by the ark in the most holy place, as a witnesse against the people, Deut. 31, 26. therefore the Apostle caleth it the handwriting in ordinances which was contrary to us, which Christ nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his crosse. Col. 2, 14, Eph. 2, 15. Hence it followeth that the holy Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, the Hebrue scripture of the old testament, are ceremonies, 2 Cor. 3, 3, 7 Num. 5, 23. 24. &amp; by necessarie consequent. The book or tables of stone, typed unto the Jewes their hard hart, void of the true understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the law. 2 Cor 3, 3. Hebr. 8. 10. Ezek. 36, 26, 27. 2 Cor. 3, 14, 15. The ynk wherwith the letters were written, signified the spirit of God. 2 Cor. 3; 3, Heb. 8, 10. with Exod. 31, 18. The letters written or characters ingraven signifieth the work of the spirit, who alone doth write the law in our harts. by proportion. also Deut. 9, 10. with Heb. 8, 10. Reading the words of the law out of the book,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:18551:16"/>
                  <hi>signifieth the vttering of the word of God out of the hart, by proportion. See also 2 Cor. 3. 2. 3. 6. 1 Cor. 12, 7. The writings of the old testament being ceremonial, are therefore abolished by Christ onely so far forth as they are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, Col. 2. 14. 20. Gal. 4. 9. The thing signifyed by the book, viz the law of God &amp; the new testament remayneth, 2 Cor. 3. 11. 7. Heb. 8. 6. 7. 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here first may be observed, how M. Sm. professing to treat of the originall scriptures, in which both old and new testament, both law and gospel are written unto vs: taketh one part onely, to weet, the law or old testament, and from it will conclude against the whole body of the scriptures; and this fallacie he often useth in his writings. But if all he here sayth were graunted, that the writings of Moses were abolished by Christ: Yet will it not therevpon follow that the writings of the other Prophets and of the Apostles also, are typicall, ceremoniall and abolished. Nay rather the contrary would follow thus; that as circumcision, and the passeover &amp;c. were figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative shadowes ended by Christ, no more to be used; but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords supper instituted by Christ in sted of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, are continually to be practised: so the writings of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, if they were shadowes &amp; ended by Christ, yet the writings of the new testament, given insted of the other, are never to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it be considered what M. Sm. hath here left unto vs, not ceremoniall and unabolished; <hi>the thing signifyed</hi> (sayth he) <hi>by the book, viz, the law of God and the new testament:</hi> but where is this to be had? not in letters written with ynk, on paper, or parchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for all these he sayth are ceremoniall and so abolished; but written in mens harts as in books, with the spirit as with inck, and so to be uttered by men, out of their harts. If Satan can but perswade this point, he will bring out of mens harts, as out of the bottomlesse pit, a smoke of heresies, insted of the fyrie law of God, &amp; who shall control him. For mens harts now, are the same which Gods book was of old; and as Israell fetched their lawes, doctrines, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and services from the scriptures written with inck: so Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now must fetch their lawes, doctrines, worship. &amp;c. from the harts of men, as from the tables of the lavv, and vvhat is from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18551:17"/>
thence uttered, is to be counted, as written with inck of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For the hevenly things themselves are as much yea more to be honoured, esteemed, credited; then the book which was but a type and similitude of heavenly things. H. N. the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Gods scriptures, can shew no stronger ground for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milisme, wherein he reprocheth scripture learning: then this which is here layd by M. Smyth.</p>
               <p>But the scriptures and reasons which he hath brought, be farr from proving so deadly an error. For the book of God as alwayes, so stil, <hi>signifieth and representeth to our eyes heavenly things;</hi> (although <note n="*" place="margin">As that mentioned Heb. 9. 19.</note> some figurative extraordinary vse thereof be abolished:) for it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth and teacheth vnto vs the mysteries of the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And as the book of the lavv was a witnesse <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 31. 26.</note> against Israel, when they <note n="¶" place="margin">vers. 27.</note> walked rebelliously and with a stiffe neck: so is it a witnesse to this day <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 48.</note> against all Christians that walk in like sort. But such in Israel as had the word <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 30. 14.</note> neer vnto them in their mouth and in their hart for to do it; the book of the Law was a witnesse for them; a <note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 19. 7 8.</note> sure testimony giving wisdom to the simple, a perfect law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the sowl; and the statutes of the Lord therein, were right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and rejoyced the hart, the commaundement of the Lord was pure and gave light unto the eyes: even so to all faithful Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now, the writings of the Prophets &amp; Apostles is a <note n="“" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</note> sure word, to which they do wel to take heed, as to a light shining in a dark place; by it they <note n="¶" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.</note> beleeve, and so come to life; and by it <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 4</note> their joy is made full.</p>
               <p>Agayn M. Sm. erroneously substituteth one extraordinary use of some part of the scripture, for the ordinary uses of the whole. Moses wrote in a book the old testament or covenant of works, (summed vp in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 21. 22. <hi>and</hi> 23. <hi>chapters:</hi>) which book was read in the peoples eares, and sprinkled with blood, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also was; for a sanction or confirmation of the Testament: in which action there was an extraordinary and figurative vse of the book for that time, which now is abolished by Christs blood which hath confirmed the new testament, and abrogated the old. The holy histories, prophesies, psalmes, parables &amp;c. were never thus sprinkled with blood; but onely that book wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the covenant were written. Wherefore there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18551:17"/>
this, other ordinarie permanent &amp; perpetual uses of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>presume above that which is written.</hi> Wherefore it is a deceit of Satan for mans ruine, to seek to make the scriptures generally &amp; wholly ceremonial and abolished; because of that extraordinarie use of them at the sanction of the law, at mount Sinai.

               </p>
               <p>As for the law of God to be written in mens harts by the spirit, this taketh not away the use of the law written in books with ynk; for in Israel when the bible was read every Sabbath, David had the law of God within <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 40. 8, 9.</note> his bowels, whereby he declared righteousnes in the great congregation; and as he, so every other righteous mans mouth, spake of wisdom, &amp; his tongue talked of judgment, <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 37. 30. 31.</note> the <hi>law of his God</hi> being <hi>in his hart,</hi> as Moses <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 6. 6</note> commanded: yet ceased not the reading of the law out of the book.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18551:18"/>
As for al hypocrites, they are now as heretofore stony harted, and the outward letter written with ynk, resembleth their hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>But whereas M, S. having cited Deut. 31. 26. inferreth, <hi>therfore the Apostle caleth it the handwriting in ordinances which was contrary to us, which Christ nayled to his crosse Col.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 15. he mismatcheth the places: for Paul speaketh of <note n="†" place="margin">Col. 2. 8.</note>

For by circumcising the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, they acknowledged (as by a bil of their hand) that they were born in syn, and impure by nature: even as we by baptising our selves, doe the like. By offring sacrifices for syns, they acknowledged themselves actual transgressors of the law, and the killing of beasts, argued themselves were vvorthy of death.

Would any man think that such bitter &amp; sweet waters could come out of one fountain, as have flowed here? Standeth this eyther with religion or with reason; that that which as an adversary, is <hi>blotted out, nayled to Christs crosse,</hi> &amp; <hi>abolished</hi> as being <hi>ceremonial</hi> and a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rudiment; should yet be the <hi>fountayne of all truth,</hi> the <hi>ground of faith,</hi> &amp;c. If these will stand togither, what wil not? Then also may circumcision, altars, sacrifices, and other Iewish services, although they were shadowes and abolished by Christ; yet be reteyned and used of Christians, with a little qualification, and distinction of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship properly so called:</hi> and this will like the Iewes very well. But we that have learned Christ, cannot brook such contrary potions. For if the book, writing &amp; reading of it be Iewish shadowes ended and abolished by Christ; and the hart and speaking out of it, be the shadowed thing, the heavenly truth, figured by, and substituted for the other: we would keep the substance, &amp; leave the ceremony for such as follow shadowes. But if the book of God, the written scriptures, be <hi>the fountaine of all truth, and foundation of our faith;</hi> as it is in deed, and we so esteem it: then can we not but detest, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plot, as a groundwork of Satan, that hung vp the scriptures as our enemy vpon the crosse, so blotting them out as a cancelled bond, and abolishing them for ever.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the reading and expounding of the scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth, now as of old in Israel, where the lavv and prophets were read in the synagogues every sabbath, for to teach &amp; inform Gods people in his vvayes: so read vve them still for like end and vse, and shall by Gods grace (maugre Satans slights) so do vnto the end.

difficultie and more brevitie, discover and do away the errors. His reasons are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because Christ used the book to fulfil all righteousnes, Mat. 3. 15. &amp;<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> having by the use of the book fulfilled the law of reading, he shut the book in the synagogue, to signifie that the ceremonie of book worship, or the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the letter, was now expired and finished. Luk. 4. 20. Ioh. 19. 30.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First here is the <hi>law of reading</hi> brought to an end, according to<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that first ground of <hi>ceremonies;</hi> &amp; contrary to the second grant that the scriptures <hi>are to be read in the Church and to be interpreted:</hi> which reading and interpreting if it be not Gods worship and service, it is the worship of the Divil. Thus M. Sm. wavereth as a reed shaken with the wind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the other side of the leaf, <note n="†" place="margin">Differ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n. pag. 7.</note> M. Sm, forgetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a drunken man, sayth, <hi>all the worship that was appointed by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for the Preists, was limitted to the holy place, whether the people were not admitted; and therefore reading was of an other nature performed in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter court or synagogue or elsewhere, eyther by the Levites or any other learned men;</hi> (quoting againe Luke 4. 16.) <hi>and so no part of worship properly so called, but onely a ceremonial ground or foundation, of inward or outward spirituall worship, common to the Churches of all ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be so, how ended Christ the <hi>ceremonie of book-worship,</hi> where none was to end? If there were no proper worship in the synagogues but exercises of an other nature; then Christ reading in the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, read not worship; and shutting the book there, shut not up book worship, nor caused it to exspire; and so M. Sm. hath lost his dream.</p>
               <p>Agayn, if Christ by shutting the book there, signified an end of reading; and the reading that there was, (as M. S. even now sayd,) was such as is <hi>common to the Churches of all ages:</hi> then Christ hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all manner reading whatsoever in the Church, even that which is common to all ages; or else the allegorie will turn to a fansie; &amp; so all reading must be abolished out of the Church; &amp; that would the Divil faine bring to passe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:18551:20"/>But the reason of ending reading, is slight; that because Christ shut the book and gave it to the Minister, therfore he ended the work of reading. He used not to do such weighty matters, by dumb signes, without <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 12. 13. &amp;c.</note> word of signification. And if the <hi>closing</hi> of the book were such a mysterie: what was the taking and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the book, nothing? proportion will cary it to be the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as well as shutting should be the end. But they be vain spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, to gather from mute actions, an otherthrow of morall lawes, permanent and needful for the the Church in all ages. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this the first or the last time of Christs reading thus; for <hi>as his custome was</hi> (sayth <note n="†" place="margin">Luk 4. 16</note> the scripture) he went into the synagogue and stood vp to read: neyther was it a decent thing, that he having received the book shut, should redeliver it open; their books being long rolls or volumes, not bound vp like ours. Finally this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against reading, hath like weight of truth, as the Papists have for their vanities, who <note n="“" place="margin">Sanders Rock Pref.</note> allege for prayer in a strange tongue, that Christ prayed <hi>Eli Eli lama sabachthani,</hi> which the people that heard him, vnderstood not: and <note n="*" place="margin">ibide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ch. 9.</note> that he preached out of S. Peters bote, to signify how in S. Peters chaire, his doctrine should alwayes be stedfastly professed. Such trifles must be brought wher sound proofs are wanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. Because reading words out of a book, is the ministration of the letter.<note place="margin">2 Reason.</note> 2 Cor. 3. 6. namely a part of the Ministerie of the old testament which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, Heb. 8. 13. 2 Cor. 3. 11. 13. and the ministerie of the new testament, is the ministerie of the spirit. 2 Cor. 3. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This scripture of the 2. Cor. 3. M. Sm. often allegeth for his<note place="margin">Answer.</note> purpose; pag. 1. &amp; 7. &amp; 13. &amp; 19. and 20. he thought belike it would sound well in simple folks eares, that the reading of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should be the ministerie of the letter. But the ignorance &amp; evil of the allegation is great; and fitted for Satans policie, to draw men from reading the book of God. For if <hi>reading</hi> be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Letter there spoken of; then is it the ministration of death &amp; damnation, as the Apostle there calleth it, vers. 7. 9. and then the Papists have doon best of al, forbidding the people to read the scriptures, least they should gather out of them errors, and so
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18551:20"/>
death and damnation. And who can comfortably read the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if that be the ministerie of the letter, and so death? But out vpon such a slanderous interpretation; it is farr from the Apostles meaning. He calleth the <hi>Law</hi> the letter, figuratively, because it was written with letters, &amp; graved on stones: he intendeth not the books of the Prophets, wherin both law and gospel was written, &amp; alwayes to be read for instruction, comfort &amp; salvation to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The law vvas first spoken, and aftervvards vvritten by Moses: the gospel of Christ vvas also first spoken, and aftervvards vvritten by his Apostles. If vvriting and reading made the other the letter, then maketh it this the letter also; and so the vvord of life, shalbe the ministration of death. The lavv if it had never been vvritten, but onely spoken, yet had it been the ministration of death: for all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael hearing it, <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 20. 18. 19.</note> vvere afrayd, and death seised vpon their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and this by hearing Gods lively voice from heaven, not by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the stony tables read, for it is not manifest that ever they vvere read unto them, but onely put and kept in the ark for a testimony. Deut. 10. 1—5. and when the 10. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements were read <note n="*" place="margin">Ex. 24. 7.</note> out of the book, there was no such feare: and the glorie of Moses face terrified the people when he <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 34. 30. 31. &amp;c.</note> spake and talked with them, for which he put a veil vpon him: but of reading out of a book at that time (wherto the Apostle here hath reference,) there is not a word. So it was not reading onely but speaking also without book, which was the ministration of the letter to the Iewes; and as Paul here calleth the law the <hi>letter,</hi> so elswhere he calleth it, <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 19. 20.</note> the <hi>voice of words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not therefore the writing, but the thing written which he intendeth. And if M. Sm. should fall to the heresie of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the works of the law, and teach this in prophesie out of his hart, though he never read line in the holy Bible, yet should he be a minister of the letter and of damnation to his disciples.</p>
               <p>Of this letter Paul sayth, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7</note> it is the <hi>ministration of death:</hi> but of the scriptures Christ saith <note n="¶" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39</note> serch them, for in them ye think to have eternal life. Of this letter Paul sayth, it is <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 9.</note> the ministerie of <hi>conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> but of the <hi>holy letters</hi> in Gods book, he sayth, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> they <hi>are able to make one wise unto salvation</hi> through the faith vvhich is in Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>The law is called the <hi>letter</hi> (not <hi>letters</hi> as the <note n="“" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</note> scripture is called) by a similitude: for a letter is an outward visible thing appearing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18551:21"/>
to the eye of an other that looketh on; whereas the thing whereon it is written, whither paper or stone, is not moved or changed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Such is the doctrine of the law to the professor of it. It maketh him seem a fayre hypocrite before men: they look and see the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God written on his forehead, on the fringes of his garments, and on his dore posts: but his hart and mynd are stony stil. For the law renueth no man, but syn that is in us, <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 7, 8.</note> taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by the law, and worketh in us al manner transgression of the law, and so death. But the Gospel is the spirit that renueth &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by faith in Christ: and changeth <note n="*" place="margin">Eze. 36. 26, 27. Heb. 8. 10.</note> the stony hart into flesh, and writeth there the lawes of the most high. Thus by the <hi>letter</hi> is not meant the holy scriptures, which are Gods instrument for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation: but the external work of the law upon a man: in which sense Paul also mentioneth <hi>circumcision in the letter</hi> Rom. 2. 29. mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outward circumcision of the flesh to be seen and read of men: where to take it as this man doth 2 Cor. 3. of reading the scriptures, were to follow the <note n="“" place="margin">

                  <hi>3. Because upon the day of pentecost and many yeares after the churches<note place="margin">3.

               <p>Nay, it is not in mens power to yeeld to the truth though<note place="margin">Answer.</note> it be shewed them: or though their own writings convince them: it is in <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 9, 16</note> God that shevveth mercy.</p>

               <p>His florish that he maketh, how <hi>the churches of the new testament used no books,</hi> because no example can be shewed: is a deceitful argument.

And this adversary granteth the scriptures were to be read; and we are sure that the churches were to be taught by the men of God: and Paul sayth that al the scripture <note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16. 17.</note> is profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, to instruct in righteousnes: that the man of God, that is the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 11.</note> minister of the new testament as wel as of the old, may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, &amp; made perfect unto al good works.

               </p>
               <p>God never gave books to read for prayers unto him: but <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 10. 17.</note> pre,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> pared mens harts and bended his ear. And as every man <note n="†" place="margin">1 King. 8. 38. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>knew the plague,</hi> (and consequently the benefit) in his owne hart, so was he to pray &amp; <hi>supplicate unto God,</hi> who heard in heaven, and was merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and did, as he knew every mans wayes and hart. But as in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men speak their minds to God: so in preaching God speaketh his mind to us; and this he doth by his scriptures and by gifts unto men for teaching and applying them ordinarily to his Church. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying and singing,</hi> hath often been performed by the spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book, <note n="“" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>8 Because it is against the nature of spirituall worship: for when we read,<note place="margin">8.

                  <hi>was onely once every 7. yere, Deut. 31. 10. 11. and therefore it was no part of ordinary worship, and there is no commandement in Moses, given eyther to the Preists or Levites, for ordinary reading of the law in the tabernacle. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hence it foloweth, that reading in the old testament, was no part of the worship of the tabernacle or temple, or of the service performed by the preists therin, &amp;c. Thirdly, therfore reading was of another nature performed in the utter court or synagogue or elswhere, eyther by the Levites or any other learned men of what tribe soever: Math. 23. 2. Luk. 4. 16. Act. 13. 14. and 15, 21. Deut. 31. 9.-11. 1 Chron. 16. 4. 7. 37. 39. &amp; 15. 1. 8. &amp; 28. 13. 2 Chron. 34. 14. 30. 31. Neh. 8. &amp; 9. and so no part of worship properly so called, but onely a ceremonial ground or foundation of inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward spiritual worship common to the Churches of all ages. Lastly it is not deneyed but that reading now is to be used in the Church: onely we say it is not a part of spiritual worship, or a lawful meanes in time of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al worship.</hi>

And where findeth M. Sm. a commaundement to read the law in the synagogues? yet was it commanded, or els it was will worship and vanitie. The ordinance for Levi to <note n="¶" place="margin">

               <p>But here M. Sm. sayth, that the reading in Israel was <hi>no part of worship properly so called:</hi> forgetting himself (it seemeth) when elswhere he sayth, that the <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 19.</note>

                  <hi>Christ shut the book in the synagogue to signifie that that ceremonie of bookworship, or Ministerie of the letter was now exspired.</hi> Thus fighteth he against himself; one while they had <hi>book worship;</hi> an other while it was <hi>no part of worship;</hi> &amp; if <hi>properly so called</hi> help not here at a need, M.

For he would have his reader think that we whom he opposeth, made arguments for <hi>bookworship,</hi> which here he answereth, wheras we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spake or thought of reading to be worship in such a sense, as he would draw it vnto, nor othervveise <hi>worship</hi> then reading vvas in the synagogues, by Christ himself, neyther vvas there controversie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout worship at all, but onely whether it were Gods word or mans, that we read in the Church, in the worship of God. But now to cloak his blasphemous error, he hath dived into his wit, to bring out a distinction of <hi>properly so called:</hi> so cogging the reader with the <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4. 14</note> die of deceit, and calumniating vs. And hath he not also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juried Israel in charging them vvith <hi>book worship,</hi> and belyed Christ himself, that he should use and finish a <hi>ceremonie of book worship?</hi> when yet here he granteth it vvas <hi>of another nature,</hi> it vvas <hi>no part of worship properly so called:</hi> it vvas that vvhich is <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the Churches of all ages.</hi>

Where the learning of the Aegyptians, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the hethen poets are alleged: and further he nameth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>translations, dictionaries, histories, chronicles, commentaries. &amp;c.</hi> Behold here what place this man alloweth the reading of the scriptures, yea even of the Originals: they must not be read but by way of <hi>opposition, difference, plea and strife;</hi> they must not be read but where when and as histories, chronicles, commentaries, books of hethen poets and al other like, may be read and produced: so they are tollerable, otherweise there is no place allowed them: though elswhere he <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 6.</note> esteemeth better of them then of other writings. But in the actions of the <hi>preisthood,</hi> in the actions of concord or union, to read them is idolatrie. What haeretik professing Christ could more have sought the disgrace of Gods holy book; then thus to shut it quite out of Gods worship, allowing it no other place, by these his wicked grounds, then Iulian the Apostata Christs deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would and did allow it (though he esteemed worse of it) in his blasphemous writings.

               </p>
               <p>But let us proceed with his answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover (<hi>sayth he</hi>) when he commandeth his Epistles to be read in the<note place="margin">Answer.</note> churches, his meaning is not strictly literal: that is that the very words which he wrote should be repeated verbatim out of the book: but his meaning is that the sense of the words or meaning of the Apostle should be related, whither by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18551:25"/>
reading the very words, by expounding the meaning by interpreting or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Loe here the shifts of haeretiks. Paul willeth the church <note n="†" place="margin">Col, 4, 16.</note> to read<note place="margin">Replie.</note> his Epistles, yea <note n="*" place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 27.</note> chargeth them in the Lord, to read them to al the brethren; and writeth to them again, to <note n="“" place="margin">2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2 15.</note> keep the instructions, taught by his Epistle: M. Smyth sayth <hi>the meaning is not strictly literal, that the words which he wrote should be repeated:</hi> but <hi>the sense ralated.</hi> As if Paul wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted fit words to set down his meaning, &amp; they that should read, could tel it better. He that readeth, must read words as they ar written, specially in Gods book, &amp; Epistles from the holy Ghost, wherein <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro,</hi> 30. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> no one word is vaine idle or unprofitable, no word mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed or out of order: and he that shal presume to add or diminish or change the order in reading Gods writings, doth wickedly, and <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 22. 18. 19.</note> is neer unto the curse. If things in reading be difficult, God hath given gifts unto men to open and expound them, to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of al: but this expounding is not reading. Reading is first, exactly to the letter; exposition cometh after with such words as God putteth in the expositors hart; as by <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 25—28.</note> Daniels practise, we may learn. Neyther are the words of the expositor comparable to the words of the writer; these being divine, are al as silver <note n="†" place="margin">Psa, 12. 6</note> fined seven times, no drosse mixed with them. The other being humane, (I speak of ordinary men as we are) and shewing the mans judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that expoundeth them, are mixed with humane infirmities, mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and sometime deadly errors. Wherfore reading of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal scriptures wherof here we treat, must be strictly literal, as is in the book. Translations are after to be spoken of; and is here vainly inserted, for Paul wrote in Greek, which al in Colosse, Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea, Thessalonica, and the whol country over, used as their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, that they needed none to translate for them.</p>
               <p>Further M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Let it be granted that the Apostles and Evangelists used no books being<note place="margin">4.

                  <hi>of scripture written into the church, and to read them as parts or helps of worship, then to bring in expositions, resolutions, paraphrasts and sermons upon the scripture, seing al these are equally humane in respect of the work equal ly divine in respect of the matter they handle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very impious is this comparison which thus matcheth a mans comment or written sermon, with Gods written word set over into an other tongue: for it debaseth the majestie of Gods law, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth too high, the basenes of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Translation</hi> is that in writing, which <hi>interpretation</hi> is in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: namely the expressing of an others mind: but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or expounding, is the expressing of ones own mind or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. The scriptures first written in Hebrue, and secondarily written in English: do set forth one and the same word &amp; mind of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18551:27"/>
God unto us, though which different letters &amp; sownds: as <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> is interpreted and translated <hi>God with us,</hi> Mat. 1 23. <hi>Messias</hi> is interpreted <hi>CHRJST</hi> in Greek; <hi>ANOJNTED</hi> in English.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation changeth not the nature of the thing: for then <hi>Messias</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> shoul not be one and the same; and so the gospel and new testament, and our faith were overthrown; and more then Iewish superstition should prevail. But God who hath sanctified by his <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2. 4.</note> spirit, all sounds and languages to the ear: hath also sanctified by the same spirit all <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 1. 8.</note> letters and characters to the eye; as th'Apostles practise sheweth, writing with Greek letters, words and phrases; which had beene profaned by lying histories and lascivious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, unto all manner idolatry and wickednes. Herevpon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the word of God, in whatsoever letter or language it be written or spoken vnto vs; is the word of God stil; so to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and regarded: and not to be basely and profanely counted among humane and apocryphal writings.</p>
               <p>A comment or exposition of scripture, as for example, vpon this word <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> sheweth the mans iudgement mind or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that commenteth; telleth the reason of this name why it was given to Christ, discourseth of his godhed, of his manhood, of the uniting of these two in one person, of the end and use of these, and many such like things. This being done by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men, is properly an humane writing, (though it may be, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God,) shewing by letters as by signes, what is the mind or understanding of such a man in this mysterie of Christs

               <p>Now God hath by his Prophets and Apostles written to his Church a short summ of his mind and will; guiding and <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> carying them, and <note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> inspiring their writings with his good spirit; that there should be nothing but <note n="“" place="margin">

               <p>But because in these scriptures, somethings are <note n="†" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>hard to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,</hi> and all men know not how to use and apply Gods word unto their times, estates, actions, &amp;c. therefore hath Christ given <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4. 11 12. 13. 14 1 Cor. 12.</note> gifts unto men, to open and apply the scriptures for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church vnto the worlds end: alwayes binding them both teachers and hearers, to the foundation layd <note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2 20.</note> by the Prophets and Apostles, whose writings are sufficient to make men wise <note n="“" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</note> unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Iesns.</p>
               <p>For this cause the holy scriptures are necessarie for al Churches, to be read &amp; expounded unto the people: &amp; as every nation differeth in language, so to have the word spoken and written in their vulgar tongue, which change of the tongue or letter, changeth not the nature of the word spoken or written, but it is stil divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. Onely because in this changing or translating, imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wants, errors may fal in: therfore the first writings as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Apostles penned them, are to be made the absolute canon, rule, touchstone, whereby al translations are to be tried: by which being tried &amp; found faithful, it is the same word of God, in what language or letter soever, &amp; differeth as much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries or expositions, as heaven dooth from earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:18551:28"/>But Mr. Sm. avoucheth mens written sermons or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ments upon the scripture, &amp; the scripture it self written in English, to be <hi>equally humane in respect of the work equally divine in respect of the matter they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</hi> Of this his bold and false assertion he maketh no proof at al, it is a speculation of his own hart. Two carnal reasons he setteth down, which are these. <hi>To translate the originals into any mother tongue is as wel and asmuch the worke of a mans wit and learning, as to analyse the scriptures rhetorically or logically, to collect doctrines and uses theologically, to give expositions and interpretations of places doubtful.</hi> Where first if M. S. mean the action of translating simply, without reference to the mater and thing translated, he doth but dally and seek to deceiv: for writing, printing, translating are al alike humane actions, but the things written printed translated, are differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, some good some evil, some of God, some of men and of the divil. The books of Moses written printed or translated, are Gods law; the book of Mahomet written printed or translated, is the divils law: the actions of writing, printing, translating, are mere humane actions in all of these. Now if because translating is an humane action, therefore the thing tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated must also be humane, &amp; the work of mans wit and learning: then also because writing and printing are humane actions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bible written or printed in Hebreue Greek &amp; al languages, must likewise be humane, and the work of mens wit and learning: and then there can be no divine scriptures but the very first copies which the Prophets &amp; Apostles wrote with their owne hands: And if Satan could perswade this; he would be glad.</p>
               <p>Secondly if Mr. Sm. meaneth the thing translated, as Moses law, Davids psalmes or other like in English: that these are <hi>as wel and as much the work of a mans wit and learning; as an exposition of doubtful pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in them or <hi>doctrines and uses collected from them;</hi> he teacheth wicked error, which al of judgment &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science wil abhorr. The holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures faithfully expressed in English or any language, is the work of Gods wisdome &amp; unserchable knowledge: and cannot without injury to his majestie, be said to be the work of mans wit &amp; learning; though man have used his skil in writing or translating it according to the original copie given of God. This plea of Mr. Sm. is like as if Ieroboam should have sayd; the <note n="*" place="margin">1. King. 6 23.</note> cherubims and <note n="†" place="margin">1. King. 7. 25.</note> the brazen bulls in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18551:28"/>
Solomons temple, are as wel and as much the work of mans wit &amp; skil as my <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 12 28.</note> golden calves; &amp; if they may be admitted into the house and worship of God, then why not these? If M. Sm. should answer that the cherubims and bulls which Solomon made, were commanded of God, and from the divine pattern, though humane art did make them; but Ieroboams calves were from his own hart: so answer I in this case; the translation is from the divine pattern of Gods original book, and commanded to be made and used; but to write comments or homilies to read in the Church, is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mans own hart, and hath no commandement or warrant from God so to be used; but are forbidden. Eccles. 12. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly he sayth <hi>The translator cannot conceive nor expresse in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whol mind of the holy spirit conteyned in the originals, but onely some good part of it: the expositor, paraphrast, commentator may expresse as much as the translator, yea and in respect of some particulars, as Hebraisms, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismes and the like considerations much more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a translator cannot expresse the whol mind of the spirit in al the bible, by his interpretation litteral or grammatical: then much lesse can the expositor expresse the whol mind of the spirit in the bible, by his exposition theological. For it is a thowsand times easier for a translator to do his duty to the ful, then for the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: yea this latter is utterly unpossible, I say not onely for one man, but for all the men in the vvorld.</p>
               <p>Though the translator cannot expresse to the full every vvord and sentence in the Bible, yet the most part he may; vvheras the expositor cannot do any at all, but is still to seek all dayes of his life, and they that come after him also.</p>
               <p>Hebraismes cannot alwayes be expressed, through defect of the language: yet translation is needful, and the translator is blamelesse. For example, this name <hi>God</hi> called in Hebrue <hi>Aelohim,</hi> Gen. 1. 1. is in Greek translated <hi>Theos,</hi> and that by the Apostles often in the new Testament. Here is a vvant in the language, for <hi>Aelohim</hi> is in form the plural number, signifying the Trinitie; yet joyned with a word of the singular number <hi>bara, he created:</hi> signifying the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the persons in the Godhed. Such a phrase the Geek tongue vvanted: therefore the Apostles admit of the Greek propriety, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18551:29"/>
the ful dutie of translators &amp; the defect resteth in the language, of which they were not Lords. And that the Lord respecteth not so much the words and phrases, as the matter meant by them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite examples in the scriptures do manifest.</p>
               <p>But whereunto leadeth this cavil? what if all cannot be expressed in the translation, shall we therefore have none in the Church? then neyther may we have any preaching by the voice of man; for none can fully expresse in his sermon, all things that God intendeth by a place of scripture, or any ground of religion. And if preaching must be vsed, though many humane infirmities be mixed with it; then also reading the scriptures (and consequently the translations to them that know not the originals,) must be used, though fewer humane infirmities be mixed therewithall; seing these both are the ordinances of God, as before hath bene proved.</p>
               <p>But then M. Sm. wil draw commentaries and homilies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church also. But that is denyed to be Gods ordinance. He hath <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.</note> appointed the lively voice of his graces in the mouthes of his servants to be heard in the Church, for the opening and applying of the word vnto them: but not their writings to be read. And because of some infirmities in translations, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them, as this man dooth, and match them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries; it is <hi>capele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>in</hi> (as the <note n="†" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 17.</note> Apostle speaketh,) to <hi>play the false vintner</hi> with the wine of Gods word. For as such a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser to make sale of his mixture, wherein some wine, much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea perhaps some puddle water is brewed togither, mought say, you can have no wine but such as is turned out of the first vessel; and it cannot be in the turning of it out, but some of the spirit and strength of the wine vvill vapour avvay, some tast it wil have of the nevv cask; therefore you may as well drink of this liquor, for in respect of the vessell they are both alike chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in respect of the matter they are both alike wine. Let M. Sm. therefore cease his odious comparisons of the translation with the comment: or else let him shew us some comment or sermon written upon any text, wherin at the least there is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and wine, and perhaps death in the pot.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1.

               </p>
               <p>I answer in the behalf of Israel; First, by M. Smythes divinity,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> the Church of Israel <note n="*" place="margin">Charact. of the B. pag. 16.</note> was a carnal people, had a carnal covenant or promise of carnal things, &amp;c. how is it then that he chargeth them here with profaning, <hi>the covenant of grace?</hi> and how wil this agree with his grounds of Anabaptisme?</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his divinity also, the scriptures and reading of them, is <hi>the mimistration of the letter</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. that is of <hi>death</hi> &amp; <hi>damnation;</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 32.</note> before hath been handled. How then could the litteral translation &amp; reading therof, be the ministerie or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace? the ministration of death, was fit ynough for the Gentiles that were to die. Or, did it kil them before the tyme?</p>
               <p>Thirdly I deny his collection from those scriptures against this action: for although the fulnes of time was not yet come, that God would send preachers with the power of his spirit, to convert all nations: yet followeth it not herevpon, that no gentile, no nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (no not though they desired it, as King Ptolomee desired the Bible;) mought have the truth imparted unto them. There is no such law made of God; nay the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie is playne. For, 1. ther were many strangers, Aegyptians &amp; others that went out with Israel to the Land of Canaan, not forbidden nor debarred of grace with Israel, Exod. 12. 38. nay the law admitted any stranger to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision &amp; the passeover, &amp; so to the covenant of grace, Exod. 12. 48. 49. 1 Cor. 5. 7.

               <p>3. There were also in Solomons time 153. thowsand and 600. strangers, none exempted from partaking with Israels mercy.</p>
               <p>4. God gave his law to be read even unto strangers also, Deut. 31. 12. so far vvas he from vvithholding grace, if any sought it.</p>

                  <hi>Because all the Gentiles ought to have been Proselytes of the Iewes Church, and to have come to Ierusalem to worship, Exod. 12. 43. 49.<note place="margin">The 2. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> Mat. 23. 15.

               <p>First, this reason enterfeireth vvith the former; for, if all ought<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> to have beene <hi>proselytes:</hi> hovv might not the covenant of grace be preached vnto them? Could they be converted vvithout the vvord of the covenant? Here the accuser of the Saincts hath <note n="†" place="margin">Prov. 26. 27.</note> rolled a stone, which is returned unto himself.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their conversion vvas not hindered but furthered by the Greek translation; for many novv might read and hear of Gods name, enquire after his truth and finding it, come to Ierusalem, and learn that tongue, if they could. So yet the seventie are not found in syn, vvhich helped men to righteousnes.</p>

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18551:30"/>Whether the <hi>characters</hi> were <hi>ceremonies</hi> or no, the LXX. are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent<note place="margin">Answer.</note> of this blame; for they wrote the bible to the gentils in the Greek characters, syllables, words, sounds &amp;c. and not in Hebrue. If M.

Or if he make the characters ceremonies in that sense, it is erroneous: for the Hebrues converted to Christ may &amp; ought to read the Hebrue scriptures in the Church, as they were wont in their synagogues. The profaning and abusing of the translated scripture was in deed a syn, in al that so did: so was it if any Israelite or stranger profaned the Hebrue. Yet Hebrue copies might goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, notwithstanding the danger of profanation, how much more the Greek? The personal synns of some, may not hinder the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik good. Otherweise, at this day bibles should not be printed and commonly sold, because atheists and profane people may buy and abuse them. The scriptures are as much to be reverenced now, as ever they were; although M. Sm. hath laboured their disgrace.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If at this day Turks captiving Christians should ask in scorn and<note place="margin">Answer.</note> mockage to sing some spiritual song for them to laugh at, I doubt not but we should answer them as the Iewes did the Babylonians; &amp; not expose Gods word to derision. But if any would hereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, it were syn to translate the scriptures into vulgar tongues, M. S. himself <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 17.</note> would condemn him: like mesure must be meted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for these frivolous reasons.</p>
               <p>The scriptures were not ceremonies, (though there was some figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative use <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19</note> of the book of the law,) but if they had been, yet this is an error in M. Smyth. to bound them within the holy land. For circumcision was a shadow, (or as he calleth it, a ceremonie) yet did they it in Babylon, and many shadowes moe. And for the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who doubteth but the Iewes had and used them in Babel,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18551:31"/>
which was out of the holy land: Yea some of the scripture was written and sent to Babylon, as Ier. 29. 1. &amp;c. some written in Babylon, as the prophesies of Ezekiel and Daniel, Ezek. 1. 1. &amp;c. and some written in the Babylonian language, and not in Hebrue, as Ezra. 4. 7. 8. &amp;c. Dan. 2. 4. 5. &amp;c. Wherfore if any Babylonian would have sought for God, the scriptures should not have been deneyed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The translation &amp;c. is contradictorie to the Lords mercy to the<note place="margin">5. Reason.</note> Iewes Church, and their special privileges. Psal. 147. 19. 20. Rom. 3. 1. 2. Act. 10. 28. and 22. 1. 2. 3. 4—18. Eph. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. Act. 13. 46. 47. 48. Rom. 16. 25. 26.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reason is in a manner the same with the first, and so<note place="margin">Answer.</note> before answered.</p>
               <p>The Iewes privileges even then appeared, that the Gentiles must have the instrument of mercy, the scriptures from them. And that God gave them this not for themselves onely, but also for the Gentiles occasionally, is before proved. Generall mercy I know there was not, as is now under Christ.</p>
               <p>Peters fact was caled in question, about conversing and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, being uncircumcised, Act. 11, 2. 3. not for letting them partake of the privilege of Gods word: for it was permitted the Gentiles to hear the word read and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the synagogues, as appeareth Acts. 13. 42. 44. 46. 48. And how was it contradictorie to Gods mercy to the Iewes, when his prophets wrote some of the scriptures in the hethens language: as did Daniel and Ezra, which are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because that seeing the Hebrue writings were ceremonies, it was<note place="margin">6. Reason.</note> unlawful for the Septuagint to change them from their proper kind, and to picture them out by the Greek writings for the Greeks use.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here agayn is a repetition of the third reason, refuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and if he wil he may make it twentie; by a little change
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18551:31"/>
of the words. But the weight of the argument is shewed to be too leight: and Greek writings for Greeks use, was no more unlawful, then Chaldee writing for the Chaldeans use; which the LXX. had learned by Daniels example, if no way els.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because the LXX did of purpose concele many things, as iudging the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils<note place="margin">7. Reason.</note> unworthy to know them fearing also least they should profane such holy mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, wherein their consciences told them plainly that their translation was syn. Also they did pervert many things of purpose, add somthing, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt their translation, which was their greevous synn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This last reason seemes to come from M. Smyths gealous<note place="margin">Answer.</note> head, or surmising hart: and it is overthrown by himself. For a little after he <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 14.</note> sayth, <hi>it is manifest by histories that the LXX. translation is lost; and this that goeth under the name of the LXX. is a patcherie made out of ancient writings.</hi> If this be so, how knowes this accuser, that they <hi>infinitely corrupted their translation?</hi> seeing he never saw their work, which long synce is lost? Belike he thought it might be so; and therfore he wrote it was so. If he make not better proof of this his heighnous charge; al men may see whose sonne he is, that so calumniateth the saincts: &amp; readeth without book not onely their <hi>infinite errors,</hi> but what <hi>their consciences told them also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His inference hereupon, that <hi>the Apostles would never account so synful a translation to be holy scripture coming from the holy Ghost, nor approve the use of it in the Greek churches;</hi> This faleth with his weak reasons: there being no such greevous syn proved against the Greek translation: but rather we may judge it a blessed work of God, that hereby brought many Gentiles to be proselytes, and prepared them for the receiving of the gospel. Albeit I deney not but errors were in the translation, some of which as occasion was, the Apostles in their writings did amend. And whereas he further sayth, <hi>there could be no use of the LXX translation for reading in the latine church of the Romans.</hi> I answer,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18551:32"/>
First if there was use of it, in the Greek churches onely: it is ynough to warrant like use of translations in al churches, in what tongue soever. Secondly, there could be use of it even in the church of Rome, where the Greek tongue was commonly known before the Apostles time, as <note n="†" place="margin">Orat. pro Archia.</note> Tullie testifyeth, and the poets <note n="*" place="margin">Omnia Graece. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal. Sat. 6</note> taxed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for it. And if they understood not Greek, is it likely that Paul would have written his Epistle to the Romans in Greek, as he did? seeing he misliked speaking (and consequently writing,) in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue. 1 Cor. 14. 6. 18. 19.</p>
               <p>M. Sm. having spent his strength, (though in vain) to heap syn upon Israel for translating the bible: <note n="“" place="margin">Diff. pag. 11.</note> procedeth unto <hi>arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reading translations in time of worship.</hi> Where first I wil give the reader advertisement, how contrary this enemie is to himself: and then I wil come to his frawd against the truth. Of the scriptures set over into other languages, commonly caled <hi>translations;</hi> he thus affirmeth <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>A translation is as much and as truly an humane writing, as the apocrypha</hi> (<hi>so commonly caled</hi>) <hi>writings are.</hi> Againe he sayth, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations <hi>are not the pure word of God, and so contrary to Eccles. 12. 10. Mat. 15, 9.</hi> Agayn, <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 10.</note> that translations of scripture, and written sermons upon the scripture, <hi>are equally humane in respect of the work, equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in respect of the matter they handle.</hi> These and the like blasphemous opinions he sought to infect our church withal, for which he was resisted: these laboured he by word and writing to confirm, with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical reasons, the pillars of al heresie. Yet even in this same book, he pulleth down this his former uncouth building; it being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of error, as the <note n="“" place="margin">Pro. 14. 1.</note> foolish woman, to destroy her howse with her own hands. For afterwards he writeth thus, <note n="†" place="margin">Dif. p. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The translation agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the originals, is a secondary scripture, yet much inferiour to the originals.</hi> So then it is not apocryphal, unlesse he use a fallacie in this word <hi>scripture:</hi> for we understand hereby (as Christ <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 5. 39</note> himself did) holy scripture, inspired of God: as 2 Tim. 3. 15. 16. <hi>It may be read</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in the church, and sung in tunes.</hi> Then (say I) it is not as the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal (so commonly called) writings are: for their very name sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>hidden,</hi> teacheth that they are not to be read in the publik church. <hi>Jt may</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be expounded in the church.</hi> But so (say I) may not homilies be, nor apocryphal writings. And if M. S. in his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18551:32"/>
synagogue doe read and expound such scriptures to his people, he maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with himself notorious idolaters. Exod. 20. 4. 5. 2 Tim. 3. 16. 17. Eccle. 12. 10. <hi>The matter of it</hi> (sayth he) <hi>agreable to the originals, is inspired</hi> to weet, of God. But the matter (say I) of the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal books, as Iudith, Tobie &amp;c. though exactly translated, is not inspired vnlesse of the Divil; for lyes and fables are in them both, the translations I mean, and the original Greek copies. <hi>Jt may be made a ground of our faith</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and an instrument to try doctrine by.</hi> Then is it (say I) not apocryphal but Canonical: for it is made a <note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>canon,</hi> that is, <hi>a rule</hi> of our faith and walking. But far be it that humane apocryphal writings should have such vse in the Church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wil M. Sm. ground his faith upon this, that ther are <note n="*" place="margin">Tob. 12: 15.</note> 
                  <hi>seven holy Angels, which present the prayers of the Saincts;</hi> and that lying <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi> (of the kinred of <note n="“" place="margin">Tob. 5. 12</note> Azarias,) is one of them? wil he ground his faith upon this, that <note n="†" place="margin">Tob. 6. 16, 17.</note> the smel of the hart and liver of a fish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed on the coles, wil so drive away the Divil, that he shal <hi>never come againe any more?</hi> or wil he have his disciples to try their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by such crooked instruments? no marvell though they be led with him into the ditch, when they try his doctrine by that which they professe to be <hi>as much and as truly an humane writing, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha (comonly so called) writings are.</hi> For it argueth that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they use the Bible but for a shew and colour, (seing they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme so vily of it:) or else that they honour the base borne apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, as inspired of God. Which is the very syn &amp; snare, that they have sought to bring upon us.</p>
               <p>Now let vs examine his arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 Thes. 5. 21. Try all things, keep that good thing. But no man ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant<note place="margin">1. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of the tongues can trie whither the translation be fit or good: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man ignorant of the tongues, can strictly keep or read a translation in time of worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here first M. Sm. striking at the translation, mysseth that, and<note place="margin">Answer.</note> hitteth onely the ignorant reader of it: for if one have skil of the tongues, &amp; know it to be truely translated; this reason maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against his reading, but for it. So M. Sm. playes the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18551:33"/>
to argue against a holy thing, because of the ignorances &amp; infirmities of some men. He mought thus have cavilled against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the law in Israel; that no man blind of sight (as was <note n="“" place="margin">1. King. 14. 4</note> Ahijah the prophet) could trie whither the original scriptures were truly written or not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if he proceed further as he hath begun, hereafter he may come with like reason thus: <hi>Try al things, keep the good thing: but no man ignorant of the tongues, can trie whither the interpretation of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which the minister giveth in preaching the word, or any text that he allegeth in his doctrine be fitt or good;</hi> then mind what conclusion the Divil wil make hereupon, in a simple mans conscience: to draw him to doubt of, and consequently to forsake and despise, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly al reading, but also preaching of the word, because he being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the tongues, cannot judge or trie whither that which is read or taught be true; according to the original scriptures. And thus he falleth into the snare of Satan, which Mr. Sm. here hath set in secret.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this reason overthwarteth that which elsewhere the man granteth; that the <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 17.</note> translation <hi>may be made the ground of our faith and an instrument to try doctrine by.</hi> This being so, how dooth Pauls counsel (<hi>Trie al things &amp;c.</hi>) make against translations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom. 14 23. 1. Tim. 1. 4. - 7. Heb. 11. 6. whatsoever co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not from<note place="margin">The 2. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</note> faith is syn. but no man ignorant of the tongues can of faith use the translation, seing he cannot examin it whither it be good or bad; and so beleve or refuse it. Therefore it is not of faith in him, and so it is syn for him, to use it before the eye in time of worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like sophistrie and impietie is in this argument as in the former;<note place="margin">Answer</note> for it concludes not the thing unlawful in it selfe, but onely in him that is ignorant of the tongues; and his faith, it seeks to shake. For ther is no faith without <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> Gods word, and where to have this word he cannot tell. If it be set over from the originals to his mother tongue in writing, he cannot trie whither it be good or bad: if the Minister translate or interpret it by voice, the poor

man is as much uncertain, or more, whither the teacher speak true or false. Thus can he neyther read nor hear of sayth, if M.

                  <hi>the matter of the translation agreable to the originals is inspired: but not the writing or character.</hi> If the thing written be inspired of God, then is it canonical scripture, 2.

               </p>
               <p>M. Sm. is like one of them that <note n="†" place="margin">Ezek. 13. 18.</note> hunteth the sowles of Gods people; setting reasons as hayes to intangle. <hi>No one translation</hi>

tures, as if he should have sayd unto an Israelite, <hi>no one sheep of thy pasture is the best thou hast: seeing the Lord may in time of worship minister a better,</hi> (as he did the ram <note n="*" place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 22. 13</note> to Abraham:) <hi>therfore no one sheep of thym may be offred for sacrifice Mal.</hi> 1. 8. Nay his reason against transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath not so good a colour as this: for it is certaine that God once ministred a ram to Abraham for sacrifice; but it was never heard that God so ministred an other translated book to read, then that which was brought to be read. The gift of interpreting or expounding by voyce, is of an other kind, and not properly read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherof we intreat. But let us follow M. Sm. in his circle, &amp; see whither he wil lead us. No translated bible may be read in Gods worship, for God may minister a better: what then? shal I bring the original bible &amp; look on that, exspecting what interpretation God wil give me to speak: seeing I may not read?

                  <hi>the holy</hi> original <hi>scriptures are not to be reteyned as helps before the eye in time of spiritual worship:</hi> So then neyther is that the best sacrifice yet, but I must exspect the Lord to minister a better. If neither the translated bible nor the original be the best: where then is the word that is best to be read or uttered to the people? In a mans owne hart: that must be the book out of which M. Sm. wil have Gods lavv to be read in his vvorship: al other books are as <hi>images and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, abolished,</hi> &amp; <hi>ended</hi> by Christ. Though he plead here against translations, colourably; yet he aimeth at Gods book generally, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as his holy Prophets and Apostles vvrote it. But the vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this engine is before discovered. Also for translations this further I say; the scriptures in English are the best for to read unto English eares; better then eyther Hebrue or Greek, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear. And seeing it is needful the scriptures should be read; the translation is best. Yet so, as no Christian is tied to the words of the book, but if he know any error in print or tralation, or any better words to expresse Gods mind; he is to do all things for the best unto the church; giving the sense togither with his reading, as the practise was in Israel, Nehem. 8. 8.

as truly an humane writing as the Apocrypha (so commonly called) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are; and seeing it hath not the allowance of holy men inspired but is of an hidden authoritie, it may be iustly caled Apocryphon, for the signification of the word importeth so much, and therfore not to be brought into the worship of God to be read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apocryphal vvritings are humane both in matter and form,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> in language, letter, vvords, sentences, method and order: the book of God set over into English, notwithstanding the difference of the letters and sounds, is yet for the substance divine, the words, senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and methode heavenly. He that translateth faythfully, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth not the nature of the work translated, neyther maketh he it his own. Luke translating into Greek Esaias prophesie from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue, (Luk. 4. 17. 18.) and we translating it into English, have not changed the prophesie it self, from divine to humane, from Gods work to mans: it was no fruit of our <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>learning</hi> to find out such a prophesie of Christ; but we understanding the originals, expresse the same thing in English which Esaias wrote, and it is his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie not ours. And the visions of Iohn in the Revelation now Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; are not <hi>as much and as truely an humane writing,</hi> as if M.

               <p>These things are spoken of the Apocrypha, not as touching the outward letter or language, but for the substance or things in them conteyned.</p>

               <p>Thus see we the weaknes of these reasons; and how M.

               <p>The second proposition is untrue, and injurious to al the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">Answer.</note> of God; and the Divil it seemeth put in his hart to write this, as a ground of his anabaptisme, wherunto soon after he drew him; and now hath moved him to write further, that <note n="†" place="margin">Coar. of the B. in the Epistle.</note>

Is not the praysing of God, a part of his worship? &amp; Christ when the children cryed Hosanna in the temple, defended their fact against cavilling Iewes, by this, that out of the mouth of babes and fuklings, God had made perfit the prayse.

Mr. Sm. ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptised himself with water: but a child could have done the like unto himself, who cannot performe any part of spirituall worship: therefore Mr. Sm. anabaptising himself with water, did no part of spirituall worship: and consequently it was carnal worship, and service of the Divil. If he answer, that a child though he could cast water on himself, &amp; utter such words as he heard Mr. Sm. speak withal; yet could he not preach or open the covenant as Mr. Sm. did: I answer in like manner, though children may read the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures perfectly wel; yet can they not preach nor open the covenant as did the Preists and Levits, Nehem. 8. 8. and as Christ himself did when he read in the synagogue, Luk. 4. Wherefore reading and preaching being joyned togither, as baptising with water &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he that condemns the one outward action because a child can doe it, condemneth also the other by the like reason. And Mr. Sm. having thus written of children, and doon to himself; the babes and sucklings whose soules he would murder by depriving them of the covenant promise and visible seal of salvation in the Church; shal rise up in judgment &amp; shall condemn him in the day of Christ.</p>

Thirdly, therfore as Antichrist hath polluted al Gods ordinances, so hath he violated the original scriptures; and therfore one Cainan must be put out, for some ancient copies have it not: and for 75. there must be seventy al: pente for pantes: as Rom. 12. 11. kairo kurio, and it is possible easily to mistake so smal a matter, in copying out any thing, as experience teacheth.</hi>

And if God so bare with the Iewes hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of old: what mouth can blame him for bearing with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both of Iewes and Gentiles here? Nay rather his mercy is to be magnified for writing his word so: as the weak mought not stumble or fal away, the froward mought not cavil. For had the Apostles written in Hebrue, the Grekes (&amp; of liklihood many Iewes)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not have vnderstood: and if they should have ordinarily left the common translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not onely the Gentiles mought have made doubt, but the Iewes would have taken occasion to speak evil.

God therefore who turneth al things to his glorie turned this his indulgence, to the praise of his grace.</p>
               <p>4 Mr. Sm. hazardeth the credit of the original scriptures, and of al mens faith; in saying <hi>Antichrist hath violated them, as he hath pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted al Gods ordinances.</hi> It is not good, they say, to bely the Divil: &amp; Antichrist hath evil ynough upon him though he be not charged with violating the originals, which this accuser wil not easily prove. No doubt but copiers, and writers might fail, and did mistake; and some thinking to mend the new testament by the old, or Luke by Matthew, might make it worse; which by true copies may be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So faults are in translations through ignorance or oversight. But this point if it were true, helpeth translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and hurteth them not. For if the <hi>originals be violated,</hi> and yet are not for the faults to be rejected: so translations may be violated, &amp; the <hi>errors</hi> in the part, are no cause to reject the whole.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly (<hi>sayth he</hi>) fully to answer the obiection whatsoever is good in the<note place="margin">Answer.</note> LXX translation, was taken out of the new testament, and ancient fathers of the Greek church. For it is manifest by histories that the LXX translation is lost, and this that goeth under the name of the LXX is a patcherie made out of ancient writings: &amp; therfore the holy Ghost doth not aim at the LXX. translation at al, as is imported in the obiection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not <hi>fully</hi> but foolishly to answer: for though the LXX. trans.<note place="margin">Replie.</note> were now lost, yet was it not lost in the Apostles dayes, nay ther was no other but that known in the world; &amp; to reason because we have it not now, therfore they then <hi>aimed not at it at al,</hi> is without reason or colour of truth. Neyther doth M. Smyth manifest by histories that the Seventies translation is now lost: rather the translations of <hi>Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotio,</hi> &amp; others that synce the Apostles time set over the bible in Greek, these al are lost, save some peeces of them; and that which we have, is for the body of it the Seventies, though much corrupted with words and sentences of the other. And this Hieroms translation of the prophets from the Septuagint, and his commentarie citing the divers versions of <hi>Aquila, Symmachus &amp;c.</hi> sheweth: and the best Greek bibles now extant, that have <hi>varias lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones</hi> do confirm the same.</p>
               <p>Neyther if al were granted which he would, is the objection <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi>

for the Apostles <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. 3. Heb. 3. 7</note> cite the scriptures in Greek, which the prophets wrote in Hebrue; eyther therfore they <hi>aymed at the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint</hi> or translated it themselves. Whereupon it followeth that the Hebrue text set over into Greek, is the scripture of God stil, and speech of the holy ghost. Or (if M. Smyths divinitie had then been known,) the unbeleeving Iewes mought have alleged, that Paul proved not his doctrine by canonical scripture, but by apocryphal writings, that were equally humane with the Rabbines commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in respect of the matter: and in respect of the letter &amp; language, worse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were Greeks and Graecians, Hellenes and Hellenistai, Rom. 1. 16.<note place="margin">The 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection</note> Act. 6. 1.

               <p>

               <p>That the Iewes were dispersed in the Greek nations, we may read al over the historie: for there were synagogues of Iewes at <hi>Salamis,</hi> Act. 13. 5. at Antioch of Pisidia: Act 13. 14: at Iconium, Act. 14. 1. at Thessalonica, Act. 17. 1. at Beraea, Act. 17. 10. at Athens, Act. 17. 16. 17. at Corinth, Act. 18. 14. at Ephesus, Act. 18. 19. and other places. Their dispersion among the gentiles, had been about 300 yeres: for Ptolomee Lagi King of Aegypt, surprising Ierusalem una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, caryed many thowsands of them captives, and made them freemen of Alexandria upon their oath of fealtie; and after them many Iewes went thither of their own accord, as <note n="†" place="margin">de antiq. Iud. lib, 12. cap. 1.</note> Iosephus witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. And his son Ptolomee Philadelphus who procured the bible to be turned into Greek; willing to gratifie the Iewes, made free six skore thowsand of their captives: who remayning in those parts, not onely learned Greek, but forgat Hebrue, as may evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by Ben Sirachs words in his prologue before his fathers book, among our Apocrypha, caled <hi>Ecclesiasticus.</hi> For <note n="*" place="margin">Prologue of Iesus son of Syrach: or Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticus.</note> he in the dayes of Ptolomee Euergetes, (who reigned next to Philadelphus) turned his Fathers Hebrue work into Greek, <hi>that they which remayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in banishment</hi> (as he sayth) <hi>and were desirous to learn, might apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to good manners, and live according to the law.</hi> This paynes he might hav spared if his people al, could hav understood Hebrue.

it is most probable, that many Ievves had forgot Hebrue, so is it almost incredible, that al should keep it, in such estate; vvhen also they maried vvith the gentiles, as Timothees mother is a president. Acts. 16. 1. Moreover in Ierusalem it self it may be probably gathered they knevv &amp; spake Greek. For when Paul spake once in Hebrue to them, it it is noted how the people kept the more silence. See Act. 22. 1. 2. and 21. 37. 38. 39. 40. And very learned Iewes, as <hi>Philo</hi> of Alexandria, who lived in the Apostles dayes, and <hi>Josephus,</hi> wrote eloquently their works in Greek, having smal skill in Hebrue, as by their writings may be gathered.</p>
               <p>Now for M.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18551:42"/>
I answer, though there he was born, yet his bringing up was in <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 22. 3</note> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem at the feet of Doctor Gamaleel, where he learned both the language and law of the Pharisees; and therfore boasted to be an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue</hi> as wel as any other.</p>
               <p>And for those whom the scripture calleth <hi>Hellenists</hi> or Greekists they seem to be no other but Iewes. For they that were Proselytes or converts among the Hethen, are called <hi>Hellenes</hi> Greeks; as Iohn. 12. 20. <hi>ther were</hi>

                  <hi>Greeks among them, that came up to worship at the feast.</hi> Neyther know I why a Greek converted to Iudaisme should hav the name of a <hi>Greekist,</hi> seeing by his conversion, he doth more degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from Greekisme; so that the name were unfit. Besides, in Act. 2. 10. &amp; 13. 43. such converted strangers, are called <hi>Prosclytes</hi> not <hi>Hellenists.</hi> Likevveise vvhen Paul nevvly converted, disputed in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem vvith the <hi>Hellenists,</hi> and they vvent about to slay him, Act. 9. 29. this their cariage argueth that they vvere Ievves, for it is not like that strangers vvould have been so busie in that place.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly (<hi>sayth M. S.</hi>) the worship of God properly so called of the whol<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Church of the Iewes was performed in the holy place at Ierusalem, and so that which was performed in the synagogue was not properly the worship of the whol Church of the Iewes: but was of that nature that passed between Christ and the Doctors in the temple Luk. 2. 46. with Act. 17. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neyther is that which we performe in our assemblies, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<note place="margin">Repl.</note> of <hi>the whol church of the Christians,</hi> but of our own particular Church: neyther is our reading the scriptures, the <hi>worship of God properly so called:</hi> as before I have manifested.

               <p>Though all the Iewes worshiped at the temple thrise in the year, yet followeth it not thereupon they had no proper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in their synagogues. For Mr. Smyth himselfe counteth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie or preaching, proper worship; and this was in their syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. Againe Prayer &amp; thanksgiving is worship properly; &amp; this they did other where then in the temple as appeareth Act. 16. 13. Neyther can we think of our godly forefathers (howsoever Mr. Sm. counteth them a carnal Church,) that they would read and preach the word, and not pray in their synagogues; yea their synagogues were caled <hi>Oratories</hi> or prayer howses; as witnesseth <hi>Philo</hi> a Iew in the Apostles age, who complayning of the outrage offred in <hi>Alexandria</hi> (the city wher he lived) by throwing downe the synagogues <note n="*" place="margin">Philo de legat. ad Caium.</note> caleth them <hi>Proseuchas Oratories;</hi> and mentioneth also the synagogues of Rome, by the same name.</p>

                  <item>2. <hi>Instituting worship in a common tongue, which was as unlawful as sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing a dog.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Therefore it was false worship; as it was to sacrifice an unclean beast</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Proper worship is an vnproper term wherwith Mr. S. would cloke<note place="margin">Repl.</note> his error, before discovered. But had it been <hi>proper worship,</hi> yet this mans charge of them were both unproper and untrue. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the willing neglect and forgetting of their Hebrue, was syn: yet the constreyned losse of it was not syn. The scripture alleged mought have taught him this; for <note n="†" place="margin">Neh. 13. 24</note> they that of lust maried strange wives, which taught their children Azotik or <hi>Ashdod</hi> speech, are just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blamed by the holy Ghost: but were any blamed for speaking Babels tongue, where they had been prisoners neer 70. yeares? nay Ezra and Daniel wrote a great parte of their books in Babylons language, and not in Hebrue. And if it had been such a breach of the ceremonial law as is intimated; Daniel and his brethren who refused the <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The comparison of <hi>sacrificing a dog</hi> is odious: for mought not converted strangers pray and praise God in their mother tongues; did God abhorr their languages, as doggs in sacrifice? Daniel was skilful both in Sions tongue and Babels: and he writing his book, recordeth his own prayer and thanksgiving in Babylons language; Dan. 2. 20.—23. He that should have condemned this for false worship: the godly Iewes would have counted him a dog. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets warned Israel of the Idols of Babel, but never of their tongue: nay Ieremie in Canaan, teacheth the people in the Chaldee tongue, how they should answer and confute Idolaters. Ier. 10. 11. And what wil this calumniator of the saints, say of Christ himselfe, who prayed on the crosse, <note n="“" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly (<hi>sayth M. Sm.</hi>) if they read the seventies translation, and the<note place="margin">Answer.</note>

               </p>
               <p>First this followeth, that the bible translated, is the bible stil;<note place="margin">Repl.</note> and Moses turned into Greek, is Moses stil: for it is not sayd that apocryphal humane writings were read in the Synagogues, but the <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 13. 15. &amp; 15. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>prophets.</hi> So it proveth the question, that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in our mother tongue, are divine writings, not humane, as M. Sm. avoucheth. Hereuppon it wil folow undenyablie, that they are to be read in al Christian churches now, as then in Israel: and not as profane &amp; apocryphal, to be quite thrust out of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The Apostles shewed an end <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 15. 24. &amp;c. Col 2, 16. 17.</note> of circumcision, and like legal shadowes: but never any end or ceasing or reading the scriptures: nay they shew plainly the contrary. 2 Pet, 1, 19, 2 Tim. 3, 15, 16, 17. 1 Thes. 5, 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deut. 31. 12. The reasons that are alleged for reading the law are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,<note place="margin">3.

               </p>
               <p>Hereunto M. Smyth answereth: <hi>First the law of reading is not moral in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
                  <hi>the particular act, but in the equitie, for it was commanded to be doon but once in seven yeare, at the feast of tabernacles, Deut. 31. 10. and if it had been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the particular act, it should have been from the beginning, which was not so, seing it began with Moses, and it should continue after the end of the world, for moralities indure for ever: but books and so reading of books shal perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men should <note n="“" place="margin">

He sayth the law was commanded to be read <hi>but once in seven year:</hi> these words, <hi>but once,</hi> are not of the law, but of his own false comment. There was a special charge to read the book then, in the eares of al togither; not intending to read it <hi>but then.</hi> For every sabbath, was to be <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and al things are sanctified by the word and prayer; and Israel knew this wel, and therfore from old tyme read the word in the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 15. 21.</note> every sabbath; and our Lord Christ <note n="“" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:18551:44"/>No better is the next plea, that because writing &amp; reading began with Moses &amp; was not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, therfore the law of reading is not perpetual, neither bindeth us now: a Familist or Atheist may likewise say, baptisme or the Lords supper in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular outward act, is not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue til the worlds end, because it was not from the beginning, but began with Christ. A practise commanded of God, at what time soever; is to continue til by him it be repeled, which reading the scriptures never was, but repeted and augmented, by the Apostles writings. Like vanitie is in the reason following: <hi>books and reading of books shal perish,</hi> when the world is at an end: therefore now whiles the world continueth, we are not bound to read Gods book. Mought he not have made these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against preaching the word, and other ordinances of God, as wel as against reading; seeing these shal cease also at the end of the world. But a <note n="*" place="margin">Isai. 44. 20.</note> seduced hart hath deceived this man, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver his sowl, nor say, <hi>Js there not a lye in my right hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> (sayth he) <hi>it is moral in the equity, that is, that al meanes must<note place="margin">Answer.</note> be used to attayn the knowledge of the truth, wherof reading is a principal: and yet hence it followeth not, that reading is eyther part or meanes of spiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: For books are things meerly artificial, as are pictures and images, Gen. 4. 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here again the enemie is caught in the snare of his own tongue:<note place="margin">Replie.</note> for if <hi>reading</hi> Gods law be a <hi>principal mean</hi> to attayn the knowledge of the truth now, as it was in Israel, Deut. 31. 12. and so moral &amp; perpetual: then his former cavils against the objection, may be cast as dung upon his own face. Then do we wel to read Gods word in our church, for that end: and M. Sm. hath doon wickedly for it to blame us, and charge us with idolatrie. To hide this his shame, he runs into his old borough, that it is <hi>no part or meanes of spirituall worship;</hi> but out of this he hath been often hunted before: and wee are sure that observing it according to Gods wil, we worship &amp; serv God in spirit and truth, as wel in this as in other like ordinances of the gospel.</p>
               <p>His matching of <hi>books</hi> with Tubal-cains craft (Gen. 4. 22.) &amp; <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> sheweth how his idol error hath <note n="†" place="margin">Isa. 44. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> shut his eyes that he cannot see, his hart that he cannot understand. For in holy scriptures (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we

                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6.</note> is in them, so as when we <hi>read in the book of Moses,</hi> we <hi>read that which is spoken to us of God;</hi> as the Evangelists <note n="*" place="margin">Mar. 12. 26, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Mat. 22. 31</note> in playn words teach us: whereas in handicrafts we see or enjoy but the fruit of mans wit and skil; and an image without life, is the <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 18</note> teacher of lyes. Such impious comparisons seem rather to come from Tubal-cains forge, then from any possessed with the spirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reading the law was performed in the Synagogue, and not tyed to the<note place="margin">4 Obiection</note> temple: an argument that reading is not ceremonial but moral, for no part of ceremonial worship was performed from the tabernacle or temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This objection with the reason, (I think) was never so made of any, but by M. Smyth himself. It is true that reading was <hi>not tyed to the temple;</hi> it is true also (though this argument thus framed, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proveth it) that <hi>reading is not ceremonial.</hi> The last branch is untrue, for some ceremonies or figurative services <hi>were performed out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> His answers to this obiection, are for the most part true, being wel understood: but in part false, when by the way he denyeth <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law to be a moral action;</hi> wherof he giveth no reason at al: and the thing is handled before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luk 4. 16. Christ stood up to read and redd his text, and then preached<note place="margin">5. Obiect.</note> out of it. Now his actions are our instructions: and therefore we are to read words out of a book, in time of preaching or prophesying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This objection M. Smyth hath falsified: it was never thus pressed by us for translations, whereof now we treat: but thus. Luke repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that Christ <note n="“" place="margin">

                  </note> read where it was written <hi>The spirit of the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me &amp;c.</hi> This text Luke setteth down in Greek, which Esaias wrote in Hebrue; whereupon it followeth, that the scripture translated into an other language, is the same scripture stil for the substance of it, though the letter and language differ, and is not an apocryphal humane vvriting, and so an idol in Gods vvorship, as Mr. Smyth blasphemed. Els, Luke and the new testament cannot be defended against Ievves that should cavil, hovv humane apocryphal vvritings, are cited for divine and canonical. Thvs serveth it to prove the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of translated scriptures, by necessary consequence: and that vve

are not bound to bring the book of the law and prophets in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue when we vvould read to the people, and so interpret or <hi>read mentally</hi> out of it, as M. Smyth then dreamed: though since he is fallen to forbid the Original Hebrue also, in Gods vvorship, as vve have heard before. But M. S. finding (as seemeth) this objection too heavie for him, hath sought to change it, as he could best make ansvver: vvhich is thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First in that it was doon in the synagogue by Christ which was neither</hi>

                  <hi>on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read:</hi> and after speaking from the scripture which he had read, <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>al bare him witnesse, and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred at the gracious words, which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> He <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 26. 25. Joh. 18. 20.</note> sate dayly teaching in the temple and in the synagogues among the people. But al this reading and teaching: vvas <hi>no proper part of the worship of the old testament,</hi> (vvith M. Smyth) because <hi>he was neither Preist nor Levite.</hi> Hovvbeit, <note n="*" place="margin">Dif. p. 6.</note> before he vvould needs persvvade us by a mystical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, that <hi>Christ having by the use of the book fulfilled the law of reading, he shut the book, to signifie that the ceremonie of book-worship was now exspired.</hi> So svveet an accord &amp; harmonie is in his vvriting. Wel, Christs action here is excluded from being a part of Gods vvorship. But M. Smyth though he vvere neyther Priest nor Levite of the old testament, nor Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor nor teacher, no nor member of the church of the nevv testament, (he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers having dischurched themselves and dissolved their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;) yet he in that estate, preached, and anabaptised himself, and then anabaptised others: and this in him was the worship of God, or els of the divil, properly so caled. And hath not this man behaved himself like a proud Korah, that without al office would presume to do these things which he counteth proper worship; and yet censureth Christs action in reading &amp; preaching of the word to be no proper part of worship, because he was neyther Preist
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18551:45"/>
nor Levite? Shal the word out of Christs mouth, read and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with al grace of the spirit (which he had without measure) be no proper part of Gods worship; and shal the word which Mr. Smyth uttereth out of his hart, be proper worship? And of what <hi>nature</hi> may we think, was <hi>that exercise performed by Christ and the Doctors in the temple?</hi> was it none of Gods worship? He was I am sure <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 49 46. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>in his fathers busines,</hi> among the teachers of the word, whom he heard, whom he asked, whom he answered with such understanding as astonied al that heard him. If M. Smyth esteme his own teaching or prophesying used in his sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue to be the worship of God; and this of Christ and the teachers of Israel in the temple, to be not his worship: he is worthy of al true Christians, to be holden Anathema.</p>
               <p>But <hi>reading</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is serching the scriptures, which is not worship.</hi> But reading (say I) as Christ now did, is proclaym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God unto the people: and if <hi>preaching</hi> be worship, <hi>reading</hi> in this sort is worship: not <hi>proskunesis,</hi> suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or prostrating unto God: but <hi>latreia</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> a worship or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God in the spirit, in the gospel; as before hath been manifested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly (<hi>sayth M. Smyth</hi>) Christ had the Originals the Hebrue<note place="margin">Answer.</note> text of Esay the Prophet, and read or interpreted out of it: for it is doubtful whither he uttered the Hebrue words, or spake the sense of the Hebrue in the Syriak dialect, and therefore from hence reading a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cannot be concluded, but eyther reading or interpreting the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How it maketh for translations, I shewed before against<note place="margin">Replie.</note> M. Smyths frawd: and to that we have no answer, but by-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters brought as clowds to darken the light. And if we had alleged this for the Originals, yet Mr. Smyth would not have allowed it, as before hath been shewed. He doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whither Christ spake in <hi>Syriak</hi> or not: but if he so did, &amp; preached or prophesied in that common language, (as before I have shewed it most likely,) and preaching or prophesying be properly worship; and <hi>instituting worship in a common tongue,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:18551:46"/>
                  <hi>Be as unlawful as sacrificing a dog,</hi> as M. Smyth before <note n="†" place="margin">Dif. p. 15.</note> affirmed: wil not he be found a blasphemer of Christ, as one that speaks not by the spirit of God, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>calling Iesus execrable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly (<hi>sayth he</hi>) hence cannot be concluded that manner of preaching<note place="margin">Answer.</note> now used, that a man shal take his text, and then divide it into parts, analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it rhetorically and logically, collecting doctrines and uses from every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp;c. of his text, al this while he hauing his book before his eye, to help him at al assayes: a thing whereof I am assured the holy scripture yeeldeth no warrant that it may be counted a part of spiritual worship. For though the scripture may be so handled, and that for very profitable use; yet that is rather a scholastical lecture, then an Ecclesiastical worship, it is rather an inquisition and serching of the holy spirits intent and purpose then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the scriptures <hi>may be so handled, and that for very profitable use:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Replie.</note> surely Mr. Smyths schisme, and charge of idolatrie layd upon us, had <hi>very unprofitable use,</hi> and wicked end. For his owne conscience can testifie for us, if it be not feared; that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaded for other use of the scriptures, then was in Israel, where Christ <note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 4.</note> read the text, and after taught from and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; where the <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 8. 8</note> law was read, the sense given, and the people caused to understand the reading; where <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 21.</note> lectures were of the law &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in their synagogues every sabbath; and other such like exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. But because we did thus out of our translated English bibles (of him called <hi>apocrypha,</hi>) he accused us of <hi>idol-latrie,</hi> that is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or service of idols; we mainteyned it to be <hi>theo-latrie,</hi> that is, the worship or service of God, because it was Gods word, not mans, though written in English. This point is now sought to be shifted off, and a nue question made, whither reading the scriptures in the Church may be caled worship: which I have cleared before.</p>
               <p>His sophistical distinction of <hi>scholastical lecture, and ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal worship;</hi> we heard not of til now; and it serveth him in no stead: for every such lecture in the Church to Christs scholars, is the <hi>latreia</hi> or service of God, not of Idols; and is a manifestation of the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits intent, as of old was in prophesying. The teacher most properly doth then inquire &amp; serch, when he prepareth himselfe privatly by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18551:46"/>
reading, studie and meditation, to expound the scriptures in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik. Were not the voices of the Prophets in Israel, a manifestation of the spirits intent? But when they were read in the synagogues, their <note n="*" place="margin">phonas.</note> 
                  <hi>voices</hi> were heard, as the scripture teacheth; Act. 13. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly (<hi>sayth M. S.</hi>) if we must needs be tied to this example of Christ,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> (which J see no reason for, seeing reading was of the old testament,) then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Christ shall bind also thus farr, as that the book shalbe layd aside, so soon as the text is read, and the book that is used, shalbe the originals, which is nothing for vocal but for mental reading, or for interpreting, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought to contradict. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man that I know, <hi>tieth</hi> to follow this particular example.<note place="margin">Repl.</note> We doubt not but men may teach, without any book. But that it is lawful by Christs example here, to read, open and apply the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; as by other examples of him also, to preach without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The mayn thing is left, and new questions set on foot.</p>
               <p>We know wel, he at first contradicted not <hi>mental reading</hi> (as he calleth it) or <hi>interpreting</hi> out of the originals though now he writeth against the use of the originals also, as before we have seen: so fast he runns on in error. His co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt of mental reading, as it hath no grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ here, nor any prophet or Apostle, to be the ordinary way of reading or interpreting scripture: so mind we it to be a far more vncertayn and erroneous course; let the man make as many <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees</hi> after it, as he will.</p>
               <p>Having answered these few objections, as we see; he <note n="*" place="margin">Differ. pag. 18.</note> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards questioneth <hi>whither the hearers may have their translations or the originals to read or search in time of prophesie.</hi> Which he deneyeth. Of this point, though it was not controverted between us, yet I wil speak what I mind about it. Not condemning it, as dooth he; nor iustifying it, as it is abused by some; but shewing the mean, which I take to be best.</p>
               <p>His first reason is; <hi>that the Prophets and Apostles wrote books, but never divided them into chapters or verses, Henry Stephen first made the verses of the N. Testament:</hi> whereupon he concludeth that the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers could not serch their bookes in time of hearing.</hi> I deney the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for in reading the law &amp; expounding it, comparing words with that which went before and after; the hearers mought serch
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18551:47"/>
and see; though it were with more difficultie.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Hebrue bibles that we have, are all divided into chapters and verses; as also into other sections, noting where the lecture of the law began and ended, and the lecture of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets answerable to it. Whither the first writers did this, or the Church after them, I wil not dispute; but that thus they might doe, I make no doubt: For God hath left to the discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church and Ministers, what quantitie of scripture to read and teach of. And this was the practise in th' Apostles dayes; for it was not possible that every sabbathall the law and prophets should be read over: &amp; the Hebrue letters and marginall notes, are sufficient records of the antiquitie of them. The Churches practise in the books of the Prophets, sheweth us our libertie in the Apostles writings; which cannot be read over at once. And long before <hi>Henry Stephens</hi> time the Greek copies of the new Testament had chapters and sections though otherweise then we now have. And Matthewes gospel par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into 68. chapters or titles, and 355. sections, was in a manner as easie for the readers to serch, as it is now with us; and so the rest.</p>
               <p>His second reason is, that th' Apostles in citing scriptures, <hi>quote not chapter and verse, but onely say it is written by Zacharie, by Jeremie; the scripture sayth,</hi> &amp;c. This reason dependeth on the former, and is there answered, in part. Further I observe, the Apostles speak diversly, sometime naming <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 13. 47.</note> no book at all; sometime naming the book, as <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 1. 20</note> the Psalmes; sometime a part of the book; as <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 33.</note> the second psalme, and how they particulated matters in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is not set down; the summonely of things is recorded. The argument therfore concluding, thus, it is not written that they quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chapters, therefore they did it not; is not of force, negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But if if be true which <hi>Hilarie</hi> an ancient writer <note n="†" place="margin">Prolog. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Psal. expla.</note> recordeth that the seventie Greek interpreters did number and order the Psalmes; and we find that sometimes the Apostles quoted what Psalm in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they alleged; it may warrant us such like use of humane labours, for help of our memorie.</p>
               <p>His third reason is of like nature, <hi>that no mention is made of any hearer that had his book</hi> &amp;c. yet mought it be, say I, though it were not mentioned, they used to dispute in their synagogues (after the lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18551:47"/>
was ended); and that <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 17. 2</note> 
                  <hi>by the scriptures:</hi> and the hearers <hi>serched</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>the scriptures dayly</hi> for trial of doctrine. Who now can say that the hearers had or used no books in the synagogues?</p>
               <p>His 4. reason is, that <hi>serching quotations hindreth attention, for the mind and affections are distracted from hearing by seeking the places</hi> &amp;c. This I grant to be amysse, in all that so use their books; for diligent eare shoud be given to all that is spoken. Howbeit this abuse, may not abolish the lawful use: for as by turning of leaves many hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in time of hearing; so many againe attentively hearkning, and comparing things spoken with the matters before and after in the chapter, are not hindred at all, but greatly furthered by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their books. And for this matter, I rest with that rule given by th' Apostle, for all things to be doon unto edification, seemlily, and with order. 1 Cor. 14. 12. 40.</p>
               <p>His last reason is, <hi>that manuscripts being few, and very dear, (there being yet no printing found out) all could not have or bring their bookes; but there is onely one kind of true aad profitable hearing: eyther all to have bookes and serch or none.</hi> If God have left it to the wisdom and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people when and how to use the scriptures, so it be not to confound actions or hinder their good: I wil not bring their libertie into bondage, nor prescribe a law, where God hath given none. Though written copies were dear, yet were they many; &amp; many had them; not all: for all now have not. That such as have not books, or cannot read, should prejudice other that have &amp; can, there is no reason. It is not therefore for us to walk by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this case, but by general ground and equitie from Gods law: who permitteth us free use of the scriptures for our edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to which if men use them in private or publik, they do well.</p>
               <p>Thus am I at an end about the mayn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversie of the scriptures, which for the readers good I have beaten out and explaned, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true differences which he handled covertly for his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Wherein the judicious may discern, how Mr. Sm. hath been up and down, wavering like a reed shaken of the wind; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seming to allow translations, sometime bitterly writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: that as easie it is to know <note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 30. 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>the way of a serpent upon the rock;</hi> as the way of a man with his mineon error.</p>

               <head>A DEFENCE OF CHRISTS MINISTERIE in the church: against the contradiction of M. Smyth.</head>
               <p>VNto the former battel against the scriptures, M. Sm. addeth strife about the ministerie: affirming that <hi>the triformed presbyterie</hi> (as he calleth it) <hi>consisting of three kind of Elders, viz. Pastors, Teachers, Rulers, is none of Gods ordinance, but mans devise; and that lay elders (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) are antichristian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That other point, being an idol of his own invention, which he would have had worshiped in our church, I have more largely dealt against: this latter being a thing oft discussed heretofore, and no new thing by him alleged; I wil the more briefly answer.</p>
               <p>M. Smyth a while before, both agreed in judgment with us; and wrote <note n="†" place="margin">Principles &amp;c.</note> in defence of this ministerie which now he oppugneth: but that his first fayth and labours, he retracteth in this book: and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence is fallen into further error about the covenant between God and his people. So by degrees he is come to undermine the word, the ministerie, and the covenant of grace, three mayn grounds of Christian religion: to manifest himself one of those which <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1</note> privily should bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that hath bought them, and bring upon themselves swift damnation.</p>
               <p>Touching the Eldership, his assertion is; <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dif. p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>The presbyterie is uniform consisting of Officers of one sort. Esa. 66. 28. compared with Exod. 28. 1. and Num. 11. 24. 25. 1 Tim. 3. 1—8. Act. 14. 23. Phil. 1. 1. Ier. 23. 1—4. Ezek. 34. 1—6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this opposite would have avouched the contrarie, he mought with farr more reason have alleged these scriptures. For Isa. 66. 21. speaketh of <hi>Preists</hi> &amp; <hi>Levites.,</hi> which had charge of the sacrifices &amp; sanctuarie: and Num. 11. 24. mentioneth the LXX. elders of Israel, joyned with Moses to ayd him in the government: and which mought not meddle with the sacrifices. And are these fit scriptures to prove <hi>Officers of one sort?</hi> If he mean no other <hi>Uniformitie</hi> in the presbyterie, then was between those Elders and the Preists, he fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his own shadow, not with us: who hold a more strict agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18551:48"/>
in the Eldership of the church now, then was in that Eldership and preisthood of the law; where one tended to civil causes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ecclesiastical. But I wil come to his <note n="†" place="margin">Dif. p. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>reasons, proving the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be of one sort, viz. al Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First in the old testament (<hi>sayth he</hi>) there was but one kind of Priests,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> who had equal authority to administer al the holy things: excepting the high Priest, who typed forth Christ: so proportionably in the new Testament, there is but one sort of Elders, who succede the Preists in the dispensation of holy things. Esa. 66. 21.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here at first, the falshood of this adversarie: even now<note place="margin">Answer.</note> he quoted scriptures that spake of Preists, Levites and other Elders; al which were different: and here he taketh one sort onely, <hi>Preists,</hi> to conclude about the Eldership of the church of Christ. But thus to reason from part of the figure; to the whol thing figured, is mere deceit.</p>
               <p>Again, he misseth in his proportion, making al the Elders now, to <hi>succeed the Preists</hi> then, who <hi>had equal authoritie to administer al the holy things.</hi> For the prophet speaketh both of <hi>Preists</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> Isa 66<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. which had not equal authoritie in al the holy things, as the law plainly sheweth, Numb. 16. 8. 9. 10. 40. and 18. 2. 3. If now al the Elders be of one sort, &amp; equally administer al the holy things, proportion is not kept with the Priests and Levites of the law as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saias prophesied.</p>
               <p>M. Sm. saw this inconvenience, and therfore <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 28.</note> afterwards seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus to shift it off. <hi>The Deacons</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in the new testament are answerable to the Levites in the old; as the Elders ar answerable to their Preists Esa.</hi> 66. 21. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 20.</p>
               <p>Here agayn he useth his former fallacie, concluding from part of the Levites, unto the whole. And taking one peece of scripture he neglecteth many other vvhich make against him. For as 1 Chron. 26. 20. shevveth that some Levites had charge of the treasures; so 1 Chron. 23. 27. 28. &amp;c. and 25. 1, 2. &amp;c. and 26. 1, 2. &amp;c. &amp; Num. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; other scriptures many, shevv that othersome vvere assistants to the Preists in the service of the Lords hovvse in al businesses, sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 23 30.</note> every morning and evening to give thanks and to prayse the Lord: and togither vvith the Preists <note n="†" place="margin">Neh. 8. 7. 9.</note> did teach &amp; instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18551:49"/>
according to the blessing which Moses pronounced upon the whole tribe, Deut. 33. 9. 10. So that the Levites were Ministers also of the word &amp; prayer, which is directly differing from the Deacons office in the Church now, as appeareth Act. 6. 2. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As in the old Testament there was the sanhedrim which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted<note place="margin">2 Reason.</note> of 70. ancients for the administration of the kingdom, which was a type of the visible Church, all which elders in their first institution<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 11 25.</note> did prophesie and were of one kind under Moses: so in the new testament under Christ Jesus which is the King of the Church ther is asu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

For in the former, Esaias was cited for Preists and Levites to be figures of our Ministers, and now the Ancients of Israel are alleged for figures also; &amp; because these Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were of one sort, therefore all the Presbyterie figured both by Preists of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, and by Ancients of other tribes, must be all of one sort. The conclusion is vanitie. Rather the reason should be framed thus, as the teaching Preists were of one sort and the governing El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an other; so the teaching Ministers, and the governing el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders differ at this day.</p>
               <p>Or, taking those Elders politik, to be figures of our Elders eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastik, as M. Sm. maketh them, the true proportion is but this, as governing elders then, so governing elders now, are all of one sort; and this is that which we hold.</p>
               <p>Neyther wil his other places Rev. 4. 4. and 5. 6. help him any better. For he seemeth to understand by that vision, the church; and by the 24. elders about the throne, (all which were of one kind) the eldership of the Church: but he should with all have conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that besides those <hi>Elders,</hi> there were 4. other <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 4. 6. 8.</note> winged crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ful of eyes, which incessantly praysed God, and went <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 9. 10</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elders in this action of worship: and these were of the number <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8. 9. 10.</note> of the redeemed by Christ blood, and of the Kings and Preists that reigned on earth; and being as meet to signifie the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18551:49"/>
Teachers of the Church, as the 24. are to signifie the ruling el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; wil rather shew a difference between the teachers and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church; then that they should be of one sort. How beit I rest not in his exposition of those Elders: but that is another point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe (<hi>sayth he</hi>) if Pastor, Teacher, Elder, had been 3. offices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> differing, the Apostle intending to teach the several officers of the church, would have mentioned them, 1 Tim. 3. but there he onely mentioneth Bishops and Deacons, according as Philip. 1. 1. go: Bishops are onely of one sort or kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How M. Sm. understandeth this phrase of <hi>formally differing,</hi> I<note place="margin">Answer.</note> cannot tel; his logik is not like every mans: the speach being well taken, I admit of; and doe deney the consequence of his argument, that <hi>if they differ formally</hi> they should have been mentioned 1 Tim. 3. for it is as if he should have sayd, if <hi>Preists</hi> &amp; <hi>Levites</hi> differ formally, Moses would so have mentioned them, Deut. 33. 8.-10. Nay Moses having mentioned the difference <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 18</note> other where; thought it not needful to set it down here; and so dooth th' Apostle. It is a weak ground to conclude against a thing, because it is not written in such or such a chapter.</p>
               <p>But the Apostle (sayth he) <hi>intendeth to teach the several offices of the Church.</hi> Not so; but rather he intendeth to shew, how officers in generall should be qualified; and setting downe things common to all, it had been needlesse repetition to speak of the Pastor first, and the same things of the teacher, and againe the third time, the same of the Elder: he useth no such tautologies. And Timothee needed not to be taught what offices belonged to the Church, though he mought have need to be put in mind of their qualifications. Yet even in the same Epistle, upon other occasions, he mentioneth <note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> the difference of the office, some being to <hi>rule</hi> wel, some to labour in the word and doctrine. Of which we shall speak anon. And in his other Epistles, the like differences ar playn. Rom. 12. 7. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 4. 5. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover, (<hi>sayth he</hi>) if th' Apostles had ordeyned three kind<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> of ELDRS Actes. 14. 23. they would have mentioned them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18551:50"/>
with their several kinds of ordinations: but that is not doon: for in one phrase their election and ordination is mentioned: go; their ordination being one, their office is one, and not three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A reason much like the former, &amp; of like vanitie; for to say, such<note place="margin">Answer.</note> a thing is not mentioned in such a place, therfore it was not doon; is inconsequent.</p>
               <p>And here the minding of his owne words, mought have stayed him from so concluding: for if Luke writing the action, doth <hi>in one phrase</hi> yea even in one word summ up both the election &amp; the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which yet ar different, and doon with many circumstances: may he not also under the general name <hi>Elders,</hi> imply differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sorts. Agayn where the holy Ghost expresseth not any one kind of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor any one word spoken to the officers, concerning their charge and office layd upon them; which yet no doubt was doon: Who would look for a <hi>severall kind of ordination,</hi> to be mentioned in such a place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further if ther had been 3 kind of Elders at Ephesus, then the Apostle at Miletum would haue given them severall charges as having several du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">5. Reason.</note> lying upon them: hut th' Apostle Act. 20. 28. giveth them one general charge common to them al, namely the dutie of feeding, the work of the Pastor. go, they are all Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These reasons be al of a sute: and the prayer of David seemeth to have prevailed against this man, for <note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 58. 7</note> 
                  <hi>when he shooteth arrowes,</hi> they<note place="margin">Answer.</note> ar <hi>as broken:</hi> or <hi>like unto strawes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, we cannot say what <hi>several charges</hi> Paul gaue those Elders; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his words in particular are hot recorded. For there is no doubt, but he spake many moe words, then are set downe: and it is usuall in the scriptures, to summ up mens speeches.</p>
               <p>Secondly suppose he gave no <hi>several charges, but one general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all,</hi> which was <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Poimainein</hi> to feed and govern the flock: yet wil not this prove that they had all one undistinct office: any more then that Peter had no other then a common Pastours office,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18551:50"/>
because Christ gave him but a general charge common to al Pastors <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 21. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>poimaine, feed</hi> my sheep.</p>
               <p>The Preists and Levites had distinct offices, as before is manifested: yet Hezekiah speaking to them al generally, (as Paul dooth here to the Elders,) gives them not several charges, according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall duties, but useth one common exhortation to them al: which if one would pervert, (as this man dooth Pauls speech,) he mought plead that all the Levits then were properly to burn incense, as that al the Elders now should properly do the Pastors dutie. See 2 Chro. 29. 4. 5.—11.</p>
               <p>The conclusion which he maketh that therefore <hi>al are Pastors,</hi> if he mean it in the strict sense, is deneyed, as inconsequent. If in the large sense, it is from the question, and deceiveth by ambiguitie: for Christ is a <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> Pastor, the Apostles-were <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 21.</note> Pastors, and so are all Bishops &amp; governours generally: yet no man I think doubteth but these do differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides. Eph. 4. 11. Pastors and Teachers are all one office. For wheras<note place="margin">6. Reason.</note> the Apostle had spoken distributively before of Apostles Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists as intending them several offices: he speaketh copulatively of Pastors and Teachers, exegetically teaching that they are both one office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, let it be observed, how himselfe doth say, <hi>Apostles, Prophets</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
                  <hi>Evengelists</hi> were <hi>several offices;</hi> yet can he not deny, but generally they were to <hi>poimaeinein,</hi> that is doe the dutie of Pastors, feeding and governing the Church of Christ: &amp; so his former exception against Act. 20. is found of no weight. Also his reasons from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa. 66. 21. &amp; Numbers 11. 25. for one sort of officers to be figured in the law, are of as little valew; unlesse we should think that the principal officers of the Christian Church, were not figured or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly the exposition which he giveth of Ephes. 4. 11. is against the Apostles purpose, who distinctly and distributively
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18551:51"/>
setteth down the divers gifts and offices of the church: and therfore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be thought to expresse one &amp; the same office by two names. For though he <hi>speak copulatively, pastors and teachers,</hi> yet is ther no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why these should be taken for one, seeing this word <hi>and,</hi> coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth divers things &amp; divers officers; as <hi>Apostles and Prophets,</hi> Eph. 2. 20, and 3, 5. <hi>Apostles and Elders</hi> Act. 15, 2. <hi>Prophets &amp; Teachers,</hi> Act 13, 1. and a thowsand the like. Neither needed he <hi>teach exegetically,</hi> by way of exposition what the pastors office is; seeing it was as wel, if not better known, then the Prophets office or Evangelists: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it an exposition, when the latter is as dark and more then the former; and the first more proper then the second. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of the office, as M. Sm. takes it, is <hi>Pastor:</hi> now to say <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that is teachers,</hi> were to explayn the proper by the unproper, or commune name, which neither Paul nor any wise writer useth to doe.</p>
               <p>But is ignorance or a worse thing that causeth M. Sm. to pervert so plain a place. The Apostle particulating the several offices <hi>some Apostles, some Prophets &amp;c.</hi> doth in the last branch according to the elegancie both of the Hebrue and Greek tongues, omitt the word <hi>some,</hi> putting <hi>and</hi> in the sted, in the very same meaning. An example of the Bebrue may be seen Hos. 3. 4. where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet telleth how Israel should remayn <hi>without King, and without Prince, and without offring, and without statue, and without Ephod, and Teraphim:</hi> meaning <hi>and without Teraphim.</hi> Here in the last place the word <hi>without,</hi> is omitted, and to be understood of the reader, as our English translation dooth expresse; for it were trifling to say as Mr. Smyth, that the two last are one, because <hi>and</hi> coupleth them, or that <hi>exegetically</hi> one expoundeth an other, when as it is but an elegancie in the language: as al that have skil in it can tel.</p>
               <p>The like is in the Greek tongue, and in Pauls own writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gal. 3. 28. There <hi>is neither Jew</hi> (sayth he) <hi>nor Greek; there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond nor free: there is neither male and female:</hi> that is <hi>nor female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where <hi>and</hi> coupleth in the last place, male and female, not as of one kind but divers; and meaneth the same that <hi>nor</hi> did before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:18551:51"/>The very like phrase and elegancie useth he here, Eph. 4. 11. as any that favoureth the language and purpose of the Apostle, may perceive. and this is plainly confirmed by the Syriak, which speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the two last as of the former, saying, <hi>and some Pastors and some Teachers.</hi> It is also manifested by Paul himself elswher distinguishing these two offices, as 1 Cor. 12, 8. <hi>to one is given the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge:</hi> and Rom. 12. 7. 8. <hi>or he that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation.</hi> And if in one place he putteth a difference; we should not think that in another he takes it away. And there is no playn doctrine set down in scripture, but may be corrupted by such violent expositions as Mr. Smyth mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly (<hi>sayth he</hi>) if al the Elders have the pastors gifts, and the works<note place="margin">7. Reason.</note> of the pastor, and the pastors ordination, then they have al the pastors office. But al the Elders have the pastors gifts viz. the word of wisdome or the gift of exhortation, Tit. 1. 9. and therefore the pastors work, as Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2. which is feeding or exhorting: and so the same ordination. Act. 14. 23. Therfore al the Elders have the same office of the Pastor, and so are al of one sort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second part of this reason is deceitful; for though in some<note place="margin">Answer.</note> sort and common mesure al the Elders have the pastors gifts, &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and doe the pastors work; being al <hi>Bishops,</hi> that is, careful lookers to, and feeders of the flock: yet in special manner &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they differ in al. Otherweise, we may also confound other offices: as Apostles and Evangelists, the Evangelists and the Pastors. For Paul an Apostle sayth of Timothee an Evangelist, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the work of the Lord, even as I.</hi> Had these two therfore one office? Agayn, Timothee and Titus Evangelists, and the other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the churches, had the same gifts, namely the word of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>exhort,</hi> 1 Tim. 6, 2. Tit. 2, 15. with Rom. 12, 8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same work, (as these scriptures alleged shew;) and the same ordination by imposition of hands of the Apostle and Eldership 2 Tim. 1. 6. 1 Tim. 4. 14. with Act. 14. 23. Wil M. Sm. hereupon conclude, therfore <hi>al pastors have the same office with the Evangelists?</hi> If he acknovvledge an error in that, so may he doe in this.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18551:52"/>
For it is the special excellencie of the gifts of exhorting, teaching, ruling, which causeth the pastors, teachers, rulers, to be designed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several works and offices. For it were vanitie to suppose, that the teachers mought be without the word of wisdom at all, or Pastors without the word of knowledge, or rulers without both. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie Levites lips were to preserve knovvledge, for the people to seek the lavv at his mouth, as at the preists; Deut. 33. 8. 10. Mal. 2. 7. yet vvas ther difference in the office So in Christs Church vvhere gifts are bestovved in varietie, he that excelleth in the vvord of vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and exhortation more then doctrine, is (being lavvfully caled thereto, a pastor; and he that excelleth in doctrine more then in exhortation, is a teacher: and they that excel other brethren in discretion gravitie &amp;c. though they have not meet gifts for pastors or teachers, are (being caled thereunto) Elders or governours, to assist the other in guiding the vvayes of the church. And needful are they unto the same, for one man may vvel teach an hundred, but tvvo men vvil scarse govern half so many in peace and order: so great a difference there is, betvveen the knovvledge of the truth, and the due vvalking and practise of the same.</p>
               <p>Whereas therfore M. S. gives al the Elders, the <hi>word of wisdome,</hi> and so the pastors office; meaning strictly and properly: he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth the Apostle vvho sayth, <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>there are diversities of gifts; and to one is given the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge;</hi> and agayn speaking of office, he mentioneth <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. 7. 8.</note> distinctly <hi>teaching,</hi> &amp; <hi>exhorting,</hi> &amp; <hi>ruling,</hi> not in one person but in sundry. Although sometime speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eldership in general, he ascribeth the same vvork in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thereto, as in Tit. 1. Act. 20. and other like places. Of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination Act. 14. vve spake before.</p>
               <p>Novv after al these reasons, M. Sm. thus concludeth. <hi>Hence this con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ectorie</hi> (sayth he) <hi>ariseth: that the Eldership consisting of three sorts of Elders, is the invention of man, having both an antichristian ministerie and goverment in it. And therfore when the popish prelacie was supprest, and the triformed presbyterie substituted, one antichrist was put down, and another was set up in his place. &amp;c.</hi> vvith other like contumelies.</p>
               <p>But the falshood and vanitie of his reasons having been manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, al these reproches do turn into his ovvn bosome, and in him is

                     <p>To this end wresteth he these words of Paul <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>The Elders that rule wel, are worthy double honour: specially they that labour in the word &amp; doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi> The <hi>specialtie</hi> sayth M.

                        <hi>teaching.</hi> I deney this violent construction: and affirm the <hi>specially</hi> here added of Paul, to respect a special distinct person in and for his work: as may thus be manifested. The Apostle treateth of <hi>honour,</hi> and unto whom it belongeth. <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 5. 3</note> 
                        <hi>Honour widowes</hi> (sayth he) <hi>which are widowes in deed. Give</hi>

                        <hi>double honour</hi> to the <hi>Elders that rule wel: speciallie</hi> to <hi>them that labour in the word.</hi> As <hi>honour &amp; double honour,</hi> respecteth several persons in their several estates and imployments; so <hi>double honour</hi> and <hi>special double honour,</hi> respecteth several persons in and for their several works and imployments; some <hi>ruling wel,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some <hi>labouring in the word.</hi> Thus the scripture is plain. But M. S. will have the <hi>specialtie</hi> to consist in the <hi>qualitie</hi> of the work, viz, <hi>wel ruling</hi> and <hi>painful teaching,</hi> As if Paul would have double honour given to them that <hi>rule and teach,</hi> but <hi>specially</hi> if they <hi>rule wel &amp; teach painfully.</hi> But thus he neither speaketh nor meaneth. For al <hi>rule</hi> is either <hi>wel</hi> or <hi>yll:</hi> but <hi>ill rule</hi> deserves no honour, therfore it were unmeet to appoint <hi>double honour</hi> in this respect, where <note n="*" place="margin">ver. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>open rebuke</hi> rather is due, and where losse and dammage followeth, because the work must burn. 1 Cor. 3. 14. 15. But take it as the Apostle speaks and intends, <hi>widowes indeed</hi> are to have honour: the <hi>wel ruling Elders</hi> are to have <hi>double honour,</hi> thus it is meet, and the meaning evident. Now the <hi>specialtie</hi> cometh after <hi>wel ruling,</hi> and respecteth an other work, <hi>labouring in the word:</hi> where the former word <hi>wel</hi> is again to be understood. For false teachers laboured in the word, to seduce and deceiv: such were to have no <hi>special double honour,</hi> but their <note n="“" place="margin">

                           <hi>Mat,</hi> 23, 18.</note> compasse sea and land to make one of their profession.</p>
                     <p>Again, the word <hi>labouring</hi> makes not the <hi>specialtie:</hi> as M. Smyth interpreteth it, <hi>painful teaching;</hi> for <hi>labour</hi> is a common dutie lying upon al church officers, whose office is not in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenes. None can rule wel but with labour: none can teach well but with labour: and therefore PAVL useth this word of all the officers, 1 Cor. 16. 16. So the <hi>specialty</hi> here is not for labour simply, but for <hi>labour in the word &amp; doctrine,</hi>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:18551:54"/>
which some Elders did; differing from labour in government, which othersome did, as is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both by this &amp; other scriptures, as 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>thirdly teachers; after that governours:</hi> and Rom. 12. 7. 8. <hi>he that teacheth on teaching: he that ruleth with diligence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus several men were imployed in these several labours or works, and in respect of the persons imployed, is the word <hi>specially</hi> added, and purposly put between rulers &amp; teachers, as if the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle should say, they that labour in ruling are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, specially they that labour in teaching. And that this is Pauls mind his plain words shew, when he sayth, <hi>they that rule, and they that labour:</hi> where this word, <hi>they,</hi> leadeth to diverse persons; as in other scriptures, <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. s. 29. </note> they that have doon good, and they that have doon evil; <note n="“">1 Cor. 7. 30.</note> they that weep and they that rejoyce; and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble such speeches. Agayn the word <hi>specially</hi> being put between <hi>them that rule,</hi> and <hi>them that labour,</hi> confirmeth this yet more: for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the distinction: as when Paul in the same Epistle sayth, God is <note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 10.</note> the saviour of al men, <hi>specially of the faithful:</hi> the word <hi>specially</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth <hi>the faythful</hi> from other common men of the world, who have not fayth in God, and yet are saved or preserved by him, that is the preserver of al his creatures, and saveth <note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 36. 6.</note> man and beast. So to Titus he sayth, <note n="“" place="margin">

And if here we take it not so for several persons (where <hi>wel ruling</hi> is first set down, and <hi>specially</hi> comes after, for such as <hi>labour in the word and doctrine:</hi>) we overthrow the force and grace of Pauls gradation, or stepping to his specialty. And if he had meant as M.

                     <p>That al Bishops must be <hi>didacticoi,</hi> that is, apt and ready for to teach, reprove &amp;c. I grant: yet that they must therfore hav al one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Ideney. For Apost. prophets, Evangelists, &amp;c. were al <hi>didacticoi,</hi> yet differed in office. But how then <hi>shal some of the Elders be rulers one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> I answer, even Ruling Elders are to be <hi>didacticoi,</hi> and yet have the office of ruling onely. For every one set over others to teach or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them in faith or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, must have aptnes to teach the things perteyning to their office, and convince the contrarie: or els they are unfit for the place.</p>
                     <p>But have they not then the teachers office? No, for this aptnes to teach is common to al offices of government, but in several sorts, according to every mans function. For example, an Apostle must be apt to teach as an Apostle: and though a man have aptnes to teach as a pastor, yet hath he not therefore aptnes as an Apostle. For the office is greater, and requireth greater gifts. So a ruling Elder must be apt to teach as a ruler: yet hath he not therfore aptnes to teach as a pastor, in whom greater skil is required.</p>
                     <p>Let us see this in Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aptnes to teach was to be in al the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: in the whole tribe of Levi generally, Deut. 33. 10. in the preists of Levi more specially, Mal. 2. 7. Deut. 24. 8. in the judges of Israel also according to their office, Deut. 1, 13, 16. with Exod. 18. 15, 16, 21, 22. For this cause God gave the 70. Elders, the spirit of prophesie, Num. 11. 17. 25. And in the reformation by K. Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, we find not onely preists and Levites, but other Princes of the king, sent for to teach the people, 2 Chr. 17, 7, 8. 9. These al were <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacticoi,</hi> apt to teach, but in several respects, and measures, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral offices.</p>
                     <p>Otherweise if one wil understand aptnes to teach, strictly as in the pastors office: then are Pauls words to be taken figuratively <note n="†" place="margin">Synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</note> the whol for a part, or general for a particular: as a Bishop, that is a

                     <p>With like grace striveth he against the word <hi>Diaconia, Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> (which the Apostle useth, 1 Cor. 12. 5.) saying <hi>that it signifyeth sometime any spirituall work</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>so it may signifie here.</hi> But if such shifting &amp; winding may be admitted, we shal have no truth so plain, but may be oppugned: yea Iudaisme and Atheisme may be maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

For we allege against Iewes to prove the death of Christ how the Angel prophesied <hi>Messiah shalbe slayn</hi> Dan. 9. 26. I, sayth the Iew, but <hi>Messiah</hi> somtime signifieth any one that is anoynted; Preist or King; &amp; so may it here be meant of any anointed governor, &amp; not of him that is properly the Messiah.

For to trouble and intangle the simple reader, al shifts are sought out, least truth should prevaile. First the objection was of M. Smyths own contriveing, as he liked best to answer: otherweise he could not (I suppose) be ignorant, that most learned men of these times, (so far as I have seen) though they detest his error, do grant his conclusion. But he concludes not the question, namely that 1. Teaching, 2. Exhorting, 3. distributing, 4. ruling, 5. shewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are al to be performed in the church by one person: or that Paul intends any such thing here. I have before shewed the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>But I wil labour to break his snare, that the simple fal not therin. <hi>diaconia</hi> he rightly interpreteth <hi>Office,</hi> and sayth, <hi>there are diverse kinds thereof:</hi> citing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5. Let this be compared
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18551:58"/>
compared with his answer before to the second objection: where he pleaded that <hi>diaconia</hi> in 1 Cor. 12. 5. mought signifie <hi>a work.</hi> There he set himself to cavil against the truth, here unawares he granteth it. Wel, seing <hi>diaconia</hi> here is an <hi>office;</hi> and there be offices divers: let us proceed. <hi>Teaching</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is one work of the prophets or Officers; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting is an other work of them.</hi> Of <hi>them,</hi> I grant; for they are divers: but is it of <hi>him,</hi> that is of one and the same officer? is ther any word or title that intimateth this? none at al, but the contrarie: for as the Apostle mentioneth divers works, <hi>teaching exhorting &amp;c.</hi> so mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he divers persons, <hi>the teacher, the exhorter, the distributer, the ruler.</hi> Neyther doth he say, let him that teacheth, teach, &amp; exhort, &amp; distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and rule, as if one man should do al: but, let him that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth teach, let him that exhorteth exhort. As if he should speak of the members of the body (which similitude he used) let that which seeth, see circumspectiv: let that which heareth, hear attentively; let that which speaketh, speak warily &amp;c. Would any reasonable man think, that one member must doe al these actions, that the eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seeth, it also must hear, and speak: and not understand this of the three several members, the eye, ear, and tongue? Even so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable is the collection, that Paul should mean one person to do those several actions.</p>
                     <p>But M. S. striving about the <hi>particle eite,</hi> which signifieth <hi>whither</hi> &amp; <hi>or,</hi> &amp; applying it to the 4. <hi>particulars;</hi> maketh the two last to be <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> &amp; <hi>exhorting:</hi> wherein he useth deceit for advantage. For he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the action for the actor that doth it. The Apostle sayth, <hi>or he that teacheth, or he that exhorteth,</hi> so noting two persons: M. Sm. sayth <hi>or teaching, or exhorting,</hi> so noting two actions. Thus he intending to have many actions doon by one person, wresteth the scripture, and maketh it speak after his own fansie.</p>
                     <p>This being observed, his pleading about <hi>Eite</hi> wil be little worth, for the Apostle by it, dis joyneth things thus. <note n="*" place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 12. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Gifts</hi> ye have <hi>divers,</hi> which gifts ye use and manifest, either by prophesie (which <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1. 31,</note> any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person in the church may doe, even as al other like gifts, of <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 26.</note> tongues, interpretations, Psalmes and the like:) <hi>or</hi> by <hi>ministerie</hi> that is by office and charge layd upon you, which as it <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 5.</note> is divers, so every one must <note n="“" place="margin">

                     <p>This first division being perfect: that which followeth is an under division, or an other division, not of the gifts, but of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have the gifts: which are five, 1.

Now al these persons are to be referred, eyther to the former 1. <hi>prophesie,</hi> or 2. <hi>ministerie,</hi> that is office: or both. But seing no scripture, that I know of, speaketh of <hi>distribution,</hi> or <hi>Ruling,</hi> or <hi>Shewing mercie,</hi> under the name of <hi>prophesie:</hi> therefore I refer them to the latter word <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Ministerie,</hi> to which they al agree. <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>exhorting</hi> I grant are doon in <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 3</note> prophesie, by private brethren: but that they are more specially doon in <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> ministerie by publik officers, none I think wil deney. And that here Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs them to ministerie, seemeth to me most evident: for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie</hi> was limited by him, <note n="“" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> 12. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>according to the proportion of fayth:</hi> so that if any brother in prophesying, kept unto the proportion of fayth he did yenough: but an officer must not onely do this, but must also attend vnto the continual doing of it, <note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2</note> in season, out of season, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20. 20.</note> privatly, publikly, and therfore must <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15, 16.</note> give himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; whereas a private brother followeth other vocation, and speaketh but <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 30.</note> when he seeth occasion. For this cause, Paul sayth here, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. 7</note> an office should be in the office, or ministerie in the ministration: meaning that it should be waited upon, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in sobrietie. And then comming to the <hi>Teacher</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horter,</hi> he useth like speech, in <hi>doctrine</hi> &amp; in <hi>exhortation,</hi> meaning that they should give themselves to these works, and execute them with modestie. So the officers, rather then the private brethren (upon whom no such burden is layd) seem here to be intended by <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> &amp; <hi>exhorter,</hi> and so consequently diverse officers, as there be divers actions for them to perform, and have diverse gifts of God for the same end.</p>

                     <p>First it can never be proved by scriptures, that there was but one Pastor in a Church, it is playn, Act. 20. 28. that ther were many in the Church of Ephesus, (that was one of those 7. Churches) that did perform the work of the Pastor, which is poimainein to feed; even all the elders vers. 17. with verf. 28. And therefore ther were many Pastors in that Church in Pauls time. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, al churches had officers of one sort, &amp; one kind of Presbyterie; &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This is the last objection which M. Sm. maketh and answereth. Other reasons many there are, more pregnant: this alone without conference with other scriptures, I know will not prove many sorts of officers But it may serve to confirm the point thus: seing in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus the were <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20. 17.</note> many Elders; &amp; Christ here directeth his Epistle to the <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 2. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Messenger</hi> of that Church; this seemeth to be one that had the principal charge of the whol, that is the <hi>Pastor. But it can not be proved</hi> (sayth M. S.) <hi>that there was but one Pastor in a church.</hi> Neyther can it be proved (say I) that there were many.

                        <hi>poimainein</hi> to <hi>feed,</hi> or doe the Pastors work <hi>therfore there were many Pastors.</hi> I answer, it followeth not; for the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceiveth by aequivocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or double meaning of the word. Pastor, generally taken is any governour; paricularly and strictly (wherof now we speak) it is the <note n="“" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note> Exhorter, or he that hath <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>the word of wisdome.</hi> In the general meaning Christ is <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 10.</note> the Pastor, the Apostles <note n="“" place="margin">

                     <p>The Apostle sheweth the contrarie, Ephes. 4. 11. As then an Apostle and a Pastor be diverse officers, though both doe <hi>poimainein, feed:</hi> so <hi>Pastors, Teachers, Rulers,</hi> may be different officers, though all do <hi>poimainein,</hi> that is <hi>feed</hi> &amp; <hi>rule</hi> the flock.</p>
                     <p>The Pastors in Israel, in the scriptures which he before alleged, Ier. 23. 1. Ezek. 34. 2, had they al one particular office? Farr other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.

                     <p>It is not <hi>playn,</hi> but very obscure and figurative, if an <hi>Angel</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies at any time, <hi>a company of men;</hi> the scriptures alleged shew it not.

To take the <hi>Angel</hi> for <hi>a company of the most syncere and holy men;</hi> is further from the mark: seing some are written to, in whom little zele or sinceritie can be gathered, Rev. 3. 1. 15. and to passe by the officers, and direct the Letters to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons, and such especially; is not according to order; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Christ to the Church, 1 Cor. 14. 40.</p>

                     <p>Any thing hath more <hi>likelihood</hi> with Mr. Sm. then that which is most likely to be true. Can this have <hi>all</hi> likelihood, that the

                        <hi>Evangelists</hi> or <hi>Prophets extraordinarie,</hi> on whose <note n="*" place="margin">Ephe. 2. 20.</note> foundation Christs Church is builded, should come to that corrupt estate, which some of these Angels were come into? Rev. 3. 1. 15. Hath it <hi>al likelihood</hi> that such as were officers of all the Churches in generall, should be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Angels of particular Churches? But it seemeth M.

For the Angels are the <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 1. 20</note> starrs in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and of these starrs or Angels, many are <note n="“" place="margin">

So that the <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>starrs</hi> in the book of Revelation, usually signify the ministers of the Churches, whither good or evil. Who rather in likelihood haue the title of angels or messengers given unto them, both from the like title given by God himself to the Preists of Israel, Mal. 2. 7. and by the Iewes common phrase, who called him that was cheif ruler in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, <hi>Sheliach tsibbur,</hi> that is the Legate or Messenger of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; which name <hi>Sheliach</hi> the Rabbines <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18551:62"/>
Rather the ground layd by the Apostle sheweth the contrarie: <hi>if the Gentiles</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be made partakers of their spiritual thinges, their duetie is also to minister unto them in carnal things. Rom.</hi> 15. 27. Vnbeleevers are admitted to the ministerie of the word in Christian assemblies, &amp; so made partakers of our spiritual things; if then &amp; there they wil give of their carnal things, upon what ground may we refuse them?</p>
               <p>It is alleged, how 2 Cor. 8. 7. the communion of almose is called a <hi>grace,</hi> and in Heb. 13. 16. a <hi>sacrifice.</hi> I acknowledge it thus to be in the saincts, whither they give it in publik or private. For when he sayth, <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>to do good and to communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God is wel pleased;</hi> he meaneth it not onely of publik contribution in the church, but of private distribution to any at any time. Paul brought almose and offrings to his nation Act. 24. 17. and himself received such a sacrifice from the Philippians, Philip. 4. 18. And if any one Christian in private had sent him the like, had it not been a sacrifice also? Wherfore the Almose of the Saincts are sacrifices, though one give to another <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 6. 4.</note> in secret: yea if a Christian releev <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal</hi> 6. 10</note> an unbeleever in povertie and distresse, it is a sacrifice and sweet odour to God. If therfore upon this ground we may not receiv it of unbeleevers in the publik Church, because it is in the saincts a communion of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>sacrifice:</hi> how may we receiv it of such in private?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (sayth M. Sm.) <hi>they that are without if they give any thing, must lay it apart, several from the treasurie, &amp; it must be imployed to common use. Mat.</hi> 27. 6. 7. This position I wil not absolutely condemn: neyther can I yet grant it, for the proof is insufficient. For wheras the Iewes (Mat. 27) would not put Iudas wages into their treasurie, it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was one <hi>without;</hi> for Iudas was a Iew, no stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger unto them: but because it was <hi>the price of blood,</hi> therfore they mought not put it into the treasurie. This teacheth us, that goods gotten by violence, extorsion, murder, theft or other like evil way: may not be put into the treasurie, though the members of the Church do offer them. But this is no more for those <hi>without,</hi> then for those <hi>within.</hi> And for <hi>common use</hi> of al unbeleevers gifts; I suppose this example wil not bear it out. For if in the povertie and distresse of Christs church, they which are not of the same, minister releif thereunto, (which if they doe not, it shalbe one reason of their <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>I am bould to pronounce</hi> &amp;c. <hi>our true constitution to be the most honorable and bewtiful ornament of our Church; more glorious then our true Ministerie, worship, and goverment.</hi> Contrary to this, a few dayes after, he setts out <hi>The character of the Beast,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (having dissolved &amp; forsaking his former <hi>true and glorious constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>) he exclaimeth against us, (as before <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 3.</note> I haue shewed,) as having a <hi>false Church falsly constituted,</hi> and <hi>therfore no one ordinance of the Lord true among us.</hi> Thus <note n="†" place="margin">

Onely because his answer to <hi>Mr. Bern.</hi> seemeth to be written in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our cause, and so may be taken of posteritie: I would have the reader take notice, that the silver there is mixt with drosse and the wine, with the <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 32. 33.</note> gal of aspes.

               <hi>to the constitution of the typical Church,</hi> (meaning the church of Israel) <hi>there was not required true holynes but ceremonial cleannes.</hi> This is a false
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18551:63"/>
and blasphemous assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, injurious to Gods holy majestie, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to constitutea Church of hypocrites: &amp; it is evidently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the covenants made between God and them; Gen. 17. Exod. 19. 5. 6. 8. Exod. 20. and 21. &amp;c. and 24. 3. 4. 7. 8. Levit. 19. 2. with 1. pet. 1. 15 16. Deut. 5. 1. 2. 3. and 26. 17. 18. 19. and 29. 10. 11. 12. 13. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So when he sayth, the Israelites <note n="*" place="margin">Parall. p. 30.</note> 
               <hi>did worship to repentance, we doo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from repentance: therfore they might and did worship, therby to reconcile themselves to God, we being reconciled to God and accepted in Christ, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to offer to the Lord the calves of our lips, the best grace we have with us, first men declare their repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then we receive them into our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to worship with us: with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> first men were received into typical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then they were trayned up to repentance and faith in Christ &amp;c.</hi> These &amp; the like distinctions Mr. Sm. hath fetched out of his own hart, not from the word of God: for although ther be differences many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us, as touching outward rites and services, ended &amp; abolished by Christ, (as the Epistle to the Ebrues sheweth;) yet as touching the substance of their religion, worship, constitution &amp;c. as touching repentance, faith, reconciliation to God &amp;c. ther was no such differences as Mr. Sm. feighneth. They had the law to shew them their fyn, and to bring them to Christ: so have we. Mat. 5. 17. Rom. 3 30. 31 and 7. 7.—12. 21. &amp;c. Iam. 2. 8. 9. 10. 11. We have the gospel, to shew us our righteousnes by Christ, without works of the law: so had they, Heb. 4. 2. Levit. 26 42—45. with Luk. 1. 54. 55<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 72. 73.

Onely in the manner of administration the Law &amp; gospel, ther be differences manifested.</p>
            <p>Also when he <note n="*" place="margin">Parall. p 30.</note> sayth, that the Iewes <hi>moral uncleannes did not pollute their ceremonial communion;</hi> that <hi>their real wickednes did not pollute their ceremonial or typical CHURCH, worship and communion;</hi> but <hi>lawfully they might have typical communion in typical worship, that were typically clean, though they were wicked in deed:</hi> these assertions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest M. S. to be not onely a <hi>typical</hi> but a <hi>real</hi> seducer and deceiver of minds <hi>in deed;</hi> who would make us beleeve that if a man in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el had but touched his own wife lying <note n="†" place="margin">Levit. 12. 2. 5. &amp; 15. 19. &amp;c.</note> in her child-bed, or put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apart for her disease; if he came to worship in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:18551:64"/>
the Church and communion of the Saincts: but though he had committed adulterie with his neighours wife, and came into the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in his syn to worship, without repentance; yet he polluted not the Church, but <hi>lawfully mought have communion</hi> in the word, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, sacrifices &amp;c. which unclean doctrine is evidently condemned, by these and many other like scriptures. Levit. 4. 2. 3. 13. 14. 22. 23. 27. 28. 35. Levit. 6. 2—7. Num. 15. 22. 23. 24. 27. 29. 30. 31. Levit. 19. 17. Levit. 18. 29. 30. Iosh. 22. 16. 17. 18. 20.</p>
            <p>But upon these and like rotten grounds, M. S. hath now sought to build his towr of Anabaptisme, which the breath of the Lord, wil throw down upon his head.</p>
            <p>Although therfore the cause which M. S. then had in hand was good, and many good things are in that book; yet the <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 10. 1.</note> dead flyes have caused to stink, and putrified the ointment of the apothecarie: as in these so in other points, which the wise must observe. Leaving therefore those things, I come to the matter which he maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and in his foresayd book of <hi>Parallels,</hi> pag. 67. hath thus inveighed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Mr Ains. steppeth up with a new kind of Antichristianisme, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before: and he teacheth us, if we wil beleeve him, that Christs ruling power is in the Eldership; and that the Pope and Prelates, ar</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">I sayd; <hi>ar antichrists, not for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists, for taking into their hands the power of the multitude, but the power of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here first Mr S. maketh his owne collection, to be my assertion. I sayd not, neyther would say thus absolutely, <hi>Christs ruling power is in the Eldership,</hi> my words are these (Counterp. pa. 176) <hi>We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christ to have ordeyned a</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note>

               <hi>teach and rule them by his owne word and lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I wrote, I plainely confirmed by scriptures in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, which the reader may serch and judge of: neyther hath this adversarie taken them away; or sayd ought against them; or yet set them downe in his book (where he <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 68.</note> printed my words) for his reader to take notice of.</p>
            <p>That which I have written, is further confirmed, for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, by Mr Sm. himself, in the very same book of <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels,</hi> the last page but one, where he hath set down this argument.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18551:64"/>
               <hi>The goverment of the primitive Apostolik institution, was by a college of Pastors, or presbyterie. The goverment of the English assemblies, is by an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. S. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> 
               <hi>Prelate and his officers. Therfore, The goverment of the English assemblies is not the primitivs Apostolik goverment. The maior is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agayn, in this very passage, where he treateth of popular gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is driven into such straits, as force him to say: <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 55.</note> 
               <hi>We dispute not whither the Elders must rule or not: but we dispute who hav the negative voice, &amp;c.</hi> and a little after: <hi>yet we say the Elders are to lead and govern al persons and causes of the Church.</hi> Who now wil not wonder, at this mans malice, to charge me with Antichristianisme for my writing: and himself in the same book, to write as he hath doon.</p>
            <p>And were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in deed <hi>Antichristianisme,</hi> as he sayth, which I have <hi>stepped up with:</hi> yet he overlasheth with his tongue, in calling it <hi>a new kind,</hi> &amp; <hi>neverheard of before;</hi> considering what he had heard before of M. Bernard, (if not of others) as the opinion of those that he caleth <hi>Puritans.</hi> But let us turn the edge of his own argument against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, thus: <hi>The goverment of the primitive Apostolik institution, was by a college of of pastors or presbyterie.</hi> (This M. S. himself defendeth,) <hi>But po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular goverment by the multitude, is not the goverment by a college of Pastors or presbyterie. Therfore, popular goverment by the multitude</hi> (which yet M. Sm. would also plead for,) <hi>is not the goverment of the primitive Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agayn his argument helpeth me thus, <hi>The goverment of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive apostolik institution is not Antichristianisme. The goverment which J plead for, in answer to M. Bern. is the goverment of the primitive Apostolik institution;</hi> (for it is the goverment by the Presbyterie,) <hi>Therfore the goverment which I plead for is not Antichristianisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus mought M. Sm. have been better advised what he censured in me: if he had duly weighed, what he wrote himself.</p>
            <p>In his confutation of my writing, he first would <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 67.</note> have it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, <hi>that the power of Christ which they speak of, is a ministeriall delegated power, given to man &amp;c.</hi> I answer, that I had to deal with M. Bernards book, and knew nothing at all, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which had passed between M. S. and him: but finding him to have set down things so badly, as that he mought make his reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18551:65"/>
there was no other difference, between Papist, protestant, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, and Brownist, (as he caleth them,) concerning church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment; then onely who should administer the same: whither the Pope, or a Prelate, or the presbyterie, or the multitude: I thought it needful in my answer, to shew the reader a furder difference, even in the power and jurisdiction it self, which whosoever do administer, they make themselves Antichrists: seeing the Pope &amp; al Papal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, challenge such ruling power, as incrocheth upon Christs own right: besides their usurping of the power of the church.</p>
            <p>And where I say that the Pope <hi>is Antichrist, not for taking into his hands the power of the multitude, but of Christ, to rule and govern the church as head of the same:</hi> my meaning was not altogither to free the Pope of Antichristianitie, for taking the power of the multitude, which I acknowledge to be a heighnous syn in him: but for to shew by way of comparison, that the other syn is much greater, to usurp the power of Christ. And thus I write, not onely from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equitie of the law, which <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37—39. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25</note> maketh a syn against God, to be much more then a syn against man: but also from the like speeches in the scriptures. For when Ieremie sayd in the Lords name to Israel, <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 7. 22.</note> 
               <hi>J spake not to your fathers, nor commanded them when J brought them out of the land of Aegypt, concerning burnt-offrings and sacrifices: but this thing I commanded them, obey my voyce &amp;c</hi> &amp; when Paul <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17</note> sayd <hi>Christ sent me not to baptise but to preach, &amp;c.</hi> neyther of them denyed simply, the things which God had plainly <note n="†" place="margin">Num. 15. Lev. 1. &amp;c.</note> spoken, &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 16</note> Paul practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but onely by way of comparison: even so doe I. And yet if I should stand upon fit and proper termes, I would not cal the Pope <hi>Antichrist,</hi> for doing that which the people in Christian libertie should do: but for doing that which Christ onely is to do, who is L. and head of the church. Even as the Apostle Iohn maketh such to be <hi>Antichrists</hi> in his dayes, as denyed Iesus <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 22. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.</note> to be the Christ, or come in the flesh: so al that in these dayes, deney or oppugn Christ, are properly Antichrists: and they that bereave the brethren of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, are tyrans &amp; oppressors of the church. But as things ar some time taken largely, he that synneth against his neighbour, may be sayd to syn against <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 39. 9</note> God &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 12</note> Christ. Anabaptists, Arrians, and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretiks, ar Antichrists: &amp; so I acknowledge the Pope for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the church of her power, may be called Antichrist.</p>
            <p>But M. Sm. to help the Pope, if therby he may think to hurt me, pleadeth <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 68.</note> that the Pope <hi>doth not assume that power which Christ as king</hi>

               <hi>hath in his own hands reserved to himself.</hi> This is catholikly spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him and very favourably on the Popes part: but how truly, let the sequel shew. The The pope assumeth this power, to be Rector of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal church; director of the Lords universal flock: (<hi>P. Bonifac. 8. Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. decretal. cap. vbi.</hi>) To be Cephas, that is (by his interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>Caput,</hi> the head of the Apostolik church.

               <hi>The pope is not Antichrist, for that he usurpeth that regal power which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Christ: but is antichristian for usurping the delegated power. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:18551:66"/>As for his freindly qualifications, <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 68.</note> that <hi>the Pope claimeth to be a ministerial head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>vnder Christ, &amp; in that he dooth many actions proper to Christ himself, it is but the misinterpretation of his ministerial headship, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how far it extendeth, &amp;c.</hi> these are but colours to hide the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of that skarlet whore, who surmounting in arrogancie all the children of pride, yet wil needs be called servant of the servants of God. But I sett downe, not what the Pope and papal Prelates say they be; (for the Divil wil say he is an Angel of light,) nor what they plainly professe to doe: but what they be &amp; do in deed; though yet they professe so much, as any forehead might blush to say, the Pope claims not the power proper to Christ alone.</p>
            <p>And what if I would presse Mr Smythes words as much for the Pope on the other hand, namely that <hi>he claimeth to be ministerial Bishop under Christ, &amp; in that he dooth many actions propre to the Church, it is but the misinterpretation of his ministerial office, not understanding how farr it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,</hi> &amp;c. and hereupon conclude, <hi>that properly the Pope is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ for challenging the Churches ruling power propre to it self;</hi> would not this plea be as good as Mr Smythes? And thus the Pope mought be freed from being Antichrist <hi>properly</hi> at all; or els Mr. S. pleading is but litle worth.</p>
            <p>Agayn, for Papal Bishops among the Protestants, however they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not such speeches of their power, (being curbed through fear of the civil magistrate:) yet their Lordly jurisdiction, which they challenge and usurp over many parishes and provinces, togither with the names of blasphemie upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their foreheads as <hi>Lords-spiritual, Archbishops</hi> &amp;c. do prove them toincroch upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christs kingly power, and usurp the same; though neyther they, nor the Pope, nor Belial himself, wil say so much.</p>
            <p>Next for the goverment by Elders which I proved by scriptures; Mr Smyth, neyther answering, nor once mentioning the scriptures quoted, seeketh to blind his reader with a <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 69.</note> 
               <hi>Wee say,</hi> and a general disclayming of myne error, (as he calleth it,) without conviction. And let the reader observe his manner of disputing against me. At the first, he sayd to me, <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 67.</note> 
               <hi>This of you deney M. Ains. (which I think you doe not) I say you are therein departed from the faith.</hi> Behold how his own hart checked him, when he began his invective against me; it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18551:66"/>
told him, that I denyed not the truth. But he proceeds; and after he had shewed his own faith, he comes vpon me with an other <hi>Jf,</hi> and conceles his owne thought, saying, <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 68.</note> 
               <hi>If you hold any other faith, it is not the faith of Christ.</hi> After drawing to an end, he concludeth a gainst me thus <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 69.</note> 
               <hi>I doe therfore vtterly disclaim this your error Mr. Ains. as one part of Antichristianisme in your Church.</hi> First let us see what mine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is, and then how it is convinced. Is it mine error to hold that Christ hath ordeyned <hi>a Presbyterie in everie Church?</hi> why the scriptures which I cited proue it to be truth; and mine adversary hath nothing to say against it, but yeeldeth it himselfe in the last leaf of his book as before I shewed. Or is it mine error to hold, that this Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is to teach and rule the Church by Christs owne words &amp; lawes? This seemeth in deed to be the scandal, which Mr. Sm. stumbleth at, &amp; would thus spurn away. <hi>The power ministerial of the Elders</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is rather a leading power, then a ruling power: neyther ar the Elders in al the new Testament (to my knowledg) caled rulers Archontes, but overseers leaders, elders, prohistamenoi: wherby the holy ghost would teach, that their power is not to rule but to lead and direct. I doe therfore vtterly disclaim this your error &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer that Mr. Sm. dooth sophisticate &amp; dally with the word <hi>Rule,</hi> whiles he maketh it to answer onely to the greek word <hi>Archein;</hi> which signifieth to rule and reign as Princes; Mark. 10. 42. Rom. 15 12. wheras he knoweth or may know that other vvords also are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly translated Rule; as <hi>poimainein,</hi> Rev. 2. 7. and <hi>proistasthai,</hi> Rom. 12 8. and he savv before his eyes, hovv I alleged for teaching and rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1. Tim. 5. 17. vvhere this later vvord is used. Which he not knovving, as it seemeth, hovv to translate better, and yet not vvilling to brook the vvord <hi>Rule,</hi> sayth they are not caled <hi>Rulers archontes, but prohistamenoi.</hi> He might as vvel have sayd, neyther ar they caled <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers</hi> but <hi>Episcopoi,</hi> nor <hi>Leaders,</hi> but <hi>hegoumenoi,</hi> nor <hi>Elders</hi> but <hi>Presbyteroi;</hi> and so have bleared the simple readers eyes, vvith al Greek vvords, to spoil Christs Ministers of their authoritie, and to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they stand but for ciphers. If he be so ignorant of the Greek tongue as he pretendeth, that he vvil neither allovv <hi>Prohistamenoi</hi> to be translated <hi>Rulers,</hi> (vvhich so many Greek authors vvil allovv,) nor give us an other English vvord for it, I vvil leav him to his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18551:67"/>
ignorance or frowardnes rather, and referr the reader to 1 Tim. 3. 4. 5. 12. where this same Greek word is applied to the ruling or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of a howse, and of children, which the Apostle after in 1. Tim. 5. 17. and other places, applieth to the ruling of the Church by Elders. So that Mr Sm. may as well teach househoulders, they must not rule their howses or children: as that Elders must not rule the Church, because they be not called <hi>Archontes</hi> princely-rulers, but <hi>prohistamenoi,</hi> rulers standing before or over them.</p>
            <p>Again if this reason of Mr S. be good it hath broke the neck of his popular government; for it is this; If Elders be not called <hi>Archon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> (Princes or Princely-rulers;) then are they not to rule the Church of God. But Elders are not called <hi>Archontes.</hi> Therefore &amp;c. Which I return upon himself thus, If the multitude of brethren be not called <hi>Archontes;</hi> then are they not to rule the Church of God: but the multitude of brethren are not called <hi>Archontes;</hi> if they be, let M. S. shew where. yea I might add, that they are not called <hi>Overseers,</hi> nor <hi>Leaders,</hi> nor <hi>Elders,</hi> nor <hi>prohistamenoi;</hi> Therfore neyther are they to rule the Church; and so it is to be without rule or government of man at all; which if M. Sm. doe hold, it wil be found that himself deneyes the faith. For however it be true, that onely Christ himself (who is the <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Archon</hi> or Prince of the kings of the earth,) is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Archon</hi> or princely-ruler of the Church, and imperiall power perteyns to him alone: yet he hath given ministerial power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his servants, <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> 
               <hi>poimainein</hi> &amp; <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 22.</note> 
               <hi>proistasthai,</hi> to feed, rule, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, go before and direct his Church: and who so refuseth them whom he hath sent and set, <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 20.</note> refuseth him.</p>
            <p>Wheras I further added of the Elders set to teach and rule, that vnto them <hi>all the multitude, the members, the saincts, ought to obey and submit themselves, as the scriptures teach; Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. this<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 16</note> wholsom doctrine Mr. Sm. before misliked and kicked against, in answering Mr. Bern. &amp; seeks to turne it away, with this peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie and perverse answer <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>Parall. p.</hi> 65.</note> 
               <hi>To the place Heb.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>J say the Apostle doth not intend to teach that the whol body of the Church must yeeld to the voice of the Elders, in every thing that they lyst.</hi> O notable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil! who sayth they must yeeld to <hi>every thing the Elders lyst?</hi> Is this a fit answer to casshier the government of the Elders? Then away
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18551:67"/>
also with his popular goverment: for I say, no scripture intendeth to teach that eyther minister or member, must yeeld to the voice of the multitude, in every thing they lyst. If so; then Aaron had been blamelesse for making the golden calf; because it was the peoples lyst, and they importuned him thereto Exod. 32. 1. 22. 23.</p>
            <p>But M. S. proceedeth, saying; <hi>nor that the Eldership hath in their hands the power of Christ to rule contrarie to their liking.</hi> I answer, the Elders are to teach and rule the Church by Christs own word and lawes, as I have <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>Counter. p,</hi> 176.</note> expressed. And herein I presuppose that both the Elders wil teach and rule according unto godlynes, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wil obey the godly doctrines &amp; directions of their Elders, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mislike or discontentment. For Christs sheep wil hear his voice; his kingdom is peaceable; his subjects loyal and obedient. Now whiles I speak of the ordinary power that the Elders have to teach and rule the Church, as Christ hath constituted it in peace; it is but from a contentious humour, to obiect, that they have not power to rule contrary to the peoples liking, as if there could be no rule, but when the Elders and brethren are at warr one with another. Of the Church it is written, <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 4. 32.</note> 
               <hi>the multitude of them that beleeved were of one hart and of one sowl;</hi> yet none (I think) doubteth, but ther was rule &amp; goverment amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them. And of such quiet rule spake I, though M. Sm. would disturb it with his exception; which he mought also have alledged against the Presbyteries authoritie to pray preach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the sacraments; seing these ar no more to be done contrary to the peoples liking, then rule and goverment: for God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in peace. So for ought that is yet sayd; the government by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders standeth fast.</p>
            <p>The last battry foloweth. <hi>But</hi> (sayth M. S.) <hi>the intent of the Apostle is to show, that all the particular members in all their affaires, must submit themselves to the instruction and guidance of the Elders. For although Christ hath placed the Elders as stewards over the servants yet he hath not appointed them as Lords over his spowse &amp; wife. Your argument therfore</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is a fallacian a coniunctione &amp; divisione thus; Al the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers must obey the elders in their lawful instructions and their wholsome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions severally;</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:18551:68"/>
               <hi>Ergo the whole body must ioyntly obey the voyce of the Elders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here M. Sm. running himself into a fallacie, by dividing those that are joyned togither of the Lord, would bear himself out in his evil, by blaming an other first, but without al equitie, as the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader may easily perceiv. For his reason is to this effect, <hi>Jf El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be stewards over the servants, and not Lords over the wife</hi> (<hi>the church</hi>)<hi>: then is not the church to obey or submit unto them.</hi> Where learned the man this logik? Is there no obedience or submission, thinks he, but unto Lords? Then is there no obedience ecclesiastical, which the church may yeeld to any save unto Christ, for he is the <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. 10.</note> onely Lord. But this man is blinded with his erroneous conceipt. For as in civil goverment we are to obey and submit, not onely to the King as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the superior, but <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13. 14.</note> also to the governours that are sent of him: so in goverment ecclesiastical we are to obey and submit, not onely to the King Christ, but to <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5 <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17</note> the Elders his ministers sent of him: to the one we submit as to the Lord and King: to the other as to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ministers, set over us by the Lord. Agayn, I would fayn know, whither Mr. Sm. thinketh the Elders to be Lords over the particular members? If he say, yea, I abhor his pride, for it is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to Christ the sole Lord of al &amp; every one in the church: if nay, then I detest his sophistrie; for by the same reason that he disswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whol flock from obedience, he mought also disswade each particular member: which yet he dooth not, but yeeldeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Now that the Apostle intendeth not onely the particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but the general flock also, is apparant; First, by his reason which he annexeth, <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>for they watch for your soules as they that must give accounts.</hi> Al good Elders, I ween, do watch as well for the publik church, as for the private members, and shal give account for the whol. If then the Apostles reason be of weight; the vvhol flock, as vvel as the particular sheep, must obey and submit to such as vvatch over them. Secondly the Apostle sayth elsvvhere, to the Elders of an other church, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> 
               <hi>take heed to al the flock, wherof the holy ghost hath made you overseers: poimainein,</hi> (that is to feed, rule, govern, guid, direct and doe al other duties of good shepheards unto) <hi>the church of God.</hi> Novv these vvords <hi>flock</hi> &amp; <hi>church,</hi> mean not particular members, but the general company under charge &amp; guidance. And if the holy
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18551:68"/>
Ghost have set Elders and shepherds over the whole flock: can any man doubt, but they must teach rule and direct the whol? &amp; if they must doe this by authoritie from God: is not the whol flock bound to be taught ruled &amp; directed by them in the Lord? What pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the scripture then is this, that when the Apostle writing to a whol church, to obey and submit unto their guides: it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned unto particular members for to obey? Such doctrines fitt rather the confusion of Babylon, then the holy order &amp; goverment of Sion. But it seemeth the stinch of this restreynt, went up into the nose of the man himself as he wrote it: for presently he seeketh to sweeten the yll savor with these flowers: that <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 66.</note> 
               <hi>Al the saincts shal yeeld obedience to the Elders in things commanded by God: and the Elders shal al of them obey the voyce of the church in things commanded of God.</hi> He might also have added that both Elders and people should obey the voyce of any particular person, in things commanded by God. For if the whol church doe syn, and <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 13 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> any one make it known unto them, and shew them the law of God: they are bound to obey him, &amp; submit to his good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel in the Lord. But what is this to the purpose? The question is into whose hands Christ hath committed the ordinarie teaching guiding governing and ruling of his saincts here on earth. The scriptures <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Thes</hi> 5. 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Heb</hi> 13. 17.</note> teach, and we accordingly have long since <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>Confess: art.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.</note> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that it is into the hands of the Bishops or Elders. This is that which I defend in my answer to M. Bernard: for this, if for any thing, M. S. also inveigheth against me: being indeed against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also herein. For besides the testimonies fore alleged out of his book, he hath further in the same book written thus, <note n="†" place="margin">paral. p. 86</note> 
               <hi>Christ is not their king, seing he onely ruleth by his own lawes and officers, and not by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Lords and lawes &amp;c.</hi> And agayn, <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 107.</note> 
               <hi>You refuse Christs testament and his kingdome, and will not have him to reign over you in his own offices and lawes, which is contrarie to these places, Luk.</hi> 19. 27. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 9. 10. 11. Loe here the truth which I defend, confirmed by my adversaries owne penn; for this is the onely thing which I plead, that Christ ruleth his people, onely by his own lawes and officers, as mine opposite himself granteth: &amp; yet see, what an outcrie he maketh against me, as teaching such Antichristianisme, as was never heard of before.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18551:69"/>
But by his former dispute against the Presbyterie, himselfe is found to be one of those enimies, that wil not have Christ to reign over them, by his own offices and lawes.</p>
            <p>Wheras he putteth <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 66.</note> the question thus, <hi>how farr the sheep must obey the Elders which ar shepheards:</hi> that is not the point between Mr. Bern. and me, neyther medle I with it: yet if any be desirous to know my mind in general, it is. So farr as the shepheards doe teach rule and direct the sheep in the wayes of Christ, by his owne word and lawes; so farr at they al jointly and every one severally, bound to obey and submit to their shephards, and no further. For although this be the ordinary way of teaching and governing the Church; yet if extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily it fal out, that the shepheards walk and lead awry, and the sheep go aright; then is neyther the whol flock, nor any one sheep to follow or obey them, unlesse they wil fall togither into the ditch.</p>
            <p>Neyther wil that reason, which M. Sm. so laboureth about, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Ministery is not by <hi>succession</hi> but by <hi>election</hi> of the church; make ought against me: unlesse the man thinketh this consequence good, <hi>If Elders be chosen by the Church, then are they not to teach and rule the Church by Christs word and lawes.</hi> The contrary rather is true. For if the Church be authorized and commanded of Christ to chose and set Elders over them, for to teach and rule them by his own word and lawes; and are also commanded to obey and submit themselves unto their Elders: then are the Elders to teach &amp; rule them by Christs word and lawes, and the Church is therin to obey. But the first is true, as the scriptures and reasons forealleged prove; Therefore alsothe latter.</p>
            <p>No more wil that similitude of a body, (which as all parables will easily be perverted, being streyned beyond the purpose of the holy spirit) help ought against the truth I defend. For as God <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 18.</note> hath disposed the members every one of them in the body at his own pleasure, &amp; given them severall faculties, so as all the members have <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 12. 4.</note> not one work; and as the eye for seing, the ear for hearing, the mouth for speaking, &amp;c. doo administer, not for particular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers onely, but for the whol body: even so the Church hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members with <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. 5. 6.</note> diversities of gifts, and diversities of offices or ministeries; which they <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 12. 6 7. 8.</note> are to attend unto and execute for the whol
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18551:69"/>
body: &amp; the whol, (not the particular members onely, as this man fansieth) are to obey and submit unto these distributions &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, being al of the Lord, as the Apostle teacheth. And as al the members of the body have not the gift of speaking, seeing, smelling &amp;c. but these are bestowed on special members for the use of al: so in the church, al <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 29.</note> are not prophets, or al teachers, or al go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours &amp;c. but <note n="“" place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</note> to one is given the word of wisdome, to another the word of knowledge &amp;c. unto the administration of which gifts, by the due offices or members; al the body is to submit, and obey in the Lord. So that a wonder it is any man should have the face to blame me with <hi>Antichristianisme,</hi> for disclayming that position which M. Bernard imputed unto us; namely, <hi>that the power of Christ, that is, avthoritie to preach, to administer the sacraments, and to execute the censures of the church, belongeth to the whole church, yea to overy one of them:</hi> or for affirming, some special authoritie to be committed to the Elders for reaching and ruling the church by Christs own word and lawes, unto whom the other brethren are to obey, alwayes in the Lord. What would it be but a mere confusion and abuse of the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the gospel, if every one in the church should administer &amp; perform the works of al Christs ministers: which they may, if the power and authoritie perteyneth unto them: for who may abridge the saincts of these things?</p>
            <p>And most strange it is, that M. S. (if any thing may be strange in him,) would thus inveigh against me: when in handling this very poynt against M. Bern. he writeth thus <note n="*" place="margin">Para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Neither is this position set down in our words, (to my knowledge) neither doth Mr. Bernard take away, but confirm rather the thing that we hold: for he granteth that they offend God, which may and doe not ordinardie (having meanes offred) live in a church rightly constituted: &amp; we grant, that many of Christs subiects for want of meanes, doe not live in a true constituted church. If therfore he were not a caviller, he would not have reckned this among our errors.</hi>

            <p>But for his injurious dealing with me, and persecuting this poor church (which deserved better of him) with his pen in publik, as the world now may see he hath don in high measure: I leave him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for mercy or judgment.
