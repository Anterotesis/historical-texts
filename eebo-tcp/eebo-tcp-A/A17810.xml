            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

working vpon the distempered Religion of the Earles

of <hi>Huntley, Arrolle, Crawford</hi> and <hi>Bothwell</hi> (a man as fickle
as his fortune, but yet the naturall sonne of <hi>Iohn Prior</hi> of
<hi>Coldingham,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth King of <hi>Scotland</hi>)
easily perswaded them into a strong mutiny. The drift and
scope of their purpose was, that hauing surprised the King,
they might make way for some forreigne forces to restore the
decaying <hi>Romish</hi> Religion to its former perfection, and then
to assayle <hi>England,</hi> in reuenge of the death of the Queene
of Scots. The pretences whereby they drew the facil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the comminalty into a fauouring and following
of the businesse, were, That the king was against his will
constrayned to the custody of <hi>Maitland</hi> the Chancellour,
and some others of the English faction; That the English
men flesht, as it were, with the safe and vnreuenged death
of the Queene of Scots, had now made themselues ready, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to roote out the whole Scottish nobility; and that they,
at the request of the King himselfe, had put themselues thus
in armes to rescue Him from the strictnesse of his custody,
and the Realme from ruine.<note place="margin">A mutinie in Scotland.</note> The King (hauing beene gone a
hunting, and certified by many messengers vpon one and
the same day, that on the one side <hi>Bothwell,</hi> was neere at hand
with a troope of <hi>Borderers;</hi> and that <hi>Huntley</hi> and the rest,

thought, that her owne Kingdome would share in the
dolefull effects of those mischiefes that <hi>Scotland</hi> hatched,<note place="margin">Allayed by the Queene.</note> left
nothing vnattempted which the forcible argument eyther
of money or reason could effect, to spurre on the King of
Scots to an immature crushing of this Spanish policy, which
notwithstanding the ripenesse of his owne iudgement had
already prompted him to. For being as wary to preuent, as
skilfull to foreknow the storme that might follow, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sets forward towards <hi>Huntley.</hi> But he, whether out of
a guilty feare of Maiesty imprinted in the heart of rebellion,
or out of some politique distrust of his owne, or his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ability, hauing marched on as farre as <hi>Dee-bridge,</hi> no
sooner vnderstood of the approach of the Kings forces, but
dismissing <hi>Glamise,</hi> he betakes himselfe to the deceitfull secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his owne dwellings amongst the ragged hilles at
<hi>Strathbolgie.</hi> Thither when the King (more eager of the
chase, then carefull either of his age or Person, vnacquainted
with labour, want and such course entertainment as those
sharpe climates affoorded) had narrowly pursued him: first
the Earle tendred a submission vpon the condition of safety
both of life and goods; but afterwards, hee wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
yeelded vp himselfe to the pleasure of the King:
who at the first indeed, vouchsafing him not so much as the
curtesie of conference straightway committed him to prison;
but not long after released him, both from his punishment
and his offence, neither only pardoned he him, but extended
the same mercy to euery one of his complices, whose sober
discretion could so farre dispense with their proud ambition,
as to petition for it.</p>

                  </gap>ld a hand cleare,
and a minde syncere.</hi> The principall heads whereof hee was
accused were:</p>
            <p>First, that he was of too intimate acquaintance with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Allan, Parsons</hi> the Iesuite,<note place="margin">The heads of his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and other Traytors, who
lay in continuall wayt for the destruction both of Prince
and people; and who by exciting both Forrayners abroad,
and Naturall Subiects at home, plotted the reducement of
the Romish Religion to its ancient vigour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that in letters sent by <hi>Weston,</hi> otherwise <hi>Burges,</hi>
a Priest, he had ingaged his promise to the sayd Cardinall,
for the promotion of the <hi>Catholique cause,</hi> and to that intent
would secretly haue conueyed himselfe out of the Realme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that he was priuy to the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby the Queene her selfe was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and her kingdomes bequeathed to the inuasion of the
Spaniard.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that in the time of his imprisonment in the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> he caused <hi>Masse</hi> to be sayd for the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous successe of the Spanish Fleet; and that hee himselfe
had vsed diuers peculiar prayers to the same purpose.</p>

            <p>To whom they answered it lawfull.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">His demands of the Iudges.</note> whether Coniecturall Arguments were of
force or no, to convince a truth?</p>
            <p>To whom they answered it lawfull for him to interpose
exception against them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether they could lustly accuse him of things
that were made treason in the thirteenth yeare of the Queene,
now, after the time alotted in the very law?</p>
            <p>To whom they promised no proceeding against, but out of
the old law for treason, enacted by King <hi>Edward the third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, he demanded whether that were a formall Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

the time <hi>when,</hi> or the place <hi>where</hi> to be chiefely to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
Then being demanded againe whether he were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or no, he pleaded <hi>not guiltie,</hi> submitting his cause to God
and the iudgement of his Peeres; requesting withall, that
the weakenesse of his memorie much impayred by the great
indisposition of his bodie, and the long time of his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might occasion no harme or disaduantage vnto him,

with other Iesuites had deuised and sought to accomplish

the said <hi>Cardinall</hi> was banisht the Realme; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the <hi>Earle</hi> maintained an intercourse of letters
with him still, in some whereof he assured him of his vtmost
indeauour for promoting the <hi>Catholique cause,</hi> which words
he argued could admit of no milder exposition, than an inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Earle</hi> made answere that by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the <hi>Catholique cause,</hi> he meant not the <hi>subuersion</hi> of the

against this, the confessions of <hi>Sauage, Throgmorton,</hi>

               </gap>ides, that the Earle had entertained such

also he had reconciled himselfe to the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> and
tendred obedience to that See.</p>
            <p>This reconcilement the <hi>Earle</hi> earnestly denied, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them that testimonie might be produced for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but they produced none but himselfe, who hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
granted them, that he had beene confessed his sinnes by
<hi>Burges</hi> the Priest, gaue them occasion to vse this argument
against him; he that is admitted to the vse of the Sacraments
of the Church of Rome must first be reconciled to that
Church: but he had beene admitted by <hi>Gratley,</hi> a Priest to
the vse of the Sacraments of the Church of Rome; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of matter, argueth his reconcilement, from his owne
letters, from his resolution to depart the Realme, and from
his continuall being thus at the <hi>Cardinals</hi> becke, thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
him guilty of treason, and afterwards producing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Gratley</hi> and <hi>Morgan</hi> to the <hi>Queene of Scots,</hi> taxed

him as if he professed the Romish religion, not out of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but as a colour for his discontents if they should chance
to break out into open rebellion. After all this was produced

them: so that in all there might be more or lesse, some eleuen
thousand souldiers and about fifteene hundred mariners. To
these also <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the base borne, and <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>Crato,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The prouisions for this enterprize being all in a readines, in

               </gap>els that rode in the Bay,
beat sorely vpon them, especially on some of the vnskilfuller
sort, whom eyther their owne indiscretion, or their vnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
fortune could not rescue from the danger. But afterwards
the English planting some few peeces of Ordnance vpon the
shore, made them quickly abandon the Road, and themselues
a safer way.</p>
            <p>The next day after, the <hi>Base Towne</hi> was assaulted at one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27506:24"/>
and the same time in three places; on that part that looked
toward the Continent Colonell <hi>Bret</hi> and <hi>Vnton</hi> made onset,
with some three hundred more; and <hi>Richard Wingfield</hi> and
<hi>Sampson</hi> with fiue hundred on the other side. These
attempting it by <hi>Scalado,</hi> were forced sometime to abandon
their possessions, by reason of strong resistance they found in
the enemy. But the rest brake in vpon them valiantly and
happily without any great losse; which made the Spaniards
that inhabited there, quickly forsake the Towne and their
Armes,<note place="margin">The Base Towne taken.</note> and conuey themselues through passages as difficult
to finde out, as dangerous to passe through, to the <hi>High town.</hi>
The enemy in the great Galleon, perceiuing her to be on fire
and her Artillery ouercharged, came presently a shore, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
her to suffer a two dayes martyrdome; and her proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all sorts, and good warlike munition (which had been
stored vp there against the next inuasion) to be conueyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the English ships.</p>
            <p>Then marched the English vp to the <hi>High Towne,</hi>

placeth his engines at the other side of the wall, intending to
make a breach at the same time. But his policy was more
laudable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the euent of it sutable; for the vnderminers,
hauing not bedded their powder enough in the walles, the
fire recoyled backe againe, frustrating both their labour and
expectation. Wherefore they fell to it againe, and worked
deeper into the foundation of the wall. The miners gaue fire
to the trayne: whereby they blew vp great part of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
vnder which their powder was planted; but the other
part thereof falling afterwards vpon many of the English
that contended for their owne destruction by entring the
breach, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rest forsaking their commanders to secure their owne liues,
left them to scuffle with a double enemy men and stones.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27506:24"/>
And yet they that continued this assault at the Breach at the
very same time on the other side of the wall, by reason that
the inconstancy of some rubbish would not allow them sure
footing, were fayne after the losse of some men, to lose their
labour to and retire; their discreet valour notwithstanding
being more to bee commended, then their successe vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Generall <hi>Norris</hi> then hauing certayne intelligence that

at the foot of the Bridge,<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards driuen backe.</note> yet was by force driuen backe,
and made to forsake their barricadoes of Barrels, and the
Bridge which was flanked on both sides with shot, which
did affoord the English an easie passage both for themselues,
and for their cruelty to slaughter the enemy at pleasure, for at
least three miles chase; and safely to ransacke hamlets and
neighbour villages, and set the whole Country thereabouts
on fire: which when they had done about two dayes after,<note place="margin">The English depart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and embarque for Portugall.</note>

hate of the Spaniard, or pitty to <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> licenced
more by his owne minde then the Queenes pleasure, hauing
put foorth to sea, came into the English fleet. The Queene

himselfe vpon this Action with a thought of being sole
Commander and Generall of the Nauy: By reason that by
former preferments he had ingaged to his seruice, the hearts
of most of the Colonels and Captaines there, that might by
ioynt consent conferre it vpon him: yet certayne it is, that in
this, if he lost his Desire, he purchased Honour.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after, the sea being so boysterous that a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet

From <hi>Peniche</hi> the Army marched by land to <hi>Lisbone</hi>
vnder the conduct of Generall <hi>Norris,</hi> which was some
threescore miles off: Generall <hi>Drake</hi> assuring that he would
follow with the fleet vp the Riuer <hi>Tagus.</hi> In their voyage at
<hi>Torres Vedras,</hi> a Councell of Warre was called; whereby it
was decreed most conuenient to pitch the Campe on the

blocked vp from the Spaniard, and that so euery <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guesse</hi>
might the more conueniently haue accesse to their
King.</p>
            <p>After six dayes marching, the Army approached the

               <note place="margin">Lisbon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted.</note> without so much as the hope

had made vnnauigable. That then if hee should haue come
straight on by <hi>S. Iulians Fort,</hi> which was well fortified with

<hi>Offices</hi> whether <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> or <hi>Ciuill.</hi> The loftinesse of this
vndermining request, intermingled with the eager promoting
of it by <hi>Cardinall Caietan</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> came yet so
short of their expectation of successe, that it occasioned great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27506:30"/>
discontentment in the French themselues, whose riper iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
prompted them to this caution, by promoting their
Religion not to lose their Reason.</p>
            <p>And as the Queene imploied no small care in establishing
<hi>Nauarre</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> so had she a long time
sought opportunity to contriue a match betweene his sister
<hi>Katharine</hi> and the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queene propoundeth a marriage to the King of Scots.</note> wisely considering that
both of them would stand her in great stead to refell the
force of <hi>Catholiques</hi> and their plots against Protestants: but
the euent prooued not answerable, by reason that her age
was of the most, and her meanes of the least; her brother
himselfe likewise being much impouerished by these neuer
discontinuing warres. The King of <hi>Scotland</hi> notwithstanding
being still vnmarried ceased not very often to sollicite the
Queen for her aduice in the choice of a wife; who being more
slow in answering him, then the desire of the Scots, although
not then reason, required, gaue occasion to the Scots not only
to suspect, but euen to vent this suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in open clamors, that
the English by their cunning trickes sought to depriue the
King both of Honour and Issue, thereby conceyting an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
for the death of his mother, and to exclude the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
race from succession in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This when the Queene vnderstood, shee exhorted the
King to choose himselfe a wife, and such a one, that might
well please him, not displease the people, nor occasion the
long amity betweene them to fall into suspition.</p>
            <p>The King of Scots therefore hauing somewhat about a

            </p>
            <p>Besides all these charges euery two moneths did she pay to
the Garrisons in <hi>Flushing</hi> and <hi>Brill,</hi> an hundred and fiue and
twenty thousand Florins, and two hundred and threescore
more to three thousand horse and foot, that seru'd in the
Low Countries. Shee set out many braue ships, shee was at
infinite charges to preuent all clandestine machinations of
the Pope or Spaniard in Scotland; and yet for all this, at this
time shee repayed to her subiects monies which shee lately
had borrowed, in so much that many men iustly wondred,
whence this abilitie should spring, she being not in any mans
debt, (a vertue which few Princes can boast of) and yet of a
sufficient competency to maintaine her kingdome against the
enemie, without admitting any auxiliary forces, which none
of the greatest of her neighbour Kings could at that time
doe.</p>
            <p>Certaine it is, she was a most prouident Princesse, seldome
entertaining any charge which was not either for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of her Honour at home, or the Succour of her
friends abroad. Besides, the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burghley,</hi> bore
a prouident eye ouer those that had charge of Subsidies, or
imposts; for many times by the couetousnesse of such subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
ministers, monies receiued for the Queenes vse, were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27506:33"/>
imployed to their priuate p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ofits, and others that should
haue beene receiued, were omitted by a wilfull ouersight, and
hir'd negligence.</p>
            <p>About this time the commodity of the Custome house
amounted to an vnexpected value,<note place="margin">The rates of the Custome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house raised.</note> For the Queene being
made acquainted by the meanes of a subtile fellow, named
<hi>Caermardine,</hi> with the mistery of their gaines, so enhansed
the rate, that Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Master of the Custome
house, who heretofore farmed it of the Queene for fourteene
thousand pounds yeerely, was now mounted to two and
forty thousand pounds, and afterwards to fifty thousand
pounds yeerely, which notwithstanding was valued but as
an ordinary summe for such oppressing gaine. The Lord
<hi>Treasurer</hi> indeed, the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> &amp; <hi>Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ingham,</hi> much
opposed themselues against this <hi>Caermardine,</hi> denying him
entrance into the Priuy Chamber, in so much that expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the Queene, they traduced her hearkening to such
a fellowes information, to the disparagement of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Councell, and the discredite of their care. But
the Queene answered them, that all Princes ought to bee (if
not as fauourable, yet as iust) to the lowest, as to the highest,
desiring that they, who falsely accuse her Priuy Councell of
sloath or indiscretion, should be seuerely punished, but that
they who iustly accused them should be heard; That she was
Queene, as well to the poorest as to the proudest, and that
therefore she would neuer be deafe to their iust complaints.
Likewise, that shee would not suffer, that these Toole-takers
like horse-lee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hes, should glut themselues with the riches of
the Realme, and starue her Exchequer, which as shee will
not endure so to bee dieted, so hateth shee to enrich it with
the pouerty of the people.</p>
            <p>Without doubt shee was a great enemy to all extortions,
and vnreasonable taxes, hating to oppresse her poore subiects
as many of her Predecessors had done, sweetning their owne
extortions with the name of the <hi>Peoples contribution, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27506:34"/>
Commons liberalitie, or their free beneuolence, or the like.</hi> She
would not suffer <hi>Tolling by the head of liuing creatures,</hi> once
to be proposed as lawfull, although it had beene formerly
proposed in the daies of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt. And hence was it
that the people paid their subsidies with such alacritie; and
though that now her necessity had occasioned a greater tax
than ordinary, yet it seemed onely a voluntary payment.
Wherefore the Queene, by a mercifull Statute, to reward her
people for their forwardnesse, would haue exempted those of
the meaner sort, and multiplied their payments vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
as was once done in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
but the euent of this courtesie would haue beene
more iniurious to her selfe, than beneficiall to the people; it
being plainly demonstrated by casting vp the accounts, that
the subsidies would fall far short of their expected value, if
those of indifferent estates, which we call <hi>Pound-men,</hi> should
be fauoured with any exception.</p>
            <p>About this time certaine Inhabitants of the towne of <hi>Groy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
one of the richest in all <hi>Friezland,</hi> which neither
could beare the seruile yoake of the Spaniard, nor would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a subiection to the States,<note place="margin">The Queenes care of the States.</note> made a motion vnto the
Queene, to receiue them into her protection; which shee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
refused, being vnwilling any way to benefit her selfe
by the States discontentment. At which time likewise shee
was much offended with the <hi>Zelanders,</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>husing the
King of France their Patron, and not acquainting the States
of Holland with their purpose. And publikely reprooued
many of those Prouinces, who vnder pretence of obedience
and affection vnto her, had occasioned many discontents
and dissentions at home. She was indeed, somewhat larger in
this reproofe, then her ordinary displeasure would allow her,
because she was giuen to vnderstand, that <hi>Richardot</hi> had been
very importunate, that pardon &amp; libertie of Religion should
be granted to all Low-Countreymen, who had fled out of
their Prouinces, if they would returne home againe: which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27506:34"/>
if he brought to passe, she soone foresaw would be disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to the States, by reason that such kinde of men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
inhabited the emptiest Cities of Holland, and would
contribute much to the maintenance of war.</p>
            <p>About which time also at the mediation of the Duke of
Tuscany,<note place="margin">She restoreth Ships to the Venetians.</note> shee commanded some
ships that had beene taken
by the English, to be restored to the Venetians and Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
straitly commanding, that none should offer violence
to the Italian, Venetian, French, Dane, Low-Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or those of the Hanse Townes.</p>
            <p>But the Spaniard, as hee escaped the contents of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
so escaped hee not many onsets and affronts of the
English; some in the Atlantique Ocean, and some at and
about the Ilands of <hi>Azores,</hi> where his Nauies from either
Indies must necessarily come for refection, and others by the
Earle of Cumberland, who surprised some of his ships, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished
to the ground his Fort of Fayoll, and brought from
thence fifty eight great peeces of Ordnance; and others by
some more of the English, who scouring the Gaditan Sea,
much endangered the ordinary safety of his vsuall Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiques.</p>
            <p>The glory of the Queene, although it were farre spread,
and almost fearfull, by reason of her prosperous successe in
war, yet was it more admirable and much better'd in report,
by a peace which shee obtained betweene the Great <hi>Turke</hi>
and the <hi>Polonians,</hi> euen at the brinke of a terrible battell;
and the <hi>Vayvode</hi> of <hi>Moldauia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">She procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth peace from the Turke, for the Polonians and Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians.</note> whom the Great Turke sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexed also; which courtesie of hers, the <hi>Polonian,</hi>
and his Chancellour, by their letters, gratefully since acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
            <p>And now to confirme that inuiolable bond of amity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
her and the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> shee sent <hi>Edward Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> to him, to congratulate to him his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
mariage, and his as happy returne home; with some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
also, that as her loue had lately beene manifested
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27506:35"/>
in honouring both him and the King of <hi>France</hi> with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of S. <hi>George,</hi> so his care should bee as circumspect to

most gently entertained both the loue and care of the

him such excessiue charges, that hauing spent not onely his
estate, but euen his credit, which was much impeached by
his abundant debts, he was in the night time buried at <hi>Pauls,</hi>

and causing it to be hung vpon a Gibbet by the Hangman,
set fire to it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon came forth a strict Proclamation in <hi>England,</hi>

of his commendations wrought him into such
a forgetfulnesse of his Commission, that he left <hi>Diepe,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the King to the suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> and sent a Challenge
to the Spaniards, to hazard with him, two hundred Pikes,

from heauen, to bring the Queene and her Councell to

He confirmed himselfe and the rest the more in this faith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

that they esteemed him greatly beloued of God, and greater

and that this yeere England should bee sorely afflicted with

               <note place="margin">Hackets ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Queene.</note> exceedingly hated the Queene, as appears
in that he durst mutter, that she had fell from her right of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
and in that he durst offer violence to her picture, in
thrusting it through the breast with a Poniard: neither was
this a great wonder, for he had perswaded himselfe already,
that God had made him King of Europe, and that therefore
hee ought not to endure a Riuall. Likewise hee perswaded
both <hi>Copinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi> that they were inspired,
not onely with a Propheticall, but euen with an Angelicall
spirit, and they perswaded therewith, exhibited to him all
obedience and reuerence, as appointed King by God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
endeauoring to giue fewell to this sedition, which they
longed to see on flame. About <hi>Iuly</hi> next, they came to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
of the Realme, and proffered to him the tuition of
the Kingdome, vnder the Queene, to whom they dedicated
the life of <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Arthingtons</hi> prophesies, but hee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hauing or faining vrgent businesse to doe, sleighted
both them and their courtesie.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, they certified <hi>Wiginton,</hi> that Christ had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to them the night before, not bodily, as hee is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd
in heauen, but Spiritually, by possessing <hi>Hacket</hi> in
the spirit, more than any of the rest: that <hi>Hacket</hi> was that
Angell that was to come before the day of iudgement, with
his Fanne and his Hooke, to separate the Sheepe from the
Goates, and that hee should tread downe Sathan and the
Kingdome of Antichrist. Afterwards from <hi>Wiginton,</hi> they
betake themselues to <hi>Hacket</hi> againe, by whose side, as he lay
downe vpon his bed, they prostrated themselues in very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
prayer, &amp; <hi>Hacket</hi> rysing vp, ioyned with them in praier,
oftentimes zealously requesting the Spirit to direct them to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:27506:44"/>
Gods glory, and then went to bed againe. Not long after
<hi>Arthington</hi> willed <hi>Copinger</hi> in the name of Iesus Christ
to annoint <hi>Hacket</hi> with the Holy Ghost, &amp; make him King:
So <hi>Copinger,</hi> hauing thrice humbly kissed the pauement, and
bowed the knee with great reuerence, approached towards
<hi>Hacket;</hi> but he droue him backe with his hand, saying, <hi>It is
needlesse for you to annoint me, for I am already annointed by
the Holy Ghost; goe ye onely and doe as I command you; Goe and
preach through the City, that Iesus Christ is come with his

flye vpon the execution of it, and running out of
doores, cry vp and downe the streetes, that <hi>Christ is come,</hi>
redoubling with a loud voice, that and many other things
which <hi>Hacket</hi> had told them, crying, <hi>Repent, repent, &amp;c.</hi>
throughout the City, till they came to <hi>Cheapside:</hi> and when
they were much pestered there with a throng of people, they
got vp into a Cart, and there partly without booke, and
partly by the helpe of some notes they had, they openly
cryed out, that <hi>Hacket</hi> had participated of Christ, by his
more <hi>peculiar Spirit a body truly glorified;</hi> and that he was
now come with his Fanne, to propagate the Gospel through
Eurpoe, and to constitute a <hi>new discipline and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
in England; intimating withall vnto them the place
where he lodged; declaring themselues to bee two Prophets,
the one of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the other of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to him for facilitating this so difficult an enterprise,
vowing, protesting, and swearing, that as they hoped to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
saued, all this was true.</p>
            <p>Then they added, that <hi>Hacket</hi> was a supreame and sole
Monarch, and that all the Kings and Princes of Europe were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27506:44"/>
but his Vassals, that therefore hee must onely be obeyed, and
the Queene deposed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, they railed at bitterly, and cursed the Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> as the
sole oppugners of the true and sincere Religion, which they
would haue brought in: and then hauing endeauoured to
haue crowded into other quarters of the City, with like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
but being hindred with the presse of the people,
and the perswasion of some of their friends, they returned
home to <hi>Hackets</hi> lodging.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, being apprehended<note place="margin">They are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</note> and brought before some
of the Priuy Councell, and other Magistrates, to bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
they behaued themselues with such contempt before
them, that they would not so much as stand bare, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
answer'd those that reproued them, that they were
aboue all Magistrates. Shortly after this <hi>Hacket</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hacket con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

speeches, euen to the terrour of those that heard
him; cunningly, as much thought, to bring the Iudges to
thinke, that hee was distracted in his wits, but yet in all his
other gestures and behauiours, there was no signe of any such
matter, for they relished more of a well setled grauity, than
any such distemper: afterwards was he drawne vpon a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

Ecclesiasticall, ought not to impose vpon a guilty man <hi>an oath

that no man is compelled to be his owne accuser, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that thereby a man must either wilfully condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

            <p>Against these men,<note place="margin">It is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and maintained.</note> the

alledging, that to withstand that, was onely to assault
the Queenes Maiesty, and with the breach of their oathes
of Alleageance, to insult ouer the sacred Prerogatiue of their

            <p>They answered, that Ecclesiasticall Courts had authority
to take notice of other causes besides Matrimoniall, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamentary,
as appeares by the Statute of <hi>Circumspecte aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
and by the Articles of the Clergie, vnder King <hi>Edward

truth of it, by the reason of the variety of reading of it, and
the vncertainty of the time of it's originall, being it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
read disiunctiuely, <hi>To make recognition, or to take oath.</hi>
Besides this, they answered, that to make Recognition, did
not signifie a deposition of witnesses, or answer to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conuented, but onely the confession of the debt, or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
plea of debts and chattels; concluding that such taking
of oaths were exacted time out of minde, to auoid Simony,
Adultery, and other workes of darkenesse; especially, if the
Information be (as they call it) clamorous. And although
that no man be compelled to betray himselfe with his owne
accusation, yet that hee is bound to bee accused by a Fame,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27506:46"/>
and to shew whether or no hee can purge himselfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his innocency, by reason that such penance imposed, is
not to bee esteemed a Punishment, but onely Physicke, to
cure sinners, and to fright others from the like sinne, or to
take away any generall scandall, according to that of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ, <hi>Bee not ashamed for thy soules sake, to tell the truth,

            <p>But wherefore stand I deciding this controuersie? which
if any man will iudiciously scanne, let him consult with the

that they should follow the lawes, and not goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>This sommer, as also last sommer, there was such a great

drought through <hi>England,</hi> that not onely the fields, but

water the fift day of <hi>September,</hi> to the great admiration of
all that beheld the same; in so much, that a horseman might
easily passe ouer at London-bridge. Whether or no, this fell
out by reason of the great drought, or the fierce rage of the
North-east winde, which had blowne vpon the water two
whole daies, and either droue away the fresh water, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the flowing of the Sea, I cannot tell; especially the

            <p>There were those that searcht into the hidden secrets of
Philosophy, to shew that this accident fell out by a naturall
cause and direction; arguing, that as a quartane Ague comes
at her due time, and as the Gout at certaine seasons, and as a
Purge, if nothing hinder it, keepes it's accustomed time for
working, and as a womans childe-bearing ordinarily comes

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27506:57"/>
And when they had weightily considered (for I speake out
of the Acts of Parliament) with what resolute malice the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
raged against <hi>Englands</hi> ouerthrow, and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in <hi>France,</hi> to ceaze the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or
to surprize any conuenient place for inuading <hi>England,</hi> they
adiudged it fit to grant some Subsidies to repell these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
Wherefore acknowledging and magnifying the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke
princely minde of their Princesse, together with her
prouident care and especiall affection to her people, that had
so happily waged warre against her enemy; and to that end
she continually exhausted the wealth of her Treasure, and
neuer offered to burden the poore comminalty with taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and that not onely in defence of her owne Kindgome,
but also in easing and relieuing her confederates according to
these words, and her promise. The Clergie granted two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Subsidies,<note place="margin">Subsidies granted.</note> and the Laity three, and six Fifteenes and
Tenths, to be paid at a time, with a willing and obedient
minde. But yet with submission petitioning, that since these
things were so assigned ouer to Posterity in publike Records,
that in expresse words there should be this caution added,
that these so great (and the like neuer before heard-of) Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies
being granted vnto so good a Princesse, vpon so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

that by her consent she might giue life to these Lawes to
make them of force, hauing professed her loue to all her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
first protested, that all her care onely watched to this
entent, that the glory of God and the Common-wealth
might be enlarged; and that she would spend onely to that
end all whatsoeuer they should bestow vpon her. After that,

want of courage; how that trusting still to God, and the
buckler of her good conscience, she neuer knew how to feare,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27506:57"/>
nay, not her greatest and her most potent enemies. Lastly,
to put courage into their hearts, she discoursed very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
of the valour of the English, and among other things,
that euen our enemies themselues could not but acknowledge
that the English, (out of a naturall &amp; inbred valour) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prompt to vndergoe any dangers: and that they
found so much indeed by experience too, although they
dissembled it; that they should yet try it more fully, if so be
that the English slept not too much in security, or be not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
vpon being vnprouided; then concluding, with hearty
thankes for Subsidie monies, she promised to dedicate all
her thoughts to God, and the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>And indeed, how she performed this promise towards
God, let the Ecclesiasticall Writers tell, what punishment she
inflicted vpon <hi>Henry Barowe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Barowe a Sectary han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> and his Sectaries, who by the
seed-plot of dangerous opinions, condemning the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> derogating from the Queenes authority in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
matters, had not a little distempered the peace of the
Church.</p>
            <p>But as concerning her promise towards the good of the
Common-wealth, certainly she amply also fulfilled that, in
employing all her greatest care to weaken the strength of the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> to hinder all his proceedings, and possibly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
his forces out of <hi>Britaine.</hi> And as she did this, so
likewise bestowed she little lesse care and paines to keepe
them from <hi>Scotland:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Her care of Scotland.</note> instly fearing, lest that a troublesome
confusion of affaires (which we haue said was in <hi>Scotland)</hi>
might open a doore for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to both Kingdomes
destruction. For she had most certainly vnderstood, that
the Popish Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> bad by the tricks and plots
of the Priests, conspired to bring in the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to alter the Religion there, and to set vpon <hi>England</hi> on
that side; and that one <hi>Creicton</hi> a Iesuit (whom she had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set at liberty) hauing passed his faith, that he would neuer
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27506:58"/>
combine against the good of <hi>England,</hi> had vnder this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
passed ouer often into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and into
<hi>Spaine.</hi> She wisely foresaw that the Comminalty of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(especially those in the west parts) would be easily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with Spanish gold: also she weighed how full of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
the Scottish shores were, how warlike the Nation it
selfe was, and how well furnished in Horsemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then they might enter <hi>England</hi> as at a backe-doore. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, considering of what an vnstable loyalty the
English themselues were, that are neighbours ot <hi>Scotland,</hi>
most of them being Papists, and euery one desirous of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations,
who had their meanes and their hopes in their own
hands. And lastly, that there is alwaies more courage in
them that doe oppugne, then in them that defend, who as it
were onely cast dice for their owne lot.</p>
            <p>Wherefore she gaue the King of <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <note place="margin">The admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the king of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> to vnderstand

sent the Lord <hi>Borough</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lord Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough sent Embassadour into Scotland</note> on an Embassie into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he
might truely informe the King that <hi>Bothwell</hi> was not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured

seuerely punish those that had entertained him: withall, she
incensed the King against the Spanish faction, wishing him
to procure a new Association of Protestants to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in safety, and to defend Religion against all outward se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
with hearts and hands knit together: and this was
shortly after effected.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Borough</hi> hauing expected the Kings returne
out of the Northerne quarters of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queens demands.</note> demanded these
things in writing from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he would certifie the
Queene of all the Spanish enterprises against <hi>England</hi> that he
heard of; That by his iustice he would defend his Regall
authority, and if that he could not execute iustice vpon the
bodies of such Traitours, that hee would haue their goods
confiscated; That he would chause into his Councell men of
pure and well-tried trust; That all these things he would
certifie the Queene of by his owne hand, that both she and
also all other Princes of the same religion might easily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
with what a prouident care he resisted the enemies
thereof. Lastly, that he would take order for a peace in the
Borders of both Kingdomes. Adding withall, That if these
things were done, she would not be wanting in any thing, as
she lately was not, in seuerely mulcting those Englishmen
that had entertained <hi>Bothwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these things distinctly the King answered,<note place="margin">The King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> answer.</note> that he had
certified her of all the machinations of the Spaniard, as soone
as he found them out; that as speedily as hee could hee had
persecuted all the Rebels, punishing some with losse of
goods, and others with life; That he had appointed Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
in their Dominions; and that he would haue all of
them banished by act of Parliament; and after their banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
their goods should be confiscated. That he would
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27506:59"/>
admit to Councell onely men of sound iudgment, of purity
in Religion and loue to their Countrey; and that he would
witnesse all this to the Queene, with his owne hand-writing;
that he would also take order about the Borderers. But then,
that it was meet, that the Queene should furnish him with
monyes to bring this to passe, both to resist the Spaniard, and
his owne Rebels, that were of great wealth and strength.</p>
            <p>Last of all hee required, that She would punish those that
fauoured <hi>Bothwell;</hi> and since hee was a fellow of vnexpiable
villany, detestable before all Princes, euen to example, that
shee would deliuer him vp to his hands, if hee lurk't in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
since shee could not chuse but esteeme the fauourers
and friends of such an enemy, as her owne enemies.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding, when Sir <hi>Robert Meluill</hi> came, and
demanded <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and monies also for to pursue the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Papists, some monies indeed were sent: but as for
<hi>Bothwell,</hi> it was answered, that hee should bee deliuered vp,
according to the couenants of the former Treatise, or bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
out of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reason of this vnexpected answer to the King of
Scotland, might well bee vnknowne, when indeed it was no
other, but because some Scottishmen in <hi>England,</hi> had enuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
the Queene with conceit, that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi>
dealt too fauourably with his popish Nobility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bothwell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bothwell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Queene.</note> about the same time, hauing beene proclaimed
Traitor by the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> returneth secretly home
againe, and brought into the Kings Chamber by some of his
friends,<note place="margin">He retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth secretly into Scotland</note> vpon a sudden he fell downe at the Kings feet, (he
little dreaming of any such matter,) and casting his sword on
the ground, humbly beg'd for mercy; &amp; by the importunate
intercession of many, hee obtained it vpon certaine conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to wit, that hee should depart from the presence of the
King; that he should appeare personally in iudgment of the
case of his dealing with witches; that, if he be absolu'd and
quitted of that, he should depart the Kingdome, and liue any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27506:59"/>
where, where it should please the King. Yet for all this, the
day after hee was quitted from his dealing with Witches,<note place="margin">His insolent behauiour.</note> he
by force, drew many of the Kings seruants out of the
Court, till at length his faction grew so potent in the Court,
that the King, for his owne safeties sake, and the peace of the
Realme, was faine, not onely to pardon him, and all his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Attendants, but also to remooue out of the Court,
the Chancellour, the Treasurer, the Lord <hi>Humes,</hi> and <hi>George
Humes,</hi> whome he esteemed most loyall vnto him.</p>
            <p>But afterwards, within a moneth, weighing with himselfe,
to his great discontent, how to the indignity of his Maiesty,
these things had bin extorted from him against all reason, he
declared in the next assembly of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that they esteemed no better of him, than of a Captiue, and
euen <hi>Bothwel's</hi> captiue; that hee could no longer suffer a
subiect that had now thrise waged was within the walls and
chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Prince, both to triumph ouer him, and his
seruants, who had so well deserued at his hands; And hee
easily had it granted by the States, that they did approoue
him a free Prince, to exercise his authority, and to chuse his
Councellors, and other Seruants and Officers, according to
his owne discretion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he recals to his Court the Chancellour, and the
rest againe, cancelling whatsoeuer before (against his will) he
had granted to <hi>Bothwell.</hi> Yet notwithstanding, by reason of
his milde nature, hee vouchsafed to pardon him, and all his
complices, all their offences, and to restore them to their
goods, if so bee they supplicantly sought for the same; vpon
condition, that quietly they betake themselues home, and
approach not to the Court, except they bee sent for; that
<hi>Bothwell,</hi> within a limited and appointed time, doe depart
into some place beyond Sea, and continue in set places, so
long as it shall please the King. Hee makes great alteration
in the Court in a short time; banisheth <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
still of worser mischiefe towards the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27506:60"/>
and to that end lay hid, lurking still within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this was not Scotland yet at quiet, for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
men and Ministers tooke it very hainously, that the King
persecuted not the Papists with fire and sword: against
whom they themselues made assemblies, and without antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from the King, assembled together the Lords and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,
to consultation about it, to preuent danger that might
fall out to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>At this time in <hi>Germany,</hi> there came out in print, many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
against Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> calumniating her, as if shee
had incensed the Turke to warre against all the Christian
World: the letters came forth also which she had sent to the
Turke, in many places corrupted, altered and changed, and
many malicious calumnies added, and feigned on purpose.</p>
            <p>But the Queene, hauing sent a messenger to the Emperour,
so cleerely washed away these calumnies, that forthwith the
bookes were called in, and the Copies of them burnt at
<hi>Prague:</hi> for certainely, shee tooke all the paines she could,
for remoouing the Turke from Christendome; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
acknowledged as much. Neither surely had she any
thing to doe with the Turke, but onely to secure her subiects
traffique at Turkie; to which purpose she had her agent there
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as the French, Polacke, Common-wealth

<hi>England,</hi> spreading it out, that the French King, either
had embraced, or would shortly embrace the profession of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27506:61"/>
the Romish Religion. Hereupon Sir <hi>Thomas Wilkes</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched
into <hi>France,</hi> to know the certainty, and, if as yet he
had not altered his Religion, to disswade him by forceable
reasons contained in writing. But before he came, the King
had made a publike profession of the Roman Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
at S. <hi>Dennis,</hi> although notwithstanding euen some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
at that very time lay in waight for his life. The King
ingeniously layd open to <hi>Wilkes</hi> the motiues of his conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thus:</p>
            <q>
               <p>VVHen first (said he) I was chosen King
of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reason of his conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I tooke a solemne oath,
that at a set time I would be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the Romish Catholike Religion, neither was I
admitted King vpon any other condition. I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
this my instruction in that Religion this full
foure yeares, neither (but against my will) I haue now
condescended to it. The King my Predecessour being
taken away, I was necessarily to retaine the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours
and Seruants, and by their voices (being the
major part) haue things so beene carried, that all my
consultations against the Leaguers haue beene snatcht
vp by them, and neuer came to a prosperous successe.
Those that were Protestants (and of my Counsell) were
seldome or neuer there; being, more then was needfull,
intending onely their owne affaires; insomuch that I
was quite forsaken euen of those in whom I put my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
and fearing also lest that I might be forsaken
by the Papists too, I was necessarily glad to subscribe
to their determinations and counsels. I doe most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protest, that assoone as I was called to the
Crowne, eight hundred Noblemen, and nine Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Protestants returned home; neither could I
detaine them by any reason; insomuch, that I had not
any but euen my houshold seruants of my Bed-chamber.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27506:61"/>
The Papists (when they saw me forsaken euen of my
own side) began to domineere a little, &amp; vrge me to an
alteration of my religion, saying, that Catholikes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with a safe conscience obey an Heretike. Yet I still
prolonging it from day to day, so delayed time, till that
seeing my owne weaknesse, (who being but relieued
with a few supplies from my friends, &amp; being vnequal
to the Popes, Spaniards, and the Leaguers forces) was
faine to yeeld; especially finding a third faction on
foot betweene the Princes of the bloud-Royall, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Kingdome, the Prelates, and most of the
Nobility; who had entred into a consultation with the
Gouernours of most Prouinces and Cities of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to forsake me vtterly, as one of a most hereticall
naughtinesse, and to share my Prouinces amongst them
man by man. And when my necessity afforded me no
meanes of preuention for this vndertaken counsell, I
passed my word I would be conformed to the Roman-Catholike Religion. They allowed me one or two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
to conforme my selfe, sending to <hi>Rome</hi> for
my Absolution. The Leaguers to preuent this, made
all possible speed to the election of another King; many
vowed their endeauour to enthrone <hi>Guize</hi> in my seate,
vpon condition that the places of Office that they did
enioy, might be assigned to them for euer, and to their
Heires. Therefore with good deliberation haue I
embraced the Romish Religion; yet the Prelates refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to admit me into the Church, without the aduice
of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> till that I hardly perswaded
them to admit of my conuersion without any informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
disputation, or debating. And by this meanes I
haue throughly ioyned to my selfe the third faction,
preuented the election of <hi>Guize,</hi> purchased the good
will of my people, and bound the Duke of <hi>Tuskany</hi> to
me perpetually; besides, I haue saued the Reformed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27506:62"/>
Religion from danger of burning, which would neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
haue followed, if that my conuersion had beene
brought to passe by Informations, Disputations, or
Debates.</p>

            <p>In the meane time the Earle of <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> (keeping a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>The King made answer thereunto,<note place="margin">The answer of the King of Scots.</note> that he would vse all

his order he retreats to <hi>Dalkeeth,</hi> and from thence (being
pricked with the conscience of a Rebell) he betakes himselfe
to his accustomed lurking-holes in the confines of the
Realme. But the Queene forbad by Proclamation, any
man neere the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to entertaine, succour or
assist him. And this was very acceptable to the King; who
on the other side (to shew his desire of requitall) assembled his
Peeres in Parliament, for the banishing of these Popish
Earles and Nobles of the Realme.<note place="margin">The Scotch Papists bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Realme.</note> The Nobility but few,
being met, yet all refused to giue their voices against them,
in respect, that although it were true, that they had sent
such Papers into <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet nothing but onely bare conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
could be gathered from thence, what their intents might be.</p>
            <p>Yet for all that, the number of the Clergy men and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,
making a plurality of Voices, they were all banished
the Realme. Their Coats of Armes, and Badges of Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
(according to the custome of <hi>Scotland</hi>) were broake, and
cast out of the windowes of the Towne-house, and their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
publikely proclaimed by a Herald. Afterwards the

Houses at <hi>Strathbolgie, Slanie,</hi> and <hi>Newton,</hi> to be quite

that <hi>Huntley</hi> first withdrew himselfe to his Aunt, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse
of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> and afterwards was compelled to bee
gone into <hi>France,</hi> and the rest to change their soile.</p>
            <p>And so it came to passe, that the mutuall good will that
was betwixt the Queene and the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his setled
constancy in Religion, which could neuer be battered, by
the meanes, the prayers, the promises, or the subtill practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Papists, the seuere lawes against the Iesuites,<note place="margin">Their plots and new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices.</note> and
men of that faction, the punishment maturely inflicted on
<hi>Graham Fentree,</hi> one of the fauourers of the Spanish party,
the supreame authority in spirituall matters conferred vpon
the Prince by Parliament, and their mutuall endeauours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the growth of Papistry; all these (I say) did so shake
the very hopes of restoring Romish Religion in <hi>England,</hi>
and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which the Iesuites had long conceiued, that
some of them began to deuise new plots, and to try (since
they could not immediately estate their Religion in its former
honour) if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rone of <hi>England,</hi> which so might both
countenance and protect it.</p>
            <p>But (when the disagreeing multitude of them could not
meet vpon one person fit to their purpose, a great while) at
last they reflected vpon the Earle of <hi>Essex:</hi> in whom, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he were no Romish Catholike) yet they expected a
well-qualified temper of Religion, because his clemency
draue him to a perswasion, that in case of Religion men
should not suffer death. The right of inheritance which
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3, from whom hee descended.</p>
            <p>But the runnagates and fugitiues stood hardly for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> although they feared that the Queene and
the Court of Parliament would preuent that, by making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:27506:68"/>Not long after came a booke out, dedicated to the Earle of

allowing hereditary succession in the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi>

            <p>In the same, they most contumeliously traduce most of the

            <p>First, Because she (as the Booke saith) descended from

            <p>But when those Spaniards which had beene called in by

            <p>Certainly, notable was the villany of these times, when

would doe as much too by offensiue warre, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

hard at the Queenes mercy to send ouer more auxiliary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into <hi>Picardy,</hi> and afterwards would that there should be
Delegates chosen to treate about the manner of the warre.
Which when it seemed somewhat preposterous both to

            <p>She forthwith answered him presently, and the King in

should impute the losse thereof to her, because her as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance

Demonstrating that the narrow streights of the limited
time could not produce those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orces: and that it was no wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the French hauing beene once or twise vanquished,
to cast her Souldiers vpon the triumphing cruelty of the

               </gap>t that while she should so much esteeme his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
she might be compelled to relieue it with the losse of
the liues of many of her Subiects, and the loue of the rest.
Yet that she was so farre from reioycing at his vnfortunate
misery, or driuing him to a peace with their common enemy,
that neither he himselfe, nor any man else, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
of his discretion, could light vpon any suspition; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if so be he would but recall to his memory, the good
Offices wherewith she honoured him, &amp; the sacred bond of
their friendship. She promised all aid, though not such as his
desire, yet, such as her necessity could affoord; confessing that
both their fortunes were hazarded vpon one chance. That
none should need to require helpe from her against the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:27506:81"/>
who, since such time that hee put on hatred against
<hi>England,</hi> and (vpon no other ground, then because his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
should encrease on the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide, as fast as her mercy did
on the other, in relieuing the distresses of her Neighbours)
neuer ceased either by Sea or Land, to infringe the greatnesse
of his power, or to bend it from it's proper and assigned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect:
euen that now all her thoughts haue beene euen bespo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be employed against him, and his Nauy; and that
therefore her excuse for not aiding him presently, stood war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
in Iustice, vnlesse that she should vncloath her own
Dominions of forces, to furnish her Neighbours. And by
reason that she had heard it whispered into a common talke
by the French, as that she doubted of the Kings constancy
in his friendship, or beheld his prosperous succeeding with
the eie of enuy or sorrow, she protested, that as such thoughts
should be vnworthy of the brest of a Prince, so were they of
hers, and were neuer harboured there.</p>
            <p>Besides this, she willed <hi>Edmonds</hi> to inculcate daily into
the Kings memory, that it is the part of a King sometimes
euen to thwart the resolution of his priuate brest, to giue some
publike satisfaction to the desires of the people; because the
<hi>goodwill of the people is the rocke of the Princes safety.</hi> And
that since he himselfe had wisely done so, for the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the loue of his people, he could not value her good will
by her outward performance, which she abstained from, for
the loue she bare to her people, to whose duty, loue, &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and valour, she accounted no ordinary blessing of God.
Their valour <hi>France</hi> it selfe could well testifie, where many
to get credit &amp; renowne, lost their liues: &amp; more would haue
lost them there, but that the dolefull cries of Mothers, the
grones of Kindreds, and the lamentations of young children,
mourning the losse of their Fathers before they knew them,
had interceded a little for them: and, but that the affaires of
warre at home, or at least, great rumour of warre had reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them to a longer time of execution. That if the King
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27506:81"/>
would weigh these things in an vnpartiall iudgement, she did
not doubt but he would be sufficiently contented with this
her answer, that he would stop vp the eares of those that for
the furtherance of the greater good of the common enemy,
had occupied all their endeauours to vnbinde their Peace.
That this is the principall endeauour of many, that by their
ill Offices they might rob the Prince of the good will of his
Subiects, and the hearts of his couragious Commons.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, the miseries of <hi>France</hi> multiplying

drawne from the actions of the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> who,
they said, did nothing but feed his eares with empty promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Some on the other side againe, busied all their inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to deterre him from it, especially <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Nauarre,</hi>
Sister to the King, the D. of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vmpton</hi> the Leager
there, obiecting incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that his hope of Peace with the
Spaniard would relie but vpon weake grounds, if he should
consider how long the Spaniard had de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ships lay there, and came about as spies for the English, and

            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:27506:85"/>
For all this, the Queene continued in the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
relying vpon the Oracles of her Lawyers and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
such as were these.</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat all contracts and agreements made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Prince and Prince,<note place="margin">Great deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about the matter.</note> are vnderstood to
be interpreted <hi>bonâ fide.</hi> Neither is a Prince
bound by any contract, when that contract on iust cause
occasions hurt to the Common-wealth. That the Peace
is not broken, when a Prince breaks the contract, when
he is occasioned to doe it, by cases of contingency, or
when the matter is come to a new case, which should
haue otherwise beene prouided for, if the said case had
beene thought vpon. That the Leagues and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Princes ought not to be occasions of cauilling,
neither ought they to be in vertue to those who breake
the couenants. That in case it turne to the damage
and preiudice of his Subiects, a Prince is not bound to
stand to couenants made; or if it but concerne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
of his owne estate. That all agreements, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be sworne to, yet are they to be vnderstood:
Things being in the same cases, as they then were, and
not altered, as they now are. That the obligation of a
Prince to the good of his Countrey &amp; Commonwealth,
is of greater force and vertue to binde him, then any
outward contract; <hi>vrging besides the authority of</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s proposed by the States to the Queene.</note> that the States fearing the anger of so
mighty a Princesse, propounded these conditions, which
they would oblige themselues vnto.</p>
            <p>First, That assoone as they could they would case the
Queene of all her charges for auxiliary forces of the English,
which came to forty thousand pounds a yeare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That within some yeares they would pay her
20000. pounds sterling, and helpe her with a certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ships.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That they would not enter into League with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
without her consent.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That after a Peace concluded, they would pay
her for foure yeares, euery yeare 100000. pounds. But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these conditions, that they may be permitted 4000.
Souldiers out of <hi>England,</hi> and all their debts raced out of her
her accounts. Humbly entreating her to admit of these
things, for the reasons fore-mentioned. Moreouer, they
protested their estates were built vpon very fickle foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that the people was euen astonished, at the rumour of
those forces the enemies keepe, that the Prouinces were at
discord about a rule concerning Lone-money, that the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
of them were at discord one against another: that many
had relapsed from the Religion which they lately professed
with them. That the Emperour by his Embassadours had
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27506:86"/>
entised the people to a peace; inasmuch, as that if this ten
yeares debt should be now rigorously exacted, it would iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be feared, that a sad Catastrophe, and lamentable period
would finish all the former endeauours of the confederate
Prouinces.</p>
            <p>And then the necessity and the mercy of the Queene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a new controuersie; for, although the proportion of her
necessity admitted not any excuse or delay of payment, yet
her mercy rests satisfied; for although she wanted monies,
she neuer wanted that. And indeed she was the willinger to
commiserate their necessities, for feare lest otherwise shee
should disioynt the Confederacie, bring them to dispaire, or
giue their enemies occasion of reioycing; onely vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
that they furnish thirty ships, and ioyne them with
her Nauy, which was a rigging for <hi>Spaine:</hi> and that they
pay the monethly payments awhile to the aux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the English. And so these matters of controuersie ended in
a quiet peace at this time.</p>
            <p>In the meane time there was sore complaints made to the

               <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Hans-townes to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour against the Queene.</note> and the States of the Empire by the

that their ancient priuiledges and customes granted by the

by the English: and that Monopolies were instituted in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

               <p>THat those antient Priuiledges by reason of

reasonable causes, were abrogated by the Court
of Parliament, in the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt; and
that from thence there is no appealing. One reason was,
that the said Priuiledges were not necessary for those
times, and that therefore they were quite inhibited by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27506:87"/>
Queene Mary. But yet that the Queene doth not
now desire an absolute annihilation of these the said
priuiledges, which indeed she could doe by the act of
Parliament; but had in the former yeares of her raigne
beene very indulgent to them, as the times then went,
till such time that they (hauing no regard of the
league and friendship) disturbed the English in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
neither giuing them any warning of their
the like vsage; and yet that for all this, she granted
to them the same order of negotiation and trade, as
the English vsed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they refused it, except they
might haue it by better right. That indeed this was
in custome nowhere, neither was it to be suffered, that
strangers should be preferred before home-bred Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
in the traffique for those things that are peculiar
to euery Region, which indeed they would challenge by
vertue of their Priuiledges. Besides this, that it could
in no case stand with the good of the Common-wealth,
if so be they should pay no more custome, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which

of, and being once abrogated vpon iust occasions,
should not be renued at any mans will or pleasure. Yet
notwithstanding, that she euen esteemed of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

no more custome for the carriage of Cloth hence, or the

promised the assistance of their vtmost helpe, for the defence
of the Roman Catholike religion; withall solemnly vowing
and protesting, that they would neuer enter into any peace
with the English, wherein besides all of the confederacy were
not also comprehended. Also a little after <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> when
<hi>Feagh Mac-Hugh</hi> came suppliant for the like pardon as <hi>Tir-Oen</hi>
had, incensed him to awaken that drowsie rebellion in
<hi>Leinster,</hi> which he did presently, for forthwith he seised vpon
the Fort ouer against <hi>Ballencure,</hi> demolished it, and still with
a continuall preying, runnes ouer all <hi>Leinster,</hi> although the
Lord Deputy followed close at the heeles. Besides this, hee

            <p>And these things he dealt vnder hand in and secretly, but

he murthered some priuily that were carrying,
and others that purueyed for wood. Nay, and he himselfe
so violently assaulted the Garrison, that thirty of them were
slaine. He sent forth <hi>Henry Oge-Man-Shan</hi> his sonne in Law,
to set fire on the Villages thereabouts, and to follow the prey

            <p>When the Deputy, and the rest of the Counsellours, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulated

English, that before by reason of the too-shallow depth

fire on their owne ships, that were now pittifully battered,
and rent, and most in them slaine, or else to thrust into shore.
Many of the fearefuller sort leapt into the Sea, willing to drowne themselues for feare of death; some whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
got to shore, others were taken, most of them drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

After, when more came forth, he commanded his forces to

and hauing entised the Spaniards vpon them a little, to
turne vpon them with all speed. Which indeed they did so
valiantly, that they put the Spaniard to flight, and so follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

for euery man, hauing gotten wealth and credit enough,
thought long till hee was at home againe: insomuch that
they would not allow him prouision for one moneth, nor
one ship, but vnwillingly droue him to leaue <hi>Cadiz.</hi> But

this, by much perswasion, he got euery man to testifie
his opinion in the matter with his owne hand, if perchance
the not doing of it should be obiected as a crime to any of

and left him with some few more behinde, who complained
much that there was nothing more done; obiecting to them
many errours in the Councell of warre, which they quickly
satisfied, thinking themselues masters of wealth and glory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that hauing giuen such damages to the Spaniard, they
returned safe with great spoiles, and not one ship lost or cast
away. If that there were any errour by reason of them, it
seemed onely to be so, because all things were not at ones
command. But the Admirall ioyned himselfe with the Earle
of <hi>Essex</hi> with good deliberation, that thereby he might well
temper his young heat and courage, and his desire of glory
with his mature moderation and well aduised resolution.</p>
            <p>Although out of this that haue beene already said, it doth
sufficiently appeare, how great glory and profit redoundeth
to the Queene and Kingdome by this expedition, and how
great damage to the Spaniard; yet it shall not seeme amisse
to reckon out of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his memoriall or Iournall
these things more amply.</p>
            <p>First, For the glory of the English, <hi>England</hi> expected
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27506:101"/>
not the Spaniard (that mighty puissant Prince) threatning
and preparing a most dreadfull warre against her:<note place="margin">How glorious this victory was to the English.</note> but chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
him in his owne dunghill, they dispersed and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
his so readily furnished Nauy, and the very greatest
ships among them; they brought home two great Galleons
in triumph; and with a few of their ships put to flight fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
Spanish Gallies. They set many English Gally-slaues
at liberty, and to the praise of the mercy of the Nation, let
goe many Spanish Captiues. They ouercame one of the best
fortified Cities of <hi>Spaine,</hi> almost as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oone as they saw it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
13. whole daies in the enemies ground.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">How profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> For the profit of the English: besides those
two great Galleons, to encrease the English Nauy, they took
100. great Brasse pieces of Ordnance, and many other spoiles:
both Souldiers and Marriners returned well fleshed with
spoile, to their better encouragement for the like expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">How h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtfull to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</note> For the losse of the Spaniard, He lost thirteene
of his best Men of warre, forty Merchants <hi>Indie</hi> ships, and
foure other for traffique; besides he lost great store of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
prouision both for ship and victuals, insomuch, that not
vnder a long time he seemed able to furnish another Nauy.
He lost all occasion of trading this yeare into <hi>Noua Hispania</hi>
in <hi>America.</hi> And which is a thing of no small moment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the English haue learned what an easie thing it is to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Spanish Sea coasts at any time.</p>
            <p>The Queene very courteously entertained them at their
comming home, and gaue peculiar thankes to euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
man of any note: but especially to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and
the Admirall, whom she highly magnified with her emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
prayses. When she had called to minde, whome of
these braue Souldiers she should make Gouernour of the
Hauen of <hi>Brill,</hi> which lay as a caution with her for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>States</hi> money, (for the Lord <hi>Sheffeld</hi> had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
resigned ouer his place) S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Vere</hi> Colonell
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27506:102"/>
of the English vnder the <hi>States,</hi> seemed worthiest thereof.
And although many of the Nobility stood for the same; nay
although <hi>Essex</hi> himselfe opposed him,<note place="margin">Sir Francis Vere made Gouernour of the Brill.</note> and most of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
thought the place more worthy of some nobler man;
The Queene that well knew his descent, (for hee was Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
to <hi>Iohn Vere</hi> the fifteenth Earle of <hi>Oxford)</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
found his valour and loyalty so well approued, in that
hee had vanquished the Spaniard at <hi>Rheinberg,</hi> that hee
had taken the Castles of <hi>Littenhouen</hi> and <hi>Buric,</hi> and that he
had recouered the Fort at <hi>Zutphen;</hi> after due deliberation,
not onely preferred him in the election before the rest, but
withall gaue him leaue to keepe his place still amongst the
<hi>States,</hi> which many others much desired; although she
could confesse, it was not very fitting to make one Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Towne of the <hi>States</hi> that was pawned to her for
the paiment of her money; who besides, was but an hyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the <hi>States</hi> for his pay. This the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> (who
had commended many to the Queene) tooke heinously, nay
very vntowardly, not hiding his anger from the simplest
iudgements; but worst of all, when in his absence S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Cecill</hi> was made Secretary, to which office hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ordained S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Bodley,</hi>

the peace of the Land,<note place="margin">Counterfeit Pursuivants and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> there was also a base sort of people,
that hauing taken vpon them the authority and badges of
the Queens Apparitors, wandred vp &amp; downe <hi>England,</hi> with
falsified Commissions, &amp; the hands of the Counsell, &amp; other
Delegates in Ecclesiastical causes, searching out all poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Papists houses: They took away almost by way of
robbery, al Vessels, Chains, Iewels, or any thing that bare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it the picture of Christ, or any of the Saints. They se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
exacted the allowance by the way due to Apparitors,
and cousened many poore silly fearefull people of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that they might not appeare before the Magistrates.
Some of these being taken, were compelled to restore againe
what they had thus robbed men of, and were set in the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory,
their eares clipped off, and branded in the forehead, as
cheaters and couseners. Yet for all this, this seuerity could
not keepe vnder this villany that had spred abroad, vntill
publique notice came, that Apparitors should not demand
their <hi>Viaticum</hi> before those that were cited did appeare, and
the Apparitors also with them, before the Magistrate; If that
many were cited by the same Commission, vpon one and
the same day, the Apparitors were also to be present; If that
any man that was cited suspected his Apparitor, hee might
warne him before the next Iustice of Peace, to be examined,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:27506:104"/>
that it may be knowne whether he be one or no. They who
were cited vnder paine of excommunication, were not to
bribe the Apparitor, that they might not appeare. Also,
that the Apparitors take no such bribe, vnlesse they would
lose their places, be imprisoned, and lyable to seuere punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>This yeare returned <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> of <hi>Wadour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell Count of the Sacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> whom
the Emperour created Earle of the Holy Empire, and all and
euery one of his Heires, his Posterity, and those that shall
descend from him, lawfully begotten of either sex, Earles and
Countesses of the Holy Empire; for because the Queene in
her Letters had commended him as her kinsman: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had deserued so great an honour in his braue beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
in the <hi>Hungary</hi> warre against the Turke. This title

those that thought that such rewards for valour were
to be allowed of, from what Prince soeuer they were besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
by reason that vertue growes lanke without her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of merit, vrging the example of <hi>Henry</hi> the third King
of <hi>England,</hi> who very thankfully acknowledged <hi>Reginald

did so congratulate <hi>Robert Curson,</hi> whom <hi>Maximilian</hi> the

his warlike valour, that he reckoned him amongst his Lords
of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and allowed him an annuall pension for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

maintenance of his dignity. Besides they vrged some
braue Scottish Souldiers, as of <hi>Archibald Duglasse</hi> of <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi>
who receiued the Title of Duke of <hi>Tours</hi> from the
French King: and of <hi>Iohn Steward,</hi> who was by the King
of <hi>France</hi> made Earle <hi>D' Euereux,</hi> &amp; that the Scottish kings
esteemed this as an honour to the Nation. But the Lords of
<hi>England</hi> imagining that this would bereaue them and their
Heires of some of their prerogatiues, if so be they and their
Heires were to giue place to such an vpstart Lord and his
Heires for euer, argued against it thus: that such Titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
are neither to be receiued by the Subiect,<note place="margin">Such honours not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> nor to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of by the Prince. That it is the property of the Prince
for to conferre honours vpon his owne Subiects, and not
for any Forreiner to doe it, according to the words of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
the Emperour.</p>
            <q>
               <p>LEt that be onely an Honour, which is bestowed by
our command.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Vrging, that there is a great detraction both from the
Maiesty of the Prince, and the dutie of the Subiect, if they
may be tolerated to receiue Dignities from Forreiners. For
there must needs be a secret allegiance betweene him that is
honoured, and the party honouring. That these kinde of
Titles are nothing else but a cunning sleight, to prefer men
out of the obedience to their Prince, to any strange Forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
That there may be an action of theft against him, that
shall brand another mans sheepe with his marke. Also that
there may be an action of cousenage and deceit against him,
that shall spread abroad fodder to entice another mans sheep
into his flocke. And although mighty Princes are not
bound to these Lawes, yet are they by the equity of these
Lawes, and the Law of Nature: As in the Citie and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth

of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> whosoeuer receiue a Spirituall digini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the Pope, or any Temporall one from any forreine
or strange Prince, is held suspected of his Loialty, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
from the vndertaking of any office publike. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the obiections they answered, that indeed it might
come to passe, that <hi>Henry</hi> the third, out of his simplicity and
the times iniquity, might allow of <hi>Reginald Mohune,</hi> thrust
into an Earledome by the Pope, when as his Father hauing
beene excommunicated, and threatned depriuation, was
compelled to acknowledge himself the tributary King of the
Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> and yet it appeareth vpon Acts and Records
of those times, that <hi>Mohune</hi> was not accounted as Earle of
<hi>Somerset.</hi> Concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, they made answer,
that he therefore accounted <hi>Curson</hi> as one of his Lords, that
he might obscure that shadowy title of Lord of the Holy
Empire; but withall obseruing, that hee allowed him no
voyce in Parliament. But as for the Scots, that it was no
wonder if they receiued and allowed of honour from the
French,<note place="margin">Counts and Vicounts such as some offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Court of Rome.</note> when they shew themselues to bee vnder the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of the French <hi>Floure-de-luce</hi> by their Kings armes, and
the <hi>Floure-de-luce</hi> therein. Many indeed esteemed an Earle
of the sacred Empire of no better ranke then a publike No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary:
as they esteemed all the Counts and Viscounts of the
Holy Palace at <hi>Lateran</hi> created by the Pope: or the Kings
Physitians, Lawyers, Grammarians, or Rhetoricians, who
hauing professed 20. yeares, boasted themselues with the

the <hi>Indy</hi> Nauy at <hi>Azores.</hi> After mature deliberation,
this was thought most expedient to be done. For so should
<hi>England</hi> rest in security: the Nauies of both the <hi>Indies</hi> being

might keepe the enemy in an expectation of his landing

in this voyage thwarted the English designes. And although
chances fall no where more then at Sea, yet these errours in
them seemed to be willingly committed, and the frustrated

for asmuch as you haue so often vsed the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

for one side to seaze and surprize all aide and succour

to the Law of Nations, which we not onely do, but euen
the Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> &amp; <hi>Sweden</hi> haue done the like, in

is not against the Law of Nations, since Nature her selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that liberty, that euery man should defend himselfe as

But concerning a peace with the Spaniard, who had first
brake it so treacherously, and especially to get it by a third
man, that should seeme to procure such a commodity for
her, she thought it not to stand with her honour, nor the
weale of her Kingdome: she for her owne part being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
so enuironed by the loyalty and valour of her owne
people, that she feared not any man. And last of all, would
she make a Peace, or trust to it made, since that he so malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
at this very time did so molest his confederate the
French King with a cruell warre?</p>
            <p>For the Spaniard had now by this time (vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Ferdinand Teglio</hi> a little Dwarfe,<note place="margin">The King of France re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth.</note> but of great skill

English to aide him from the Queene. Which indeed she
denied him not, vpon this condition, that he should giue
them pay, when as the Nauy sent out lately to the Islands,
and the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had much consumed her treasure.
The King solemnly protested that he was not able to pay:
and that he might obtaine them without pay, certifies the
Queene, that a most commodious peace was offered him by
the Popes Nuncio, with an absolute restitution of all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
taken in <hi>France</hi> besides <hi>Calis</hi> and <hi>Ardes,</hi> if so be he would
seperate himselfe from the Queene, and not haue League
with her: and that the French Nation beg'd for peace most
earnestly. The Queene made answere, that she could not
belieue that so great a Prince, conioyned to her by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and much benefited by her especiall good will, and but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:27506:115"/>
lately bound by an oath, would admit of such faire deceitfull
shewes, to draw him from the League made betweene them,
and the oaths and protestations made by either parties, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because she could not in this so great necessity helpe him,
as otherwise she would. And <hi>Anthony Mildmay</hi> the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
there, very earnestly (and not without offence to the
Kings eares) expostulated with him these things: a man
truely of an open heart, and a true Englishman, who very
often would accuse to their faces the French Counsellours
of tergiuersation, and too much inconstancy in their answers,
and lightnesse too, as if they onely mocked <hi>England.</hi> But
shortly afterwards, when some men shrewdly hallucina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the purpose of the Spaniard bended onely and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at this marke, that hauing broken the League betweene
the French and the Queene, and retaining <hi>Calis</hi> still in his
possession, he might the easier assault <hi>England</hi> from thence.
The Queene thought good to send him ouer aide, and to
pay the Souldiers her selfe, if so be he would onely warre in
<hi>Picardy</hi> or <hi>Britains,</hi> to remoue the Spaniard farther; if so be
he would ioyne greater forces to them, and allot the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
a place of retyring. For otherwise, by reason of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
loue towards her Nation, she would not send them
to be butchered by the cruelty of the Spaniard, onely for
the pleasure or benefit of the French. And besides, she lent
him great store of monies, for the which (and all his debts
besides) he pawned to her <hi>Calis,</hi> if so be the Queene at her
owne cost and charges within a set time recouered it; and
the better to recouer it, he allotted the English <hi>Boloigne</hi> for a
retyring place.</p>

                  </gap>.</note> which creeping on him very fast, excited
him continually to a desire of peace. For when experience
had well informed him, that his affaires consisted more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
then strength, and that all his wealth was not able to
represse the assaults of the English; that the warre in the
<hi>Low Countries</hi> was to be prosecuted, and that the places w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
he had taken in <hi>France</hi> were also to be defended, that he was
now in a good old age, and that his strength failed him, that
his Sonne was but of small age, and lesse experience of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
that the French were very famous for warlike exploits;
he thought it his best course (by the meanes of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who should be as an arbitratour betweene them) to
treate with the French King about peace, who indeed was as
desirous as himselfe of it; the Spaniard adiudging it better
to conclude his troubles in a well-setled peace, then to leaue
them all hereditary to his Son, whose yeres were too tender,
to goe through them with good successe. And truely this
peace was shortly made betweene them, as we shall speake of
in its proper place.</p>
            <p>Assoone as the first suspition of this vnperfect peace came
to the Queenes eares, she imagining that it was only the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to molest <hi>England</hi> and entrap it, strengthened her selfe
before hand, both with monies, which she almost lacked,
and the good will and loue of her people, which she much
encreased. For she called a Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi>

she made many very good and gracious Lawes acceptable

of the Common-wealth; to congratulate also the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of the Realme from the hands of bloudy enemies,
the defence and protection whereby <hi>Ireland</hi> was secured, the
aide and assistance which she vouchsafed both the States and
the French.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:27506:116"/>After this, that the Queene might the better be ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with store of money, the Clergy voluntarily granted

by the authority of the Parliament in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt his

inheritance that might fall to him by his Vnckle. Yet for
all this (although in the daies of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
condemned of treason) he was by the Queene restored
to his honour againe, as if so be he had neuer been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But, when as this Lord by the reason of the sentence
of the Parliament, could not enioy his Grandfathers honour,
by the especiall fauour of the Queene, he was a new created
Lord <hi>Da-la-ware,</hi> and as long as he liued he enioyed his
place according to the time of his creating. The Queene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
this matter to the Parliament-house; who hauing
found that the former sentence against the former Lord, was
onely personall, and not touching his progeny; and that his
banishment in the time of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> nothing hindered
him from losing that honour, which he had not, and that he
was restored againe shortly after; as also, that his ancient
honour is not extinguished by reason of a new creation, but
onely as it were lay asleepe, as long as he liued, when it was
not in him, in the time of his being created, they allotted
him the place of his Ancestors, betweene the Lord <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>

that he had determined not to prosecute the matter further,

them both for offence and defence. Wherefore he requested
that some might be sent ouer out of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Low

what reasonable conditions were proposed.</p>

               <p>THat although the Queene had vndertaken
and waged warre against the Spaniard,<note place="margin">The King of France speakes to them.</note> and
had had fortunate successe in the same; yet
for his owne part, although he was borne a Souldier,
yet being a King, and hauing people vnder him, hee
held it no point of Religion, to expose his faithfull
Subiects to the rage of warre, but rather a great sinne
and offence, out of an irreligious ambition, to refuss
Peace, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Cecill</hi> made answer, that the Queene was not so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
peace, as he might imagine, who now hauing suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
reuenged her selfe vpon her enemy, desires nothing
but quietly to maintaine the safety of her people, and her
own honour. And then (after that) he required to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
what condition of peace the Spaniard had proposed,
and what order should be taken with the state of the Low
Countries,<note place="margin">The reply of the King.</note> if they should not accept of it. The King in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
acknowledged, that indeed the Queene had endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged
the Spaniard much, but the Spaniard had as much
him; that yet now the Spaniard earnestly desired a peace,
and that thereupon he would also restore all places in <hi>France</hi>
that he had taken, euen <hi>Call is</hi> againe. Also assuring him,
that shortly he would bring the Spaniard to agreement both
with the Queene, and the States, solemnly and publikely
protesting, that it could not be if he should refuse this peace,
but <hi>France</hi> should wrap it self againe in the fire of ciuill
warre, by reason that he found the hearts of his people so
prone to a rebellion.</p>
            <p>Whilest these things are in hand, he being carefull of the
maine chance, secretly agreed vpon some things concerning
the peace with the Spaniard, dealing with <hi>Albert</hi> the Arch-Duke,
till such time that some authority were delegated from
<hi>Spaine,</hi> to the finishing and perfecting of the peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:27506:120"/>
This when the Queene certainly vnderstood, she began
somewhat to expostulate with the French King about it: but
he excused himselfe by reason of the delay the Queene vsed
in sending ouer,<note place="margin">Expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betweene the King and the Queene.</note> and by reason of the vrgency of his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the offered opportunity, which he could not neglect:
and so as it were hauing somewhat else to doe, hee referred
the matter wholly to his Counsell.</p>
            <p>And first of all <hi>Barneuelt</hi> layes open before them in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the affaires and estates of the Low Country,<note place="margin">Barneuelts Oration.</note> which
by the helpe of God, the fauour of the Queene, were now
growne to such a perfection, that they were not onely able
to defend themselues, but euen to aide <hi>France,</hi> if their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
should require their assistance. Then he shewes how
earnestly the French King desired a league with them, both
of Offence and Defence, which they agreed vnto, onely for
to pleasure the Queene, and for her sake, being certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that a generall peace would make all sure thence, not
so much as imagining that so great a King would once so
much as thinke of breaking it. After this, he largely dilated
vpon this, to shew how farre the Spaniards power to the
danger both of <hi>France</hi> and her Neighbours would extend,
if so be those confederate Prouinces that were rich both in
Armes and wealth, were subiect vnto him. Then hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales
to the Kings conscience (before God) whither or no
it were fit for a King to seperate himselfe from those, with
whom he had so firmely conioyned himselfe, they offering
him not the least occasion that was thereunto, and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reasons, whereby they could not haue peace with the
Spaniard, he concluded.</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat some Kings haue neglected their Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and Leagues, onely to encrease their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
but commonly with sad successe. For the
affaires of Kings, vnlesse they originally ground vpon
truth and faith, cannot well consist by power.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:27506:121"/>
And yet for all this, in the name of the States hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
that if so be the King would not hearken to the
peace, and would besiege <hi>Callis,</hi> that the States at their own
cost and charges would besiege another place, to distract and
seuer the enemies forces, and to giue pay to seuen thousand
Souldiers at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iege at <hi>Callis,</hi> and to furnish fiue and twenty
men of warre with all manner of prouision, vpon condition
that the king would allow to the siege three thousand Horse,
six thousand foot, and six peeces of Ordnance. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
of <hi>France</hi> indeed acknowledged these things to be
worthy of consideration, and to be signified to the King, and
he promised all his endeauours to hinder the proceedings of
the peace; and yet presently after hee made answer againe,
that this commodious peace, <hi>France</hi> being in such a fain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o

time in sending them ouer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither that she denied
their King her assistance, if so be he would haue employed it
against the common enemy to the commoditie of all the
Confederates. Hee shewed also that their necessity, which
they so much aggrauated beyond all beliefe, was not so great,
being that all <hi>France</hi> (excepct one or two Prouinces) was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Kings obedience. And concerning the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of opportunity they so often spake of, he said he would
not speake, especially to those that lesse esteeme of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27506:121"/>
But they not granting him so small a courtesie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee required
then to returne to the Kings memory, how deeply by vowes
&amp; oaths he had ingaged himselfe before the Earle of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
after the confirmation of the League, and before it, by
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etters, signed and subscribed by his own hand; withall,
he stuck not to say, that indeed the Queen neuer miscaried in
the performance of any of her Couenants, but that the King
had scarce kept any, producing thereupon the contents of the
Couenants. And then gently he put them in mind, that they
would take some order how the monies due to the Queene
might be repaied her, that had now bin taught by their King
hereafter better to looke to her own estate, &amp; not bestow her
benefits and good turnes so euilly, and on vngratefull men.
Yet, at length, with faire speeches they dismissed him, and
the King acknowledging the infinit courte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the hands of the Queene, promised that he would doe
any thing for her sake which lay in his power.</p>
            <p>These things the Queene tooke very scuruily at his hands,
and forthwith she sent Letters ouer to him, and Sir <hi>Thomas
Edmonds</hi> her French Secretary, whereby she gently and yet
freely admonishes him to remember his word and promise;
to consider a little his conscience towards God, and his good
report among the people; wishing him to take heed, that by

            <p>These things, although they were too true, yet the French

chiefe place were not granted to them; by reason that they
came to a towne of the French Kingdome; which they
would neuer haue done, had it not beene to shew their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruancy
and respect to the Bishop of Rome and the Legate
that represents him. At length the Popes Legates much
striuing in the matter, it was agreed vpon, that he should sit
at the vpper end of the board, and the Popes Nuncio should
sit by him on the right hand: then this choyce was giuen to
the French whither or no they would sit nearest the Nuncio
on the right hand, or the Legate on the left. The French
they chose the left, as nearest to the Legate. The Spanish
side willingly tooke the right hand, because they thought it
the best, and because the Nuncio was none of the number of
the Delegates: and thereby they thought they sufficiently
maintained the honour of their King. For if so be, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligarton,</hi>

which they haue receiued from the most Christian
King, they were onely stiled the Delegates for the Arch-Duke,
they said, they would willingly giue place to the
French. For the Spaniard prouidently carefull to maintaine
his owne honour, had resigned authority ouer to the Arch-Duke,
whereby he might delegate others for the matter;
that so the Spaniard himselfe might not immediately come to

               </gap>scend to a Treaty with
<hi>Spaine;</hi> if not, what they would bestow on the warre;
also, earnestly to deale with them to repay those monies, and
charges,<note place="margin">A discepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</note> which she had beene at for their sakes. And in the
meane time there was great disceptation in <hi>England,</hi> whither
or no, to conclude a peace with the Spaniard were commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
either to the Queene, or the Realme. They that were
desirous of peace vsed these and the like perswasions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:27506:123"/>
First, That a peace (besides that, that it is both pleasant
and holesome) would now take away that aspersion that is
cast vpon the English,<note place="margin">For peace.</note> as disturbers of the whole world, as if
so be that they thought themselues happy in other mens ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and secure by others dangers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Queene would be thereby more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from forreigne practises.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That an end of the cost and charges of warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Spaniard and Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Duke would be thereby
made.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> would soone be
lull'd asleepe, when they should once perceiue no helpe
would come to them out of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, That Traffiques would be better and oftner vsed
to the profit of Prince and people.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That <hi>Spaine,</hi> that lately was so fruitfull to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Merchants, would be open againe to them, where they
might exchange away Corne for Gold and Siluer.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, That thereby the Emperours Proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
English Merchants would be reuoked.</p>
            <p>Eightly, That the danger of tumults at home, and often
taxes, tributes, and pressing of Souldiers, would be thereby
taken away.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, That the League of <hi>Burgundy</hi> would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, That they need feare nothing then from the
French.</p>
            <p>Eleauenthly, That <hi>England</hi> might take breath thereby,
and heape wealth together against future fortunes.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, That thereby the credit and estimation of the
Queene would be well prouided for, in that she in <hi>An.</hi> 1585.
when the States offered her the dominion of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
publikely (and in print) protested, that by ayding the
Low Country-men, she meant nothing but their liberty, and
the peace and security of <hi>England.</hi> For, if so be that then it
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:27506:124"/>
seemed great wisedome (as the times then were) to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ist
them: and great equity to refuse the dominion and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so many Prouinces for the bearing of her charges in
the warre; certainly, now would it seeme great indiscretion
to pursue warre when that peace is offered on the one side by
the Spaniard, and nothing by them that so greatly desire the
warre.</p>
            <p>Besides, that these things ought to be considered, whither
or no <hi>England</hi> were of sufficiency enough to wage warre in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the Low Countries, and elsewhere against <hi>Spaine.</hi>
Then, whither or no, by this nourishing of a warre, there
would be hope of bringing the Spaniard to better and more
reasonable articles and conditions then now were proposed;
and that then it was most exactly to be considered, since
without doubt it was most conuenient for the English to
haue an offensiue warre (for woe to them that defend at
home) in what place they should haue it; whither or no, in
the Sea coasts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Portugall;</hi> and then, that indeed
the Townes therein might be taken and ransacked with easie
paines, but not be retained, but with great charges, and no
profit; or, then whither or no, in the <hi>Azores;</hi> and, that
then they truely might be brought vnder the Queenes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
to the Spaniards great losse for the time, but not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
therein without greater cost and charges; or, then whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no, in <hi>America;</hi> then, that there were ships euery
where ready furnished, and disposed about the Sea; that the
Sea coasts were better fortified with Garrisons then they
we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e wont to be, and that not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot of Gold, Siluer, Pearles,
or precious Stones, could be expected there, without great
danger; that those Regions are stuft with well fortified Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
euery one whereof would hold out a long siege; and
then, that the States were so weake for assistance, that with
the aide of <hi>England</hi> too they could onely wage a defensive
warre, till such time as the Spaniard turned from them to
<hi>France;</hi> lastly, that the old axiome of policy was not to be
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:27506:124"/>
neglected, <hi>Who are equally able to wage warre, let them make
peace; who are not, let them neuer.</hi> Then were produced the
sad examples of the Athenians, and others, that refused
peace when it was offered.</p>
            <p>Some added, but out of an ill will and hate to the men, that
the States, what colour soeuer and maske of defending liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Religion they put on, yet had they taken away the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of true Religion, by suffering any but the Romish. That
they did nothing but what they could to further and encrease
their own commodity, by imposing heauy tributes and toles
for prouision, by counterfeiting monies, by encreasing the
value of them at their pleasure, and many the like trickes,
whereby also, in this warre, they would cunningly nourish
it, and grow rich by it, when other Nations impouerish
themselues thereby. Besides, that by their Monopolies
granted, almost euery where, they haue spoiled the good vse
of Trading, that being Democraticall gouernours, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
hated Monarchies. That they had droue away all
of the Nobility from amongst them, besides one or two, that
stood them in steed in the warres; and, that most certainly
they intended nothing else, but (to an ill example against all
Princes) as the <hi>Switsers</hi> against the <hi>Habspurge</hi> Family, so
they against the Family of <hi>Austria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Against the peace.</note> that is the same. They
who were against the peace perswaded themselues with these
and the like arguments.</p>
            <p>First, That out of a peace the Spaniard would heape vp
to himselfe such infinite store of wealth, that if perchance he
should afterwards breake out into a warre, he would be too
strong for all his neighbours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That a true and solid peace cannot be had, but
by the dispensation of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> since the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
heretofore in 78. onely mocked them at <hi>Bourburgh,</hi> and
thought that no faith was to be kept with Hereticks and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Spaniard is of such a nature that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:27506:125"/>
can digest an offered iniury, but boyles continually for
a reuenge.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That thereby the Queene must forsake both
the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> and also lose all her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
laid out for their warres, except she would offer to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
those Townes that were pawned to her, into the hands
of the enemy, that the one would be a disgrace to her, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a dammage.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That the States being forsaken of the Queene, must
needs be reduced to the Spaniards gouernment, and that
thereby hee will be more apt and readie to inuade <hi>England;</hi>
also, that those Regions are the most fit places of warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Neighbour Kingdomes, for to constitute his Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
vniuersall Monarchy, that can be.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Grant that it is very hard to wage an offensiue war
in <hi>Holland,</hi> that it is dangerous and doubtfull at the Islands
<hi>Azores,</hi> that it is fruitlesse in the coasts fo <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi>
and that it is very chargeable in all, yet would warre
very compendiously and profitably be made in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
which being a vast Country is peopled by the Spaniard
so scarcely, and one place so farre off from another, that they
cannot possibly helpe one another. So that if so be a perfect
entire Armie of ten thousand English were sent out thither,
hauing all determination to inhabite there, vnder any expert
Commander, it could not be doubted, but that <hi>Carthageni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Castilla Aurea, Ciagre</hi> the Riuer, that is portable of little
Vessels as farre as <hi>Panama,</hi> and <hi>Panama</hi> it selfe, and <hi>Puert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Bella,</hi> would be all taken by assault, and consequently the
wealth which by these places is sent to <hi>Spaine</hi> from <hi>Peru,</hi> and
<hi>Castilla Aurea,</hi> would be surprized, or else detained there
still. That hereby the Spaniards traffique would be stop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and bard vp, and the Custome much diminished to the
great losse and dammage of the King, and that there is no
feare of the <hi>Americans,</hi> that are by nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lothfull, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
by reason of the pleasant aire, much lesse of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:27506:125"/>
that shall be sent thither, who being wearied with the
long voyage, and a diseased stomacke, will finde it a hard
matter to dislodge the old weather-beaten English out of
their well fortified Forts. That they need not also feare sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Victuals, or warlike Munition, which would be as
easily conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied out of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Spaine.</hi> For assoone as
once it shall be blazed about that they haue come to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
there, all kinde of people will flocke thither with neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
to trade with them, especially since those of <hi>Europe</hi>
haue nothing more greatly desired, then to haue their Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
free in <hi>America.</hi> And then, concerning the religion
of the States, and the Monopolies, they say, that they were
bare cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mnies of those that hated the reformed Religion;
affirming, that the States did liue very religiously in that
Christian liberty, as their Grandfathers haue done, and that
they beleeued all fundamentall points alike with the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches of all the Christian world; that for other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
matters there ought to be respect had to the time,
which might very well tolerate them, seeing that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church, the Tares were euen suffered to grow vp
with the Corne. Concerning other particular obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the States, they answered, that a particular offence
ought not to be made Epidemicall, and ascribed to the whole
Nation; and that there was wickednesse euen in the Angels
of God, and chiefest Apostles. Lastly, that we ought not to
enuy or speake ill of a Common-wealth, that is industrious
and sparing, if she haue that great happinesse, as to grow rich
by warre.</p>
            <p>They that were for the peace,<note place="margin">The reply for the peace.</note> endeuoured to refell these
arguments by these reasons, that the Queene also and States
might aswell heape riches by this peace, and as valiantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
themselues for Defence, as the Spaniard can for Offence.
That now they might looke for a true and solide peace from
him, who hauing sustained greater dammages, may now at
length learne how much hee is mistaken by pursuing his
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:27506:126"/>
warres in the administration of the Low Countrie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
That peace with the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and
the Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> the Spaniards Ancestors, was alwaies
very sound and solide, and if euer any was, healthfull to
<hi>England.</hi> Grant it, that the Spaniard treatied not for a peace
at <hi>Bourburgh,</hi> which would not seeme honourable for his
affaires; yet would it not hurt vs, although we are ready to
fight, to treate now about it. That peace was alwaies kept
with Heretiques by Popish Princes, excepting onely the
Pope, ancient examples sufficiently testifie; as of <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifth, and his successour in the Empire, who alwaies kept
their words with the excommunicated Protestants of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
although they esteemed them as Heretiques. Of
<hi>Francis</hi> the first King of <hi>France,</hi> who performed Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erall
rites for <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had beene excommunicated by the Pope. Also of
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth now King of <hi>France,</hi> who hauing beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to the Pope, and surnamed the eldest sonne of the
Church, and his dearest Sonne; yet he entred into both an
Offensiue and Defensiue League with the Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
That the Spaniards heat of reuenge will be quickly
cooled, when his strength and forces shall faile him. That
the Queene might iustly forsake the States, being she onely
bound her self to aide them till such times as the Spaniard
would propose equall conditions, and a reasonable peace for
their liberty; which conditons if they refuse, she is not
bound to aide them. That it is not fit for to giue to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
those Townes which are pawned to her, which they
in reason cannot require. And that once if there were a
peace concluded, there would be a speedy course taken for
recouery of her monies. That the States could not be so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
reduced vnder the Spaniard againe, being that in tract of
time many things fall out vnexpectedly; and if so be they
were peaceably reduced, they could take no better care for
themselues, then that, except they would resist their best
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27506:126"/>
commodity and profit. But howsoeuer, whatsoeuer became
of them, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> conioyned in a solide and
firme league, would easily poise <hi>Spaine</hi> between them. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they deriued their reasons for peace from the very Law
of Nature, which chiefly intends the conseruation of it selfe;
and from the Law of Nations, which commandeth the
highest Law to be the safety of the people; and lastly, from
the piety of true Christianity, that they might spare bloud,
and confirme the Christian affaires against the Infidels.</p>
            <p>The reasons for the warre against this peace, were dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
onely from humane policy, to driue away dangers far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off; which indeed were better to be left to Gods dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
who would direct their counsels and consultations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to the publike good, by meanes which might be vsed
with a good conscience, and not by warres, which are neuer
commendable, but when they are necessary. And thus haue
wee heard the matter on both sides largely enough dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burghley</hi> Lord Treasurer, weighing well what wee haue
said,<note place="margin">Burghley for the peace.</note> enclined to the peace, by reason he knew the hazard of
warre to be doubtfull, and yet of infinite charges, he knew
the Treasure of the Exchequer was much impaired; also,
that the disposition of the English were very prone to sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if so be they were once taxed a little more then ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
he knew also, the in-bred malic of the Commonalty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some of the Nobility, and the poore hopes that were
from <hi>Holland;</hi> that our Neighbours were suspitious to trust
to on euery side; and that our owne people were hardly
loyall enough at home; also, that the wealth of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
was inexhaustible; wherefore he concluded, that by this
warre there could redound nothing to <hi>England,</hi> but the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away of euill, which was but the smallest good that
could be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Essex</hi>
               <note place="margin">Essex against the peace.</note> on the other side, being bred vp in Military affaires,
not allowing talke of this peace, argues for the warre, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:27506:127"/>
vrging it, out of the cunning sleights of the Spaniard,
his desire of the vniuersall Monarchy, and his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eterate hate
against the Queene, and all <hi>England,</hi> the diuersitie of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Axiome, <hi>that Faith is not to be kept with
Heretiques,</hi> the power of the Pope to dispence with him, if
he breake the peace, with many the like reasons; insomuch
that <hi>Burghley</hi> said, he nothing but breathed warre, and out
of a strange presaging minde, giuing him the Psalme booke,
secretly light vpon this verse:</p>
            <p>Bloud-thirsty men shall not liue out halfe their daies.</p>
            <p>Yet were there many that honoured much the spirit of <hi>Essex,</hi>
as one that greatly aimed at the honour and securitie of his
Country. But on the other side, many also that whispered
it to be for nothing but to fulfill his ambition, and serue his
owne turne. But <hi>Essex</hi>

when he could not effect, or perswade the Queene to, being

contempt, he turnes his backe to the Queene, in a manner
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:27506:127"/>
scoffing at her. The Queene growne very impatient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,

that he would not put vp so great an indignity, nay that he
could not, euen at <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> hand, &amp; forthwith in a chafe
flew from the Court. And afterwards being admonished by
the Lord Keeper of the great Seale, in very graue Letters,
that he would supplicate to the Queenes mercie, and giue
place to time: that he would remember that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> That
<hi>if the Law punish a man iustly, he must giue way to Iustice; if
vniustly, he must giue way to his Fortune.</hi> That if hee had
iustly done wrong to his Prince, he could not giue her any

that both his discretion, duety, and religion would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

of <hi>England;</hi> who being sorely troubled with griefe of

earnestly beseeching her, that he might lay aside the burthen
of his Offices. The Queene presently vpon it came and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, and comforted him very much: but within few
daies after, hauing liued long enough to Nature, and famous
enough to Glory, but onely not long enough to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he so quietly gaue vp the ghost, that his greatest enemy
could confesse, that he hated nothing more, or enuied any
thing like to such a death in so great honour, seeing that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
the ends and Catastrophes of the Administratours
of such great affaires as he did, are both sad, and sometimes
sodaine.</p>
            <p>Certainly he was an excellent man, whom (besides his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
countenance, and comely visage) nature made, and
learning perfected to a great fame of honesty, grauity, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,

well-spoken man in his curious language; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:27506:128"/>
was any way affected, but plaine and easie. His wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was strengthened by long experience, and seasoned
with great moderation. His faith and loyalty well approued,
and his religious piety aboue all, most to be commended. To
speake all in a word, the Queene was most happy in such a

for euer.<note place="margin">His Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> If at any time it shall concerne posterity to know
his birth, he was borne at <hi>Burne</hi> in <hi>Lincolne</hi> shire in 1521.
His Father was <hi>Richard Cecill</hi> Master of the Wardrope to

Afterwards,<note place="margin">Secretary to K. Edward.</note> he became Secretary to <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, and
by him knighted. He found some fauour with Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but greater with Cardinall <hi>Poole, Tunstall,</hi> and <hi>William
Petra,</hi> for his wisedome: the resson of his fauour with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
was in that, (although he with the rest subscribed) hee
most opposed that counterfeited pretence to <hi>Edwards</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whereby both <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were excluded

the good of his Friends, Kindred, and followers, without
any iniuries, that the Queene admiring his discretion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the gouernment of all vnto him in a manner. But, as
his power and fauour with the Queene encreased with him,
so did hatred and enuy in many of the Nobility against him;

hauing well approued his wisdome and loialty this thirteen
yeares, bestowed on him the title of Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> and
Lord high Treasurer of <hi>England.</hi> In which Office, alwaies
hating those base trickes of heaping money together, as hee
encreased the publike good, so also his own priuate estate by
his paines and parsimonie. He was very vnwilling to haue
any thing spent, vnlesse for the honour of the Queene, the
defence of the Kingdome, or the aide of our Neighbours.
He narrowly looked into, although not with the eies of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
yet of equity, the affaires of the Custome-house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the
Tole takers that belong thereto. He would professe that hee
neuer liked that the Exchequer should like the Spleene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
continually, and the rest of the members wither and
fade away: and truely, hee strongly endeuoured that the
Prince might not grow rich by the peoples misery of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that both the one and the other might want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Hee would often say, that nothing was profitable
to the Prince, that was not honourable for her also to
doe: and hereupon he would not suffer the Reuenews of her
Lands to be encreased, or the old Tenants remoued, or Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
put out. As for his priuate estate, he so well managed
it, that neither he euer went to Law with any man, or any
man with him. Of his former wife <hi>Mary Cheeke</hi> begot hee
<hi>Thomas</hi> now Earle of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Issue.</note> very fruitfull in his issue. Of

his successour in the greatest Offices of the Kingdome,
with the like happinesse: besides two Daughters that died
before himself, <hi>Anne</hi> Countesse of <hi>Oxford</hi> (who had three

that died without issue. The Ouerseers of his Will,
were <hi>Gabriel Goodman,</hi> Deane of <hi>Westminster,</hi> an vpright
man, and <hi>Thomas Bellot</hi> Steward of his Houshold, to whom
he left great summes of money to be bestowed vpon pious
vses, which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Although the earnest desire which <hi>Burghely</hi> had of peace,
effected not the same, yet it greatly eased the costs &amp; charges

by the Queene.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">A new a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the States.</note> That the League made in 1585. except onely some
Articles concerning the administration of their Kingdome,
should be still in force and vertue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the States of the vnited Prouinces should
pay the Queene 800000. pounds of good money of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
viz.</hi> as long as the warre lasted against the common
enemy 30. thousand pounds yearely, till such time as they
had payd 400. thousand pounds. But if so be the peace
were concluded by the Queene and Spaniard, of that which
remained they should pay twenty thousand pounds a yeare,
till they had payd eight hundred thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the States should pay one thousand, one
hundred and fifty English men at Garison in <hi>Flushing, Brill,</hi>
and the adioyning Forts thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:27506:130"/>
Fourthly, That they should presse English Souldiers
vnder English Leaders, which they should giue pay to.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, If it should chance that the Spaniard should inuade
<hi>England,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Wight, Garnsey, Iarsey,</hi> or the <hi>Sillin</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
that the States should aide <hi>England</hi> with fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

            <p>Sixtly, That if so be <hi>England</hi> furnished a Nauie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

As also, if that any forces of the English were sent ouer

            <p>Lastly, That for the monies that are due to <hi>Pallauicine,</hi>
from the Queene, which she borrowed for them, the Queene
should write to the Prouinces of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
the rest that are out of the Leagues.</p>
            <p>By these Couenants was the Queene eased of infinite char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
who euery yeare was at more or lesse then twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

of by the discretion of <hi>Burghley,</hi> and the care of Sir <hi>Thomas

for the States:<note place="margin">Bodleyes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</note> For <hi>Bodley</hi> being now eased of these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
affaires, wholly commended himselfe to the care &amp;
prouision for good learning, worthy indeed the care of the
greatest King; for he began to restore the publike Library at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> first instituted by <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester;</hi> but
afterwards, in the daies of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, rob'd of all the
Bookes almost. This Library hee hauing bought with his
money, and other mens beneuolence, the choicest Bookes
that were, so furnished it with them; and dying, left such
reuenewes to it, that he is worthy to be celebrated eternally,
and liue as long as Learning.</p>
            <p>Whilest these businesses are in hand betweene <hi>England</hi>
and the States, the Queene sends into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Zouch,</hi> and <hi>Christopher Perkins,</hi> to congratulate with him,
his marriage with the Daughter of the Prince Elector of

            <p>And about this time also <hi>Philip</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> made
sure his Daughter <hi>Isabell</hi> to <hi>Albert</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Austria,</hi>
and with her as a Dowry, he bequeathed to him the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Low Countries, and the County of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
Whereupon the Cardinall, hauing duely sent backe to <hi>Rome</hi>
his Cardinals Cap, and his consecrated Sword being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the Pope, he makes haste into <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the meane time the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> aboue seuenty
yeares of age,<note place="margin">Philip King of Spaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty first yeare of his age.</note> in September departed this troublesome life,
with great patience. A Prince he was certainly, whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
extended so farre and neere, beyond all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
that he might truely say in his Motto, <hi>Sol mihi sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
lucet,</hi> the Sunne, &amp;c. he atchieued great wisedome from
his fathers counsell, which he improued with long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the affaires of this world: but commonly, as hee
mannaged many warres, so was he vnfortunate in most of
them, for the most part, by reason that he himselfe being of a
milde weake nature, was gouerned by others wary counsels,
and his warres followed by them, and not by himselfe.
Whereupon it came to passe that the three keyes of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Empire<note place="margin">The three keyes of the Spanish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> (which his Father so called, and willed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Flushing</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Gadez</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> were negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
The first taken in by the Turkes, the second by the
Low Country confederates of the vnited Prouinces, and
the third much impaired, and its strength much impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by the courage of the English; not so much to the losse,
as disgrace of so great a King: which it is likely his Father
foreseeing in his life time, is reported to haue admonished
him to make peace with the English, and the States of the
Low Countries.</p>

souldiers at Garison, besides the Townesmen. And here the
Earle determined to seat all his warre, by reason that it was
such a fit place, that it was called by the Spaniard the Key
of <hi>America:</hi> wherefore he remooued all the Inhabitants,
although for ransome of that place, they offered great store
of Merchandise, and Gold, and Siluer. But the bloudy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and the griping in the belly did so rage amongst the English,
that in forty dayes (for so long he continued there) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed

to returne home againe, with great spoiles, but greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
yet in his spoiles hauing some threescore peeces of
Ordnance of Brasse. Certainly, this voyage was occasion of
great dammage done to the Spaniard, by reason that this
yeare neither the Carackes set forth for the East <hi>Indie,</hi> nor
the American Nauy returned home to <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time also <hi>Edward Squire</hi> was called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
a base fellow, and one that had beene a common base
Scriuener: afterwards hauing gotten some office in the

by the Spaniard, hee was carried into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there at
last came vnto the knowledge of <hi>Walpole</hi> an English Iesuite;
he quickly caused him to be brought into the Inquisition, as
one that was an Hereticke: and at length, by continuance
of punishments, drew the fellow to the faith of the Romish
religion. Afterwards he dealt with him to try if that hee
would dare to doe any thing for his Religions sake, that he
might be sure hee truely professed it: and afterwards, after
many courses of words, (as <hi>Squire</hi> himselfe confessed) hee
taught him indeed, that to take the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> away, was
a meritorious act, but that it was farre more necessary to take
away the Queenes life. Then he shewed what an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was, and as well done as conceiued, &amp; as free from sin
in doing, so from danger after it is done, if it were, but by
besmearing the pummell of the Queenes Saddle with poyson,
where she should lay her hand when she takes horse.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Squire</hi> hauing condiscended to this villany, the
Iesuite bound him by diuers solemne vowes, vnder paine of
damnation to keepe it secretly, and to doe it. So that <hi>Squire</hi>

the Queenes pummell of her Saddle with poyson,
seeming to do somewhat else, and praying with a lowd voice
for good successe: but by Gods mercy the poyson lost his
nature, as well as <hi>Squire</hi> his loyalty, and had no power to
hurt the Queene.</p>
            <p>After all this he went for a Souldier with the Earle of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>
to the Island of <hi>Azores,</hi> and went with him in the same

            <p>The first whereof was <hi>Thomas Stapleton</hi> Doctour of

into the Low Countries, where by his publike Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and his printed workes, hee at last grew very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>The second was <hi>Richard Cosin</hi> a <hi>Cambridge</hi> man,<note place="margin">Of Ri. Cosin.</note> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour

            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:27506:134"/>
The third was <hi>Edmund Spencer,</hi>

a Scholler of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who was borne to so great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of the Muses, that hee surpassed all our Poets, euen
<hi>Chawcer</hi> himselfe his fellow Citizen. But labouring with
the peculiar destiny of Poets, pouerty; (although hee
were Secretary to <hi>Grey</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland)</hi> for there
hauing scarse time or leisure to write or pen any thing,
hee was cast forth of doores by the Rebels, and robbed
of his goods, and sent ouer very poore into <hi>England,</hi>
where presently after hee dyed; and was buried at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
neere <hi>Chawcer,</hi> at the charges of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi>
all Poets carrying his body to Church, and casting their
dolefull Verses, and Pens too, into his graue.</p>
            <p>Now all this yeare the rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> continued
very hot on foot still, for <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> had got his pardon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great Seale of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which hee so dissembling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implored at the hands of <hi>Ormond</hi> the Lieutenant: yet
on a sodaine dared hee to girt <hi>Black-water</hi> with a strong
siege.<note place="margin">The Fort of Black-water besieged.</note> To remoue this siege, the Lieutenant Generall of
the Irish forces (for as yet there was no Lord Deputy)
sends forth his choycest bands; to wit, thirteene Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men of Armes, vnder so many Ensignes, all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Henry Bagnall</hi> the Marshall, a bitter enemy of <hi>Tir-Oen.</hi>
The fourteenth day of August they marched from
their Campes neere <hi>Armagh,</hi> in a threefold battalion. The
first the Marshall <hi>Bagnall</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi> led, <hi>Cosby</hi> and <hi>Thomas
Mary-Wingfield</hi>
led the middle, and <hi>Cuine</hi> and <hi>Billings</hi> the
last. <hi>Calisthenes Brooke, Charles Montacute,</hi> and <hi>Flemmings</hi>
were leaders of the Horse.</p>
            <p>They scarce marched a mile, but too much seuered from
themselues by reason of the swelling vp of some hils in
their way; there being nothing but a plashie plaine of one
side,<note place="margin">The English come by the worst.</note> and woods on the other; but I say, <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> being
vehemently incensed with hatred against the Marshall,
brake in vpon the first Squadron, with all his force and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27506:134"/>
might, and presently hauing slaine him amongst the thickest
crowde, put all his troupes out of order with the multitude
of his forces, whilest the rest of the English, by reason of the
hill between them, scarce saw any such matter: &amp; at the very
same time the powder hauing by some strange chance taken
fire, blew vp many of them, and maimed more. Afterwards
<hi>Cosby</hi> being sent to recollect the remnant of the dispersed
Squadron, had a great ouerthrow. But <hi>Montacute</hi> (although
not without great danger) reduced them to an order. <hi>Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
in the last Squadron, failing of powder, returned to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi>
againe. And <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> got thus a pleasant victory of
the English, and a more pleasant triumph ouer his enemy.
And certainly, the English receiued not a greater slaughter
then this, since the time that they first set foot in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
lost 13. stout and valiant Leaders, and 150. common
Souldiers, that being put shamefully to flight, were slaine
vp and downe about the fields. They that remained aliue,
were opprobriously blamed, not their sluggishnes, but their
Captaines vnskilfulnesse; neither was their complaint of
that altogether friuolous, for it was no great discretion in any
Captaine, to march so disioyntedly one company from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
against such barbarous people, who alwaies being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
together, are more beholding to their rude violence for
their good fortune, then any policy or discretion.</p>
            <p>Not long after this slaughter of the English,<note place="margin">The Fort yeelded vp.</note> followed the
yeelding of <hi>Black-water</hi> Fort to the Rebels, the men that lay
in Garrison keeping both their loyalty and their Armes still,
till such time that there was no hope of any succour.</p>
            <p>This victory got great glory to the cause of the Rebels,
and this Fort of especiall vse; for from hence they furnished
themselues with all kinde of prouision of Armes; and now
<hi>Tir-Oen</hi> vnder the name of the Authour of their liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatly swolne with pride thereof, grew more fierce then
before; insomuch that all <hi>Mounster</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mounster re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolts.</note> reuolted from the
Queene; and yet not so much out of this prosperous successe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27506:135"/>
               <note place="margin">1599</note> of the Rebels, as out of their hatred towards the English vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers,
and Farmers, who were brought into the lands
and possessions of <hi>Desmond,</hi> that fell to the Queene after his
rebellion: and partly also, out of hope of Protections if their
purposes failed. For now there had beene a most detestable
custome very rife in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby Rebels, and the like
malefactors,<note place="margin">Protections hurtfull to the common-wealth.</note> purchased, with monies that they had got by
preying and robbing, their Protection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> the better to keepe on foot and nourish this new
Reuolt in <hi>Mounster,</hi> sends thither, <hi>Ouny-Mac-Rory, O-go-More,</hi>
and <hi>Tirill;</hi> who though he were an Englishman ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,
yet he was a great enemy to the very English name,
and with them he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strong enough to encounter them. But when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that the very Irish that marched vnder his banner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to thinke of reuolting from him, and that the new Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
that came out of <hi>England,</hi> could not furnish him with
aboue two hundred, and those vnweaponed, hauing disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Forces, he betakes himselfe to <hi>Corke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rebels all this while hauing their number en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased

which they could not haue done, if so be that they that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
those grounds had sent out their Farmers furnished and
in that number, as by their Couenants they ought to haue
done. The pride and vaine-glory of the Rebels thriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with their good successes, brought them to such a passe,
that they themselues declared, that <hi>Iames Fitz. Thomas</hi> one

his dissembling was so palpable, that he sent both Letters

Neither were they contented to extoll the glorie of his
pedegree; but also euerie one exceedingly praised in him,
Religion, Valour, and Wisdome. These things, some in the
Court, that desired his roome more then his company, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated
so much, that they put spurres to him that run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
propounding vnto him glory for euer with posteritie,
and the loue and good will of the present commonaltie. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring
him for the great and euerlasting good of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
to take this hard taske vpon him; promising to
him very largely all their endeauours, and the vtmost of their
good wills. Others, a more craftie kind of his enemies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of friendship, by greatly extolling him, and
raising vp great expectation of him, did the more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as more secretly, practise their old hatred and enuy against
him: well knowing, that the fiercenesse of his youth, would
quickly runne it selfe to destruction; and considering that
there was to shew no better way of quite ouerthrowing his
great popularitie, and loue of the people, then by putting
him vpon a businesse, which hee would not be able to goe
through withall. Indeed, what need many words? Hee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man of a most perspicuous, and quicksighted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,
yet either perceiued it not, or would not. For first, in

This power with great importunitie, he obtained for
himselfe, although that this the said power in all the other

            <p>His armie was allotted him,<note place="margin">His Army is allotted.</note> as much as he would desire:
neither euer saw <hi>Ireland</hi> a greater. 16000. Foot, 1300 Horse;
which number afterwards in all was compleat 20000. And,
to see the secret working of malice, there was nothing that
the Earle desired, but the officious, and more treacherous
industry of his aduersaries quickely obtained it for him. And
the better to intangle him vnawares in vnknowne nots, they
laid spies round about him, that should take notice of his
doings, obserue his sayings, and alwayes make the worst of
either. In his Commission<note place="margin">His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</note> hee had authoritie (for I omit

and bend all his forces only against <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> and as soone as
hee could possible, for to oppresse him with the garisons at

wont to hold very necessary to bee done; heretofore
obiecting it as a great fault in the former Deputies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the warre by often parlies and colloquies.<note place="margin">The Earle of Essex goes into Ireland.</note>

intended the good of their priuate affaires, hee neglects the

and which was a famous receptacle to the Rebels. He spread
farre the terror of his comming, by driuing away great store
of the cattell; &amp; scattering the rebels out into the woods and
forrests thereabouts. Neither returned till towards the latter
end of Iuly, many of the Souldiers diminished, and all sorely
wearied; and he himselfe very much angred, that the Queen,
hauing fed his credulous hopes with expectation of it, had
now made Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> Master of the Wards. The Queen
taking this lossefull voyage very ill at his hands, vrged him

            <p>But returned againe, he found his armie so diminished, that

more supply from <hi>England</hi> against his voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

wearied them sorely, and finding a great want of powder,
commandeth them to come ouer the <hi>Cunlew</hi> mountaines;

notwithstanding kept not far off, but vnderstanding that

of their faintnesse in the tedious way and vnequalitie of

            <p>In the meane time the supply of Souldiers in <hi>England,</hi> that

that he could doe this yeere would be with 1300. Foot, and

grant vnto him, that he, in all obseruancie, neere vnto <hi>Balla

and not many words being on all sides spent, it pleased
them that the next day there should be some delegated, that
should treat concerning a peace.<note place="margin">A truce made for sixe weekes.</note> Amongst those delegates
it was agreed vpon that there should be a truce from that

they might haue leaue and libertie to renue the warre
againe. And if so be any of the Earle <hi>Tir-Oens</hi> confederates

               <hi>Henry Cuffe</hi> brings those

sent her word that he could doe nothing, this yeare; she was
greatly moued thereat, accusing all his consultations and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

not to say but vpon what iealous suspition I know not, to
some there, that he endeauoured in <hi>Ireland</hi> some what more
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:27506:139"/>
then the good of his Prince and Countrey. Neither would
she recall her opinion after great perswasion, alwayes estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it the greatest folly that can be, to stirre vp one that
is ready armed, whom once he had stirred before, and since
armed.<note place="margin">She writes backe to him.</note> But yet she sent her letters backe to him and the
Counsellours of <hi>Ireland:</hi> wherein she expressed her great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
that the Deputie should lose so much time, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all kind of occasions of delay, that he should spoyle
many faire opportunities of good successe against the Rebels,
when as he himselfe in <hi>England</hi> thought nothing fitter, then
onely to prosecute and pursue <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> which also in his
letters since he had largely promised. She also expostulated
with him about his expedition into <hi>Mounster</hi> and <hi>Affalle,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his own sober iudgement, and against her knowledge;
for had he made her acquainted with his intent, she would
haue hindred that hurtfull expedition. If now the army be
weake and feeble, why did he not follow the enemy when it
was not so? If the Spring time were not fit for his warre in
<hi>Vlster,</hi> why did he neglect the Summer and Autumne? was
not any time fitting enough for that warre? she did now
well see that <hi>England</hi> must be consumed more then needs,
and by this vnhappy successe suffer the note of infamy of all
forraine nations; Nay, that they, that hereafter shall write the
History of these times will instruct posteritie, that she neuer
did any thing in the preseruing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he neuer
omitted any thing that might tend to the losse of it, except
he would take some better order with his warres. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she admonished both him and the Councell, that with
better aduice they would prouide for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

            <p>The Deputy being much mooued with these letters, and
discontented that among other things, the Queene had chid
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:27506:140"/>
him too, that hee remooued not the Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi>
from his office which he lately bestowed vpon him, (for the

her knowledge as the Nobles vse not to doe, he had marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Elizabeth Vernon,</hi> borne of the Aunt of the Earle of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>
secretly.) But most of all being discontented at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
of his enemie <hi>Cecil,</hi> to his place of the Master of the

stormes of melancholy;<note place="margin">He plots se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to take some indirect course.</note> he secretly thought some vndirect

would easily and quickely flocke vnto him. But <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> that had married his
mother, frighted him from this dangerous, wicked, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enterprize. Whither or no the Queene had inckling of
this matter, I know not; but at the very same time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of vncertaine rumours of a Spanish inuasion that was
willingly beleeued,<note place="margin">An army of 6000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> choice footmen mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered in London.</note> there was mustred vp 6000. of the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest

whereof lay at watch and ward about the Queene; the rest
commanded to be in readinesse vpon any occasion: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these, a great number was also mustered out of all the

others, who at his arriuall in <hi>England,</hi> went away seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
wayes. <hi>Essex</hi> accompanied onely with sixe, comes to
<hi>None-Such</hi> where the Queene then lay, to enforme her of
the affaires of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In his way, the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi>
one of his greatest enemies ouer rode him, and not once sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
or spake to him. The Earle fearing lest he should doe
him hurt at the Court, and Sir <hi>Thomas Gerard</hi> ouertaking
him, and, although in vaine, requesting him that hee would
doe him no ill office there; <hi>Christopher S. Larence</hi> offered
his seruice to the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> to kill the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> in the
way,<note place="margin">He comes and kneeles before the Queene.</note> and the Secretary at the Court. But the Earle, hating
such wickednesse from his heart, would not yeeld thereto;
but made such hast to the Court, that on the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he came and fell on his knees before the Queene, that
not so much as thought of him, as shee was in the Priuie
chamber. The Queene entertained him with a short speech,
but not with that fauour she was wont; and bid him go to his
chamber and continue there. For now to his other offences
he added this, that without her leaue, or against her will he
had left <hi>Ireland;</hi> and for that he had made such a truce, that
euery fourteene dayes was violable, when as it had beene in
his power, by his authoritie, to haue ended the matters with
the Rebels, and pardoned their treasons. Being asked of the
Councell, why he made such couenants with <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> hee
answered, That <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> being potent, proudly refused any
conditions almost, except hee would forgiue all the Rebels
too in <hi>Ireland:</hi> except the Irish should be restored into their
possession which the English had, and except the Romish
religion might bee with libertie professed through all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But when as these things were adiudged by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
uery heinous, and then his returne into <hi>England</hi> againe,
especially with such company as he did, grew also somewhat
suspicious; and the more, being aggrauated by the varietie
of plots laid by his potent aduersaries: the Queene thought
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:27506:141"/>
it fit to confine him to some custodie, but yet not to any
prison,<note place="margin">He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody.</note> lest she might seeme thereby to cut off all her former
fauours towards him; but she confined him to the Lord
Keepers house, that so, not being at libertie he might not be
led away with euill counsell. The Earle tooke it very vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that both his and his friends returne should be so miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
to a suspition of ill; For I haue seene his owne hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
wherein in a very faire method, he digested and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
together whatsoeuer he did thinke would be obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. To wit,<note place="margin">He remoues the suspitions conceiued by his returne.</note> that first neglecting his instruction, he
delayed his expedition into <hi>Vlster,</hi> by losing fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
both wasting and wearing the Queenes Forces else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
Secondly, that he had made couenants, and a truce
most beneficiall to the Rebels. Lastly, that the affaires in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being not set in good order, that contemning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
of the Queene, hee had left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and returned
with so many warlike men. To these things hee adioyned
this answere:</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Before I left Ireland, set all things in that order,
as now they are; that there hath beene no hurt
done these nine moneths. That there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why his companions that came with him should be
suspected; they being few, and hauing good occasions
of their returne; and that no more then sixe accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him to the Court. What hurt could hee doe with
so small a company? It had beene an easie matter for
him to haue thought or done any hurt when he had the
armie and all Ireland at his command. If he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of reuenge, that he needed not any others helpe.
For he is quickely master of anothers life, that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner
of his own. But I knew (saith he) who said to me,
Vengeance is mine, and I, &amp;c. Shall so great a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
fall vpon mee, that my returne should be suspected,
who haue worne away my body in my Princes seruice,

of the warre. And that the occasion of his renewing the
warre was very iust, by reason he vnderstood that <hi>Essex</hi> the
Deputie, in whom hee had reposed the trust of his life and

hauing assembled a tumultuary Band, (for his selected

            <p>The Deputie returning againe to <hi>Dublin,</hi> bent him onely

would arise a contention, or question about prioritie of place
in sitting or going betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> some men
were selected that should make enquiry into that matter.
They obserued out of the booke of Ceremonies of the

               <note place="margin">Obseruations of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land &amp; Spain</note> (which as the Canons say, like a Ladie,

Title the Spaniard preferreth before all his other to bee the
King of, is but lately a Monarchie in respect of <hi>England:</hi>
and that it had neither Earles nor Kings, before the yeere of
Grace, 1017. and that those Kings are not anointed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
they found that the King of <hi>England,</hi> is reckoned the
third amongst those Kings that are titled, Most Illustrious,
and the Spaniard is reckoned the fourth. Also that Pope
<hi>Iulius</hi> the third, Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> gaue sentence for <hi>Henry</hi> the

that the Queene of <hi>England</hi> is more ancient both in yeeres

reckoned as constituted and so ordained by Right.</p>
            <p>Besides they obserued, that in the first Session of the

tooke place of the French, by reason of the Emperors
right; that, since the Spaniards haue arrogated to themselues
the prioritie, not onely by the vertue of the Emperour, but
as they are Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> because none euer contradicted
it. And at that time, the English found great want of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the French Embassadour, because hee contradicted
them not, and made no publike contesting with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Legate, if so be he had made, as he tooke place of him
in right of the Spaniard and not the Emperour. Besides they
noted, that the Spaniard by reason of his large &amp; vast domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
spread far and neere, by reason of his power ouer other
Princes, and his Merits from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom
hee well deserues, and by reason of prioritie before the

Queenes honour, safetie, and profit. As concerning the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
that in no case they giue the more Honourable place
to the Spaniard, but directly, modestly, and from the foresaid
arguments challenge it themselues. If so bee the Spaniard
would not condescend, that then the English should not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
preferre Honour before Profit, but propose some
meane and equall debatement; as this, to cast lots for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie
of going or sitting first. Then, as concerning the safety
and profit of <hi>England</hi> and the Queen, that they should haue
a care that no cosenage or deceit be put vpon <hi>England,</hi> or the
Low-countries in their trafficks. That the English may haue
libertie to trade at the <hi>Indies;</hi> by reason that was granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Treatie 1541. in all the dominions of <hi>Charles</hi> the
fift; but especially in those places where the Spaniards are
themselues seated and peopled; also to trade with all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Princes that are vnder the Spaniards gouernment. That
first the Spaniard should propound their Conditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they inuited the English thither to a Treatie. That
they should not speake a word of the Rebels and Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes,
(who according to the ancient Leagues made with
the Burgundians, were to be driuen out on both sides; and
restored againe to those with the French.) But if so be, they
should propose that, that they should tell them that there
are no Low-countrey men in <hi>England,</hi> besides the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and handy-crafts-man; but, that in the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
the English are hired with Pensions to breed stirres and

from Sacred Emperours, and was both sonne in law and

               <note place="margin">The title Illustrious.</note> and was also the husband and

by all Princes with the title of most Puissant. The English
answered, that an Arch-Duke ought not to bee equalled in
Honourable Titles with a King: besides, that hee was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therway
titled then Most Illustrious, in the ancient treaties
betweene <hi>Philip</hi> the Arch-Duke, the father of <hi>Charles</hi> the
fift, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. The Spaniards answered, that it
was no wonder, if that title onely were giuen to him, when
the very same and no greater was also giuen to <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight himselfe. On the other side the English found these
faults in their King: that the forme of their subdelegation
was wanting, that it was much obscured by the interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of other Commissaries: that it was sealed but with a
Priuate Seale, when the Queenes was sealed with the Broad
Seale of <hi>England:</hi> Lastly, that this clause was wanting, that
the King should ratifie whatsoeuer was concluded vpon.
They answered, that their formall subdelegation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in those words, <hi>Par trattar y hazar trattar.</hi>
That there is no such name in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as the Broad Seale, and
the Priuate: but that this was their Kings owne hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in the presence of the Secretary, and signed with the
publike Seale of the King and Kingdome; and that lastly, by
these words, <hi>Estar y passar, y estare y passare,</hi> all was Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
            <p>Within some few dayes after,<note place="margin">The English challenge the first place.</note> the English desired that
they should meet (for as yet they had onely dealt with the
Arch-Dukes Delegates, by writing) also demanding the
prioritie of the place for the Queene: the Spaniards being
angry somewhat with that, that the English should first
challenge the first place, as if in such affaires, <hi>Le premier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeur,
estoit le vaincueuer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Spanish will not yeeld them a place equall with them.</note> They answered, that it was
newes for the Kings or Queenes of <hi>England,</hi> to stand vpon
the tearmes of Equalitie with the Catholike King; but that
it was vnheard of to speake of Prioritie. The English an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Precedencie of the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi>
was very well knowne to all the world, and strengthened
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:27506:153"/>
with good and sound reasons; and that besides, the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
Resident for the Queene hauing a double power ought
to be preferred, before him that comes onely with the bare
title of a Delegate. <hi>Edmonds</hi> was very earnest, and
assured them that before hand hee had informed <hi>Richardot,</hi>
that the Queene would not lose her Prioritie, and when hee
vrged him to answere, he indeed denied it not, but said, that
he would answere him when they met together; and, that
hee did not thinke that the Treatie should haue broke off
for that matter. After this there were inuitations on both
sides to their priuate houses, vnder the pretence of familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and talke together, but indeed to worke them out of the
conceit of the Prioritie. But this effect was well enough
shunned on both sides: although the Low-Countrey men
had enough to doe to mollifie the Spaniards a little, who
would not endure to heare, that the Catholike King should
once acknowledge the Queene for his Equall; for because,
that thereby he must necessarily acknowledge the French
his Superiour; being it is on all sides confessed, that <hi>England</hi>
yeelds prioritie to <hi>France.</hi> The English still doe continue
strong in their resolution, defending their ancient priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
saying, that the Spaniard hath no cause to bee angrie
thereat; For he that vseth onely his owne Right, not a whit
preiudices another mans: and that there was no reason why
the Spaniard should not acknowledge the Queene as his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
since shee is as Absolute a Monarch as hee is, and hath
as ample, if not more ample Iurisdiction in her Maiesties
Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Edmonds</hi> was sent ouer into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">New instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the English from the Queene.</note> &amp; retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

or preiudiciall to the Queene, let it be admitted; and
that they should not so strictly stand vpon their first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.
That the Peace should be perpetuall both to the
partie now contracting, as also the further Succession for

traffiques and trading should be recalled to the state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was in 1567. That there should be a Couenant made,
that no ships be stayed without the consent of that Prince,
whose subiects those ships are. That they should no way
admit of that the Spanish men of warre should come into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hauens of the Queenes. That if the traffique into <hi>Indie</hi>
were denied, they should not stand vpon it but passe it ouer;
as the French did at the Treatie of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and at <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so euery man should venter thither on his owne perill;
for by admitting of any Restriction or Limitation, the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of many thither might much bee preiudiced. That, as
the French did in the Treatie at <hi>Bloys</hi> and <hi>Veruins,</hi> they
should hold their tongue in the matter of Rebels and Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes:
That they should promise that the English Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
in the townes pawned to her, should onely defend the
said townes, and not warre against the Spaniard. And that
they should enforme them, that the Queene had fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that her Subiects might haue free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rading in the Arch-Dukes
Prouinces: and that the English seruing now the
States, should not be recalled againe. Lastly, that they should
fit themselues to Time and Place, and to businesses accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
which sometimes giues better counsell to the men,
then the men can to them; also; that they should carefully
obserue to what end this Treatie tended, whither or no, it
were to keepe the Queene in suspence, whilest they either
inuaded <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland:</hi> or whether it were not to draw

               </gap>oyne them from
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane while the Arch-Duke, being somewhat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
with his great warres in <hi>Flanders,</hi> complaines, that
succour and Subsidie was sent by the Queene to the States,
and that ships were rigging for the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Delegates
made answere, that they knew not of any such matter; but
if it were true, that this was no Innouation of new stirres,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:27506:154"/>
but a continuation of those things that were begun before
the Treatie; and that therefore they must bee borne withall
patiently, till such time as the peace be concluded: Blaming
the Spaniards againe, that publikely they had furnished the
Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> with prouision and money; that hee had
receiued of them Hostages, and promised his succour: that
these things were to be seene extant in the very letters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of the Spaniards, which were sent ouer to curry fauour
from the Queene to the Rebels, and could presently be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
Besides, that that was a plaine innouation; For his
Father neuer assisted them but secretly, if he did that. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
these things were in controuersie, and suspition on either
side daily increased, that the peace indeed is propounded, but
a worse thing treacherously intended, The Spaniards declare,
that their Master the Catholike King, would in no case grant
the Queene Prioritie; or admit of Equalitie: and that
hee had peremtorily commaunded them, to dissolue the
Treatie.</p>
            <p>This indeed much troubled the Delegates both of the
Queene and the Arch-Duke: and the English,<note place="margin">The Treaty is dissolued.</note> rather then
the Treaty should be dissolued, propounded, that omitting
that question of priority, they might treate with them by
writing, conferences, or mess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngers betweene. They againe
on the other side, proposed, that if there were a meeting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the States would also meet there,
that they would treate with them in any place of <hi>Holland,</hi> so
it were not vnder the Queene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or, if it should please them
to meet in any place of the Spanish Dominion, that they
would entertaine the English thither, as euery one would a
stranger, at his owne house. Besides, it was also propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the Treatie should be onely prorogued for three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
daies, and not absolutely dissolued, that in meane time,
euery one might endeauour for this peace, if it shall please
both the Princes. But this was all in vaine; for the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
of the Spaniard and Arch-Duke post home in all haste
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:27506:155"/>
possible: and the Queene forthwith recalled hers againe,
protesting before-hand, that out of her sincerity she did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing to her knowledge, that was or might be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in any Christian absolute Princes, which tend to a true
peace, strong, and perpetuall, the better to spare the effusion
of Christian bloud; as appeares in that after shroward sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of no faire dealing, by reason of aide sent by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> she at their request sent her Delegates to
this Treatie; where, seeing no reason that she should giue
priority to the Spaniard, as she before intimated to them by
<hi>Edmonds,</hi> she was content with equality: and if that were
denyed, she refused not to treate either by writings or Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingers
betweene both parties. And so expired this Treatie
at <hi>Bullen,</hi> after three moneths.</p>
            <p>The States in the meane hauing all things according to
their hearts desire,<note place="margin">The skirmish at New-port.</note> were so farre from desiring peace with the
Spaniard, that at this very time they consulted to bring to
their obedience the Sea-coasts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to secure their
Sea voyages the better, for <hi>Spinola's</hi> Gallies molested
their Seas sorely; and also to free <hi>Ostend,</hi> which was onely
brought into distresse with Castles being planted round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. These things seemed very easie vnto them, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the weaknesse and affliction of the enemy, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolts
and seditons amongst their old Souldiers. Wherefore
hauing pressed fourteene thousand foot, and three thousand
horse, vnder <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> to whom some of the
chiefe of the States themselues adioyned them too, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to land at <hi>Ostend.</hi> But the winde being crosse, they were
faine to land at <hi>Philippine</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by flat bottome
boats, drouen on shore by the tide; and there they spread
abroad the terrour of them so farre and neere, that those in
Garrison in the way, and those in S. <hi>Alberts</hi> Fort, yeelded
themselues euery where neere to <hi>Ostend,</hi> whither they also
came eight daies after, hauing waded ouer an Arme of the
Sea to <hi>Newport:</hi> the next day after, in their consultations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:27506:155"/>
pitching their Campes, comes newes to them, that the
Arch-Duke with seuen thousand foot, and one thousand
horse, came flying vpon them; who indeed, night and day
following them, re-got most of their Fortresses againe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-run
eight hundred Scots, that lay in his way, and brought
his weary Army almost as farre as <hi>Newport.</hi> There it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
good to the Spaniard to pitch a little, and recouer <hi>S<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.
Alberts</hi> Fort, and by making a trench hinder those of <hi>Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw's</hi>
Army from prouision of all sorts. But the Arch-duke
some what couragious by reason of his late-happy successes,
scorned that deuice, as vnworthy the very thought of a
true Souldier.</p>
            <p>On the otherside <hi>Maurice</hi> as quicke as he, prouideth
himselfe for battaile, committing the Troupe on foot to Sir
<hi>Francis Vere,</hi> (as <hi>Vere</hi> himselfe in his Commentaries and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations
reports) and the Troupe of horse to <hi>Lodowicke
Nassaw:</hi> but it pleased all of them to wade backe againe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the arme of the Sea, as soone as they could. <hi>Vere</hi> would
not suffer any of his men to put off their clothes, saying, that
shortly they should not either haue need of clothes, or they
should get better. Then hee chose out a fit place for battell,
which was a narrow Plaine betweene the sea and the sand
hills: the sand hilles on either side, being somewhat higher
then ordinary. In the highest of them he placed of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
1500. and 2500. Musketteers of the <hi>Frisons.</hi> Then
<hi>Maurice</hi> propounded, whither or no it were best to march
on and meete the enemy, or expect him still there. Many
thought it best to march on, that so that might fright them,
and bring backe victory: and that by expecting them, they
should but weaken their courages and increase their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who had opportunitie now to stop their passages of
victualls to them. But for all that, <hi>Vere</hi> was on the contrary
opinion, that the enemies armies being so suddenly mustred,
was not so prouided with victualls and all kind of prouision,
that it could long continue in a region wasted away with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:27506:156"/>
continuall warre; That the difficultie of stopping their victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
was least of all to be feared, by reason that they had store
enough in the Ships, and the Seas lying so open for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniance
of more prouision vnto them. Also, that the enemy
being wearied with the ascents and descents of hils &amp; vallies,
and with the extreame heat of the Sun, would easily be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
by their fresh Forces. <hi>Maurice</hi> embracing this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
there made a stand: and chose some elect Bands to stop
the breaking out of the Garrison of <hi>Newport</hi> vpon them:
and whilest the Arch-Duke takes one or two houres for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
whither or no hee should make a stand there, to
refresh his Souldiers, and expect his troupes that were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
hee lost both opportunitie of time and place. But yet
for all that, being as full of hope as courage he marches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
and seeing that by reason of the tide comming in,
there was but small roome for his Horsemen, and that hee
must necessarily bend towards the Sand Hilles, on set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
hee set foorth one of his prisoners or captiues, that to
put them in a flight, cried out that the <hi>Scots</hi> were all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
and that there was no fighting now; but yet his
mouth was quickely stopt. <hi>Vere,</hi> seeing the Arch-Duke
drawing neere on, willed the Horsemen to be sent out vpon
him, but the Master of the troupes of Horse would not suffer
them. Wherefore <hi>Vere,</hi> hauing assaulted them with Shot of
his great Peece of Ordnance, droue them to the mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Sandie Hilles, where they tarried for their Footmen,
who comming alone by the shoare, thundred vpon the Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souians
with their Ordnance. <hi>Vere</hi> he gets to the top of the
Sand Hilles to obserue the motion of the enemy; and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, by reason of some fiue hundred Spaniards that came
to assault them, the combate grew dangerous; wherein <hi>Vere</hi>
was wounded first in the leg, and then in the thigh: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
drawing towards the shoare, his horse fell vnder him,
he also lying downe vpon him till he was helped by <hi>Drury</hi>
and <hi>Higame,</hi> and put vpon <hi>Drury's</hi> horse; and in good

who all so violently beat vpon the enemies with their shot,
that they droue the enemy to flight. Many in the flight
were slaine; in all about nine thousand. There were taken
the Admirall of <hi>Arragon, Vigilare, Sapena,</hi> and many
more of great note, and Nobility. The Arch-Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was sore wounded, Duke <hi>Aumale</hi> also, and <hi>Alphonsus

            <p>The Spaniards were very loth to attribute their losse to

the Danes being angry with this fishing and the English
Piracy,<note place="margin">Contentions with the Danes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.</note> suddenly set vpon the English of <hi>Hull,</hi> fishing not

(the cause vnknowne) the Queene tooke heinously, and as
proceeding from an enemy, who neither respected her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or Subiects, or his owne ancient League she mediated
for the men of <hi>Hull,</hi> in Letters sent by <hi>Stephen Leisere,</hi> and

               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:27506:158"/>
had verbally pretended, that that fishing by Island, and
<hi>Norway,</hi> was vsed of the English, contrary to their League,
but of this, that they had shewed no proofe; she taught al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that many priuiledges of fishing were granted to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
by the ancient Kings of <hi>Norway,</hi> before the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and that the same were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Christianus</hi> Kings of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> which
was affirmed out of the Treatie with <hi>Iohn,</hi> that licence of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
from seuen yeares to seuen was to be asked; she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that it had beene omitted many yeares of them, that
the Danes were in fault, not the English; for vntill the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
of <hi>Christierne</hi> their King, in the yeare 1521. this
licence was asked; since then, that neither <hi>Fredericke</hi> the
Kings great Grandfather, nor <hi>Christian</hi> the Grandfather, nor
<hi>Fredericke</hi> the Father had enacted it, who in the yeare 1585
promised by his Letters, that if the English abstained from
iniury, they might enioy the liberty which formerly they
had without any asking leaue; wherefore that now the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
were vniustly dealt withal, since that of late they had not
refused to aske licence from seuen yeares to seuen, as before
also the most famous Lawyers had iudged the Sea to be
common, not to be interdicted of any Prince by the Law
of Nations. To let passe many words, the Queene required
the whole matter should be referred either to Delegates on
both sides, or to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law, the Duke of <hi>Mekelburgh, Henry Iulius</hi> the D.
of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> Vncle to the Kings Sister. But when neither
<hi>Stephen Leisiere,</hi> nor <hi>Ferrar,</hi> nor <hi>Nicholas Crage</hi> a learned
man, the one sent into <hi>England,</hi> the other into <hi>Denmarke,</hi>
could compose the matter; at length it was agreed on, that
Delegates should be sent to <hi>Embda,</hi> thither the Queene sent
Embassadours <hi>Richard Bancroft</hi> Bishop of <hi>London, Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Swale,</hi> who might parley with the
Delegates of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> But when they came not at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
day, whether hindered by the winde, or some other
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:27506:158"/>
errour, the Danes alleaging, that the time of their Delegates
was out, went home, or as some thought, because they
wanted victuals, for the Danes giue to their Embassadours
Captaine victuals, not mony as other Princes, neither could
endure to heare that they should require the prolongation of
that authority. Hence the English complained of the Danes,
as men proposing nothing else to themselues, then that
things should remaine as they were, to wit, that they might
exact new tribute daily in the <hi>Oresund</hi> Sea, that by new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
they might confiscate their ships and merchandize, that
they might hold their fishng in the Northerne Sea, and then
saying through the same into <hi>Moscouia:</hi> notwithstanding
about these times (for the better furtherance of Nauigation,
the Trades increase, and the Kingdomes honour) the Queene
instituted the Company of East <hi>Indie</hi> Merchants,<note place="margin">The East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia company instituted.</note> giuing to

suspected, because it was priuate and secret. These things
the Lawyers sorely aggrauated, bringing in also abrupt sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences

            <p>Out of these sentences they argued, as if he had thought
the Queene very weake, or voide of reason; that hee had

(besides his allegiance) owed neither loyalty or thankful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vnto the Queene; also they obiected some petty matters

great thankes to God for all his mercies bestowed vpon him,
and to his most mercifull Queene, that cited him not to the
Star-Chamber, but would haue that cup passe by him, (as he
himselfe said) within these priuate wals. Therefore professing
that he would in no case contest with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, or altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the errors of his weaknesse, or his vnconsiderate youth;
protesting withal, that he was alwaies a Subiect very loyal, &amp;
that he not so much as thought that, that might enfringe his
loyalty; also, that in all things he meant well, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
it fell out otherwise, and that now he had taken lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the standers by to accompany him in that dolefull colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymation;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:27506:160"/>
yet he could not containe himselfe, but hee
must needs excuse his errour, in making <hi>Southampton</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Horse; which he did, he said, being erroneously
perswaded, that the Queene would admit of those reasons he
could giue her for it: but that, when he saw she would not
admit of them, he casheared him from that authority. The
reason, he said, that he knighted so many, was to retaine
with him more Voluntaries of the Nobler sort. That the war
in <hi>Mounster</hi> was vndertaken by the vndiscreet opinion of
the Irish Councell, but that the chiefe of them, now, <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was strucken with blindnesse, and <hi>Warham</hi> of S. <hi>Leager</hi> with
a cruell death.</p>
            <p>As he was going forwards,<note place="margin">The L. Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per interrupts his answer.</note> the Keeper interrupted him,
admonishing him, that as he had begun, hee should betake
himselfe to the Queenes mercy, who indeed desired not to
finde him guilty of treason, but onely of Disobedience,
and contempt, and that he should not carry a shew of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
before him, but shew his obedience indeed. That by
extenuating and lessening his offence, he would seeme the
more to extenuate the Queenes mercy. That it sounded ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
harshly for him to shadow his disobedience, vnder a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and will of obedience.</p>
            <p>It were needlesse to repeat what euery man said, when as
they said little or nothing, but what had beene before said
in the Starre-Chamber. Wherefore at length the Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
pronounceth this sentence; That he must be degraded
of his office of one of the Councellours, and suspended from
his office of Earle Marshall, and Master of the Ordnance, and
remaine in custody during the Queenes pleasure.</p>
            <p>These things euery one approued with his consent, and
many notwithstanding conceiued great hope of his recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and restoring to the Queenes fauour, in that the Queene
expresly commanded that be should not be suspended from
being Master of the Horse, as if she had intended to haue
vsed him againe, and withall, in that she would not haue
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:27506:161"/>
this censure past vpon him registred.</p>
            <p>These hopes,<note place="margin">The hopes of his liberty ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Queenes naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to pitty.</note> many that obserued the consequent euents
and dispositions, both of the Queene, the Earle, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
probably encreased the same by this meanes. That
the Queene was borne to clemency and quietnesse. That in
her wisedome she knew that mercy was the pillar of her
Kingdome. That she both would and could shew mercy, &amp;
yet with discretion. That she would not driue so great a man
into despaire. That she would not, that any one should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
that was any commodity to the Common-wealth. That
she had squared all her actions hitherto to the rule of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
That she intended not the ouerthrow, but the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Earle. That such a word of a Prince was an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
and as in God nothing is that admitteth a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
so neither in Princes. Besides, that she, like <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
hated the malicious that raged against vertue forsaken
by good fortune. That whom she loued once, she loued to
the end. That many hauing more heinously offended, haue
recouered, or yet not quite fell from her fauour; as <hi>Sussex,</hi>
concerning the Irish treason. <hi>Norfolke</hi> not obseruing his
Commission in the siege of <hi>Lethe. Bacon</hi> hauing written a
Booke of the succession of the Kingdome. <hi>Henry Arundel,
Henry</hi> the Father of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and <hi>Lumley,</hi> for secret
conspiracies with the Q. of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And <hi>Croft</hi> for priuate

               </gap> the Prince of <hi>Parma. Walsingham</hi> for sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
the K. of <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Gowry,</hi> vnknowne to her, or
her Councell. And <hi>Leicester</hi> concerning the affaires in the
Low Countries. These all were accused, and yet recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
her fauor. But indeed, for the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi>
and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> that they were iustly executed, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
the destruction of this Kingdome with forreine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As also <hi>Norfolke</hi> who sinned against his oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
afterwards againe, by going about a marriage
with the Queene of Scots; and by concealing those things
which he knew she dealt about with other Nations; and by
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:27506:161"/>
ayding the Scots that were proclaimed publique enemies to
<hi>England.</hi> Also that the Queene of Scots indeed died, for all
she seemed safe by the priuiledge, and prerogatiue of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction,
in that she tooke such sinister courses for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of her liberty, that she endangered the safety of the
Kingdome: and when no better physicke could be giuen the
common-wealth to maintaine its life, then her death. But
then, they considered, that no such matter was obiected to
the Earle, who onely hauing sinned out of ignorance, was
free from treason, both by the sentence of the Queene her
selfe and her Councell. The Queene all this while (to call
him backe from despaire) not preferring any of his noted
enemies in the time of his oppression, although they much
affected higher dignities.</p>
            <p>Then they argued from the noblenes of the Earle (for a far
off he was of the bloud Royall) his vertues,<note place="margin">Next, from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e noblenesse and vertuous disposition of the Earle.</note> and the choice
of the Queene of him from amongst many into her fauour;
that he suffered euen a box on the eare at her bands; that he
deserued exceedingly well of his Country, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
that there was not any one better instructed in the
arts of a Commander, or to mannage a warre, or frustrate the
violence of an approaching enemy; that there was not one
more beloued of the people that could appease any tumult
if it were once raised, and that could discreetly gouerne the
affaires of the Realme; and that he was one that was most
worthy of the Queenes loue and fauour; that the seuerity of
the Queene, if she should exercise it against one so well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
would also concerne the rest; that nothing doth more
ioy the hearts of our enemies, then to see those ill dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
who are more famous then the rest, and indeed innocent;
that the Earle had no greater enemies then his owne orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that his aduersaries complained of nothing in
him, but his greatnesse.<note place="margin">Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the diuers intents of his very aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarins.</note> Then they argued from the diuers
intents of his aduersaries, who although they all meant
ill, yet vsed not the same meanes. Some of them when he
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:27506:162"/>
was cited in the Starre-Chamber, thinking it not best to
deale rigorously with him; that then the Secretary deuised
euill practises against him; that yet such euill-minded men
desire more then they dare attempt. Besides, that it was
wisedome to vnderstand, that affaires in Court turne
not alwaies vpon the same wheele; that there are periods of
hate, of loue, of iealousie, of cruelty and mercy, although
we cannot define them. That no man knowes whither or
no he be worthy, by to morrow, of loue or hatred. That
the determinations of Princes are very intricate. That they
are wont sometimes, euen to sacrifice to the people, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
of their credit, the chiefest of their seruants, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the example of <hi>Empson, Dudley,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Woolsey,</hi>
and <hi>Cromwell.</hi> Let men wisely deeme, that as Princes haue
shewen themselues towards others, so they will towards
themselues too if occesion shall serue. Therefore, that
hence his aduersaries ought to be wary lest they plunge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
themselues too deepe in this businesse, and be not able to
follow it, lest thereby they doe themselues the greatest hurt,
in striuing to burthen him more, that already is too much
laden with hatred. Neither that they doe too much exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
the Queene terribly against so braue a man: for if they
doe, howsoeuer men may be amazed at it, yet God will be
auenged of them, who being himselfe iust, will in his best
time defend those that are vniustly afflicted.</p>
            <p>So by these perswasions many were of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Earle
would recouer fauour again with the Queen, both now busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for to put himselfe vpon any free Embasy, and so to withdraw
himselfe into some forreine Country, till such time as the
weather grew a little clearer for him; secondly, whither
it were better to addict himselfe wholly to a contemplatiue
life, that thereby he might lift vp his heauenly minde as his
fortunes grow lower and lower. Or lastly, whither or no
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:27506:162"/>
he should take some mid-way betweene both, being ready
prouided for either fortune.</p>
            <p>The Earle in the meane time made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he had taken his leaue of this world, that with teares he
had washed away from his heart his hot ambition. And
that now hee desired nothing more then that the Queene
would let her seruant depart in peace, (for these were his
owne his words.) These speeches so much delighted the
Queene, that shee forthwith remoued him from his keeper
<hi>Barckley,</hi> willing him to be his owne man, and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>Then shortly after she suffered others to haue the profit

much vsed to recite and commend that physicall Aphorisme,</p>
            <p>That the more one feeds corrupt and diseased bodies, the

that now had fully perswaded him, that the Queene, the

to make his owne way to the Queen, intimating, that besides
many of the Nobility would secure him, his ingresse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.
But the Earle answered, that that would breed a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in his conscience, except he had the fauourable opinion
of Preachers thereto. Yet for all that, he sent word to <hi>Blu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

entertaining at boord all kinde of Souldiers, audacious, and
discontented persons, that would not care whom they woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with their tongues. Euery day there was a Sermon by

hauing lost the honour of her marriage-bed, found the great

            <p>All these (to auoid suspition) meeting couertly in <hi>Drury</hi>
House; there <hi>Essex</hi> first proposed to them a Catalogue of
the Nobility that were all addicted to him; wherein, of
Earles, Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, he reckoned about
one hundred and twenty. After this, he willeth them to
consider, and tell him, whether it were best to surprize the
Queene, or the Tower, or both together; and then what
they should doe with the City.</p>
            <p>But it seemed best to them all to surprize the Court, and
that after this manner: <hi>S. C. Blunt</hi> with a choice company
should seize on the Gate, <hi>Dauis</hi> the Hall, <hi>Danuers</hi> the great
Chamber of the Guard, (where they sit seeing who is highest
amongst them) and also the Presence Chamber; and then
<hi>Essex</hi> should come out of the <hi>Mues</hi> with some choice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and hauing way made for him, come humbly to the
Queene, and demaund that shee would remoue from her
his potent aduersaries, whom he had afterwards resolued
(as was by some of them confessed) to cite to appeare before
Iudgement; and hauing assembled a Parliament, to change
the forme of gouernment in the State.</p>
            <p>But whilest these Scottish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mbassadours,<note place="margin">Suspition dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increased of Essex his loyalty.</note> and a seasonable

daily of him, by reason of a continuall concourse of the
Commonalty to <hi>Essex</hi> house, vnder pretence of hearing
Sermons; as also, by reason of some words that fell from
one of their Preachers, whereby he allowed that the great
Magistrates of the Kingdome had power in necessity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
the Princes themselues. Hereupon, at small inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the matter on the seuenth of <hi>February,</hi> came <hi>Robert
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:27506:167"/>
Sack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill</hi> the sonne of the Treasurer, vnder pretence of an
honourable visitation, but indeed, out of a desire of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
by knowing who vsed to come thither, and what
they were. Presently after that, is <hi>Essex</hi> sent for to the Lord
Treasurers house, (where the Councell met) there to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
that he should moderately vse the benefit of his
libertie: and the very same day, a litle note was put into
his hands, (he knew not how) wherin he was warned to
looke to himselfe and provide for his owne safetie. But the
Earle fearing that somewhat had come to light, and so hee
might perchance be committed againe, excused himselfe by
reason of some distemper in his health, that he could not
come to the Councell.</p>
            <p>And by this time his resolution (which had beene foure
moneths a digesting) failed: and he hasteneth againe to
some new plot. Wherefore hauing assembled his intimate
friends againe, and intimated to them, that some of them
would shortly be imprisoned, he propounded to them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were best or no forthwith to seize vpon the Court, or
to try what the Citizens will doe for him, and so by their
helpe set vpon it: or whither or no they had rather counsell
him to fly, and secure himselfe that way. For the surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of the Court,<note place="margin">He plots new matters.</note> they were vnprouided of Souldiers and
Engines; and besides, some affirmed that there had beene
lately watch and ward duly kept there; besides, that to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
the Court, was inexcusable treason against the Queene.
Whilest they were arguing about the loue of the Citizens,
and some obiected the vnsta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> disposition of the common
people, behold one comes in, as if sent from them, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
their vtmost endeauours against all their enemies.
Hereupon the Earle being somewhat cheerefull, began to
discourse how much hee was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oued in the Citie, by most
that were much addicted to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame and fortune; which
he beleeued absolutely to be true, by reason of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
murmuring and crying out against his hated enemies.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:27506:167"/>
Also, by other mens speeches, he was perswaded that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Smith</hi> then Sheriffe of <hi>London,</hi> who was then Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of a thousand trained Souldiers, would be for him
vpon all occasions. Wherefore he was resolued (by reason
that such lingring is as dangerous commonly as rashnesse)
the next day, which was Sunday, to come through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with two hundred of the nobler sort, and so to passe to
<hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, iust about the end of the Sermon, and there
to declare to the Aldermen and people the reasons of his
comming, and demand of them aide against his aduersaries.
If so be the Citizens were backward in the matter, then they
would goe on further presently; but if they were willing to
helpe, then with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to inuade the Court presently, and
make way for him to the Queene. So all that night there
was nothing but running vp and downe from <hi>Essex</hi> house,
and crying that the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Essex his house.</note> and <hi>Rawleigh</hi> laid waite
for the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> life. Hereupon, on Sunday, which
was the eight day of <hi>February,</hi> early in the morning, comes
the Earles of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sands,
Parker</hi> Lord <hi>Montaquile,</hi> and almost three hundred more
of the better sort. These the Earle courteously entertained,
and intimated to some, that there was waite laid for his
life, that therefore he had resolued to get vnto the Queene,
and tell of his dangers to her, by reason she neuer heares of
it from his aduersaries, who abusing her sacred eares with
calumnies and false informations, haue engrossed them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Citie stood for him, and that therefore hee would betake

<hi>Blunt</hi> indeed perswaded them there to surprize Sir <hi>Walter
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:27506:168"/>
Rawleigh,</hi> but they did i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not. Now indeed there were some
that reported that <hi>Gorge</hi> made there a discouery of all the
matter to <hi>Rawleigh;</hi> but that is vncertaine: yet certaine it
is that <hi>Rawleigh</hi> admonished him to take heed, that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from his Office at <hi>Plimmouth</hi> without leaue cost him
not imprisonment, and that <hi>Gorge</hi> againe admonished <hi>Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
that he should haue a care to himselfe, seeing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Nobility had conspired against him, and some
more that abused the Queenes authority.</p>
            <p>At this very time the Queene commanded the Lord
Maior of <hi>London</hi> to see that all the Citizens were ready at
their doores at her command in an instant; and to the Earle
of <hi>Essex</hi> she sent the Lord Keeper,<note place="margin">The Lords of the Priuie Councell sent to the Earle of Essex.</note> the Earle of <hi>Worcester,
William Knolles</hi> Controwier of the Queenes Houshold, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to the Earle, and <hi>Popham</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to know of him the reason of such a concourse. They
were all let in at a wicket, and their seruants shut out, onely
except him that carried the Seale before the Keeper. In the
yard there they found a confused multitude of people, and
in the midst of those the Earles of <hi>Essex, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi>
and many more, that presently flockt about the
Councell. The Lord Keeper turning himselfe to the Earle
of <hi>Essex,</hi> signified to him, that he and the rest of the Lords
with him, were sent newly from the Queene, to know of
him the cause of this concourse; who promised, that if any
iniury had beene done vnto him, he should haue Law and
Equity for it.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> answered him alowed in this manner;</p>

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:27506:168"/>
neither my patience, nor misery, will appease the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of my aduersaries, except they drinke my bloud
also.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Popham</hi> spake to him to the same purpose, that the Lord
Keeper had said already before; promising, that if so be he
would particularly tell what was vndertaken, or intended
against him, that hee would truely and honestly tell the
Queene, and he should be lawfully heard.</p>
            <p>The Lord Keeper being very vrgent with them, that if
so be they would not tell their grieuances publikely, they
would retire in and tell them, the multitude interrupting
him, cryes out,</p>

            <p>Hereupon the Lord Keeper, turning about to them, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

Then the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> goes into the house, the
Lord Keeper following him, and the rest of his company,
that there they might priuately talke about the matter. In

            <p>After they had come into the middest of the house, <hi>Essex</hi>

The Lords of the Councell being shut vp there, were
kept by <hi>Iohn Dauis, Francis Tresham,</hi> and <hi>Owen Salisbury</hi>
an old bold Souldier, and some Gun-men. And <hi>Essex</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
almost forgot his resolution by reason of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
committing his house to <hi>Gill Mericke,</hi> issues forth
with some two hundred with him, who were not in battell
array, or any military order, but onely running for the most
part with their Cloaks wrapt about their armes, &amp; Swords:
amongst whom were the Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
and some other Nobles.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And so going through <hi>Cheape-side,</hi> he made all haste to
<hi>Smith's</hi> house the Sheriffe by <hi>Fenchurch-</hi> street. And euer
where he saw Citizens without weapons, he requested them
to arme themselues, or else they could doe him no good.
Yet for all this, in so well trayned a Citie full of souldiers,
most popular, and most addicted to him; there was not one,
no not of the basest people, that tooke Armes for him in
his defence.</p>
            <p>At length he got to the Sheriffes house, almost at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Citie, so fretting and cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing in his minde,
and so sweating (although the weather was not then so hot)
that there he was faine to change his shirt.</p>
            <p>The Sheriffe <hi>Smith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Traitour.</note> in whom his too easie credulity had

meane time the Lord <hi>Burghley, Dethicke Garter</hi> King at
Armes entring into the Citie, proclaime <hi>Essex,</hi> and all his

and offered violence. The Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:27506:169"/>
When the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> perceiued that, hee rushes out of
the Sheriffes house, and his countenance much chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> exhorting the Citizens
to take armes, but all in vaine; for the Citizens wealth,
if nothing else, would keepe them loyall. But when the
Earle saw that not any one tooke Armes for his defence, and
that those that accompanied him withdrew themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and heard also that the Admirall came with forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
him, then he began to cast away all his hopes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to procure some hope of fauour from the Queene. But when

with the Queene for his pardon, whilest yet there was hope,
and some comfort, no blood being yet shed, and whilest
the Queene might be in doubt of the successe, or the Cities
minde in any vncertainty what they should doe. The
Earle gaue him leaue, but onely willed that <hi>Popham</hi> might

            <p>Hauing returned, he was very angry that the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

            <p>The day after,<note place="margin">The loyall care of the Citizens is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> the Queene by her Herauld commended
the loyall care of her Citizens, acknowledging the same with

that the infection of this new sedition was likely to
lurke and breake out somewhere: also, that they should
haue an especiall care to obserue if any went about any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouations,
either by forcing the mindes of the weake and

profered his seruice either to surprize or kill the Earle of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>

that it were a braue thing if six tall fellowes at once would

<hi>Crosse</hi> hauing betrayed to the Councell, &amp; <hi>Lee</hi> being sought

another time haue beene longer deliberated on, but in these

            </p>
            <p>These all being called by name, <hi>Essex</hi> demanded if it were
not lawfull for him, as it is for a priuate man in the like
case, to take exception against any of them. But the Iudges
made answere, that the credit and truth of the Peeres of the
Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is such, that in any Law-case, or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
causes, they can neither be put to their oath, nor yet
excepted against.</p>
            <p>Then are they ioyntly demanded,<note place="margin">The heads of the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> wherefore they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:27506:172"/>
of assaulting the Court, of breaking into an open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and of imprisoning the Priuy Councellours, of stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Londoners to a rebellion, and of setting vpon her
Maiesties trusty Subiects in the City, and by defending
their houses against the Queenes forces. They being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
whither or no they were guilty of these crimes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied:
and submitted themselues to God and their Peeres.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eluerton</hi> at large vnfolds the matter,<note place="margin">They are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded by the Queenes Lawyers.</note> shewing that it is to
be reckoned as treason, euen to thinke any thing against the
Maieste of a Prince. Then he compares <hi>Essex</hi> with <hi>Catiline,</hi>
by reason that he heaped together in his rebellion men of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sorts, Atheists, Papists, and the wickedest that were. Then
he casts in his teeth the liberality and goodnesse of the
Queene towards him, that had bestowed vpon him (an
vndeseruing young man) such vntimely honours, accusing
him for abusing them by hunting after popularity, and the
loue of Souldiers, in an vnsatiable ambition of glory, which
neuer stinted, but still like the Crocodile growes as long as
it liues. Then he shewes, that he much wonders that the
Earles would pleade not guilty, when all the world could
giue euidence of their offences.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> Solliciter, shewes them out of <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
an English Authour among the Lawyers, that the very
inward thought of any villany against the Prince, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
treason; although not to be iudged so, till it brake out
into Word or Act. Then he shews that they intend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Prince, who run into rebellion, who draw
together an armed Band, who being commanded to dismisse
them, refuse; or who thinke of bringing the City, the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
or the Court, or the Prince vnder their owne power.
Then hee runnes thorow all the graces and fauours of the
Queene bestowed vpon him. That she had made him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Horse, and warlike Engines. That she had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
him into her Priuy Councell. That she had made him
Earle Marshall of <hi>England,</hi> and Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:27506:172"/>
and that in a small time she had most munificently giuen
him thirty thousand pounds of English money. Then hee
reckons vp the imprisonment of the Priuy Councellours,
the threatnings against them, the feares they were put in;
and then he obiects his acquaintance to him with <hi>Danuers,
Dauis,</hi> and <hi>Blunt,</hi> all addicted to Popery. Then shewed he,
how that they chose rather to goe into the City then come
to Court, because the glorious light of Maiesty glittering in
the Queene, would haue so blinded the eies of their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and treason, that they would neuer haue dared to haue
come neere. Then he commends their confessions, which
came out voluntary, and not being wracked out; and also
for the coherence of one with another: and hauing wouen
into his discourse an historicall Narration of all the matter,
about surprizing the Queene, and calling a Parliament, hee
concluded his speech with this bitter Epiphonema:</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat it were to be wished, that this <hi>Robert</hi>
should be the last of this name Earle of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
who affected to be <hi>Robert</hi> the first of that
name King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The Earle cheerefull in voyce and countenance,<note place="margin">The Earles reply.</note> answered
to this, that indeed it was the propriety of Lawyers to
speake well, and be good Orators; who doe thinke it a great
glory in accumulated speeches, to aggrauate the offence of
people in a manner innocent. But for his Peeres he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to consider of his case, not according to the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of his words, but the truth of the thing: protesting
that for his owne part he was most sincere in his Religion,
and that he knew no otherwise by <hi>Dauis,</hi> for he went daily
to Church. Concerning the threatnings to the Priuy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours,
he answered, that he heard not any, by reason of
the tumultuous concourse and noise of the people, that hee
vsed them there as his best and chiefest friends, but that he
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:27506:173"/>
was compelled there to keepe them in custody, by reason
of the people, and that he was necessarily droue thereunto
in his owne defence, after that once he had heard, not by
coniecturall thoughts, but by sure reason of faithfull messin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that he was ready to be set vpon sodainly by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And concerning the Queene, hee said, that he then
did (and still doth) keepe his loyalty to so well-deseruing a
Prince, and that he nothing intended else, then to prostrate
himselfe at the Queenes feet, and to lay open the dangers he
was in, and the danger that hangs ouer all the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Popham</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <note place="margin">He excuseth his iniuries done to the Counsellours.</note> being asked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his oath, declared how vnworthily and ill they had bin
vsed at his hands. The Earle made answer, that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no harme to those Honourable persons, but respected
them with great honour; but yet he saw that the Queenes
command could not keepe <hi>Southampton</hi> from iniurie, by
reason that <hi>Grey</hi> durst assault him publikely with his sword;
and that there he prouided some safeguard for himselfe, from
his friends and Clients to withstand the violent fury of his
enemies. And that there was such violence offered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against him,<note place="margin">He layes open the iniuries done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> would appeare, if but from that, that
<hi>Gorge</hi> was admonished by <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> that assoone as hee
could he should separate himselfe from him, as a ship that
was now sincking. Then he complained, that some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
were accusers of him, onely being hired thereto; as
also, that they had counterfeited his hand-writing, (which
indeed was done by an Impostor a cheater, to get money, as
we shall shew.) So that hereupon <hi>Gorges</hi> testimony was
brought in, who had confessed that the Earle had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to inuade the Court, and to call a Parliament, trusting
to the helpes of the Londoners, &amp;c. And then <hi>Gorge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was sent for out of prison hard by, to witnesse this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his face. The Earle assoone as he saw him, supposing,
that either out of hope or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eare he had betrayed all, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
his was the first testimony that was brought; and also,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:27506:173"/>
because he came as a witnesse of his owne accord, very pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
traduces him,<note place="margin">The Earle seekes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges testimony. Southampton defends his owne cause.</note> esteeming his testimony of no truth,
by reason of his variable countenance, which was by and by
pale, and then red.</p>
            <p>Then was obiected their meetings and consultations in
<hi>Drury</hi> house, about the seizing of the Tower, or the Court.
To which <hi>Southampton</hi> in a very milde speech, protesting
his true heart to the Queene, made answere, that such as those
things were indeed there proposed, but not determined, but
onely referred to the Earle of <hi>Essex.</hi> Neither was that which
was consulted put into practise, but another, to wit, his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out into <hi>London,</hi> which was to no other end, then to
get thereby secure accesse vnto the Queene, and complaine
freely to her of his iniuries. That all the day long he drew
not his sword, neither that he heard of any Proclamation,
whereby he was proclaimed Traitour. That as much as he
could he hindered the shooting out of <hi>Essex</hi> house. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he requested that they iudge of the matter, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rigour and letter of the Law, but equity: And
being demanded if he thought not, that to seize vpon the
Court, and to bring the Queene vnder their power, was
not Treason? Hee answered him, asking him, what hee
thought in his conscience they would haue done against
the Queene? The very same answered the Recorder, that
<hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> did to <hi>Richard</hi> the second: who
humbly came into the Kingdome, vnder pretence of remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
away from the King some naughty Councellours; but
hauing brought the King himselfe vnder his power, he took
from him his Crowne, and shortly after his life.</p>
            <p>The Iudges after this were demanded by the Peeres, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no that consultation in <hi>Drury</hi> house were Treason,
by reason it came not to effect. They all said it was; and
the rebellion in the Citie, to be a prosecution of that their
consultation: for that, if so be they could haue got aide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
at <hi>London</hi> amongst the Citizens, they would haue

inuaded the Court. Then it being asked, whether <hi>Essex</hi> were
the Author and occasioner of these meetings;<note place="margin">Cases pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Iudges assistants.</note> that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by many testimonies, by the contents of their meeting,
written with his owne hand, and by his casting of some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
into the fire, for babling, as he said.</p>
            <p>The Earle assoone as he heard these things,<note place="margin">Essex accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.</note> which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
had beene concealed; hope (said hee) of getting their
liues, or escaping from punishment hath wrought these te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
out from some: and indeed let them enioy their
liues as long as they can, or will. Death is more desired to
me then life; onely the violence of <hi>Cobham, Cecill,</hi> and
<hi>Rawleigh,</hi> droue mee to a necessary defence of my selfe;
which was all, howsoeuer the Lawyers interprete my going
out into the City, my own conscience being cleare from any
treachery, is my greatest comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cobham</hi> rising vp, protested that he neuer did <hi>Essex</hi> any
malicious office, but onely alwayes disallowed of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Essex</hi> answered, but I with all my heart, euen with the
losse of my right hand, would haue remooued such a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator
(and tale-teller) from the Queene.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> politely,<note place="margin">Bacon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations.</note> and like an Oratour, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
to take away that colour from their rebellion, which
they drew from the enmity that was betweene them, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that both <hi>Cabham, Cecill,</hi> and <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> were so true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honest, and of so good estates, that they would neuer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
both of them in the attempt of any such wicked act.
Then he shewes that those fictions of waite laid for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
were false, by reason of the variety of them: sometimes, in
that he would cry out he should be murthered in his bed;
then in the Boat; and lastly, by the Iesuites. Then he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him of great vanity, for crying out in <hi>London,</hi> that
the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> was put to sale to the Spaniard,
and to be diuided for the <hi>Infanta:</hi> adding, that it was an
ordinary matter with Traitours, not indeed directly to rise
against their Prince, but onely obliquely, and through the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:27506:174"/>
sides of some of the Peeres: Then he checkes him for his
deepe dissimulation, in that he had put on such a Vizard of
godlinesse: comparing him to the Athenian <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> that
would teare his owne body, that hee might shew it to the
people, as if it had beene rent and torne by his enemies, and
so hauing got aide of them, oppressed the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<hi>Essex</hi> interrupting him in his proceedings,<note place="margin">Essex inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts his speech.</note> remember, how that but lately he himselfe had very efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and pithily written Letters for him to the Queene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these his aduersaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adding besides, that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> had said to one of the Priuy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
that the right of the <hi>Infanta</hi> to the Realme of <hi>England,</hi>
was as good and iust, as any of the rest of the Competitors.
Scarce had he said these words,<note place="margin">Cecill comes forth.</note> but <hi>Cecill</hi> that had stood hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in a little Closet to heare all the proceedings, straight way
comes forth, and falling downe on his knees, beseecheth the
L. High Steward, that he would giue him leaue and licence
to answere for himselfe to such a calumny, so foule and false.
Leaue being granted, he speakes to <hi>Essex</hi> in this manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p>IN wit indeed I giue you place,<note place="margin">Cecill speakes to Essex.</note> wherein you are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
excellent. In your Nobility I giue you place,
for I am not reckoned amongst my Predecessours
that were Nobles, although I my selfe am. In your
military affaires I giue you place, I am no Souldier.
But yet for all this, my innocence shall protect me, &amp; in
this place am I free, where you are guilty. Wherefore
I challenge you, if you dare, to tell who was the Priuie
Councellour, to whom I said these words.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Essex</hi> refused it. Therefore, sayes <hi>Cecill,</hi> it is but a fained
tale. <hi>Essex</hi> denied that. Wherefore <hi>Cecill</hi> turning to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi>
entreates him by all their acquaintance, euen since
their youth, by their Christian profession of the same Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by the honour of his Family, and adiuring him by
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:27506:175"/>
them all, to name the man to them. <hi>Southampton</hi> referres it
all to the Councell, and <hi>Cecill</hi> himselfe, if it were fitting with
reason, &amp; safe for his honour to name him, when all thought
it fit he should name him, he names <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Knolles,</hi>
Vnckle to the Earle of <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cecill</hi> very earnestly entreating that he should be sent for,
shortly after he came,<note place="margin">Knolles is sent for.</note> and acknowledged, that some two
yeares agoe he heard <hi>Cecill</hi> say, that one <hi>Dolman</hi> in a Booke
had prooued the right of the <hi>Infanta</hi> to the Crowne, but
that he himselfe said no such matter. <hi>Essex</hi> replied, that the
words were told him after another sence. <hi>Cecill</hi> replyed,</p>
            <q>
               <p>THe malice,<note place="margin">Cecill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Essex.</note> whereby you haue endeauoured
to bring me in hatred with all men, comes
from nothing else, but my desire of peace, and
the good of my Country, and from your hot desire of
warre, to the profit of the Souldiers, that they might
be vnder your becke. And hence was it that you set
forth an Apologie against the Peace. And hence was
it that all that spake of peace were hated, as most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the Spaniard. But for my owne part, I am
so farre from enclining towards the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
that I tremble euen to thinke of it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Whilest the Lord <hi>Knolles</hi> is expected, the Recorder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
<hi>Essex</hi> of dissembling hypocrisie, that professing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
the Euangelicall Religion, yet hee promised <hi>Blunt</hi> (a
Papist) a Toleration. The Earle denyed it; yet denyed he
not but that he knew <hi>Blunt</hi> was a Papist, (for hee when hee
was a Boy was brought vp in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> vnder <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
that was afterwards Cardinall) but that he desired his
conuersion, and neuer indeed liked that any Christian should
be tormented in case of religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Southampton</hi> he forth with excuseth himselfe,<note place="margin">Southampton againe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe.</note> by reason of
his deare loue to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and his ignorance of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:27506:175"/>
the Lawes. He modestly implores the mercy of the Queene,
whom he alwaies knew the patterne euen of Gods mercy,
and whom he protested he neuer iniured, not with an euill
thought.</p>
            <p>The Iudges Assistants being demanded,<note place="margin">The Iudges Assistants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Peeres prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations.</note> concerning these
reiterated protestations of both the Earles, that they neuer

            <q>
               <p>THat if any man shall attempt to strengthen
himselfe so farre, that the Prince cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, he is guilty of rebellion. Also, that
euery rebellion the Law construeth to be a plot against
the Princes life, or a deposing of him, in as much as the
Rebell will not suffer the Prince to continue, or reigne,
that shall hereafter punish or reuenge such a rebellion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This they confirmed by Law, where it is adiudged Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to doe any thing against the security of the Prince, by
reason, that it cannot be, that he that once prescribeth to his
King a Right, will euer suffer the King to recouer his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to himselfe againe, or to liue, lest so he might chance to
recouer it. Fetching examples from our owne Chronicles,
of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the second, who being
by force of Armes brought vnder their Subiects power,
were after both deposed and murthered.</p>
            <p>After that Sir <hi>Iohn Leuison</hi> standing by, describes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words against the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> the tumultuous fray
neere <hi>Pauls</hi> Churchyard. Then was read through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of the Earles of <hi>Rutland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mwell,</hi> and
<hi>Sands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then began <hi>Essex</hi> to answere more mildly, that hee
thought of nothing but onely to repell force by force, and
that he would not haue gone into the Citie so inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but that he foresaw imminent danger ouer him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> repeats the opinions and sentences
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:27506:176"/>
of the Iudges, who all found both the Earles guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
shewing, that they could not excuse themselues, who
being commanded by the Lord Keeper, and a Herald, to lay
downe their weapons, yet did it not. <hi>Essex</hi> replied, that he
saw no Herald but a lame fellow, whom he tooke not for a
Herald, saying, that if he had intended any thing but onely
his defence against those his aduersaries, he would not haue
gone out with so small a company, so vnarmed, (for they had
nothing but Swords, and Daggers, and Gunnes.) <hi>Bacon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that that was done out of policy by him, who indeed
relyed vpon the Citizens armes, that they might furnish
himselfe, and his men too, and take armes themselues for
him. Imitating <hi>Guise</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in this tricke; who not
long agoe entring <hi>Paris</hi> with a few people, so stirred vp the
people to take armes, that he made the King dispatch out of
the City.</p>
            <p>By and by, were both the Earles remooued aside: and the
Peeres that past vpon them, rising and separating themselues
from the rest, conferred amongst themselues, and weighing
the matter, within an houre returned againe to their seates:
euery one hauing found both the Earles guilty. The Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
calls both the Earles to the Barre againe, according to the
manner, and asketh them seuerally, if they had any thing to
say, why sentence should not be pronounced against them.
<hi>Essex</hi> intreating the Peeres, to make intercession for <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi>
to the Queene, who might hereafter well deserue
at her hands, answered:</p>
            <q>
               <p>MY life, I take no care for that, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that I more earnestly desire, then to
lay downe my life in loyalty towards God and
the Queene, whatsoeuer the Law make of me. Yet
would I not that you should signifie to the Queene any
contempt in me of her gracious mercy; which indeed
all my smooth language would neuer purchase. And
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:27506:176"/>
I entreat you all, that since I neuer thought ill against
my Prince, ye would quit me in the Court of your
Conscience, although that ye haue cast me and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
me in this Court of Iustice.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi> most demissely and humbly
craued the Queenes pardon, entreating his Peeres to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for it with the Queene, protesting againe, that he neuer
conceiued any ill thought against the Queene: insomuch
that with his pleasing speech, and ingenuous modestie, hee
mooued all the standers by to pitty him.</p>
            <p>The Lord High Steward hauing made now a very graue
speech,<note place="margin">Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Essex and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton.</note> admonisheth the Earle, to request the Queenes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and pardon, pronouncing vpon him the dolefull sentence
of hanging, drawing, and quartering. And now the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
being turned towards them, that before was turned
from them, <hi>Essex</hi> said,</p>
            <q>
               <p>THis body might haue done the Queene better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
if she had pleased; but I reioyce that it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
any way for her.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Requesting, that before his death hee might receiue the
Communion, and that <hi>Ashton</hi> a Minister might be still with
him, for his soules health. Then hee asked pardon of the
Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and the Lord Chiefe Iustice, for keeping
them in hold. And of <hi>Morley,</hi> and <hi>De-la-ware,</hi> for bringing
their Sonnes (that knew not of the matter) into such danger.
And then, his staffe being broken, the Earle departed. These
things, the<note n="*" place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Camden himselfe.</note> Authour of the originall being there present,
makes worth beleefe, who, if he haue omitted any thing of
note, wisheth it imputed to the fault of his memory, not of
his will.</p>
            <p>The next day Sir <hi>Robert Vernon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Others also arraigned.</note> Sir <hi>William Constable,</hi>
Sir <hi>Edmund Baynham Iohn Littleton, Henry Guffe</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:27506:177"/>
to the E. of <hi>Essex,</hi> and Cap. <hi>Whitlocke, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Wright,</hi> brothers, and <hi>Orell</hi> an old Souldier, were all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned.
Assoone as (after the fashion) they had held vp their
hands, the Queenes Letters came in, who being informed
by Sir <hi>Fulke Greuill,</hi> that most of them were deceitfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
to this villany, commanded that onely <hi>Littleton</hi> being
sicke, <hi>Bainham,</hi> who ran headlong vpon the matter, out of
wantonnesse and contempt of the Magistrates, and <hi>Orell,</hi>
should come to triall; the rest she willed to be sent backe to
prison againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bainham</hi> and <hi>Orell</hi> pleaded ignorance, in that they onely
followed the Earle to testifie their obseruancy. But <hi>Littleton</hi>
being cast by the witnesse of <hi>Danuers,</hi> who had brought
him into the company, could not denie but that he was there
at their consultation. Then in his accusation being accused
of thinking some villany and sedition, by reason of some
Horses and Armour that he had in his Inne; hee answered,
that his meanes would allow him to doe it, and that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
loued horses well. Being condemned with the rest, he
said nothing, but lifting vp his eies to Heauen, <hi>Wee praise
thee O God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we knowledge thee to be the Lord.</hi> But yet all their
liues were spared: <hi>Bainham</hi> bought his of <hi>Rawleigh</hi> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<hi>Littleton</hi> died very shortly by reason of his sicknesse,
<hi>Orell</hi> onely continued some time in prison. The E. of <hi>Essex</hi>
in the mean time,<note place="margin">Essex desires to speake with some of the Councell.</note> whether or no out of his tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
voluntary, or whether or no he were councelled into a
conscience by the Minister that was with him, was so mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
that he was perswaded he should be vtterly damned if
he concealed any of the truth, and betrayed not all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators.
Wherefore he requested to speake vnto some of the
Councell, and particularly <hi>Cecill,</hi> who came to him, with the
Admirall, Treasurer, and Lord Keeper. And first he asketh
forgiuenesse of the Lord Keeper, for keeping him in hold at
his House; and then of <hi>Cecill,</hi> for traducing him in the case
of the <hi>Infanta:</hi> So that on both sides there was made a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:27506:177"/>
and christian reconciliation. And then he intimates
vnto them, that as long as he liued, the Queene could not be
safe. Wherefore he desired to die priuately within the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Then he greatly condemneth some of his partakers in
this matter, for pernicious men, <hi>viz. Blunt,</hi> and <hi>Cuffe,</hi> whom
he desired to speake with. And assoone as he saw <hi>Cuffe,</hi> hee
said:</p>
            <q>
               <p>O Cuffe, aske God and the Queene pardon,<note place="margin">He accuseth Cuffe.</note> &amp;
God grant thou maiest deserue it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am now
wholly thinking vpon a better life, hauing
resolued to deale plainly before God and men: neither
can I choose but deale plainly with thee; thou wert the
first that brought'st me to this treachery.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Cuffe</hi> being examined vpon these words, in some few
words had a fling only at <hi>Essexes</hi> inconstancy, for betraying
his friends, and then held his tongue.</p>
            <p>Likewise <hi>Essex</hi> reueales Sir <hi>Henry Neuill</hi> not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of this conspiracy,<note place="margin">Essex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueales others that knew of the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> who was now Leager in <hi>France,</hi> and
who thereupon returning about the confirming of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at <hi>Bloys,</hi> and forbidding robberies on either side, was at
his returne committed to the Lord Admirals custody.</p>
            <p>Likewise he reuealed some in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and the
<hi>Low Countries,</hi> and Lord Deputy <hi>Montioy</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as no
strangers to his resolution, and besides many in <hi>England:</hi>
whom because they were so many, and because the Deputy
prospered so fortunately in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Queene tooke no
notice of. Neither was it sufficient enough for him (as hee
thought) to declare these by word of mouth, but also vnder
his owne hand-writing: which being afterwards shewed to
the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> by his enemies, lost him much of his
credit.</p>
            <p>The 25. of February, which was allotted the time of his
death, there were sent vnto him early in the morning <hi>Thomas
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:27506:178"/>
Montford,</hi> and <hi>William Barlowe,</hi> Doctors of Diuinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Ashton</hi> the Minister, to confirme and strengthen his
soule in her assurance of saluation. The Earle before these
gaue the Lord great thankes from the bottome of his heart,
that his purpose (that was so dangerous to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth)
tooke no effect. That now God had enlightened
him to see his sinnes, it being to him a great cause now of his
sorrow, that he had so strongly defended his so vniust a
cause. Then he gaue hearty thankes to the Queene, that she
suffered him not to die publikely, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t that by the acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and noyse of the people, his setled minde might haue
beene drawne from it's resolution; withall witnessing vnto
them, that now he had well learned what popularity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of it, were; confessing, that he ought indeed now to
be <hi>spewed out,</hi> (for that was his word) out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
by reason of his pernicious vndertakings, which he
compared to a Leprosie, that had dispersed farre and neere,
and had infected many.</p>
            <p>The Queene, by reason of her good will alwaies to him,
somewhat now mooued in mind, commanded that he should
not die, by Sir <hi>Edward Cary.</hi> But then on the other side,
weighing his contumacy and stubbornnesse, that scorned to
aske her pardon; and that he had said, that as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
the Queene could not liue in safety; she altered her
resolution, and by <hi>Darcy</hi> commanded the execution to
proceed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore on the same day was the Earle brought out
betweene two Diuines vpon the scaffold,<note place="margin">Essex brought to execution.</note> in the Tower-yard:
where sate the Earles of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Hartford,</hi> Viscount
<hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Bindon,</hi> the Lords <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Walden, Darcy</hi> of
<hi>Chile,</hi> and <hi>Compton.</hi> There were also present some of the
Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> and some Knights, and Sir <hi>Walter
Rawleigh,</hi> to no other end (if we may beleeue him) then to
answere him, if at his death he should chance to obiect any
thing to him, although many interpreted his being there to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:27506:178"/>
a worser sence, as though he had done it onely to feed his
eyes with his torments, and to glut his hate with the Earles
bloud: wherefore being admonished that hee should not
presse on him now he was dying, which was the property of
base w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

him at the Armoury.</p>
            <p>The Earle, assoone as he had mounted the scaffold, vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
his head, &amp; lifting vp his eyes to Heauen, confesseth,
that many &amp; grieuous were the sins of his youth, for which
he earnestly begged pardon of the eternall Maiesty of God,
through the mediation of Christ, but especially for this his
sinne, which hee said was a <hi>bloudy, crying, and contagious
sinne;</hi> whereby so many men being seduced, sinned both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and their Prince. Then he entreated the Queene
to pardon him, wishing her a long life, and all prosperity.
Protesting, he neuer meant ill towards Her. He gaue God
hearty thankes, that he neuer was an Atheist, or Papist, but
that alwaies he put his trust in Christs merits. He bese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God to strengthen him against the terrours of death. And
he entreated the standers by to accompany him in a little
short prayer, which with a feruent eiaculation and hearty
deuotion he made to God. Then he forgaue his executioner,
and repeated his Creed, and fitting his necke to the blocke,
hauing repeated the fiue first verses of the 51. <hi>Psalme,</hi> hee

Christianly: in as much, that his Fathers admonition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

with <hi>Cisely</hi> the Daughter of <hi>William Bourchier,</hi> whose
Grandmother was Sister to <hi>Edward</hi> 4. K. of <hi>England,</hi> whose
great Grandmother was Daughter to <hi>Th.</hi> of <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> the
Son of <hi>Edward 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Bohune</hi> E. of <hi>Hartford</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> whereupon the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Viscount of <hi>Hartford</hi> was bestowed vpon his great
Grandfather <hi>Walter</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> 6, and the Title of Earle of
<hi>Essex</hi> bestowed vpon his Father by Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He being a young man, was brought vp at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in
the studies of learning and Religion, and afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> (his Father in Law) to the
Queene, and made Master of the Horse, although with much
adoe he obtained it of the Queene, she being somwhat grown
strange to his mother. But afterwards, when by his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancy
and duty, he had purchased her full fauour, she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue
him the debt which his Father owed; she made him
one of the Order of <hi>S. George,</hi> and of her Priuie Councell,
when he was scarce 23. yeares olde. He was often Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of Armies, although fortune failed him in good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I will not say was by reason of the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> who
in the 11. house of Heauen shined most afflictiuely ouer him
at his Natiuity. And when as now he had not alone the shew
of the Queenes fauour, but the excesse thereof, in very deed,
he made all haste (as the Courtiers most did complaine)
to outgoe all his Equalls, and Superiours too, to speake euilly
of the praise of any man that was not wholly addicted to
him; to take heinously if any man had gotten either power
or fauour with the Queene; to hunt after the popular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:27506:179"/>
that alwaies is very short in durance, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
praises, which are as dangerous, by his meeknesse and
liberality. Also he began to be somewhat selfe-willed, and
stubborne towards the Queene, and rather out of his great
minde, then pride; especially, after that she out of her cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
had renewed her fauour to him, which he once lost, and
had opened a way for new benefits to him. But this his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy
&amp; vntowardnes as it were, in wrestling out benefits
from her, and his lothsome neglect of obedience towards
her, with the crafty vndermining of his enuious aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
by little and little toled him out of the Queenes fauour,
and at length quite estranged him from it. Neither indeed
was this noble Earle made for a Courtier, who was slow to
any wickednesse, very warie in taking of offence, and very
loth to forget it, and one that could not couer his minde.

               <hi>S. Charles

were all arraigned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> before the Lord Admirall
of <hi>England, Hunsdon</hi> Chamberlaine, <hi>Cecill</hi> Secretary, Sir
<hi>Iohn Fortescue</hi> Chancellour of the Exchequer, the Lord
chiefe Iustice, and others: where they were accused of the
same faults as the Earles before were; to wit, that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
mischiefe to the Queenes Maiesty, by consulting of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uading
the Court, and by rebelling in the Citie.</p>
            <p>The three first of them were demanded whether or no
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:27506:180"/>
they could not deny one part of their accusation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the other: which they did, for they denied that euer
they intended any thing against the Queene. <hi>Mericke</hi> and <hi>Cuffe</hi> being taken aside, the Iudges, as before, declared;</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat he that intendeth to prescribe Lawes to
his King or Prince, whereby he restraineth his
power, doth intend mischiefe and destruction
to his Prince; and doth intend both to take the Crowne
&amp; Life from him. This they proued from the examples
of silly Countrimen, that were condemned for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
euen in the memory of our forefathers, for that
they tooke armes and met in <hi>Oxford-shire</hi> and <hi>Kent:</hi>
one, to encrease their daily pay for their worke; the
other, to take away the Inclosures of pasture fields.</p>
            </q>
            <p>For confirmation of this, they brought many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
shewing also, that it could not be, but that they must
needs, bring in the Queene vnder subiection; also offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to her, because that Conquerours are alwaies insolent:
and the fury of a multitude cannot be restrained, who to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for their owne security and safety, feare not the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of any villany.</p>

of the Earle himselfe, who but lately accused him as
the onely entiser of him to all wickednesse; when he heard it
read, and signed with the Earles owne hand, as he saw it, he
grew altogether amazed with admiration, and greatly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that in some other place he might talke with the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and <hi>Cecill</hi> concerning that matter: but lifting vp his
eyes, he cryed out openly,</p>
            <q>
               <p>THou, O God, knowest well from what purposes and
plots I disswaded the Earle of Essex.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:27506:180"/>
Then was read the confession of <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that by the leaue of <hi>Blunt</hi> who was then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he had sent to <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> and againe from him
vnderstood that <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> had said,</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat if the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> would but hearken
vnto him, that he would make him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
man in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>It was also affirmed, that <hi>Lee</hi> had said, that he knew that
both <hi>Essex, Blunt,</hi> and <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> thought all the same. Neither
indeed did <hi>Blunt</hi> denie, but that he gaue leaue to <hi>Lee</hi> to goe
or send to <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> but it was by <hi>Essex's</hi> command. And
then are read many other things that were sent out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to prooue the intimatenesse that was with <hi>Essex,</hi> with
the Earle <hi>Tir-Oen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flemming</hi> then the Queenes Solliciter,<note place="margin">Danuers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</note> turning to <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,</hi>
discourseth out of the points of Law: how, that if a

the Prince, and yet ioyne himselfe in action with those
that doe it, he is guilty of Treason. That then <hi>Danuers</hi> was
much more guilty, who (as is prooued by his owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
confession) was a partner both in the consultation, and
the conspiracy acted.</p>
            <p>He answered little or nothing to this, onely that his loue
was so great to the Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi> that for his sake
he would neglect life and goods: for the Earle had before
entertained, and hid this <hi>Danuers</hi> that fled for a murther,
and afterwards sent him ouer into <hi>France,</hi> where he followed

            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Dauis</hi> being in a manner conuicted by his owne

by the way that he was a Papist, he denied not that at <hi>Oxford</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:27506:181"/>
he was instructed in the Romish Religion by his Tutor, and
confirmed in the same by <hi>Blunt,</hi> while he was in the Irish
warres. At which words, when hee perceiued <hi>Blunt</hi> was
mooued, he straight appeased him, affirming that hee was
confirmed in that Religion not by <hi>Blunts</hi> perswasion, but by
the example of his Christian and religious life.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Cuffe</hi> and <hi>Mericke</hi> were arraigned,<note place="margin">Cuffe arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> and <hi>Cuffe</hi> is
laid hard at with the confession of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Danuers</hi> and
<hi>Henry Neuill. Danuers</hi> had confessed, that <hi>Cuffe</hi> knew of
al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the consultations and meetings; and that he alwaies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them to assault the Court. <hi>Essex</hi> had confessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councell, that hee was the instigator of him to all
this treachery, and signed this truth with his owne hand.
<hi>Henry Neuill</hi> had confessed, that <hi>Cuffe</hi> presently after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from <hi>France,</hi> had suggested to him, that the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
successe of the Treaty at <hi>Boloigne</hi> would be imputed to
him; that after that, hee would diuers times come and see
him, and perswade him to come and see the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi>
which he once did. Afterwards, when he returned last, that
he entreated him to come to <hi>Drury</hi> house, and heare what
was consulted on, protesting that he should heare of nothing
there which was not beneficiall to the Kingdome, and the
Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and what hee might heare with loyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Queene; that afterwards he entreated him to be
present with him, and the Earle, at the inuasion of the Court;
and that then he opened all the councell vnto him; which
when <hi>Neuill</hi> disliked as dangerous, difficult, and wicked, and
said; that they were of those kinde of purposes, that are neuer
commended till they are ended; that then <hi>Cuffe</hi> extenuated
both the danger and difficulty, intimating all <hi>London,</hi> and
the Aldermen themselues to be for <hi>Essex</hi> altogether, and
ready at a becke; and that then he would vse the verse of
<hi>Lucan,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—To him that holds vp armes in sight,</l>
                  <l>He giueth all things, that denies his right.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:27506:181"/>
Neither could <hi>Cuffe</hi> denie any of this. Whereupon the
Recorder Syllogistically argues against him; and he so wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
and acutely answers him, that <hi>Cecill</hi> called him a subtle
Sophister. And <hi>Anderson</hi> chiefe Iustice of the Common
Pleas, was so angry at it, that he cried they both made foolish
syllogismes; and he fell to vrging the Law against Traitors
in <hi>Edward</hi> the third. But to conclude, <hi>Cuffe</hi> tooke vpon him
to answere his accusation, which consisted of two parts.
For that (first said he) I am accused of Treason for being in
<hi>Essex</hi> house on the day of the Rebellion, you might as well
haue accused one of the Lions too, for lying in his Den. All
that day I sorely lamented the ill fortune of my Earle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I doe any thing else. I perswaded him, as I could to
cry the Queene mercy, which I could not compell him to, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he pleased. And then for the consultation in <hi>Drury</hi>
house, that is no more to be adiudged a piece of Treason,
when it neuer tooke effect, then an Embrion, or an vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
creature not full borne is to be adiudged a man. The
Lawyers vrged against him, that no necessity lay vpon him
to continue in <hi>Essex</hi> house at the siege of it; besides, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one had his office allotted him; some to defend the
House, whereof he was one; and others to seize vpon the
Citie; who all did their endeauours equally, and all were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
too guilty of Treason. Then they answered, that the
meeting of them at <hi>Drury</hi> house was of it selfe Treason, by
reason there was order taken against the Queene, which was
also put in practise. Then they vrged out of the Law, That
if more conspire against a Prince, and yet practise that their
conspiracy diuers waies, yet is the fault of Treason one and
the same in all, by reason of one and the same malice of the
Conspirators. Their discreet answeres, with the confessions
of <hi>Essex, Neuill,</hi> and <hi>Danuers,</hi> quite spoiled <hi>Cuffes</hi> cause so,
that all his wit and sophistry could not worke it out againe,
into an ambiguity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mericke</hi> he is accused for sending Letters to his brother
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:27506:182"/>
               <hi>Salisbury, Groyne,</hi> and other audacious fellowes; whom hee
drew to his side: also, for vndertaking the defence of <hi>Essex</hi>
house against the Queene, for giuing mony, and causing an
olde obsolete Tragedy of the deposing of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. to be
acted publiquely before the Conspirators, which the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
did iudge of, as if he had shewen them now that vpon
the stage, which he would haue them act the next day, vpon
the Queene. The like iudgement spent they vpon a Booke
of Sir <hi>Iohn Haywards,</hi> a learned man, that was written about
the same matter, as if it had been written to encite and stirre
the Earle to depose the Queene: to the ill fortune of the
worthy Authour, who lay long in prison, punished for his
vntimely Edition of it: and these words in his dedicatory

            <p>Two daies after Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles
Danuers,</hi> were beheaded<note place="margin">Blunt and Danuers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> vpon Tower hill. <hi>Danuers</hi> offered
ten thousand pounds to redeeme his life, and to liue in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
imprisonment; which being refused, with a very quiet
countenance, and minde, asking God and the Prince pardon,
and the L. <hi>Grey,</hi> to whom he had been a great enemy, not out
of hate to him, but loue to <hi>Southampton,</hi> he ended his life.</p>

               <hi>Blunt</hi> hauing ascended vp the Scaffold, speakes to the
people much after this manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p>ALthough the time require that (setting all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters aside) I should now fall a crying
for mercy at Gods hands for my sinnes;<note place="margin">Blunts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> yet by
reason that I haue beene traduced as an instigator of
the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> to all this villanie, as I desire the
saluation of my soule, I will speake the truth. Some
three yeares agoe, and more, I beheld the minde of the
Earle somewhat proane to ambitious desires; But
lately in Ireland whilest I lay wounded at <hi>Rheban</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and since at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Earle then told me, that
he had resolued to send ouer some choice bands to seize
vpon <hi>Milford</hi> Hauen in <hi>Wales,</hi> and to march so vp to
<hi>London</hi> with greater forces. I then well considering
of the matter, throughly disswaded him from it; as a
thing that was very dangerous, and that would cost
<hi>England</hi> great store of bloud. Therefore (to deale
truely) I perswaded him rather, with some choyce
company to seize vpon the Court, and get himselfe
there faire and reasonable conditions. And yet, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we neuer thought of doing any iniurie or wrong to
the Queene; although I must confesse, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no, if fortune had fauoured our enterprize,
the businesse would haue beene finished, with the death
of the Queene. Then, after the Earle was his owne
man, and at liberty againe, he began to consult with
me againe about these matters; but wee neuer agreed
vpon any thing determinately. Afterwards he sent
for me out of the Countrie, not long before this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
The rest I haue confessed before the Honourable
the <hi>Admirall,</hi> and the worshipfull the <hi>Secretary:</hi> to
whom to remember my seruice, and salute them from
me, I entreat you Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> of whom I
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:27506:184"/>
also aske pardon. Then lifting vp his eyes to heauen,
hee cries, God preserue the Queenes Maiestie. And
Lord, according to thy infinite mercy pardon the sins
of my heart, and my lewd life. And beare you witnesse
all, that I die a Catholike, but so that I put all my
confidence and trust in Christs merits alone, and so
good people pray for me. Then he bids the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>
and <hi>Compton</hi> farewell, and hauing prayed a little
softly, he giues his necke to the blocke, and his life to
the executioner.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And so by the mature execution of the Earle of <hi>Essex,
Cuffe, Mericke, Danuers,</hi> and <hi>Blunt,</hi> the rebellion being well
laid, peace was restored to the Common-wealth: The
mindes of the rest being well appeased too, the richer hauing
summes for muscts laid vpon them, which very few payed,
and the rest freely pardoned. <hi>Southampton</hi> being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Tower, and with him <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Sheriffe of
<hi>London;</hi> but hee either out of the Queenes mercy, or his
owne innocency, (being indeed calumniously informed of,
rather then iustly accused) within a short time he was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe to liberty.</p>
            <p>On the eight day of Iuly Sir <hi>Henry Neuill</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir H. Neuill committed.</note> was arraigned
at <hi>Yorke</hi> house before the Priuy Councell, and some of the
Iudges, and was accused for hauing been present at the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in <hi>Drury</hi> house, and for not hauing reuealed their plots;
&amp; also for reuealing to <hi>Essex</hi> the secrets of his Embassie into
<hi>France.</hi> He confessed indeed that he shewed vnto <hi>Essex</hi> the
whole Iournall of his Embassie, and what he did euery day at
his earnest request, but that he was neuer but at one meeting,
and then, that he contemned their plots as idle dreames, but
that he durst not accuse such men as the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be thought an Informer, and hoping that they would
quickly change such vnconsiderate councell, or at least thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it would be time enough to reueale it after his returne
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:27506:184"/>
from <hi>France.</hi> Yet for all this was he greatly reprehended by
all their voices, and as thought worthy of a greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fauoured with imprisonment.</p>
            <p>It is not to be forgotten that the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> often
complained that his Letters were forged, and counterfeited.
Now concerning this matter, there was diligent enquirie
made,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poster.</note> and a notable cousenage found out. The Countesse
of <hi>Essex</hi> fearing the euents of this troublesome time, hauing
put vp into her Cabinet some loue letters, which she had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
receiued of him, deliuered them to the faithful custody
of a Dutch woman that liued with her, which <hi>I. Daniel</hi> her
husband by meere chance lighting vpon, then read them, and
obseruing somewhat to be contained therein, which might
bring the Earle into some danger, and incense the Queene, he
got the Letters counterfeited by a cunning Scriuener, very
like the true originall. Afterwards the good woman being to
lie in, he came and told her that hee would deliuer vp those
Letters into the hands of her Husbands enemies, vnlesse she
would forthwith giue him 3000. pounds. She straight way
(to auoid all danger) gaue him 1170. pounds; and yet for all
this mony, receiued not the Letters themselues, but only the
counterfeited Copies: this same cousener intending to wipe
the Earles aduersaries of a great deale more mony, for the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals
themselues. This cousenage being found out, he was
committed to perpetuall imprisonment, being fined three
thousand pounds, two thousand pounds whereof was to
fall to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> then his eares being nailed to the
Pillory, being made a spectacle to the people, hee had this
inscription, <hi>A forger of writings, and a notable cousener.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long before the Embassadours of the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queens answer to the Embassadors of Scotland.</note>
namely the Earle of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Kinlosse,</hi> came vnto the
Queene, who in the name of their King gratulated vnto her
the happy and mature preuention of this vnhappy rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They likewise somewhat expostulated with the Queene
concerning her not punishing of <hi>Valentine Thomas,</hi> who had
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:27506:185"/>
sorely calumniated the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> as also, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>William Eeuer,</hi> and <hi>Ashfield,</hi> two Englishmen, that
had lately conueyed themselues out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and also,
that there might be made to their king an assignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of some
Lands here in <hi>England.</hi> To whom the Queene answered,
that she thanked them heartily for their congratulation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the rebellion; and wisheth withall, that none such
may euer happen in <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnlesse with the like successe in
the same day to be both publisht and punisht. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this <hi>Valentine Thomas,</hi> she answered, that she therefore
spared his life, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t by rubbing an olde sore too much, shee
should rather renue then remooue the paine and anguish
which would daily accrue vnto their Master, out of viperous
and slanderous tongues, who commonly when they want
all shew of proofe, yet finde beleefe. Concerning that same
<hi>Eeuer</hi> she made answere, that by reason of his peremptorie
deniall and protestation so against the truth, he had drawen
vpon himselfe the iust suspition of an euill minde. But for
<hi>Ashfield</hi> she answered, that as he had cunningly put a tricke
vpon the President of the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by that
meanes got licence to goe into <hi>Scotland;</hi> so that by another
tricke he was fetcht home againe. That for her part she was
so farre from boulstering any ill disposed subiects of his in
their conceited discontents, that she esteemed the fauouring
of anothers subiects in such a case, to be nothing else but an
enticement and occasion of causing her owne to doe the like,
when they before hand iustly may expect a conniuence from
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ands of the other Prince. About the assignment of
some Lands she answered onely what she had before in the
same matter. But lastly, condescended to adde to her yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contribution towards the King of <hi>Scotlands</hi> affaires, and
her owne, the summe of two thousand pounds more, besides
the principall, onely vpon condition, that the King would
maintaine an inuiolable vnity and concord with her, and
not submit his discretion to their tuition, who vse to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:27506:185"/>
encrease their priuate Coffers with the publique losses. Much
about this time was it, when (many of the Spanish Gallies<note place="margin">Gallies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note>
at <hi>Scluse,</hi> much in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>esting the Sea coasts of <hi>Kent,</hi> and those
opposite of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeeland)</hi> the Queene also began to
build her selfe some Gallies too, and repriued many condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
persons, and other malefactors, and sent them to worke
in the Gallies. But although both the cost and charges of
the Queene, and the honourable Citie of <hi>London</hi> (which did
with great alacrity contribute much to the effecting of the
businesse) were very great, yet the vse of them, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
benefit was as little.<note place="margin">The States thinke how to subdue Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> Notwithstanding the States of
the vnited Prouinces carefully watching ouer their great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and desiring to preuent the euill which these Gallies
might doe vnto them, resolue now to transport some of their
forces ouer into <hi>Flanders</hi> againe, and there seize vpon some
Fortresses by <hi>Ostend,</hi> that so they might with better ease &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
prey vpon the Countries thereabouts, &amp; pillage them,
and also reduce those parts of <hi>Flanders</hi> that lie by the Sea
side, vnder their owne gouernment, lest they should become
a continuall harbour for the Spanish Gallies.</p>
            <p>Yet at the very same time, that so they might both delude
the enemy from knowing their intent, and diuert him from
crossing it, if he should know it, it seemed good vnto them
to send <hi>Graue Maurice</hi> into <hi>Gelderland</hi> to besiege <hi>Rhein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge:</hi>
of which matter they certified the Queene by Sir
<hi>Francis Vere;</hi> of whom they requested foure thousand Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to be mustered and transported at their owne charges:
To which the Queene consented.</p>
            <p>But before that Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> could returne againe out
of <hi>England, Maurice</hi> had already set forwards towards
<hi>Rheinberge</hi> on the one side;<note place="margin">They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by the Arch Duke.</note> and on the other side <hi>Albert</hi>
Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> had laid his siege to <hi>Ostend:</hi> which

               </gap>es, that they
now begin rather to defend their owne Holds, then offend
their enemies. To which purpose they send for twentie
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:27506:186"/>
Companies of Englishmen from <hi>Reinberke,</hi> ouer whom they
appoint <hi>Vere</hi> the Generall both without and within <hi>Ostend:</hi>
but <hi>Maurice</hi> sent them onely eight Companies of English,
and those not very willingly, hauing already begun the siege,
and hourely expecting the enemy; and those eight were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to them by Sir <hi>Horatio Vere;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vere made gouernour of Ostend.</note> yet Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi>
wanting not courage, though he did much Companies,
(causing them to sweare to him that the other Companies
should follow, and that he should not want prouision) about

then <hi>Cecill</hi> a braue expert Souldier, euen in this very

and the rest of his Companies, although with as great
hazard indeed, as valour.</p>
            <p>This same <hi>Ostend</hi> (which in our forefathers memory was
nothing but poore Cottages of silly fishermen that liued on
the sea shore) by reason of continual tumults &amp; insurrections
was at first fortified by the States with stakes and piles, but
afterwards with trenches and other workes,<note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Ostend.</note> which the Sea
entring into the Towne a pretty way, did easily affoord them

there vnder the conduct of Sir <hi>Iohn Conway,</hi> and afterwards
vnder Sir <hi>Edward Norris,</hi> which vpon occasion did so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
<hi>Flanders</hi> with their diuers excursions, that both the

<hi>Mottee</hi> also in vaine assaulted it by treachery, (although he
lost his life at the businesse) and the Arch-Duke himselfe as
much in vaine, although hee erected about it seuenteene
strong Forts.</p>
            <p>These Garrisons therefore being as thornes in the sides
of those of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Hauen where they were placed,
to wit <hi>Ostend,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eeming to the Spaniard a most commodious
place for his Gallies to retire into, from whence hee might
hinder the traffique both of the Zelanders, and the English;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:27506:186"/>
made the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> absolutely resolue one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to assault and get it to himselfe; and indeed the States
were as carefull to defend, and still maintaine it; neither was
there euer any assault and defence of a Fort (in our age) so
memorable, and so full of ouerthrowes and slaughters. But
it is not my resolution to weaue together an Ephemerides, or
a remembrancer of the siege euery day after day: it shall be
enough for me only to note and obserue some passages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> in the fifth moneth of this siege, seeing
his forces much to be diminished by the continuall erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the enemie vpon them, and skirmishes, and the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
worse then both; seeing also that part of the olde
Towne was swallowed vp as it were in Fordes; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
also the want of Victuals, which daily encreased, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
whereof he could not hope for, by reason of crosse

on with hopes of yeelding, till such time as he had auxiliary
Forces sent ouer to him; and then sent backe the Delegates
without doing any thing concerning yeelding, excusing
himselfe out of that Military axiome,</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat to delude the enemy by trickes, is not onely
lawfull, but also commodious, and sometimes very
fruitfull.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And wittily by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing in a scoffing sort, he did entreat them
to pardon him, if by reason of vrgent necessity, he should do
so againe, since that with the safety of his honour he could
doe no otherwise, by reason that now he had receiued aide,
and other necessaries for the warre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:27506:187"/>
The Arch-Duke being hereupon sorely vexed, cast in
<hi>Veres</hi> teeth, that he knew better how to ouercome by deceit
then by valour; and the 14. day after hee thundered vpon
the Fortresses before the walls with 18. great pieces of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
about the euening the Sea ouerflowing, hee droue
out 2000. olde trained Souldiers against their wills, to set
vpon the olde Towne, the Horsemen following them close
at the backe. But Generall <hi>Vere,</hi> and Sir <hi>Horatio</hi> his brother,
who with a choice Band was euery where as occasion serued,
droue them backe thrice very valiantly. They that set vpon
the Easterne part, being it was somewhat late before they
began, in seasonable time, and yet not without some damage
retired backe againe, by reason the Tide came vio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ently in
vpon them. They that were allotted to assault <hi>Helmont,</hi> and
<hi>Erinace,</hi> the two Fortresses, and the trench of the English,
easily tooke them, by reason that the Souldiers were called
forth from thence to defend other places; two thousand of
them being sent to the Westerne arme of the Sea (which
they call <hi>Gullet)</hi> did presently take <hi>Semilunula,</hi> which was
forsaken; from whence they were driuen out againe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
many of them being lost, whilest they fled confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for feare the water should rise and hemme them in. Nine
great pieces of Ordnance placed against the West gate,
thundering forth not single Bullets, but chained together,
like a tempest, and sometimes Lead and Iron tooles, did so
ouercome the Assaulters of the West gate, and the Sand hill,
that they receiued a very miserable ouerthrow: and in the
middest of the assault, the Sea comming in vpon them, and
the Scouts shewing themselues, they were so affrighted, that
casting away their Armes, Ladders, and draw bridges, they
gaue themselues ouer either to the slaughter of the Garriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that sallied out vpon them, or the fury of the Sea that
followed closevpon them. The Arch-Duke not a whit ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with this losse of his men, lay very hard still at the siege,
although with very small hope of obtaining his desires, by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:27506:187"/>
reason that he could not hinder prouision, nor new supplies
of Souldiers which daily came in; neither could he find any
place for vndermining, there being so many Fortresses placed
euery where. And now Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> hauing repaired the
breaches that were made, being recalled by the States, who
euery fiue moneths adiudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d it fit to send a new Gouernour,
and fresh Souldiers, resigned his place to <hi>Fredericke Dorpe,</hi>
who (euen as all his Successours) for three whole yeares, and
about a hundred dayes, valiantly and laboriously more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himselfe against the furious assaults of the Seas, then
the enemies, who but a little molested him.</p>
            <p>Certainly, happy had it beene with that warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if so be that the Sea had vtterly swallowed it vp; for
whilest the most warlike Souldiers of the <hi>Low Countries,
Spaine, England, France, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> contended for
a barren piece of Sand, it became their common Sepulchre,
although to their eternall honour. But these things belong
properly to the writers of the <hi>Low Country</hi> affaires; but yet
it may belong to vs to know and remember those worthy
Englishmen that died there: the chiefest among them were
the <hi>Veres</hi> Brothers, Sir <hi>Edward Cecill,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Ogle,</hi> Sir
<hi>Charles Fairfax,</hi> Coronell <hi>Lawrence Dutton,</hi> and Coronell
<hi>Drake, Carpenter,</hi> Serieant Maior, Captaine <hi>Holcroft, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
Dutton, Greuill, Wilford, Humphreyes, Drake, Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Herbert, Frost, Madeson, Gerard, Butler, Rogers,</hi> and
<hi>Dennis Connigraue.</hi> Neither let vs forget the valour of <hi>Iohn
Carew,</hi> a Cornish young man, who hauing his arme burst
off by the force of a great piece of Ordnance, and shot a good
way from him, with an vndaunted minde (all his fellowes
sorely lamenting) he went and brought it in his other hand
into the Towne, and shewing it to the Surgeon, <hi>Behold,</hi> said
he, <hi>the arme that to day at dinner serued all my body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This siege brought the King of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Cales,</hi> from
whence is a short iourney ouer into <hi>England,</hi> on purpose to
prouide and strengthen the borders of his Kingdome.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:27506:188"/>
which when the Queene vnderstood, she sent ouer to him
Sir <hi>Thomas Edmonds</hi> to see him, and congratulate his health
with him. He againe to acknowledge this courtesie, sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
into <hi>England</hi> to the Queene, Marshall <hi>Byrone,</hi>

               <hi>Aruerne,</hi>

entertained at <hi>Basing</hi> with such humanity, and dismissed
them so courteously, that they much blazoned forth her
meeke affablenesse, seasoned both with wisdome and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
That truely which the French Writers report,
that the Queene shewed to Marshall <hi>Byrone,</hi> and the rest of
the French, the braines of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> in her priuy
Chappell; or as others will haue it, fastened to a post or
stake, is most ridiculous, for his braines and body were true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both buried together. Indeed, certaine it is, that amongst
her talke with them, she very sharply blamed the Earle of
<hi>Essex,</hi> concerning his vngratitude towards her, and his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised
consultations, and his scornfull contumacy, in not
begging pardon for his offence; and that she wished that the
most Christian King of <hi>France,</hi> would rather vse towards
his Subiects a milde kinde of seuerity, then a dissolute cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency;
and that he would in time cut off the heads also of
those that intend or plot any innouations in the state or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
the publique quiet.</p>
            <p>This aduise of the Queene might haue well frighted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
<hi>Byrone</hi> from his wicked designes, which he had already

the force of his destinie rushing on him so besotted his blind

            <p>Shortly after, the Queene hauing returned out of the

The brightnesse of a Princesse Maiesty hath not so blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

with me more then Iustice. The glorie of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name of a King may deceiue vnskilfull and vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Kings, as guilded pills doe a sicke patient. But I
am none of those, for I know that the Common-wealth
ought to be gouerned for the good only of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are
committed to it, and not of him to whom it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and that the King must giue account of it before

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:27506:189"/>
that by Gods helpe I haue so gouerned my Kingdome
as I haue done; and that I haue such Subiects, for
whose good I would leaue Kingdome, or life it selfe.
I desire, that what other men haue trespassed in by
false suggestion, be not imputed to me, to whom the
testimony of my cleare conscience is a sufficient excuse
for me. You cannot chuse but know that Princes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants

Princes, neither can they looke through all things, who
are continually troubled with great throngs of greater

               <note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against transporting money into Ireland.</note> And then we
shall obserue, that about this time there came out a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
(which also <hi>Henry</hi> 7. had forbad by Law) that no
man should transport English money into <hi>Ireland,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that either the Rebels get it to themselues, and purchase
their prouision with it; or the Merchants conuey it into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forreigne Nations, to the great losse and detriment of
this Kingdome.<note place="margin">Deliberation about alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Irish Coine.</note> Wherefore now there was great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
about altering the money in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and mingling
some Brasse with it, by reason that the warre in <hi>Ireland</hi> stood
them in yearely 160000. pounds sterling. Hereupon others
thought the charge of the warre would be lesse, and that all
good and lawfull money in <hi>Ireland</hi> would be put away in
exchange in <hi>England;</hi> and that so the Rebells being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of good and lawfull money, would be barred of all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with forreigne Nations, and be necessarily much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
weakened. Others argued, that this change of Coyne
would be very preiudiciall to the Queenes credit, and good
report, and the losse of Subiects be much thereby encreased.
That the good money could not be transported ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great charges of the Queene; and that the gaine of this
new Coyne in <hi>England,</hi> would not answer the charges of
the very bringing ouer of it (if the account should be cast
vp right) much lesse, if so be the monie were coined in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> where a Mint were with great charges to be erected,
and mony-makers hired at farre greater expences. Also, that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:27506:190"/>
thereby they could not hinder the Irish Traffique with
Forreigners, when the Merchants know there is Siluer in
the new Coyne, which they know for to separate from
Brasse easily, and who care not whether they take one piece
of money, or three of the same value; vrging, that besides
there was a doubt whether the Souldiers would not muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for their pay would then be shortened.</p>
            <p>But for all that <hi>Buckhurst</hi> Lord Treasurer, very skilfull
in money matters, with much adoe got of the Queene, that
the money might be altered for a while, but afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
to it's greatest value, which he vrged by reason of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
(for that was the Law of the time:) and which the
Queene (although she was faine to grant it) yet could say,
that it would be preiudiciall to her credit, but worse to her
Army.<note place="margin">The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pay alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without any tumult or mutiny.</note> But yet for all that, it was finished without any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
or commotion in all the Army, to the great happinesse
of the Queene, which exercised her strict authority ouer her
Souldiers, and yet lost not her loue. Certainly the Army
did sustaine great losse by this alteration of Coyne, and the
Queene got but very little good, if any at all: If any got, it
was those that had let monies out, whose onely couetousnes
was thought first to haue broacht this businesse. The Lord
Deputy,<note place="margin">The Lord Deputy sets on towards the Rebels.</note> assoone as he had receaued this their Deliberation,

<hi>Moghery,</hi> where he kept his Souldiers to hard worke,
who by cutting downe a wood, had made a very difficult
way easie and passageable; and then he built a Fort. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the vsurping <hi>Mac-Genises</hi> out of <hi>Lecall,</hi> and subdued
all the Castles of the Rebels, euen as farre as to <hi>Armach,</hi> and

In the meane time <hi>Iohn O-Doghert</hi> being dead in <hi>Tir-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi>
the Deputy declareth his Sonne Heire,<note place="margin">And Henry Docwray on the other part.</note> because his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
possessed some lands in the English right; and he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
ouer his Inheritance to <hi>Hugh Boy</hi> and <hi>Phelim Reaugh,</hi>
his Guardians. This so heinously molested <hi>O-Neale Garue,</hi>
that forthwith he flies vpon the young mans inheritance,
out of an imaginary right he thought he had, as if all the
Land that was in <hi>Tir-Conell</hi> belonged to him; &amp; he tooke it
as heinously that the Deputy thought not so too, although
hee promised indifferently to heare both parties. Yet at
length <hi>Henry Docwray</hi> with faire promises asswageth <hi>O-Neale
Garue,</hi> and at last enticeth him to the English party:
and lest he should be idle, hauing assaulted <hi>Mac-Swine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh,</hi>
he droue away a braue prey: but at his earnest suite,
and swearing fealty he restored it againe, and receaued Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages,
whom a little after, <hi>Mac-Swine</hi> breaking his faith, he
hung vp. Afterwards wasting his Country, hee brought
him to that passe, that hauing giuen Hostages againe, hee
was glad to keepe his promise better. After that, he laid waste
the Countrey of <hi>Sleugh-Art,</hi> woody and boggish, of some
fifteene miles extension, <hi>O-Neale Garue</hi> being still his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
Then he tooke <hi>Dery-Castle,</hi> and strengthened <hi>Newton</hi>

reason of necessities which he wanted, and the enemie that
blockt vp his passage, he could not come to the Deputy, the
Deputy checking him, admonished him that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
this his negligence with some famous exploit, which,
hauing gotten opportunity, he did accordingly. For being
informed by <hi>O-Neale Garue,</hi> that there were Souldiers mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
out of <hi>Tir-Conell</hi> against the Deputy, and that <hi>Done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi>
Monastery neere <hi>Ballashanon,</hi> was peopled but with a

               <hi>O-Donell</hi> at the returning of the Lord Deputy comes
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:27506:191"/>
with all his Forces to <hi>Donegall,</hi> fiercely armed and prouided
for the destruction of the English. He eagerly besets it thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whole daies, shooting continually as if they had gotten
victory: The Monastery being by chance set on fire in the
night: and yet for all that the English valiantly sustained the
siege.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things succeed so prosperously in these
quarters, behold many write vnto the Lord Deputy,<note place="margin">Rumours concerning the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards sailing towards Mounster, calls the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty backe.</note> and

and preuent the enemy <hi>without</hi> as well.</p>
            <p>The Deputy therefore (not to loose that which hee had

            <p>And now the warre being remooued into <hi>Mounster,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs thither too. <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> and the Rebels of <hi>Mounster,</hi> by

by much entreating, praying, and protesting, that hee
would send ouer to them the Rebels in <hi>Mounster,</hi> some aide

Sir <hi>George Carew</hi> to preuent this, hauing found the titular

it best first to seize vpon <hi>Limricke,</hi> as neighbouring vpon

Land both) and shortly brought it to an absolute yeelding.</p>
            <p>And now Sir <hi>Richard Leuison</hi> Vice-Admirall of the Seas,
hauing beene sent out of <hi>England</hi> to stop the passage of the

Spaniards, and come too late, blockes vp the Spaniards in
the Hauen: whereupon the English (both by Sea and Land)
begin to batter the Towne, and hardly to besiege it: But it
was growne a great deale more remisse after, by reason that
Sir <hi>Richard Leuison</hi> with his Marriners set forth after two

            <p>All the same time was <hi>Carew</hi> sent out from the Campe

fiue hundred horse, being triumphing in the hope of a sure
victory, by reason they were more in company, and better
prouided: and on the otherside, the English were sore wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with a winter siege, and shut vp from prouision, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
spent with pouerty and hunger.</p>
            <p>The Deputie, for all these difficulties, plies the siege as
strongly as he can, and fortifies the Castles with new works.
On the 21. of December <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> shewes himselfe from a

The night following the Spaniards rush forth of the Towne,
and the Irish endeauour to get into it; but both failed of

            <p>The Moone shining the next night, the Lord Deputy
commanded Sir <hi>Henry Poore</hi> to leade forth eight troupes of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:27506:193"/>
olde Souldiers, and to set them in battle array at the West
part of the Campe. Sir <hi>Henry Greames</hi> that was Master of

            <p>The Lord Deputy, with President <hi>Carew,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard

they rush into the midst of the Enemies Armie, and
breake through them. <hi>Tirell</hi> yet with the Spaniards stood
firmely in their places, wherefore the Deputy marcheth on

vpon them with three Regiments of Sir <hi>Oliuer Saint-Iohns,</hi>

that their eruption out of the Towne was very dangerous,

            <p>The day after that, the Lord Deputy causeth Sir <hi>Iosias

which he had left vnperfect, and bring his Rampiers neerer

the Lord Deputy, yea, though he were an enemy;
complaining that the Irish were weake, and impotent, vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to military exercises, and (which he feared) perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
That he indeed was sent only in succour of two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

they should haue prouision for their money, without any

that onely, that saylings might be secured from Pyrates and

sayling and fishing in the Irish Sea, betweene <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> although they were Lords of those shoares, aswell

            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Danes</hi> propounded, that since their Kings
Father allowed of their Nauigations, which was very full
of damage to him, for the Queenes sake; that now the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the English should redeeme the same for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

            <p>That goods surprized on each side might be restored ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to equity and honesty.</p>
            <p>They grieuously complained then of the English Pirates;
requesting, that although (by reason of the heate of the war)
the Pirates insolency could not well be repressed; yet, that
by seuerity of punishment they might be kept vnder a little:
or that otherwise they must allow of <hi>Arrests</hi> to repaire their
iniuries and losses; because it should principally concerne
the King, to see that his Subiects suffer no losses.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that the English ought not to complaine of their
transporting warlike munition into <hi>Spaine,</hi> by reason that
they transport so little, that the Spaniard was but little the
better for it, and might easily want for all their supply.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">The treaty breakes off.</note> after that they had spent two moneths in these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
by writings on both sides exhibited, the <hi>Danes</hi>
beyond all expectation certifie the English, that they had no
power to take notice of, or to reforme the Leagues, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away, or lessening the tolls; or of granting leaue for
fishing in the <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Island</hi> Seas, without the speciall

(which mooued much admiration) they gaue warning to the

                  </gap>e,</hi> vnder the paine
whereby other fishings haue beene heretofore inhibited.</p>
            <p>The English on the other side made protestation in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
words concerning the nullity and inualidity of this
Inhibition; as also of any other declaration which should be
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:27506:200"/>
made contrary to the League. Lastly, when they could no
otherwise agree, then to referre to the Princes on both sides,
what had beene done, and what had beene gone through
with; and that the <hi>Danes</hi> had promised their diligence to
intercede with the King for the publication of Tolls regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in a Booke, whereby they might be certaine of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
number, and waight; and not feare to haue them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
according to the pleasure of the Toll-takers: And that
in case of confiscation, those goods should be seized vpon,
and confiscated, that were concealed, and not named: The
Englishmen being content with these promises of the <hi>Danes,</hi>
the whole matter (the right of the Queene, and the Realme
not any way infringed) was suspended, and prorogued till
another time.</p>
            <p>Whilest these things were in controuersie betweene both

            </p>
            <p>Then they shewed, that their mischieuous practises
against the Common-wealth had disturbed all, and much
empaired the Catholique religion, and that they were the

            <p>Then they shewed, that for all this in 10. yeares follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

whom she might haue proceeded Legally, and executed
them too.</p>
            <p>Then they shewed, that from that time, there were Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries

            <p>In the middest of this combating with Bookes, (whether
in earnest,<note place="margin">Iesuites and Secular Priests bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> or deceitfully vndertaken) the Councell came to
finde out, that both the Iesuites and the Priests in this matter
secretly conspired to withdraw the Subiects of the Queene
from their obedience to her, and to excite the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
to the maintenance of the Romish Religion, euen with
Armes.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Queene by Proclamation commanded the
Iesuites and Secular Priests belonging to them, to depart the
Kingdome: as for the rest that seemed to be mediators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
both, they had two moneths allotted to resolue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no they would professe loyalty to the Queene; if
not, to he gone; and neither of both sorts euer to returne
againe, except they will hazard the punishment of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and without doubt this Proclamation came out by the great
prouidence of God, to auert a great meditated mischiefe.
For amongst these affaires <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> (as hee himselfe
afterwards confessed) and <hi>Tesmund</hi> a Iesuite, being sent for
by some of them into <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnderwent most pernicious
consultations to cut off the Queene, and to exclude <hi>Iames</hi> of
<hi>Scotland</hi> from his Right of inheritance.</p>
            <p>And not onely these in <hi>England,</hi> but also in the <hi>Low

            <p>I doe not well know whom the Marshalls confession de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected;

            <p>That he had allotted the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to succeed in the

            <p>That he had conspired to betray the vnited Prouinces to

had no Iurisdiction in such matters as those.</p>
            <p>That he tooke exception against his accusers, which in
case of Treason is not lawfull to doe.</p>
            <p>Concluding, that these things were nothing but tergiuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
in detracting all Iudgements,<note place="margin">He askes Q. Elizabeths counsell what he should doe with him.</note> and arrogating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the Kings authority.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he asketh councell of the Queene what hee
should doe in this matter.</p>
            <p>She answereth him by her Leager in <hi>France,</hi> that she was
exceeding sorry to heare of these things; and that she estee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med
it great honour done to her, that he would impart it vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:27506:202"/>She much commended his moderate minde, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suggested by so great dangers, yet was rather guided by
the councell of his friends, then the affection of his owne
selfe.</p>
            <p>As concerning the councell which he required, she made
answer,<note place="margin">The Queens answere.</note> that if the proofes were as manifest against him, as the
obiections were odious, he should do well to proceed legally
against him; but that it was dangerous for her to councell
him to any thing, till such time as the proofes were cleare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, left perchance she should offend God, if so be he
were innocent; or offend the King, if he should suspect his
own safety to be neglected; wherefore, that she held it most
fitting in so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>doubtfull a case, to be silent. Yet withall, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questeth
the King to vse both iudgement and conscience in
his councell, and accurately examine both the accusations
and confessions, to see whether or no they come from men
of trust, vncorrupted, and no way suspected of partiality; by
reason that commonly no mans innocency can protect him
from others base calumny. Withall informing him, that
bare assertions are but slender proofes to informe the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a iust Iudge, against a man of so well-tried vertue and
valour: As also, that those obiected crimes, being not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
prooued, did seeme as incredible to be fathered on such
a man, as they are in their owne nature execrable. For, who
would belieue (said she) that hee, being brought vp in the
feare of God, and continuing so long in an vnspotted loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
euen in greatest dangers both towards his King and
Countrey, should euen imagine now such mischieuous villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
against so well a deseruing Prince: or euer ioyne councell
with men both of lost estates and hopes, with whom there
was neuer any conformity of manners, or religion; and
from whom hee could not but expect perfidious dealing?

without an answere.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then he constantly affirmed, that those things obiec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed,
were most true. Then he recalls the benefits he had be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him, as first, that he numbred him amongst his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
then that he procured him a rich match with the heire
of the Family of <hi>Bouillon;</hi> that he had set him in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Sedan;</hi> that he honoured him amongst the Nobles of
the Inward Admission; that he made him Duke, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall:
and that once he had resolued to shew mercy to him,
if he would come aske pardon; but now, since he scorned it,
and out of an ill conscience, since he fled away he saw no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of shewing mercy now againe to him.</p>
            <p>Then he added, how that in the like case he interceded
with the Queene for the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> till hee vnderstood

               </gap>einousnesse of his fact, and then he gaue ouer.</p>
            <p>The Embassador returned, that the Queene only thought
well of the Duke, because hitherto he had shewen his loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and valour towards his King and Country; but that she
would be very sorry if that the obiections should be found
true, as it was in <hi>Essexes</hi> case; and that then she wou'd detest
and hate him from her very heart. Concluding, that this her
admonition proceeded from no other ground, then her
minde troubled, aswell for the Kings safety and security as
her owne.</p>
            <p>If we may belieue the French Writers,<note place="margin">The opinion of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter.</note> and the politick'st

them those Offices now in peace, which before they
possessed in time of warre. They (I say) tooke it very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously,
as if the King suspected their loyalty; and hereupon
being also mooued with other suggestions, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

on euery side, with great Military skill, and greater

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:27506:205"/>
into the Priuie Chamber, (where the Deputy, encircled
with a multitude of warlike men, sate in his Throne) in the
very threshold with a deiected countenance falls <hi>Tir-Oen</hi>
vpon his knees. And hauing kneeled a while, he was wished
by the Deputy to come neerer; whereupon arising, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
come some few steps, he falls againe downe vpon his
knees; saying,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Acknowledge, and aske pardon for my offences
against God, and my most gratious Prince and
Mistresse; to whose Princely clemency I doe now
flie as to an holy Anchor; entreating her to dispose of
my life and fortunes as she pleaseth; and yet humbly
wishing, that as heretofore I haue felt her beneficency,
and but lately her power; so now I may feele her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and mildnesse, and become an euerlasting example
and patterne of her clemency: Truely, my age is not
so farre come vpon me; neither is my body so much
decayed, or my courage impaired, but that by my
future valiant, and loyall seruice, I may expiate the
sinne of my rebellion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In processe of his speech, when he began to complaine
against the enuy of some towards him, that occasioned most
of his offences, the Deputy interrupted him, telling him very
maiestically (which was eloquence enough for a Souldier)
that no excuse ought to be sowed ouer such a great fault; after
that he commanded him to depart aside; and the next day
after he carried him with him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with intent to
send him from thence ouer into <hi>England</hi> to the Queene, to
let her deale with him as she pleased.</p>
            <p>Thus the rebellion of <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> which began out of priuate
discontents mingled with ambition, and was nurst vp with
the contempt and parsimony of <hi>England,</hi> till such time that
(vnder pretence of restoring the Romane Religion) it spread
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:27506:206"/>
ouer all <hi>Ireland,</hi> being strengthened with many mens too
much credulity, and the secret fauour of some in authority,
and one or two happie successes, Spanish succour, and the
Popes Indulgences. Thus (I say) this rebellion, that also
was still lengthened and prolonged by the enuy of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
one against another, by the bipartite command, by the
auarice of the olde Souldiers, by the craft of <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> and
his counterfeit submissions and Truces, and by the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bought by villaines for money, and by the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie

in their swiftnesse of flight, then abode in warre, now at

happy command of the Lord <hi>Montioy</hi> Deputy, (created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
E. of <hi>Deuonshire)</hi> was most fortunately finished.</p>
            <p>The Queene,<note place="margin">The Queene falls sicke.</note> who hitherto, by reason of her abstinence
from wine, and moderate dyet, which she said was the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
part of phisicke, enioyed perfect health, now entring
into her Climactericall yeare, to wit seauenty, began some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to be sensible of defect of health and strength, which
the indisposition of the aire towards the end of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
being a filthy windy and rainy day, much improoued,
when she remooued from <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>Richmond,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to refresh her olde age with quietnesse, and to giue her
selfe to godlinesse wholly. Vpon which day, as if she were
about somewhat else, (I know not whether she thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or prophesied of her death) she said to the Admirall,
whom she dearely loued,</p>
            <q>
               <p>MY Throne is a Throne of Kings, neither ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but my next Heire to succeed me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Courtiers obserued her more then ordinarily to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
prayers and Sermons; and they also report, that she
then commanded a Ring (with which at her Inauguration
she married her selfe to her Kingdome) to be cut off from her
finger, which hauing beene neuer puld off, had euen growne
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:27506:206"/>
into her flesh. This they tooke for ill lucke to come, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a diuorce shortly betweene her and her Kingdomes,
to whom that Ring married her. In the beginning of her
sicknesse the Almonds of her Iawes did swell suddenly, and
grew lancke againe suddenly; then her appetite to meate
grew sensibly worse and worse; whereupon she became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sad, and seemed to be much grieued at some thing
or other: whether or no it were by reason of the violence of
her sicknesse, or out of her want of <hi>Essex,</hi> (as many of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
belieued) or rather, that (after so great charges of
warre) because she was perswaded to pardon <hi>Tin-Oen</hi> the
Authour; or rather, because that by some whisperings, and
Letters from the King of <hi>France,</hi> she had heard that most of
her Nobility in priuate Letters and Messengers curried fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
already with the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> adoring him as the
rising Sunne, and neglecting her as ready to set. And this
certainly she too much belieued, (by reason of the vice of
her Sex, and olde age, which is alwaies suspitious.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed was it a bare suspition in her, for many of her
Courtiers, besides some Ladies, who least of all ought to
haue done it, by reuolting from her, almost forsooke her;
(when indeed she was nothing altered in her selfe from what
she was, but they onely in their opinion.) Whether or no
it were that they saw her neere her end, or whether or no
they were weary with her long Reigne, (for so pleasing is
alteration and change to the nature of man, that there is an
irkesomnesse euen of good things of long continuance;) or
whether or no out of too credulous couetousnesse of nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and alterations, they despised the present case, and expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted
better: some forgetting her but late benefits, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fault with the times, it may be out of a Court-mystery,
onely to curry fauour with the Successour, and all this, in a
halfe opinion and conceit, that the discrediting of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
would proue a great delight to the Successour. Insomuch
that some vnder this pretence found fault with others, and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:27506:207"/>
others propounded the sending for a Successour, whilest the
Queene was yet but of sickly health, being run-wayes in
minde, though they stayd at home.</p>
            <p>These things so grieued the Queene, that she accounted
her selfe a wretch forsaken, and the indignation of her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wrackt out such words from her.</p>
            <q>
               <p>THey haue yoaked my necke; I haue none now to
trust: my estate is turned topside turuey.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And so witty was their more ciuill disloyalty and treason,
that to encrease this great discontent in the Queene, they
would put in her head, how that her authority grew weaker
and weaker amongst the people, when as onely the people
(alwaies enuying the command and authority of some great
ones) onely complained against the irregular power and
might of some, if not aboue, yet growne as great, as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
her selfe.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, when the rumour began to be common, that
her sicknesse encreased, and that she (as alwayes heretofore
she had done) refused all Physicke; It is impossible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
with what nimble hast the more zealous, and Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
sorts, and all ambitious kinde of men, and flatterers, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man in conceit to perfect his own hopes, posted night and
day to <hi>Scotland,</hi> both by Sea and Land, to worship the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
King, and to curry grace and fauour; whose succession
indeed the Queene, although, in policy, she forbore in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
to speake of it, yet in her heart she alwaies fauoured;
euen as all men of all sorts, who had cast their affections and
eyes vpon him, the apparant Heire of the Crowne; for all
that false rumour of the marriage of the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> the
Daughter of his Vncle; for all the French Ambassadour
thought to hinder the vniting of both Kingdomes into one
Dominion, in one King.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of March a kinde of numnesse and
frowardnesse vsuall to olde age, began continually to possesse
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:27506:207"/>
her; insomuch that she would sit and say nothing, eate no
meat, and wholly giue her selfe to meditation; being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
if any spake to her but the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
with whom she vsed very often, and very deuoutly to
pray, till such time as her speech failed her: and after that, she
willingly heard him, and within her heart prayed, when
she could not speake. At which time the Lord Admirall tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the rest of the Councell what the Queene departing
from <hi>Westminster</hi> spake by the way concerning her Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour:
it seemed good to them that he, the Lord Keeper, and
the Secretary should goe to her, and recall it to her minde
againe, signifying that the intent of their comming was to
vnderstand her pleasure for her Successour.</p>
            <p>The Queene almost out of winde, made answere, I haue
said,</p>
            <q>
               <p>MY Throne is the Throne of Kings; no ordinary
man shall succeed me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Secretary asking what she meant by those words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Will, <hi>said she,</hi> that a King succeed me, and what
King, but my neerest Kinsman the King of Scots?</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then being admonished by the Archbishop, to haue her
thoughts onely vpon God.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Doe, <hi>said she,</hi> neither goeth my minde astray from
him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And when she could not vse her tongue as an Instrument
of prayer, with her hands and eyes she directed to God the
deuotion of her heart; praying euen in this, that she seemed
to grieue because she could not pray.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, vpon the 24. of March, being the Eue of
the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same day whereon she was borne) being called out of the
prison of her flesh, into her heauenly Country, she quietly
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:27506:208"/>
departed this life, in that good manner of death as <hi>Augustus</hi>
wished for himselfe; being now in the fiue and fortieth
yeare of her Raigne, and of her age the seuentieth; an age,
and a Raigne, to which not any one King of <hi>England</hi> before
her, euer reached vnto.</p>
            <p>The sad desire of her, which her death bequeathed to all
<hi>England,</hi> was amply paralell'd with the hopes conceiued of
the vertues of her famous Successor, who within few houres
after her death was (with the acclamations and ioyfull
shoutes of the people) proclaimed King. But yet let no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion
euer rot the perpetuity of her fame and glory; but let
her liue in the very hearts of all true Englishmen, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the happy memory of posterity. Being that she was
a Queene, who hath so long, and with so great wisedome
gouerned her Kingdomes, as<note place="margin">* In the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader in his Basilicon Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> to vse the words of her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour,

time, or since the daies of the Romane

or no hee were a

but, which giues
some probability to the
matter, certaine it is, hee
had his education vnder
the Iesuites beyond Sea;
and the occasion of his
comming to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was in this wise: <hi>Philip</hi>
King of <hi>Spaine</hi> presently after the death of <hi>Mary</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:27506:228"/>
Queene of Scots in <hi>England,</hi> willed the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> (the Gouernour of his Forces in the <hi>Low
Countries)</hi> in his name to promise to the King of
Scots both money and munition good store, if so
be he would attempt the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and
her Dominions, to reuenge the death of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Queene of Scots. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to
effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this businesse, sends ouer this <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi>
or <hi>Brusse,</hi> a Scottish man by birth, and of a Noble
Family, with great summes of monies, the better to
quicken his purposes. It chanced that at the very
same time (by the appointment of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rome)</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Dublin</hi> also was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
ouer thither, to promise to the King of
Scots the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> in marriage, if so be he
would but change his Religion, and turne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.
But the Bishop (by reason of the faithfull
loyalty and industry of the Chancellour <hi>Metellan,</hi>
to whom the King owed the preseruation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and Kingdome from destruction) being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
of his hopes, returned home againe with
little thankes for his labour. Amongst those whom
he retained at the time of his comming ouer, was
one <hi>William Creicton</hi> a Iesuite, and a Scottish man
too, who had heretofore beene Rector of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the Iesuites at <hi>Leiden:</hi> who, seeing his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
come short of his expectation, determined to
<pb facs="tcp:27506:228"/>
stay behinde himselfe, to see what hee could doe
with some of his friends there. The first whom
euer he broke withall concerning his minde, was
this <hi>Robert Brusse,</hi> whom he would faine haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to haue murthered the Chancellour of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who, as he said, alone nullified and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
all their plots and machinations. <hi>Brusse</hi>
being startled with the horrour of so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oule a deed,
absolutely denied to consent thereunto as a cruell
and vnconscionable demand. Afterwards (the
King and the Chancellour both being inuited to a
Banquet by a Nobleman of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the Romish Religion) this same <hi>Creicton</hi>
assailes <hi>Robert Brusse</hi> againe, that if so be he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
would not doe the businesse, he would giue
him some of the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> money, to giue
to the Nobleman, where the Banquet was, to
tempt him to the fact. But <hi>Brusse</hi> also denied that,
alleaging, that he had other businesse to doe there
with the monies; and also, that if it should be done,
it would be a great scandall and disgrace to them,
and occasion of their greater feare. After many
other passages, the Iesuite <hi>Creicton</hi> at last was very
instant with the said <hi>Brusse,</hi> if so be hee would
haue no hand in the businesse, to deliuer to him the
fifteene hundred Crownes which hee receiued of
the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> to distribute amongst three of
<pb facs="tcp:27506:229"/>
the Scottish Nobility, that should vndertake and
effect the businesse; by which meanes all scandall
and feare should be remooued from them, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
nothing to doe in so foule a murther. But
<hi>Brusse</hi> was very loath also to condiscend euen to
that, esteeming it an equall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inne to commit one,
or hire another, to a murther. Insomuch, that at
last, after the death of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> He accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this <hi>Brusse</hi> for a Traitour, because indeed hee
would not commit treason; whereupon poore
<hi>Brusse</hi> was imprisoned for fourteene moneths, and

of such, to his brother <hi>Hugh-Roe-Mac-Mahon,</hi>

hee could not be admitted to his Right, till hee had

what infinite fauoures and benifits God

of his Holinesse the Pope, and after that, are
the better prepared for theire iourney. But how

of S. <hi>Michael</hi> was first instituted by <hi>Lewis</hi> the
eleuenth of <hi>France,</hi> in the yeare of Grace, 1469.
and was then named, <hi>The order of my Lord S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</hi>
To euery Knight of this Order the King gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
a Coller of Gold, made of Scallops enterlaced
one within another, and doubly banded, fastened
on small chaines or mailes of gold. At the middest

of my Lord S. <hi>Michael,</hi> which must hang
down vpon the breast of him that weares it; which
they are bound to weare daily and openly about

and reuerence due to the Glorious Virgin

Conditions, Statutes, Orders, and Articles, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
are set downe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The chiefest reason that can be found of the
Institution of this Order, to the honour of <hi>S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
was certainly the ancient opinion that the
French haue, who belieue that S. <hi>Michael</hi> is the
<pb facs="tcp:27506:244"/>
Tutelary Angell and Guardian of all <hi>France:</hi>
Wherfore hee is called by them, <hi>Princeps imperij
Francorum:</hi> which name he receiued euer since he
appeared to <hi>Aubert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Auranches,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to build a Church vpon a Rocke in his
Diocesse called the <hi>Tombe,</hi> or <hi>Tombe-Helene.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they celebrate two great deliuerances, which
they attribute to Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> namely, when the
English besieged <hi>Orleans,</hi> in the yeare of Grace,
1428. where the Archangell S. <hi>Michael</hi> (they say)
visibly appeared vpon the Bridge of the City, and
fought against the English, and ouerthrew them.
And secondly, when <hi>Henry</hi> the Great reduced to
obedience the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> where there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in the shape of a young childe, about six or
seuen yeares olde, cloathed all in white, who (all
the time the King rendred thankes to God vpon
his knees, for this happy reduction) stood close by
his right side, and when he had done, immediatly
vanished. But concerning this order, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
that before any <hi>Knight</hi> elected come to the
<hi>Soueraigne</hi> of that Order, he must deliuer these or

it came to such an vnhappy perfection, that most,

their beliefe vnto it; Insomuch that Doctor
<hi>Whitaker,</hi> at that time <hi>Regius Professor</hi> in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity,
imployed the extremity of his endeauours,
in his Lectures, &amp; Sermons, and Disputations, to
crush the same, from getting farther Credit: as is

            <p>Vpon the receit whereof, his Grace of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
being desirous to compose these controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
appointed an Assembly at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> where
were present his <hi>Grace</hi> himselfe, <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>London,
Richard</hi> Elect of <hi>Bangor,</hi> besides Doctor <hi>Whitaker,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Tindall,</hi> and other learned Diuines. The
<pb facs="tcp:27506:248"/>
conclusion of it was, that by them there were
nine Articles drawne into seuerall heads, and from
the place where they were established, named, <hi>The
Articles of Lambeth;</hi> which set all things right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and reduced the Vniuersity to an vnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of beliefe: for, vpon their arriuall at <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
my <hi>French Doctor</hi> presently vanished; and shortly
after that, one <hi>Barret</hi> Fellow of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi>
hauing preached some of that new Doctrine lately
before, was compelled to recant publikely at Saint
<hi>Maries,</hi> by the appointment of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Duport</hi> Vice-Chancellour
of the Vniuersity. The Articles, by
reason I know very many haue beene desirous to
see them, I thought good to Transcribe out, as
they were printed beyond Sea.</p>

Treasury, as our Aduersaries speake.] For indeed it is
onely they that speake so, or conceiue any such
matter; and but some of them neither; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their learned Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that there is in the custody of the Church a
spirituall Treasury, mixed of the Passion of Christ,
and of his holy Saints, which is the foundation of
<pb facs="tcp:27506:253"/>
all Indulgences; yet he will giue leaue to others,
who in spight of him, will take it, to belieue no
such matter: For, <hi>Non defuerunt ex antiquis</hi> (saith
he himselfe) <hi>Theologis Scholasticis, qui tametsi Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentias
admitterent, tamen de Thesauro dubitarunt.</hi>
There haue beene some it seemes, who, though
they haue admitted of such <hi>godly deceits,</hi> as Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
are, yet they much haue doubted of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Treasury, which should be the foundation
of them. But, who were they that durst offer this
affront to this so common opinion? why, no lesse
men of their owne Iury, then their <hi>Major</hi> on the

<hi>Distinct. 4. quaest.</hi> 2, 3. as they are both arraigned
for it by <hi>Bellarmine, in Lib. 1. de Indulgent. cap.</hi> 2.
This was a chip of that blocke which was first
hewen by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, of whom their
owne <hi>Agrippa</hi> obserues, <hi>Bonifacius octavus primus
in Purgatorium extendit Indulgentias:</hi> That he was
the first, that euer extended the benefit of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as farre as the Purgatory flames. And indeed,
this rare Bird did first spring out of that fire: For,
as their Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> obserues, <hi>Caeperunt Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,
postquam ad Purgatorij cruciatus aliquandiù tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidatum

was no great vse of Indulgences, before they had
blowne vp Purgatory flames to such an height,
<pb facs="tcp:27506:253"/>
that silly proselytes began to swet to thinke on it,
and buy vp Indulgences to keep them coole from
it. Then, as <hi>Polydor Virgil lib. 8. de Inventor. Rerum

The first original of the Monarchy of <hi>Casteele,</hi> was
in this manner. <hi>Ordonius</hi> making warre against
the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> expected aid from foure of the Earles
of <hi>Casteele;</hi> who (it seemes) neglected his desires,
and contributed not to the warre. Hereupon <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi>
hauing ouercome the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> sends for
these foure Earles, giuing them his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for their safety and security; but hauing had
them once within his fingers, hee put them all to
death. The <hi>Castellians,</hi> that had heretofore beene
subiect to the King of <hi>Lions,</hi> put themselues here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in a rebellion, to reuenge this persidious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the King; and choosing and making to
themselues Iudges and Magistrates of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
they became in short time their own
Gouernours, from whence afterwards their Kings
descended. The story is plaine in <hi>Volateranus</hi> his
Commentaries, to this effect. <hi>Post haec</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius

&amp;c.</hi> It may be (saith he) they will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
that in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> the Embassador
of the Emperour was also the Embassadour of the
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> because the same man <hi>Charles</hi> the
fift, was both Emperour and King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> So
that, to the Emperours Embassadour they had no
reason to take exception, because he ought alwaies
to haue the precedency; but when as once the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles</hi> dyed, and that <hi>Claudius Fernandez</hi>
was substituted in the state of the Marquesse of
<pb facs="tcp:27506:256"/>
               <hi>Pesara</hi> for the K. of <hi>Spaine, Philip</hi> the second, then
the Embassadours of the French King, would not
onely not grant them place, but challenge it of
them: Whereupon, the controuersie grew so hot,
that it disturbed the quiet proceeding of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.
To preuent which mischiefe, the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the Spaniard abased himselfe as low as the
Secretary of the Councels seat; but not without
the decree of the Councell, that no preiudice from
thence should arise vnto his Master. To satisfie
this obiection, we answer, saith <hi>Valdesius,</hi> that as
the Embassadour tooke place being the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the Emperour, so he should doe also being
the Embassadour of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> because
the Embassadour of the French in the time when
the Embassadours of <hi>Spaine</hi> tooke place by reason
of the Emperour, made no protestation against it,
nor desired that it might not be preiudiciall to them
hereafter. A worthy answer without question, and
as good as another of his to as strong an argument;
who being conuinced with the Precedency giuen
from the Spaniard to the French in the Councel of
<hi>Constance</hi> that tooke the vpper hand, answeres ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confidently, <hi>Quod sedere ad dextram vel sinistram
non arguit semper eminentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loci, ut ex</hi> Varonio <hi>often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus.</hi>
That to sit on the right hand, argues no
precedency or superiority of place. I wonder what
<pb facs="tcp:27506:257"/>
then doth with him? Certainly, if it doth not, he
ought not so much to commend the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of his <hi>Iohannes Sylva,</hi> nor ought <hi>Iohn</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

neither was it done as it is here specified, before the
death of the Queene. For the Queene dying on
<pb facs="tcp:27506:258"/>
the 24. of <hi>March,</hi> the Lord Deputy <hi>Montioy</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
thereof, not till the seuen and twentieth. So
vpon the 28. day, the Lord Deputy being at <hi>Melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi>
wrote to Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> to cause <hi>Tir-Oen</hi>
to dispatch his comming to submit himselfe;
which he presently did, hauing met <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> on the
29. of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Toker,</hi> some fiue miles beyond <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganon.</hi>
On the 30. of <hi>March, Tir-Oen,</hi> and all of
them came to <hi>Mellifant</hi> in the afternoone, where
<hi>Tir-Oen</hi> (admitted into the Lord Deputies Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
submitted himselfe vnto him; but the next
day signed this submission following with his own
hand, and deliuered it vp to the Lord Deputy. The
forme was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Hugh O-Neale,</hi> by the Queene of <hi>England,
France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> her most gratious fauour, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Earle of <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> doe with all true and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
penitency prostrate my selfe at her Royall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eet, and
absolutely submit my selfe vnto her mercy, most sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
imploring her gratious commiseration, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
onely to her Princely clemency, without presuming
to iustifie my vnloyall proceedings against her sacred
Maies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y; onely most sorrowfully and earnestly desiring,
that it may please her Maiesty rather in some measure
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itigate her iust indignation against me, in that I doe
religiously vow that the first motiues of my vnnaturall
<pb facs="tcp:27506:258"/>
rebellion were neither practise, malice, or ambition, but
that I was induced first by feare of my life (which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
was sought by my enemies practise) to stand vpon
my guard; and afterwards, most vnhappily led, to make
good that fault with more hainous offences, which in
themselues I doe acknowledge deserue no forgiuenesse,
and that it is impossible for me in respect of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in any proportion, euen with my life to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
I doe most humbly desire her Maiesty to pardon
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as I haue already beene a sufficient argument
of her Royall power, hauing little left but my life to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
it selfe, so that it may now please her Maiesty to
make me an example of her Princely clemency, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
ornament of her high dignity. And that I may bee
the better able hereafter, with the vttermost seruice of
my life, to redeeme the foulnesse of my faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do most
humbly sue vnto her Maiesty, that she will vouchsafe to
restore me to my former dignity and liuing, in which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of a Subiect I doe most religiously vow to continue
for euer here after loyall, in all true obedience to her
Royall Person, Crowne, Prerogatiue, and Lawes, and
to be in all things as farre and as dutifully conformable
thereunto, as I or any other Noble man of this Realme
is bound, by the duty of a Subiect to his Soueraigne, or
by the Lawes of this Realme; vtterly renouncing and
abiuring the Name and Title of <hi>O-Neale,</hi> or any other
authority, or claime, which hath not beene granted or
<pb facs="tcp:27506:259"/>
confirmed vnto me by her Maiesty, and that otherwise
by the Lawes of this Realme I may not pretend iust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
vnto. And I doe religiously sweare to performe so
much, as is aboue mentioned, and the rest of these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
subscribed by my owne hand, as farre as shall any
way be in my power, and to deliuer such pledges for the
performance thereof, as shall be nominated vnto me by
the Lord Deputy.</p>
            <p>I doe renounce and abiure all forreigne power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
and all kinde of dependancy vpon any other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
but her Maiesty the Queen of <hi>England, France</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and doe vow to serue her faithfully against
any forreign power inuading her kingdomes, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
truly any practises that I doe, or shall know against
her Royall person, or Crownes: and namely, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
I doe abiure and renounce all manner of dependancy
vpon the King or State of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or Treaty with him
or any of his forces or confederates, and shall be ready
with the vttermost of my ability to serue her Maiesty
against him, or any of his forces or confederates.</p>
            <p>I doe absolutely renounce all challenge or intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the <hi>Vriaghts,</hi> or fostering with them, or other
neighbour Lords or Gentlemen out of my Countrey, or
exacting any Blacke Rents of any <hi>Vriaghts,</hi> or borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lords.</p>
            <p>I doe resigne all claime and title to any Lands, but
such as shall now be granted vnto me by her Maiesties
Letters Patents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27506:259"/>
Lastly, as the onely being a Subiect doth include all
the duties of a Subiect, so will I be content to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
here, and aduised by her Magistrates, and will be
conformable and assisting vnto them, in any thing that
may tend to the aduancement of her seruice, and the
peaceable gouernment of this Kingdome; as namely,
for the abolishing of all barbarous customes, contrary to
the Lawes, being the seeds of all inciuility, and for the
clearing of all difficult passages and places which are
the Nurseries of Rebellion, wherein I will employ the
labours of the people of my Country, in such sort, and in
such places, as I shall be directed by her Maiestie, or the
Lord Deputy, or Councell in her Name; and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
for my selfe, and the people of my Countrey, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
ciuill habitations, and such as shall be of great effect
to preserue vs against theeues, and any force, but the
power of the State, by the which we must rest assured to
be preserued, as long as we continue in our duties.</p>
            <p>And thus ended this long and tedious warre:
the very charges whereof, within these foure last
yeares and a halfe, amounted to no lesse then
1198717 pounds, 9 shil. and a penny,
besides great Concordatums, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
which happened.</p>
