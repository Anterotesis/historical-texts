            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſad and moſt deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Brethren, profeſſors of the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> with us, in the Kingdome of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as it hath very lately bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Letters from thence unto us, is the occaſion of turning me aſide (for the preſent) from that Scripture that I had intended to have proceeded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156711:3"/>
with, and of caſting me upon this; that ſo, as wee have a great opportunity from Hel, we may have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Heaven alſo, to excite and ſtirre you up, to quit your ſelves like the Children of GOD, and the redeemed of JESUS CHRIST, by drawing out the bowels of your compaſſions readily and freely unto thoſe, that are, or ought to be as deare to you, as your ſelves, and your owne Soules. The Author of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> was that Diſciple and Apoſtle whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved, that is, loved in ſpeciall manner above his fellowes: who (it ſeemes) as he received abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of the ſweet fruites and expreſſions of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in GOD, and in his Lord and Maſter JESUS CHRIST towards him, ſo did he abound propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably in his reciprocall affection towards GOD and JESUS CHRIST againe: the fire burned in vehemencie and ſtrength of heate according to the pile of wood that was layd upon it. And thus know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a double experience, the infinite ſweetneſſe and preciouſneſſe of this affection: he labours more then all the reſt of the Apoſtles, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and multiplie it in the hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD, both towards GOD, and towards one another. To paſſe by all other paſſages in his writings, wherein hee labours to promote the cauſe and Kingdome of this heavenly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in and neere about the Scripture read unto you, hee makes out with a high hand, and with many important arguments, to kindle this fire in the hearts of men, yea and to make it burne out into a vehement flame. <hi>Greater love hath no man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour John 15. 13.) <hi>then this, that a man ſhould lay down his life for his friend: and leſſer love then this ought no man to have</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> in effect in this place:) Therefore we ought alſo to lay down our lives for the <hi>Brethren.</hi> Not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156711:3"/>
ſo much as to mention any other of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, adjoyning neere unto the text both before and after it, whereby hee pleades like an Angell of GOD, for ſinceritie and truth and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this affection we ſpeake of; in this 16 verſe, being come to an argument or ground that hee ſaw could beare it, he raiſeth his demands in this kinde very high; and tells them (in effect) not onely that it ſtands them in hand, or that it is their duty ſimply to love one another, no nor yet to love one another in deed and in truth; but to love one another to the height, or to the higheſt pitch and ſtreyne of this affection: <hi>we ought alſo to lay downe our lives for the Brethren;</hi> which is nothing elſe (being interpreted,) but (as was ſayd) to love one another with the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteſt, and largeſt, and deepeſt affections that our hearts will hold. True it is, ſuch a demand as this, <hi>to lay down our lives for the Brethren</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth very high (as was ſayd) but behold an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at hand, that will juſtify it, and reduce it to a point of the greateſt reaſon, equitie and faireneſſe that can be. <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith hee in the former part of the verſe) <hi>have we perceived or knowne love, that hee,</hi> that is, JESUS CHRIST <hi>layd down his life for us:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: this was love indeed, this was love in the glory and exaltation of it, that our Saviour CHRIST ſo holy a perſon, ſo wonderfull in Glory and all manner of excellencie as he was, who had no bond or ingagement either of duty or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample upon him, ſhould freely and willingly part with his life for our ſakes, to accommodate and pleaſure us withall who were his enemies: but now for us, having ſuch a patterne and example before us to conceive by, and ſuch an infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156711:4"/>
upon us, as that love of CHRIST, is, and ſuch an advantage likewiſe as the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to us by that love of CHRIST is to facilitate and make eaſy any expreſſion of love whatſoever towards thoſe on whoſe behalfe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall require it: it is no great matter in us, it is but matter of equitie and duty in us, to be ſo farre raiſed and carried out in our affections of love towards thoſe that are our Brethren in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and partakers of like precious Faith with us, as to lay down, and part with our lives for them. We ſhall adde no more either for the dependance or meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>We ſhall from the paſſage recommend onely this one generall point of Doctrine unto you: <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>the higheſt and deepeſt expreſſions of love to thoſe that are Chriſts, are but matter of duty from Chriſtians when they ſtand in need of them.</hi> For we are to take the Apoſtles expreſſion or inference here, with ſuch a limitation as this: <hi>therefore we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren, viz.</hi> if they ſtand in need of them, or if we may accomodate and pleaſure them in any proportion or conſiderable good or benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not that we ought actually to doe it at all times (for then we ſhall be all bound to die immediatly) nor yet that we ought to doe it, when we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them in their neceſſities otherwiſe, no nor yet to accommodate them in matters of lighter conſequence, though (haply) they cannot otherwiſe be gratified or provided for, however I conceive this to be a caſe rarely incident, if incident at all, I meane that the common and ordinary affaires or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Chriſtians ſhould not poſſibly be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, but by the lives of other of their <hi>Brethren</hi> for them, but in this ſenſe and upon theſe termes,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156711:4"/>
we are all bound to lay down even our lives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Faith, when their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are great and ſore upon them, and the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of our lives may in likelyhood relieve them, or ſtand them in ſome ſpeciall ſervice, and there is no other mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es in appearance likely to do it. Therfore I include al theſe proviſo's and caſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, in that clauſe in the Doctrine, <hi>when they ſtand in need of them,</hi> laying it down thus, the higheſt and deepeſt expreſſions of love to thoſe that are <hi>Chriſts,</hi> are but matter of duty from their fellow Chriſtians, <hi>when they ſtand in need of them.</hi> The point lies large and full in the Scripture read unto you: ſo that we ſhall not need to adde much for the further proofe of it. Take we only a Scripture or two. <hi>So then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affectionately deſirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Gospell of God only, but alſo our own ſoules</hi> (i. our lives) <hi>becauſe you were deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. We ſee the Apoſtle here very glorious and high in expreſſing the tenor of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards this people: <hi>he was willing to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted even his own ſoule unto them, viz.</hi> if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had required it, if he had conceived that hee might have inriched them with peace or comfort by it. Whatſoever the intenſneſſe or pitch of his affection towards them was, he could not aſcend higher then this, in a way of expreſſion to them <hi>Greater love then this, i.</hi> a greater expreſſion or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of love then this, <hi>hath no man</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as we heard) <hi>that a man lay down his life for his friend.</hi> Now then I demand, whether in caſe <hi>Paul</hi> had actually performed, on their behalfe, what hee here profeſſeth himſelfe willing and ready to doe, that is, had indeed imparted his owne ſoule unto them, whether (I ſay) he had ſupererogated or no, or gone beyond the line of that which was his duty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156711:5"/>
to doe? Doubtleſſe that commandement Luk. 10. 27. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soule, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind,</hi> reacheth the utmoſt extent and point of the utmoſt abilitie that is in man: neither is it poſſible for any man to riſe in any expreſſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of love either to <hi>God</hi> or man, above it. So then, if <hi>Paul</hi> in laying down his life for the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> ſhould have done no more then what <hi>God</hi> required of him, in caſe their condition had required it, certainly he requires no leſſe of any man, when the neceſſitie of his Saints doe require it. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Scripture from the ſame pen of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alike importance. <hi>Who now rejoyce in my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for you, and fill up that which is behinde of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodies ſake, which is the Church,</hi> Col. 1. 24. Theſe <hi>ſufferings</hi> of the Apoſtle for theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that is, to accommodate them in the miniſtery of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> though (as he ſaith) <hi>he reioyced in them,</hi> yet (doubtleſſe) they tooke deepe of his outward man, and were grievous to the fleſh, and conſequently were great and weighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his love to them: and yet upon the ground lately mention'd, they were no more, then the demand of a good conſcience of him. Now <hi>Paul</hi> (and ſo any other faithfull miniſter of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi>) may be ſaid <hi>to fulfill,</hi> or fill up, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi> the remainders or wantings, or afterlings</hi> (as it were) <hi>of the ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> (to open this by the way) <hi>for the Churches ſake,</hi> when he deſiſted not from his worke and imployment of preaching the Goſpell for any perſecution, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loſſe or trouble be ſuſteyned thereby. There are two things (amongſt many others) of abſolute neceſſity (according to the counſaile and courſe of <hi>Gods</hi> ordinary diſpenſation) to accompliſh the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156711:5"/>
of his elect, of whom his body, that is, his Church conſiſts. Firſt, the making of a Goſpell. Secondly, the preaching or making knowne of this Goſpell. The Goſpell is no meanes of ſalvation unto any man, except it be revealed and made known unto him. Now <hi>the Sufferings of Chriſt,</hi> were of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſitie to conſtitute and make the Goſpell, and they are alſo of abſolute and intire ſufficiencie this way: <hi>Chriſt</hi> wants no ſufferings to be added to his, or to come up in the reere to ſecond his, for any ſuch purpoſe as this, to perfect the Goſpell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally in any kinde. But becauſe the making of a Goſpell, though never ſo compleate, rich, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, was not enough to effect and actuate the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Church, but the publiſhing and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Goſpell up and down the world, was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſarie: hence it cometh to paſſe, that the afflictions and ſufferings of <hi>Paul</hi> (and ſo of other Miniſters of the Goſpell) are neceſſarie too, over and above the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to bring the Church into an actuall poſſeſſion of her glorie. For Satan, the <hi>God</hi> of this world, will be ſure to take a courſe where he hath to doe, and as farre as the length of his arme will extend, that the Goſpell of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall not be effectually, and with power preached in the world without the trouble, and perſecution and ſufferings of thoſe, that ſhall put forth their hand to that Plough, and breake up the fallow ground of the world with it.

               </hi> as the other was by the Author of the <hi>Gospel</hi> himſelfe, But this by the way.

them, their being made all one heart (as it were) and one ſoule. <hi>Love</hi> (we uſe to ſay) is an affection of union: and when it is reciprocally and mutually fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and ſtrong, and raiſ'd to an excellent degree, though amongſt never ſo many, it makes a ſtrong conſolidation of all into one, ſo that every one hath (in effect) the ſame ſtrength, and the ſame wiſdome, and ſo every other perfection, which any other hath, yea or which they all have amongſt them: In ſuch a caſe, one man ſo perfected in one with others, though never ſo many, hath as much of every thing that is deſirable or good, as they all have together. Now then when thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in JESUS CHRIST, are thus <hi>made perfect in one,</hi> thus intimatly and mightily affecting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that entercourſe of Love, and thoſe glorious expreſſions of this affection, paſſing to, and fro, from time to time betweene them, cannot but be taken notice of by the world: and the interpretation of what they ſee and take notice of in this kinde, can lightly be no other (when their judgments and conſciences are but in any meaſure themſelves) then this, that that CHRIST, whoſe Diſciples and followers theſe men profeſſe themſelves to be, was (doubtleſſe) the Sonne of GOD, and hath appeared unto them, otherwiſe ſuch an excellent Spirit of <hi>Love</hi> which we ſee and behold, could not worke in them As <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> and his Nobles ſaw <hi>a fourth</hi> man in the Furnace, walking with thoſe three which he had caſt in, <hi>whoſe appearance was like the Sonne of God:</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:156711:9"/>We ſhould anſwere that objection here (but that we have no time.)

It is true, there are many factions and parties and combinations of men in the world, that ſeeme very deere, and deeply ingaged amongſt themſelves, that are ready to ſtand up to plead the cauſe one of another (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) even unto blood. But here is the difference betweene the affection of love, which ſeemes to rule in other Societies of men, and that which ruleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt true beleevers, when they are perfected in one: the reaſon, ground, or roote of that affection or deereneſſe which reigneth amongſt Chriſtians, is not any thing viſible, any thing ſavoring of the fleſh, nor can their enemies, the men of the world, ſatisfie their judgements or conſciences in conceiving ſo of it (though many times they ſatisfie one another in ſo ſpeaking) whereas the band wherewith other ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men are chain'd and link'd together, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſomewhat that is naturall, and which falls within the reach and comprehenſion of a naturall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156711:10"/>
and levell of that duty now preſented unto you, it is becauſe they doe not effectually <hi>ſtirre up the grace of God within them,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſomewhere ſpeakes, they bow downe their backs to the ſuggeſtions of the fleſh, whereas their ſtrength were it put forth accordingly, would ſerve them to goe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.

Secondly that a man or woman having obtained ſuch an excellent principle as this, a power of loving the Saints unfeignedly through the purifying of their hearts, are bound in a ſpeciall manner to give out themſelves fully and freely according to the nature, ſtrength, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this principle, to expreſſe themſelves in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent termes of love and reſpects unto them, as their neceſſities ſhall require it. This for the 7 and laſt reaſon. We addreſſe immediatly to the Vſe and application of the Doctrine, we ſhall be very briefe in particulars here.</p>
            <p>By way of Inſtruction (in the firſt place) we may<note place="margin">Vſe. 1. Inſtruction.</note> from the Doctrine obſerve ſundry particulars. As</p>
            <p>Firſt that the minde and good pleaſure of JESUS CHRIST, concerning his Saints and people on Earth, is, that you ſhould be a ſocietie or body of men and women in the world, animated and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:156711:11"/>
(as it were) mooved and acted by a ſpirit of love, as the life or ſoule of it, that you ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in this affection, above all other ſocieties of men whatſoever. Doubtleſſe he that commands us to lay down our lives one for another, commands us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a commandement involv'd and wrap'd up in this commandement, to maintaine a Spirit of moſt ardent and burning affection towards one another. A man can never be inſtructed or taught to die willingly by any other teacher or teaching whatſoever, but by <hi>Love,</hi> yea and that ſuch a <hi>Love,</hi> of ſuch a conquering and commanding power, that it muſt tread downe the ſtrength of a thouſand loves and deſires beſides, yea and many of theſe of ſoveraigne ſtrength and power alſo. To require a man <hi>to lay downe his life for the Brethren</hi> out of any other ground or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatſoever, then out of an affection of love to them, and that tranſcendently glorious, is (in effect) to bid him gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This likewiſe is by way of inſtruction obſervable from the Doctrine, That men doe but that which is their duty in this kinde, when they are enlarged in the greateſt meaſure, in the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their love towards their Brethren: if they ſhould give all their goods, and part with their whole ſubſtance to them, yea, if they ſhould lay downe their necks, and jeopardie their lives for their ſakes, yet there is nothing to boaſt of in all this: they are never-the-leſſe to remaine vile and little in their own eyes. If their right hand doth never ſo much in this kinde, yet ſhould not their left hand know any thing at all of it. Heights of duty ſhould no waies prejudice or hinder the depths of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>So likewiſe yee</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156711:11"/>
               <hi>when you ſhall have done all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants: we have done that which was our duty to doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve Thirdly (by way of Inſtruction) what gratious and bleſſed proviſion the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath made, for the poore and weake, and diſtreſſed ones in any kinde in his Church. Hee hath ingaged the rich and ſtrong, and thoſe that are at libertie and that have meanes of reliefe or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in any kinde, in their hand, to be ready at all times to miniſter unto them. The neceſſities of any, as farre as they are made knowne, are a ſummons from Heaven to call the reſt to looke after them and relieve them. If this royall Law were duly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church of CHRIST, one ſufferer ſhould create and raiſe up many relievers; neither ſhould there be heard the complaint or crie of any man ſinking, whilſt there remaines any one ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. It is a ſigne, that the minde of CHRIST is not fulfilled by his body, if there be one member<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 21.</note> hungry, whilſt another is drunken, if there be want in any place, before there be want in all.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, (we are yet in the way of inſtruction) If the higheſt and deepeſt expreſſions of our love to the Saints, be but matter of duty in us, as their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities may determine it; then is it not any diſcharge of a mans duty, nor to be counted obedience unto GOD, or unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, when the neceſſities of your Brethren being great and ſore upon them, men ſhall miniſter unto them in a ſparing, pinching, and contemptible manner: when the condition of the Saints requires (it may be) the one halfe of our ſubſtance, and we caſt in two mites into their treaſury: when their exigences
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156711:12"/>
call us to lay downe our lives for them, and we are willing onely to beſtow the parings of our nailes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Doubtleſſe to miniſter unto the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Saints upon ſuch termes as theſe, is no better obedience, nor any whit a more acceptable ſervice unto GOD, then that of <hi>Saul</hi> was, when being commanded to ſmite <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and to deſtroy utterly all that appertained to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed that which was vile and nought worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, but ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and all the beſt of the ſheepe and oxen, and all that was good 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 3. 9. As <hi>Saul</hi> was rejected by GOD, and that with much indignation, and arreſted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a writ <hi>of rebellion</hi> ſerved upon him by the hand of the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> for ſuch an abuſing of the commandement of GOD, which yet to himſelfe ſeem'd a ſufficient and plauſible obedience: So is it more then to be feared that many men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are lifted up in a ſelfe admiration, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in a way of charitie and reliefe unto the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aints, which being interpreted by GOD, is rather a reproach and mockerie to his pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that way, then any obedience or ſubjection to it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly (for Inſtruction:) if the higheſt, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expreſſions of love to the Saints, be but matter of duty, when their neceſſities require them: then is not that which any man poſſeſſeth in the things of this world, whether eſtate, liberty, life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo much to be look'd upon, as a mans owne (to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) as the Churches and houſhold's of Faith. GOD we ſee both in the Text and Doctrine delivered, who hath an abſolute Sovereigntie of right and power to diſpoſe both of our perſons and of all we have, hath intereſſed <hi>the Brethren,</hi> that is, the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:156711:12"/>
and Brotherhood of the Saints, both in our perſons, and in our poſſeſſions. The neceſſities of the Saints are ſealed and confirmed from Heaven, as a lawfull right and title to ſuch proportions and ſhares in our eſtates, and in any other meanes of help and ſupport that we are able to afford, as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to them, and of a conſiderable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to relieve them. That civill right or propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie we have in our poſſeſſions, is not by Chriſtians to be looked upon, or pleaded in Barre to that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall right which all the Saints have in them alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Doctrine affords matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe<note place="margin">Vſe 2 for Reproofe.</note> alſo, and that of foure ſorts of men. The firſt are thoſe that will needs be numbred amongſt the righteous, yea are ready to thinke themſelves evilly entreated, and hardly dealt with, if they have not their place aſſigned them at the upper end of the Table amongſt the Houſhold of Faith, if they be not looked upon as the true ſervants of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (at leaſt) and yet are as a dry, and barren wilderneſſe to the Saints, and looke upon this family of Heaven as ſtrangers unto them, eſpecially when they ſtand in need of an helping hand from them in any kinde. A little affliction falling upon a ſervant of GOD where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their helpe is required, puts him quite out of their knowledge; as <hi>Davids</hi> neceſſitie made <hi>Nabal</hi> that he did not know him. 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 10. Who is Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? and who is the ſonne of Iſhai?</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had bin a great Courtier, or the Sonne of <hi>Iſhai</hi> a favourite of King <hi>Saul,</hi> it is no otherwiſe like, but <hi>Nabal</hi> could have knowne him well enough. But perceiving that his knowledge of him in ſuch a condition, and ſtreight as he was now in, would be chargeable to him, and coſt him ſome of his bread, and of his fleſh, he would by no meanes owne his knowledge of him.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156711:13"/>
Such a condition, wherein a man ſhall ſtand in neede of the helpe of another is, in the interpretation of a baſe cloſe-fiſted generation amongſt us, an evidence againſt him, that he doth not belong to CHRIST Alaſſe, how farre are theſe from laying downe their lives for their Brethren, and conſequently from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, who can acknowledge none for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but thoſe that have no need of them at all? when <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall be caſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, theſe ſhall goe thither in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is another ſort of Profeſſors too, which though they ſeeme not altogether ſo bad as the former, yet their prerogative above them were a deere bargaine of the Widowes two mites, if it were to be bought with them. Theſe are ſuch, who though they will not be ſeene to ſit out in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Saints, when others are in, yet they will play but at very ſmall game (as we ſay) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them: they neither conſult with the greatneſſe, or depth of the Saints neceſſities, nor with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſuperfluities of their own eſtates, but with the narrowneſſe, and ſeantneſſe of their owne baſe diſpoſitions: This is the only Oracle they inquire at, and by which they are regulated in all they doe for the Saints, upon any occaſion whatſoever. They have a forme of giving (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome that have <hi>a forme of knowledge</hi>) which neither mends, nor paires, neither riſeth nor falls, nor any waies alters by any difference or occaſions, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities whatſoever. If the fit of charitie be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they will give aſmuch to a vagrant beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar by the way ſide, as they will to ſave the lives of ten thouſand Saints: and no great matter neither to the one, or towards the other. If men be <hi>rich in the things of this world,</hi> and not <hi>rich in good workes</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:156711:13"/>
               <hi>too,</hi> they are not like <hi>to lay hold of eternall life.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 19. We know the rich young-man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, though he was neere unto the Kingdome of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet becauſe he would not ſell all that he had, and give liberally to the poore, being required to do it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred thereinto. For rich men under the <hi>Law</hi> that had great heards of Cattell and flocks of ſheepe, and Goates, to have brought Turtles, or young-Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons for their offering, had been a prophanation of the Temple, and deſpiſing of GOD. And ſo for men of great eſtates to have caſt in 2 mites into the Treaſury, as the poore Widdow did, had rather bin a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelie or affront put upon that ſervice or cuſtom of offering, then any expreſſion of charitie or devotion. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver</hi> (ſaith the Lord himſelfe by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> Mal. 1. 14. And is it not a ſin of very neere affinitie with this, and ſo obnoxious to the ſame Curſe, when men that are able to relieve by thouſands, and the extremities of the Saints call for reliefe by thouſands, ſhall yet miniſter reliefe but by tens, yea and ſcarſely by this proportion?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, another ſort worſe then both the former are ſuch, who are ſo farre from managing an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love to the Saints with thoſe high, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent expreſſions we ſpeake of, even when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt need requires, that to keepe their bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and credit too, are ſtill ready to blaſpheme the pouertie or hard condition of the Saints in any kind, as if they were of a baſe originall and deſcent; as if they alwaies proceeded either from negligence, ſloathfulneſſe, raſhneſſe, want of diſcretion and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, or the like. Becauſe men have no minde or will in this caſe to part with their money, nor are yet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156711:14"/>
willing to make any part of ſatisfaction for that baſeneſſe with their names and reputations; they have no waies to bring both theſe ends together, but by inſimulations aſperſions and ſundry imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to render thoſe unworthy, whoſe neceſſitous condition calls upon them for reliefe. Thus <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> ſought to make a covering for his owne ſhame in refuſing to ſupplie <hi>David</hi> in his extremitie, of that wicked inſimulation or reproach caſt upon <hi>David,</hi> as that he ſhould be ſome ſervant run away from his Maſter. 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 10. There be many ſervants now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies that breake away every man from his Maſter:</hi> Out of theſe impertinent premiſſes, this baſe minded wretch thought he might lawfully and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inferre this concluſion: therefore there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon nor conſcience why he ſhould part with any thing to <hi>David.</hi> The like ſpirit of baſe inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations againſt the Saints in diſtreſſe is taken in by that other uncleane ſpirit of covetouſneſſe which reignes in the hearts of many amongſt us, to defend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the juſt ſmitings both of conſcience, and of the tongues of men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly for reproofe) thoſe are yet worſe then the former (if worſe may be) who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of loving the Saints fervently, and with a pure heart, and with all demonſtrations and rich expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this love as occaſion requires, are ſtill ſnarl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and biting, and vexing them, with injuries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, backbitings, and all manner of evill entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And yet there are of this generation alſo, that muſt be honoured before the Elders of their people too, with the Names, and reputations of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Any thing (it ſeemes) will ſerve for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to make Chriſtians and Saints of: Hey, and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and wood will ſerve to beare the name, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156711:14"/>
of Chriſtianity, aſwell as ſilver, gold, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones: but when they ſhall be made to paſſe through the fire of <hi>Gods</hi> judgement, then that Hey, and Stubble, and wood we ſpeake of, will make no more Chriſtians, but baſe hypocrites, and accurſed unbeleevers only. How farre are theſe men from that ſtreyne of Chriſtianity, which is required of all men in the Doctrine, from miniſtring richly, &amp; with a large heart, and with an open hand to the neceſſities of the Saints, when their daily practiſe is to give them gall, and vinegar to drinke, &amp; to bring preſſures, and to heap ſorrowes upon their head? inſtead of making their beds for them in their ſickneſſe, they caſt them into beds of ſickneſſe and ſorrow. If the miniſters of Satan be Angells of light, ſuch men as theſe are good Chriſtians: and when <hi>God</hi> ſhall<note place="margin">Eze. 16. 53.</note> bring againe the Captivity of <hi>Belzebub</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and reſtore them to their firſt eſtate in Heaven, theſe ſhall have part and fellowſhip in Heaven with them.</p>
            <p>A third and laſt Vſe of the Doctrine, ſhall be for<note place="margin">Vſe 3 for Exhortation.</note> exhortation, and that to all thoſe that meane to doe any good, upon the profeſſion and trade of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that deſire to raiſe themſelves for ever by it: The duty I ſhall recommend unto you, is only this, that you would make it matter of conſcience (as well as you doe any other duty in the world, as to abſtaine from Murder, Drunkenneſſe, Adultery, or the like,) yea that you would make a ſolemne worke and labour of it, to abound in that ſweete and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affection of love towards the Saints, and to give full and free teſtimony and account thereof both unto <hi>God</hi> and men, as their occaſions ſhall from time to time require. Quit your ſelves in this kinde, (I beſeech you) as the Diſciples and followers of him, who when the neceſſitie of the world (and of your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:156711:15"/>
ſoules particularly) required it, and could not be ſaved without it, freely emptied himſelfe of all his greatneſſe and glory, and poured out his deereſt ſoule an offering for it; and was content to take reſt and peace and glory in reverſion, when as otherwiſe he might have had them in preſent poſſeſſion. In a word, that you will count nothing of all you poſſeſſe in this world deere unto your ſelves, that your love to the Saints may reigne and triumph in all the rich and glorious and high expreſſions thereof, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any of theſe ſhall require. Particularly (to turne in a little to that ſpeciall occaſion, which hath drawn out my heart and ſoule unto you this day, in this ſubject) that you will vindicate your ſelves for Chriſtians indeed, and your love to the Saints and ſervants of JESUS CHRIST, like it ſelfe, by your ready and free, and liberall contributions by way of lending (for your love for the preſent is not put to any greater triall then this) to redeeme the lives and liberties and eſtates of your poore <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> (if GOD will yet vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to honour your zeale and forwardneſſe in this kinde, with ſuch an honourable vouchſafement as this) out of the mercileſſe hand of thoſe cruell, blood thirſtie and implacable enemies both theirs and your's, that Butcherly, and bloody faction of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are now gathered together like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of chafed Beares, and fierce Lyons againſt them, in an heate and ecſtacie of revenge, and being led on by that Prince of darkneſſe, that great roaring Lyon the Devill, have their hands lifted up on high, to ſlay and kill, and to deſtroy, to commit all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, and barbarons outrages, as they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and taught by that God of this world whom they ſerve in this ſpirit of revenge, which now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth them. The conſiderations, and motives
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:156711:15"/>
that may ſtrengthen your hand to this ſervice that is recommended to you, are both more in number and greater in weight and conſequence by farre, then I am able to expreſſe. Give me leave to touch you with ſome few of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that faction of Hell, the Romiſh party, are of a very formidable ſtrength and power amongſt them: they were ſome while ſince reported to have bin an Army of about 30000 fighting men, and to be daily increaſing, and gathering greater numbers unto them. They have already taken many ſtrong Townes and Caſtles, and have made themſelves Lords and Maſters of them: and many Captaines, and other Officers that have bin trained up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in Warres, are ſaid to have come over from beyond the Seas unto them, to aſſiſt them in their enterprize: In ſo much that the feare and dread of them is fallen and ready ſtill to fall upon many, that they have and are likely every day more and more to revolt and fall in unto them. So they are not like to be reſiſted, or withſtood but with an high hand. The ſtrength and power of the enemy, which is ſo formidable to your Brethren, and in it ſelfe alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it not (I beſeech you) be contemptible in your eyes, but gaine proportionably upon your hearts and ſoules to conſider them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Proteſtant party</hi> of your Brethren, are but very weake in compariſon of their enemies, they are but few in number, in reſpect of the ſwarms of thoſe Anti-Chriſtian hornets that neſtle amongſt them: and that which is yet of ſadder conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are but naked, and unarm'd, and no waies appointed or provided to defend themſelves; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not long ſince had their Armes, and meanes of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:156711:16"/>
defence, moſt cruelly taken from them, by him, who hath made ſome part of attonement for that and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his outrages, with his head. In which reſpect they are but as a flock of Kids, before an Hoſt, or Army of Lyons. Let this conſideration alſo of the weakneſſe of your Brethren, ſtrengthen the hand of your love and make tender your reſpects unto them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, their enemies are of a bloody, barbarous, and revengefull ſpirit: all mercie, pittie, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yea humanitie it ſelfe is hid from their eyes: there is neither age, nor ſex, neither young-men, nor Maids, neither old-men, nor Babes, but all are one before the rage of their cruelty. They have ſhut up all the bowells of their compaſſions as it were with barres of yron, that neither cries nor teares, nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſries, nor extremities, nor the Law of GOD, nor the Lawes of men, nor the Lawes of nature or huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it ſelfe, can doe any thing to open them. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you let the ſhutting up of the compaſſions of the enemies of your Brethren againſt them, be the opening of your compaſſions ſo much the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo much the more abundantly unto them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they are deeply, indeed moſt deſperatly ingaged to goe through with their enterprize, and are under a vow, to make as cleere riddance of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> out of the Kingdome, as their lying Legend reports that their Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> made of Serpents &amp; Toades, &amp; al venimous creatures. They have made a covering of their breaden God, wherewith to hide all repentance from their eyes: ſo that all relentings, all doubtings, all faintings or feebleneſſe of ſpirit, all hanging down of hands from the worke in hand, are no leſſe then deadly ſins with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they looke backe from the Plough
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156711:16"/>
whereunto they have now put forth their hand, they are afraide they ſhall fall into Hell immediatly. That God and creature of theirs which they make of bread is amongſt them of as great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power, as the Poets made the Rivers Styx in Hell, to be among their Heathen God's, when they ſware by it: <hi>Timor et Deus ille Deorum eſt.</hi> It is the inſpiration of their Religion and teachers, that it is no leſſe then damnable ſinne, and to be puniſhed with Hell fire, once to doubt or queſtion whether it be meritorious or no, to murder, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> when the advancement of the Catholique cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it. I beſeech you let the height of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and the depths of their ingagements to doe evill, be both heights and depths of ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reſolutions unto you, to doe good, to the countermanding (if it be poſſible) of their evill.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they have already conſecrated themſelves unto the Devill and his ſervice upon the lives and blood of many of the ſervants of GOD, your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the <hi>Faith,</hi> hewing, and hacking ſome in pieces (as it were on purpoſe to quench, and ſmother all ſparkes of humanity that might yet be alive in their breſts) after they had murdered them, and by other moſt barbarous villanies, and outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon them; ſetting themſelves a coppie (as it were) for their future proceedings, and giving thoſe that yet remaine to underſtand, what meaſure they muſt expect, and looke for, if they make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and meane to keepe their Religion. I beſeech you let the lives, and cruell and curſed uſages of thoſe that have already periſhed by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede &amp; mediate with the bowells of your compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the behalfe of the remnant which is yet left.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, It is the holineſſe, purity, and truth of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:156711:17"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:156711:18"/>
that Faith and Religion which your ſelves profeſſe, and wherein you hope to be ſaved, that hath kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled that fire of hatred and revenge in thoſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſpirits, which is now broken out, rageing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, as you have heard. Theſe ſervants of <hi>God</hi> whoſe cauſe we now pleade before you, are for no other cauſe, nor in any other reſpect made the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable objects of the wrath and furie of their enemies, expoſed to that fiery ſtorme and tempeſt of blood that hangs over their heads, but becauſe they are your Brethren, and Profeſſors of the ſame Precious <hi>Faith</hi> with you: They ſuffer not as evill doers, but only becauſe they have given the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip unto you in the things of GOD, and of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. I hope the power of that Religion which you profeſſe, will ſet you on fire to make up the breaches, which the Profeſſion of it hath made, or further ſhall make upon others.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Conſider, that the cauſe, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance whereof you are now ſollicited, being ſo cleerely and intirely as it is, the cauſe of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and you of this Citie looked upon as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friends, as the ſolemneſt and moſt ſerious Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors which it hath not only in this, but in all other Kingdomes alſo under Heaven, and withall many of you being of knowne eſtates and ſufficient abilities to doe much for it in that way, which is now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from you; if then you ſhall now diſcover any backwardneſſe in miniſtring to the neceſſities of it, if you ſhall give the leaſt ſuſpition to the world, that your eſtates are competitors for your hearts with your Religion, if your contributions towards the maintenance of it ſhall either fall low, or come off heavily from you, you ſhall much quench the glory and eſteeme of it in the hearts of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156711:18"/>
men, and repreſent it unto the world as a Religion weake and contemptible and of a doubtfull aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anc, upon the ſervice whereof ſilver and gold were too great to be ſacrificed. The truth is, that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that is before you, enableth you to ſet the prize and eſtimate of your Religion, at what rate, or height you pleaſe: you have the world at ſuch an advantage to compell them to thinke highly and honourable of that truth which you profeſſe, the loſſe and neglect whereof would be an inexpiable ſtreyne of unworthineſſe in you, and which you can hardly ever redeeme, no though you ſhould ſacrifice your ſelves and your whole eſtates in the flames of the greateſt zeale for it afterwards. Nay if you ſhall ſinne againſt the Crowne and dignitie of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you profeſſe, by being remiſſe, and low and cold in the ſervice recommended unto you, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors it hath in the world beſides, though they ſhould riſe up in their might and cloath themſelves with double zeale to doe their uttermoſt for it, will not be able to build up what you will throw down, nor exalt the glory of it according to the meaſure of your abaſements. Therefore if your Religion be of that ineſtimable worth and value whereof you have given information unto the world hitherto by your profeſſion of it, ſeale to theſe informations of yours this day, and rejoyce in free and liberall contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons over it: cauſe your ſilver and gold to doe hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to it, and to acknowledge the Divinity of it.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Your zeale and open-handedneſſe for the reliefe of the diſtreſſed, may ſtrike a dampe of feare and teror into the hearts of their enemies, when they ſhall either by hearing of ſeeing, come to know it, and ſo weaken their hand to their work. When they ſhall perceive what deep and deere intereſt in your hearts and affections thoſe have,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156711:19"/>
whoſe confuſion and ruine they hope to reape as the recompence and reward of their preſent rebellions, this may, cut the ſinewes, and ſtrength of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation this way, and take off the fiery edg of their preſuming confidence. The interpretation of what you ſhall doe in this kinde like your ſelves, may be of much more conſequence to your friends, then the text it ſelfe. I beſeech you give not thoſe bloodthir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie wretches any ſcope or libertie of hope or thought, but that thoſe whoſe lives and fortunes they ſeeke to ruine and trample under foot, are a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration very precious in your eyes, and that your hearts are fully ſet and bent upon their preſervation and deliverance. Little (perhaps) doe you thinke or imagine, of how rich a concernment ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt as this begotten in the ſpirits of their enemies, may be for the peace and ſafety of your friends.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, By caſting on ſufficient quantities of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to quench the fire that is kindled in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, you may prevent the kindling of the like, or a worſe, in your own. <hi>Jreland</hi> is not unfitly termed, a back doore into <hi>England:</hi> and of what diſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance it muſt needs be to you and your Nation, to have the Pope keeper of the keyes of your back dore, I ſhall not need to repreſent unto you. If <hi>Jreland</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought under the power of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Sun of <hi>Englands</hi> proſperitie will ſuddainly be darkened in the midſt of the Heavens thereof: that Land and Kingdome will receive immediate conſecration from the triple Crowne, for a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary unto thoſe that ſhall undertake or attempt the ruine or moleſtation of this: it will ſo one be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for <hi>Ijm</hi> and <hi>Oijm,</hi> I meane for the furies and firebrands of <hi>Rome,</hi> to lodge in. Beſides, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of ſuch a confederate Kingdome as <hi>Ireland</hi> will be, if ever that generation of vipers we ſpeake
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:156711:19"/>
of, ſhould Lord it there, will foment and cheriſh thoſe ſeeds of ſeditions, Treaſons, conſpiracies, and Rebellions, which are ſowne in the natures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of that Popiſh gang amongſt our ſelves. If you let <hi>Ireland</hi> goe, the peace and ſafety of your own Land and Nation (it is much to be feared) will ſoone follow after it. I beſeech you be not backward to do the beſt you are able for thoſe who are now recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto you: that which you ſhall part with, may be the price of the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your own land.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, There is no better foundation can be treaſured up for your ſelves againſt an evill day, then by a compaſſionate and tender conſideration of thoſe that are in diſtreſſe, in the meane ſeaſon. Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of compaſſion towards the afflicted, make the beſt ſhelter and covert from a ſtorme and tempeſt, of any other materiall whatſoever. By the ſame ſhield which you ſhall hold forth to defend others from evill, you ſhall protect your ſelves alſo. The Scripture is abundant in the teſtimonie of this truth. <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poore: the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble. The Lord will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him and keepe him alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 41. ver. 1. 2. you know not what evill times, what daies of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe GOD may yet pleaſe to bring upon your Land and Nation: take heed I beſeech you, leaſt by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Brethren naked to that ſtorme and tempeſt which now threatens them, and in part lyeth ſore and heavy upon them, you do not conſult nakedneſſe to your ſelves, againſt the day wherein the like ſtorme or tempeſt ſhall fall upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He ſhall have iudgment without mercie, that ſheweth no mercie.</hi> Jam. 2. 13. Take heed, he that hath ſaid i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, will do it accordingly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to make my motion unto you greater then deniall (if it may be) be pleaſed to conſider this one thing further, that if you ſhall deale unworthily in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:156711:20"/>
that worke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> whereunto you are now called, and ſhall love the wages of unfaithfullneſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to keep your money by you, notwithſtanding the importunate and loud cries of your Brethrens blood and lives for it, you may juſtly feare that it will ſoone alter the property of it; and that, that which was life and ſtrength unto you hitherto, will from henceforth be but labour and ſorrow, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. Whatſoever <hi>God</hi> calleth for at any time at the hands of any man for his glory, if it be denyed unto him; whether it be a mans credit, friends, liberty, eſtate, life, or whatſoever, it ſeldome or never proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; nor is it ſelfe afterwards any more unto him. There may well be an inſinuation or breathing of this truth, in that of our Saviour, <hi>He that will ſave his life</hi> (and ſo his credit, eſtate, liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the Goſpell and my affaires require it) <hi>ſhall loſe it:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (haply) that after ſuch a ſaving it, a mans life will be no more it ſelfe, no more a <hi>life,</hi> but rather a <hi>death</hi> to him, and ſhall never have the like content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſweetneſſe in it, which it had before. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you put this conſideration alſo to heart with all the former. Whatſoever it be that <hi>God</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of you for the ſupport of his cauſe and ſervants, it is to little purpoſe, I meane in reſpect of the fleſh it ſelfe, or any outward accommodation, for you to withhold it, or to deny it unto him: This call of <hi>God</hi> for it, hath made it good for nothing, but for conſecration: it is no more for any civill or naturall uſe or ſervice unto you, till <hi>God</hi> hath bin ſerv'd by it, and ſhall returne it againe into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes. That bread which <hi>God</hi> commands to be caſt upon the waters, will certainly mold and putrifie, if it be not caſt upon them: but if his voyce be obeyed concerning it, ſo that it be <hi>caſt upon the waters</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when it ſhall be found and taken up
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:156711:20"/>
againe from the waters (as his promiſe is it ſhall be) it ſhall be unto the owners, or him that caſt it, as the bread of Angels: there will be more nouriſhment and ſweetneſſe in one morſell of it, then in full tables of other proviſion.</p>
            <p>All theſe things duly weighed, I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you have to doe in the ſervice propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and recommended to you. It will be of ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence unto you to ſeek out pretences and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, why you ſhould not willingly take this yoake upon you: the exigencie of the occaſion is ſuch, that no pretences or reaſons whatſoever are to be knowne or once regarded againſt the motion that hath bin made unto you. It ſeldome or never falls out, but if <hi>God</hi> hath one requeſt to make to us, the fleſh and the world have another to make in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and barre to it; and that (for the moſt part) very plauſible and ſatisfactory to the Conſcience of him that deſires to decline the worke and ſervice of <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Nay rather if pretences and excuſes ſhall offer themſelves unto you, hide them from your eyes, and bury them like your dead, out of your ſight: tread them downe under your foot as oft as they offer to riſe up againſt you to trouble you in your way. Wife and Children, and charge, and poverty, and want of moneys, and occaſions of disburſments otherwiſe, with a thouſand other ſuch inſinuations as theſe, muſt with Sathan himſelfe be commanded to get them behind us: theſe are not to be admitted into this conſultation. <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt be look'd after, and provided for, as if we had neither Wives, nor Children, nor charge, nor were poore, nor wanted Moneys, nor knew what to doe with our Money otherwiſe. Vniform and ſtanding occaſions, are but nences, in the preſence of great exigencies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate exigences, and precipitate occaſions. And know
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:156711:21"/>
that you are not your ſelves, except you be more then your ſelves, and above your ſelves in this worke: you do not that which you are able to doe, and conſequently not that which is your duty to do, except you do more then you are able to do, upon ſuch an occaſion as this. <hi>To their power, I beare them record</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the Churches of <hi>Macedonia) yea, and beyond their power they were</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>willing of themſelves.</hi> The meaning is not (as perhaps the face of the leter ſeemes to import) that they were deſirous &amp; willing to have done more then they did, in caſe they had bin better provided: but that out of an abundant willingneſſe that was in them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch a ſervice as was now propoſed to them, they ſtretch'd themſelves in their contributions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the line of their outward eſtates would well beare. We know that exigencies and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ecſtacies of feares in other kinds, will intend and raiſe the naturall ſtrength and abilities of men far above themſelves. In a plunge of danger, and by the help &amp; advantage of ſome great feare, many have bin able to leap ditches, and to take up weights, and to run with that ſwiftneſſe, which by their ſtanding ſtrength &amp; abilities they were never able to do. And doubtleſſe ſuch a ſpiritual exigencie as is now preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, if we tooke the impreſſions of it kindly &amp; fully, would raiſe the powers of grace alſo within us above themſelves, and enable us to worke miracles, in compariſon of our ordinary expreſſions of our ſelv's, it would make <hi>even our moſt extreme poverty</hi> (in caſe our poverty were ſuch) <hi>to abound to the riches of our liberalitie;</hi> as the Apoſtle records concerning the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> which we ſpeake of. <hi>The Lord grant that the efficacie and power of what hath bin ſaid unto you, may be found in your deportments and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in that great worke that is before you.</hi>
