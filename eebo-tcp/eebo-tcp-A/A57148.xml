            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I was by you called to
bear a part in that season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and necessary service of
your late solemn <hi>Humiliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
I considered the sad condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
these Nations were reduced, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great provocations which we have
been guilty of, the miserable commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and earthquakes, which have not
<pb facs="tcp:96724:3"/>
onely shaken, but even dissolved our
<hi>foundations,</hi> and made them <hi>all out of
course. I</hi> seriously looked back on the
dark and gloomy providences of God
amongst us, the untimely death of Princes,
the dimidiating and dissolving of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
the frequent expirations and
vicissitudes of Governments, the horrid
Apostasie, Atheisme, Scepticisme, Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
Prodigies of phrenetick and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Opinions, whereby multitudes
have played the wantons with as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a light of Orthodox Religion, as any
Nation under heaven enjoyed; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming
of Ministry, decrying of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
incroaching of many Romish doctrines
under a disguize, and other like distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
whereby we are become an hissing
and astonishment to the Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us. In a word, It seemed unto me,
That the Scene of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> was
translated into these Nations, and that we
were making hast to be a <hi>Jezreel,</hi> a <hi>Lo-Ruhamah,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96724:3"/>
and a <hi>Lo-Ammi,</hi> as they once
did.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though my habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
disposition usually lead me to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which have more of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and gentlenesse in them, as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the counsel of the Apostle, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
in meeknesse those that oppose
themselves:</hi> yet I thought it a duty,
little lesse then absolutely necessary, in
such a day of trouble and rebuke, to
set the Trumpet unto my mouth, and
to represent unto you, the doleful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a <hi>Deserted people,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the sad misgiving feares (whereunto
the Symptomes of these sick and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Nations did lead me) least
the Lord were now departing from
such a People, who after an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years possession of the Gospel, did
still so wantonly abuse it, and walk
so unworthy of it.</p>
            <p>Yet if any man shall say unto me,
<pb facs="tcp:96724:4"/>
that it shall not be so, that the Lord
will still own us, and continue his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with us: I shall answer as
once the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
The Lord do so,</hi> the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that I should desire the <hi>wofull
Day,</hi> or with <hi>Jonah</hi> be displeased
with the patience and goodness of
God. Farre may this Sermon be from
a <hi>Prophecy</hi> or prediction, let it be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>Instruction,</hi> and a warning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. But certainly the maturity of
our sinnes, and the face of our distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
do so farre threaten us, as that
we ought thereby to be awakened to
cry mightily unto God, and to hold him
fast, least he be <hi>weary of repenting,</hi>
and after so many despised mercies,
take at last the <hi>plumb line</hi> into his
hand, and refuse againe to pass by us
any more.</p>
            <p>If hereunto this weak service of
mine may be any way useful either to
<pb facs="tcp:96724:4"/>
City or Countrey, to Magistrates,
Ministers, or people, I shall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
cause to blesse the Lord, to whose
gracious presence and protection, in
these dangerous times, I desire in
my daily prayers to commend these
three Nations, and this great City,
and so to be</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E finde in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
that in several cases the <hi>Priests</hi>
of the Lord were to sound the
<hi>Trumpets</hi> unto the people to
summon and awaken them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the special duties which God called for,
<hi>Numb. 10. 1—10.</hi> And in like manner the
Lord commandeth his Prophets <hi>to lift up
their voice like a Trumpet, and to set the
Trumpet unto their mouth,</hi> Isa. 58. 1. <hi>Hos.</hi>
8. 1. One end of blowing the Trumpet was
to give <hi>warning</hi> to the people of any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
danger, that they might timely
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96724:6"/>
prevent and escape it. <hi>Joel 2. 1. Blow ye
the Trumpet in</hi> Zion, <hi>and sound an alarme in
mine holy mountaine: let all the Inhabitants of
the Land tremble: for the day of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
for it is nigh at hand.</hi> This is one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
duty of the <hi>spiritual Watchmen,</hi> Jerem.
6. 17. <hi>I set Watchmen over you, saying, hearken
to the sound of the Trumpet. Sonne of man, saith
the Lord to the Prophet, I have set thee a
Watchman to the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>therefore thou
shalt heare the word at my mouth, and warn them
from me.</hi> See <hi>Ezek. 33. 2—9.</hi> as <hi>Elisha</hi>
gave the King of <hi>Israel</hi> warning of the King
of <hi>Syriahs</hi> counsels against him, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. 9.
This charge <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> gave unto the Priests
and Levites, that they should <hi>warne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not to transgresse,</hi> least wrath come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them and their brethren, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
19. 10.</p>
            <p>When ruine was hanging over <hi>Nineveh,
Jonah</hi> is commanded <hi>to cry</hi> against it, <hi>Jonah</hi>
1. 2. Crying sinnes call for crying preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and when He slept in that terrible
tempest which was upon the ship, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the ship awakened him, <hi>What ailest
thou O sleeper? arise and call upon thy God,</hi> Jon. 1.
6. We have had amongst us the <hi>confused noise
of the battel of the Warrier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 9. 5.</note> and <hi>garments rolled
in blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nahum 3. 2, 3.</note> the <hi>noise of the ratling of the wheeles,
and of the prancing of the horses, and of the

jumping of the Chariots,</hi> of the <hi>bright sword,</hi>
and the <hi>glittering Speare.</hi> And this should
have awakened us to returne, and to seek
the Lord.<note place="margin">Isa. 9. 19.</note> For certainly it is <hi>through the
Lords wrath, that the people of a Land are as
the fuel of fire, no man sparing his brother.</hi>
But his anger is not turned away, his hand
is stretched out still. And if our eares were
well awakened, I feare we should heare a
more dreadful noise then that of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riar,
the noise of the <hi>wings of the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
Ezek. 1. 24. the glory of the Lord in
his Church threatning to <hi>depart</hi> from us, as
he did from his people <hi>Judah,</hi> Ezek. 9. 3.
10. 18, 19. 11. 22, 23. I have therefore
made choise of these words of this Trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounding
Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> that we may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
to cry mightily unto God, and to
hold him fast, and not let him go, to repent
and <hi>do our first works,</hi> least he come quickly
and remove our Candlestick out of his place,
as he threatned to do unto the Church
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Rev. 2. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter we have an enumeration
of several <hi>sins</hi> of that people, and several
<hi>judgements</hi> denounced against the same. The
sinnes are, 1. <hi>Idolatry,</hi> going from God,
ascribing their plenty to their superstition,
<hi>ver.</hi> 1. 10, 15. 2. Emertaining and <hi>believing
false prophets,</hi> ver. 7, 8. 3. <hi>Profundity of

desperate</hi> wickedness, as that of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> Judg.
19. <hi>v. 9. 4. Carnal confidence</hi> and security,

should <hi>punish</hi> others, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and of the
<hi>People,</hi> ver. 17. and all these sinnes ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated

            <p>The <hi>punishments</hi> denounced, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and now

of it. But this should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the judgement, the murtherer should
finde out their children, the beloved fruit of
their womb, <hi>v.</hi> 1. 3, 16.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text containe the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of all these judgements. God may
love and adopt a people, own them for his,
vouchsafe his <hi>presence</hi> to them, be a <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
for them,</hi> in <hi>a Wildernesse,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
when he feeds them with bread of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

But this is the uttermost misery which a
people can be exposed unto, to have the
Lord <hi>hate</hi> them, <hi>love</hi> them <hi>no more, drive</hi> and
<hi>cast</hi> them out, and <hi>depart</hi> from them; a
comprehensive judgement, a doleful <hi>Epipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nema,
though</hi> they have famine and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and desolation, no sacrifices, no festivals,
no children, yet the <hi>Woe</hi> never comes till God

also to them when I depart from them;</hi> Or
<hi>when I remove my Glory</hi> or Divine Majesty

thing for mens children to flee away
and depart from them, or after they are
brought up to be preserved for the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
But if God continue his presence, all
other comforts are comprized in that. <hi>Job</hi>

the Lord had not forsaken him, <hi>Job</hi>
1. 21. and the Apostle, <hi>All men forsook me,
but the Lord stood with me,</hi> and strengthned
me, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16, 17. But when corne and
wine, sacrifices and oblations, countrey and
dwelling places, Tabernacles and delights,
Children and the beloved fruit of the womb,
the Glory of that people, are all gone, then
for God to go after them, and depart too,
and to withdraw his Majesty and presence
from them, to hate them, to love them no
more, to cast them out of his sight, this is a
<hi>cumulated Woe, etiam vae,</hi> a Woe that doth
consummate all the other woes, that leaveth
no room for another, or a greater, <hi>Ye Also
Woe</hi> unto them, when I depart from
them.</p>
            <p>Here then that we may rightly understand
both what it is for God to depart from a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and how great a woe and judgement it
is, It will be necessary to enquire <hi>what it is
for God to be present</hi> with a people, and <hi>how
great a mercy</hi> that is; for contraries do notably

able to expresse. These are some few
of those unspeakable benefits which usually
come along with it.</p>
            <p>1. Manifestation of himself, and of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of his love and counsel to the Church,
<hi>John</hi> 14 21. he shews unto a soul the <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>2. Cohabitation and gracious converse
with the soules of men, having his abode
in them, <hi>John</hi> 14. 23. It is a rich mercy,
as <hi>Galeacius</hi> said, to have but one hours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

            <p>5. Supplies of grace, strength, ability, and

Zac. 14. 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 24.</p>
            <p>We have briefly considering the Glory
and honour of a people, who have God thus
with them as their God, owning them,
comforting, blessing, defending, encamping
about them; for it is <hi>nearnesse unto God,</hi> and
the enjoyment of righteous Lawes and holy
Ordinances, which makes a <hi>Nation great and
honourable,</hi> Deut. 4. 7, 8. Isa. 43, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to consider what it
is for God to <hi>depart</hi> from a people,<note place="margin">What it is for God to depart.</note> and
how great a woe it bringeth along with
it.</p>
            <p>1. We must remember, that the <hi>Catholick
and universal</hi> Church is <hi>indeficient,</hi> though
not in its own Nature (for by the same
reason that any particular Church may fail,
all may) yet in regard of the <hi>promises</hi>
which are made unto it, That the <hi>Gates of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96724:11"/>
Hell</hi> shall not prevaile against it, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 18. That Christ will be with it
to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. Of
the Kingdome of Christ there shall be <hi>no
End,</hi> Luke 1. 33. Christ will alwayes have
a people on the earth to serve him. His
Throne shall be <hi>as the Sunne,</hi> and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
witnesse in heaven, <hi>Psalme</hi> 89. 36, 37.
These are promises made to the universal
Church, and to all who should throughout
the world believe in Christ,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Mat. 5. 1, 2. &amp; in Mat. 28. 20.</note> as <hi>Chrysostome,
Austine, Prosper,</hi> and others have expounded
them.<note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 80. Prosper de vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. Gent. l. 2. c. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. We say that <hi>particular Churches are
defectible,</hi> They may fall from God, and
God may depart from them. He hath not
to any particular Church or Nation made an
absolute promise of abiding with them for
ever. No Church ever did challenge this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
but the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, which yet the
Apostle warneth to take heed, <hi>least God spare
not them,</hi> as he spared not the natural branches,
but brake them off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20, 21. This
Truth we finde verified in the examples of
the ten Tribes, who were at last <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi>
quite unchurched and cast off by God, <hi>Hos.</hi>
1. 9. and of the Jewish Church, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
branches, from whom the Kingdome
of God hath been taken, and wrath come
upon them to the uttermost, <hi>Matth. 21. 43.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96724:12"/>
1 Thes.</hi> 2. 16. according as God threatned
if they forsook him, he would forsake them,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. And in those famous
Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> from whom the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
is removed, and they swallowed up
in the deluge of <hi>Mahumetanisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For opening this sore judgement of
Gods departing from a people we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That the Scripture setteth forth
<hi>Desertion</hi> unto us three manner of wayes. In a
way of <hi>propitiation.</hi> In a way of <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
And in a way of <hi>punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In a way of <hi>propitiation.</hi> So God the
Father <hi>forsook Christ</hi> in his Agony and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when his soule was made an offering
for sinne, not because he ceased to love
him,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Ep. 12. c. 110.</note> or to delight in him there was no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of <hi>union,</hi> nor substraction of love or
favour, but a with-drawing and hiding of
<hi>Vision</hi> and comfort, whereby Christ was to
make an attonement for us, by bearing for
us the weight and sense of Divine wrath,
<hi>Mat. 27. 46. Isa.</hi> 53. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>2. In a way of <hi>probation,</hi> when the Lord
in some particular case departs from a man
<hi>to try him,</hi> and discover his own weaknesse unto
him; for if God never so little turne away
his face and supportance from us, and suspend
the operations of his Spirit upon us, we
quickly finde by sad experience that of our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96724:12"/>
selves we have no sufficiency to think or do
any thing that is good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. thus the
Lord <hi>left Hezekiah</hi> in that one particular of
the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Ambassadors, that he might
have tryal of his weaknesse, and learne to
ascribe all his other standing to the grace
of God, 2 <hi>Chr. 32. 31. Psal.</hi> 30. 7.</p>
            <p>3. In a way of <hi>punishment.</hi> When the
presence of God having been undervalued,
and his Spirit grieved, and his grace turned
into wantonnesse, he doth in anger depart
from those who put such affronts and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
upon him, and thus God forsakes us
when <hi>we forsake him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 2. and
when we behave our selves ill in our
doings, he will hide his face from us, <hi>Micah</hi>
3. 4. It is an <hi>hiding wrath,</hi> Isa. 57. 17. 59. 2.
64. 7. for the Lord threatneth darknesse to
darknesse to those that walk not in
the light when they have it, <hi>John</hi> 12.
35.</p>
            <p>This penal desertion is either personal, or
publick. <hi>Personal</hi> is when the Lord having
endured <hi>with much long-suffering,</hi> the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of evil men, and finding his grace
still abused <hi>doth at last depart</hi> from them as
he did from <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 16. 14. and because
they will <hi>not be purged,</hi> doth resolve that
they shall not be purged, but seales them up
Under this <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oleful judgement, that he will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96724:13"/>
               <hi>strive no more</hi> with them, but let them alone
<hi>to be filthy still,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. Hos. 4. 17. Rev.
22. 11. so the Lord forsook <hi>Judas</hi> when he
withdrew his restraining grace from him, and
left him to go quickly about his wickednesse,
to do that now which he had before withheld
from doing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 27. And <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he
left him to runne after the wages of iniquity,
in wrath as it were granting him to do, what
he had forbidden him to do before, <hi>Numb.</hi>
22. 12. 20. 35. When the soul of a wretched
sinner hath so long outfaced the light, and
withstood the wrestlings of the Word, that
at last it contracteth a brawniness and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
of it, then the Lord frequently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in <hi>with penall induration,</hi> as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of voluntary and <hi>contracted induration,</hi>
and as to any spiritual awakenings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
wholly departeth from such a soul.
This is the forest judgement, next to hell it
selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publick</hi> desertion, when the Lord forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a <hi>People,</hi> and withdraws his presence
<hi>from a whole Church</hi> or Countrey; as when
he threatned to remove the Candlestick from
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. to strive no more with
the <hi>old world,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. when he calls the
<hi>ten Tribes Lo-Ammi,</hi> and will own them for
his people no longer, <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>This is either <hi>partial,</hi> as when the Lord
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96724:13"/>
forsook <hi>Shilo,</hi> but did not cast off all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but made that place an example to warn
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Jer. 7. 12, 14. when he threatned
to scatter his people, he said he would <hi>leave
a few men,</hi> a tenth from the sword, &amp;c.
<hi>Ezek. 12. 15, 16. Isa.</hi> 6. 12, 13. Or <hi>total,</hi> as he is
said to have cast off the <hi>whole seed</hi> of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
Jer. 7. 15.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is either <hi>desertion temporary,</hi>
when the Lord doth <hi>return with mercy</hi> to a
people, and make them as though they had
not been cast off; maketh her who had been
termed <hi>forsaken</hi> and desolate to be <hi>Hephzibah,</hi>

<hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes he seemed to forsake
<hi>England,</hi> and in a few years returned to us
again: <hi>Or perpetual;</hi> as when he called the

to <hi>take them away utterly,</hi> and
to have mercy on them no more, <hi>Hosea</hi>
1. 6.</p>
            <p>Now that we may understand what this
penal desertion is, we must note, That it is
<hi>not every publick affliction</hi> which the Lord
brings upon a Nation or people. He had not
forsaken <hi>Judah</hi> when he had sent them into
bondage, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9. 9. The Lord was a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
unto them in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Ezek. 11. 16. they
may be in a wildernesse and have God with
them, <hi>Exod. 33. 15. Paul</hi> was perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96724:14"/>
but not forsaken, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>Neither doth every <hi>spiritual Judgement</hi> of
ignorance or corruption in worship amount
to a divine desertion. The ten Tribes a
long time after the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi>
had Prophets sent unto them, and were
not presently called <hi>Lo-Ammi,</hi> or forsaken by
God.</p>
            <p>But the Lord is then said to depart from
a people, when he giveth them a <hi>Bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi>
and breaketh off the <hi>conjugal Relation</hi>
which he had with them, owns them not
as <hi>Members of his Family,</hi> withdraws his
<hi>presence</hi> from them, his <hi>Care</hi> of them, and
thrusts them out of his <hi>house;</hi>

            <p>It denoteth. 1. A subduction <hi>of Peace</hi> and
comfort, withdrawing the evidences of Gods
favour from a people. Gods Church is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and honourable in his sight, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 4.

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96724:14"/>

As when a man forbids any servant of

<hi>depart from Israel,</hi> 1 Sam. 4. 22. when the

the Apostle, <hi>depart I will send</hi> thee to the
Gentiles, <hi>Acts 22, 21. 13 46. Acts</hi> 28. 28.

of the Lord is upon the <hi>wing and the wheele,</hi>

evidence that God is forsaking a
people: for his Ordinances are his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>3. A subduction of <hi>Gifts and graces,</hi> as
God withdrew his Spirit from <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 17. 4.</note> 1 Sam.

and cry down the comforts annexed unto
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96724:15"/>
those gifts, and the Seminaries where they
usually are acquired. These are steps of
Gods departings from a people.</p>
            <p>4. A subduction of defence and <hi>Protection,</hi>
when a Nation is smitten, and there is <hi>no
healing,</hi> but God takes away his peace from
them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 19. 16. 5. and they in danger
of being given into the hands of Enemies,

step this of divine desertion, when men are
given up to walk in their owne counsels,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 12. and are captivated to strong
delusions to believe lies, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 11. we
have seen what this judgement is for God
to depart from a people. It is the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching</hi>
of them, sending them back into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
again, as our Prophet here expresseth it,

            <p>1. It cuts off our relation unto God, ye

1. 9. It is the <hi>unfranchizing</hi> of a Church,

them very <hi>Gentiles,</hi> A people without God or

            <p>2. It consequently cuts off <hi>our Communion</hi>
with God; He delights not in us, nor we
in him; for though this be the greatest
judgement in the world, yet there is this
further misery in it, That wicked men
choose it, and are well pleased to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God. They say unto God, <hi>depart from

before us continually; which things the
Angels look into, which Kings, and Prophets,
and righteous men have desired to see, and
have not seen them. This is so great a

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96724:18"/>
for if it be a <hi>great madnesse</hi> for men <hi>not to
believe the Gospel,</hi> the truth whereof hath
been confirmed by the witnesse of Apostles,
the blood of Martyrs, the power of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the attestation of Elements, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Devils; It is then certainly a
<hi>greater madnesse, Si de Evangelii veritate non
dubitas, vivere tamen quasi de ejus falsitate non
dubitares:</hi> to professe to believe the <hi>torments</hi>
of hell, and the <hi>joyes</hi> of Heaven, and yet so
to live, as if we feared nothing lesse then
Hell, or desired nothing lesse then Heaven.
Certainly our plagues will be answerable to
our Talents if we have not improved them,

            <p>3. To tremble at the judgement here
threatned of Gods departing from us, and
giving us <hi>a Bill of Divorce,</hi> and casting us
out of his family, and <hi>removing our Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,</hi>
as a very preface to <hi>Goe ye cursed.</hi>
If we have ever duly thought of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of <hi>Caine,</hi> the howlings of <hi>Esau,</hi> the
distresse of <hi>Saul,</hi> the despaire of <hi>Judas,</hi>
we may passe some judgement what it is
to forfeit God, and to have him nolonger
for our God. What great reason we
have to feare this judgement, and lay
this matter close to our hearts, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
if we consider,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96724:19"/>
1. The sinnes which provoke Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from a people; amongst others such
as these, 1. Divers and <hi>strange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
which corrupt the truth of God.
<hi>Heresie</hi> in the Easterne Churches made
way for <hi>Mahumitanisme.</hi> And therefore
when the Apostle makes mention of the
<hi>dayes of Apostacy,</hi> when God was in great
measure departed from the Church, we
finde him still mentioning <hi>delusions, lies,
doctrines of Devils, resisting of the Truth,</hi>
2 Thes. 2. 11. 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 1. 2 Tim.</hi>
3. 8.</p>
            <p>2. Incorrigiblenesse under <hi>former judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
for the Lord will <hi>not alwayes strive,</hi>
either by his Spirit or by his Rod, but
<hi>will overcome</hi> when he judgeth, <hi>Amos 4.

will at last take the <hi>plumb line</hi> into his hand,
<hi>Amos 7. 1—7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Contempt and scorne of his <hi>Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
and their message, which he hath
sent, rising early and sending them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
36. 16. when the <hi>servants</hi> were beaten and
stoned, and the <hi>sonne</hi> slaine, then quickly
after the Kingdome was taken away, <hi>Mat.
21. 33—43. Mat.</hi> 24. 34, 38. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
since the reformation of Religion the
Ministers of the Gospel have never been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
more reproach and contempt (and that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96724:19"/>
by a Generation of men that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
perfecter then others) then in this
Age they are; heretofore they were the
song of drunkards, now of such as own
themselves for Saints.</p>
            <p>4. Remisseness and backsliding from our
first love, <hi>Rev. 2. 5—7.</hi> falling away from
that high esteeme which once we had of
the Ordinances of Christ, of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints, and earnest zeale for the faith
once delivered to the Saints.</p>
            <p>5. Neglecting the day and <hi>season of
grace,</hi> and the voice of Christ in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
playing the wantons with so great
a <hi>depositum,</hi> as the Jews did, not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in this our day the things which belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our peace,</hi> Luke 19. 42, 43. when men
will not <hi>receive Instruction,</hi> God threatneth
to depart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
            <p>2. If we consider the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of
Gods threatning to depart from us, besides
the forementioned sins. As,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Loosning the joynts of Government,</hi> and
making continual changes in a State. It is
a signe of <hi>sicknesse</hi> in the body, when it
knows not how to rest, but is in <hi>perpetual
agitation,</hi> from <hi>Chamber</hi> to Chamber, from
<hi>Couch</hi> to Couch, from <hi>Bed</hi> to Bed; and so it
is in a State when a Parliament doth not
please, we try a piece of it, then down with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96724:20"/>
that once and againe, and try new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
a certaine signe of a sick Nation.
It was in the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> a forerunner of
this judgement threatned by our Prophet,
when they so often pulled down one another;
and it may justly make <hi>England</hi> tremble when
they compare their condition, and that of
the ten Tribes before their deportation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Divided interests,</hi> and intestine dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
amongst the people, <hi>Manasse Ephraim,</hi>
and <hi>Ephraim Manasse,</hi> and both against <hi>Judah,</hi>
this the Prophet makes an evidence that
Gods anger would not turne away from
<hi>Israel,</hi> Isa. 9. 21. These kinde of doleful
intestine commotions were sad forerunners
of the fatal destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of which
we read in <hi>Josephus.</hi>

brethren biting and devouring one another,

common enemy to enter in at; for <hi>union
strengthens</hi> the interests of those united, and
<hi>divisions betray</hi> them. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is a City
<hi>compacted;</hi> the Coat of Christ a <hi>seamlesse Coat,</hi>
and therefore the Apostle bids us, <hi>mark those
that cause divisions and offences,</hi> and avoid them,
as men that drive an interest, and do
not serve Jesus Christ, <hi>Romans</hi> 16.
17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:96724:20"/>
4. Multitudes of <hi>seducing spirits,</hi> and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries
of Satan who go up and down
without controle, sowing tares, and laying
levens, shaking the mindes of credulous
and simple people, who are apt to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about with every winde of doctrine, and
slyly insinuating under disguises and other
shapes, such doctrines as in their own proper
colours would be rejected.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>uselesness of many men eminent</hi>
for piety and prudence, by whose great
perspicacy and grave wisedome, <hi>dangers,</hi>
might be discovered, <hi>breaches</hi> healed,
<hi>difficulties</hi> removed, <hi>expedients</hi> offered,
<hi>paths</hi> restored to walk in. A sad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
when the Lord maketh the tongues
of such men to cleave to the roof of their
mouth, and layes them in his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
(not to them but to the nation)
aside as <hi>Rejected stones</hi> unfit, for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the General <hi>Senselesness</hi> of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
past or present, the <hi>sleep of slumber</hi>
and <hi>security</hi> which is upon most of us,
as upon <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Tempest, few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening
themselves to cry unto God
or to poure out their Confessions, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
or Supplications at the throne of
Grace.</p>
            <p>The Lord open our Eyes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96724:21"/>
us in this our day to lay to
heart the things which belong unto
our peace, to prepare to meet our
God, to hold him fast with strong
cryes, and love of his Truth, and
not to let him go till he preserve three
sinful Nations and snatch them as Brands
out of the burning, or at least that we
our selves may be hid in the day of the Lords
Anger.</p>
            <p>I shall Conclude with a few words of
<hi>Exhortation,</hi> both unto the <hi>people</hi> in <hi>generall,</hi>
and unto you who are <hi>Magistrates</hi> of
this great City in particular, unto
such things as seeme necessary Remedies
of our great danger, and Means to
keep our glory in the midst of us still. First, to
the <hi>people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Repent,</hi> and do your first works,
else Iniquity will be your ruine. Even
<hi>after a bill of divorce</hi> God allows an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous
Church to returne unto him.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 1, 22. Hos. 2. 2, 19. <hi>In a day
of darkeness and gloominess,</hi> of horses and
horsemen of fire and Earthquake, of
Armies and Terrors, the Lord calls on
his people to <hi>Turne</hi> to him, with intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a gracious Answer, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 12,
13, 14, 18, 19. With a peradventure
of mercy, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. This means God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96724:21"/>
prescribeth unto <hi>Ephesus</hi> to preserve their
Candlestick amongst them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.
If this be neglected, <hi>no people nearer
unto Cursing</hi> then those who have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the light and presence of God ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only thorns and briars, <hi>Heb. 6. 8. Amos</hi>
3. 2.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Wrestle</hi> mightily with God, be not
refused nor rejected, let the Lord
know you are <hi>Resolved to hold fast,</hi> and
not to let him go without a blessing,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 26. Lord <hi>rather no Canaan,</hi> no
milk, no honie, no houses, no vineyards, no
heards, no flocks, no Angel, then <hi>No God,</hi>
Exod. 33. 14, 15, 16. Lord, <hi>whither shall we
go</hi> to mend our selves? thou only hast the
words of eternal life? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 67, 68. Will
changes in Government mend us? will a
Democracy, or Aristocracy, or any other
form of Politie mend us, if God be going
away from us? Ask the Prophet. Now,
saith he, <hi>they shall say, we have no King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we feared not the Lord, What then should a
King do to us? Hos. 10. 3. if we feare not</hi>
the Lord, if we <hi>sweare falsely</hi> in a Covenant,
if we <hi>be an empty Vine,</hi> and if our heart be
divided, and we are found faulty; the
best Governments can do us but little
good.</p>
            <p>3. Resolve every man with <hi>Joshua, As for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96724:22"/>
me and my House we will serve the Lord,</hi> Joshua
24. 15. I will tread in the steps of my father
<hi>Abraham, I will command my children and my
houshold to keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18. 19.
as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4. 3, 4. If they be
my children and my servants, if they expect
from me the love of a Father, or the care of
a Master, <hi>My God shall be their God,</hi> I will
shew the love of a Father and Governour
unto them, in not suffering their souls by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
neglect of mine <hi>to be poisoned</hi> or endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any perverse or Heretical doctrine.
The way to keep God in a <hi>Nation</hi> is for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to keep God in his <hi>own heart,</hi> and in
his <hi>own family first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Prize highly the presence of Christ in
<hi>his Ordinances,</hi> the communion of Saints, the
assembling of your selves together, <hi>Heb. 10.
24. Contend earnestly</hi> for the faith, <hi>Jude v. 3.
Buy the truth, sell it not,</hi> Prov. 23. 23. Let no
interest, no party, no policie, make you
willing to part with any truth of God for
promoting any designe of man. If any man
speak disgracefully of the Scriptures; if any
man tempt you to forsake the Ordinances, or
to beget any low or base esteeme of them in
you, say unto him as Christ to Satan, <hi>get
thee behinde me. Christ will not forsake those</hi> to
whom he is <hi>precious.</hi> The more value we
set upon him, the more careful we will be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96724:22"/>
to keep him, the more willing he will be to
continue with us.</p>
            <p>5. Pull off the <hi>vizard,</hi> and look through
the <hi>disguizes</hi> which are put upon <hi>false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Recens vastatio vineae vulpem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat affiusse, sed nescio qua arte fingendi ita sua confundit vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia callidissimum animal, ut qua vel intret vel exeat, haud sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile queat ab ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine apprehendi, Cumque pateat opus, non apparet auctor, &amp;c.

<hi>Hereticks</hi> will bring in their opinions <hi>privily,</hi>
and by <hi>faire words</hi> and good speeches will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

<hi>Mystery</hi> on their forehead, <hi>Rom. 16. 17. Eph.</hi>
4. 14. Col. 2. 8, 18. 2 Thes. 2. 3. 2 Pet. 2. 1.
Rev. 17. 5. When <hi>Agrippina</hi> poisoned <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
she mingled the poison with the meat
that he loved, as men <hi>gild over bitter pills,</hi>
and as <hi>Lucretius</hi> speaks, tip the Cup wherein
there is a bitter potion with hony. Satan
knows how to <hi>transform himself into an Angel</hi>
of light, and under pretentions of higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
like painted Sepulchres, to veile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and palliate rotten and unsound opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>6. Judge of <hi>Ends by the Meanes</hi> which are
used to compass and promote them; there
never wants good meanes to advance good
Ends. We shall <hi>never need to do evil,</hi> that
good may come of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. the wife
in the Law was not to do an undecent thing
in defence of her own husband, <hi>Deut. 25. 11,
12.</hi> If you see men revile Ministers, decry
Ordinances, broach Heresies, foment Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
disrespect and lay aside Wise, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96724:23"/>
Sober, Serious, Grave Orthodox Patriots,
<hi>Latet anguis in herba,</hi> certainly the ends may
justly be suspected, that make use of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients,

            <p>2. To you that are <hi>Magistrates</hi> in this great
City,</p>
            <p>1. Study your <hi>Character,</hi> your <hi>Authority,</hi> and
your <hi>Duty,</hi> carry your selves like <hi>Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
to be a terror to evil doers; be men of
courage, loving truth, &amp;c. <hi>Exod. 18. 21.
2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. Rom.</hi> 13. 4. Beg wisdome
of God as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, that he may shew you
the right way, that you may have him, his
house and glory nearest to your heart. If
you intend Gods house, he <hi>will preserve and
build yours,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 11. If you appeare for
him, he will engage for you. If you ask
wisdome to serve him in your places, he will
give honour and other good things without

            <p>What an honour would it be for such a

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96724:24"/>
in prosperity, in honour for above fourscore
years together, maugre all the power and

our selves by our sinnes have loosened the
joynts of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and done
that with our own hands, which our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

attempt. Oh that now, when the Lord
saith, <hi>seck my face,</hi> we would all say, <hi>Thy

<hi>Turne ye back-sliding children, and I will

Joshua 9. 19. It is not safe to distinguish

            <p>Lastly, consider in this our day what are
the things which belong to our peace,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42. It is a great <hi>wisdome</hi> in
evill dayes <hi>to redeeme Time,</hi> Ephes. 5.
15, 16. It is noted of the <hi>men of Issa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char</hi>
that they had <hi>understanding of the
Times to know what Israel ought to do,
1 Chron.</hi> 12. 32. As <hi>Mordicai</hi> said to
<hi>Ester,</hi> who knoweth whether thou art
come to the Kingdome for <hi>such a time
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96724:26"/>
as this?</hi> Ester 4. 14. Surely in such a
time as this, a day of trouble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
it is necessary for every man to
beg of God to <hi>shew him his way,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
with the Word of God, what wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or counsel, or help he may put
in to keep God with us, and to prevent
this dismall Woe of Gods removing our
Candlestick and departing from us. Must
I <hi>write?</hi> must I <hi>speak?</hi> must I <hi>counsel?</hi>
must I <hi>pray?</hi> must I <hi>do Judgement and
Justice? Lord we seek of thee a right way,</hi>
be thou intreated of us, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21, 23.
In evil and dangerous dayes, as all men,
so especially <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> Magistrates
and Ministers are by their fidelity and
zeal to stand in the gap, and to obviate
those judgement which are impendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us.</p>
            <p>I conclude with the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi>
Zach. 2. 5. The Lord is a <hi>Wall</hi> of fire
round about, where he is the Glory in
the midst of a people. He will <hi>encamp</hi>
about his House, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 8. upon all his
