         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>JANUARY.</head>
            <p>IT is now <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and winged Time (the measure of motion) begins to turne the Wheele of his Revolution. The smiling fields and youthfull meadows have lost their particoloured Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; The Woods have parted with their beautious verdour, and the amorous Trees that but the other day with out-stretcht armes embraced each other, stand now at a distance. In a word, the White hath routed the Greene Regiment, root and branch. The Squirrel now (that Hector that covers her back with her Tayle) survayes the Nut and the Maple all day, and at night goes to Bed in her Kell, whilst the proud Oake stoops to the Axe; and the Hedge-hog rowles up himself like a foot-ball, and with his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fortification stands on his own guard. The Black-bird finds thin shelter in the bush, and therefore leaves not a berry on the thorne. The Fisherman hath now but a cold Trade, and the frost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipt Centinel keeps a hard watch, when he dares not for his ears stir off though he be ready to eat his fingers end. The Cook-room now is not the worst place in the Ship: And the Shepheard hath a bleak seat on the Mountaines. The dryed grasse is the horses Ordinary, and the Meale of Oats and Beanes makes him trot through the Mire. The Garden Earth is turned up for her Roots. The Load-horse hath his full back burthen to the Mill, and the Wench should not ride on it were she not light. The Thresher in the Barne tryes the strength of his flaile, and counts it better employment then washing of Sheep. To conclude; the Hills and the Valleys, and the flowery Meads doe pennance in a sheet of snow for their luxury and pride in the Spring; whilst the hard heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frost locks up the Wormes, and the Pismires, and the blind Velveteers in the earth.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have showne you in part what <hi>Ianuary</hi> is, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is rather felt then understood. I now come to advise you, and in the first place, have a care of Bleeding, except in case of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by falls or otherwise, there your Physitian will advise you to it to prevent accidents that doe commonl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> attend such maladies: Or else in violent <hi>Haemorrages,</hi> or bleeding at Nose, for revulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sake; but truly as to Feavors or Plurysies they have their spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, safer, and more proper Cures without Phlebotomy. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41233:4"/>
give thee the same advice I meane to practise my self; that is, now and then in snow and frosty weather, to thaw your congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led veyns, and cherish it with a glasse or two of rich and rasie wines, which are chiefly chosen by these five F's, <hi>Fortia, Formosa, Fragrantia, Frigida, Frisca.</hi> Neither would I have you too busie with Physick without great occasion constraine, for mens bodyes are bound up as the earth in frosty weather, and therefore not without extream danger are purging medicines exhibited to open the pores of the body for cold and pernicious Aire to enter. Be sure you have a care of taking the least cold head or foot, for this Month Rheumes and Flegme doe extraordinarily encrease. To fast long is exceeding hurtfull, it fills the stomack and intestines with wind, and renders thee subject to Collicks, Convulsions, and Illiack passions. But to drink a draught of Ale and Wormewood wine mixt in a morning, comforts the heart, scowers the Maw, and purges the Ureters, and is good against gravell or stone. Let your diet be such as is naturally of a moderate heat, and you may eat a more liberall meale now then in Summer, for the heat of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is more intense, and vigorous to concoct what it requires or receives, then it will be when the Sun with his nearer neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood calls forth that now self-centered heat to the extimous and cutaneous parts of the body. As to Apparell, I hold it a needlesse thing to prescribe, for I presume frost and snow will convince thee that a freez Jacket, will doe ye more service then a Taffita doublet.</p>
            <p>For the Country man if he live in stiffe simple clayes, let him in this Month in the first place, plow up his pease earth, that it may lye and take baite before it be sowne: But if he live in fertile and well mixt soyles, then in this month he shall begin to fallow the field he will lay to rest the next yeare; but if he live upon hard barren earths (of which chiefly I write) then in this Month he shall water his Meadows and pasture grounds, and drain his arable grounds, especially where he intends to sow pease, oats, or barley the Seed time following: also he shall stub up all such rough grounds as he intends to sow the next year.</p>
            <p>Now measure and trim up your garden mould, and comfort with manure, sand, or lime the Roots of all barren fruit Trees, and cleanse away mosse and superfluous branches from them. You may plant, or transplant all manner of fruit-trees, as Apples, Peares, Plums, Cherries, Filbert, Walnut. The fittest time of setting all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41233:5"/>
manner of Plants or Quicksets (the weather open and the ground easie) is from the change to the first Quarter.</p>
            <p>You may now geld such Cattle as ye intend (the state of the Moon alwayes considered) and such as are sick or weak ye may drench, Kine with Verjuice and London-Triacle, and Horses with your common Mashes of water, and ground Malt, and a little Bran. The time is good to reare Calves, and remove Bees.</p>
            <p>Now for the recreations of this Month, they are within, or without doores, within, as it relates to Christmasse; it shares the chearfull carrolls of the wassell cup, Beasts, Fowls, and Fish come to a generall Execution, and Hecatombs are sacrificed to cold weather, and Cards and Dice purge many a purse, and the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous youth shew their agility in shooing the Wild-Mare. The Lord of misrule is no meane man for his time; a good fire heats all the house, and a full Alms-basket sets the beggar to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Masking, and Mumming, and choosing King and Queen, the meeting of the friendly, and the mirth of the honest.</p>
            <p>For out door Recreations. Now does the early Hunts-man prevent the Sun-rise, and watches the Stag to his Leire, (which this month he expects in the Corne fields of wheat and Rye) and having lodg'd him, home he comes for his Horne and his deep mouth'd Quire; now are the pampered Pransers trampling the Plaines as greedy of sport as their Masters. Now are the finders cast off, and after a ring or two about, in goe the full mouth'd cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and now the Hunts-man comforts the Hounds with his Horn, and the sight of the Stagg. Now the Horses try their heels, and the Riders their throats, whilst the empty Woods Eccho the thunder with a double resound: The horses sweat, the Hunts-man frets, and the Stag is imbost, the next and last refuge is a sett, or a Soyle, then comes the death of the Deere, and the Talbot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples his Tongue, and his Master his hands with the reeking blood.</p>
            <p>Now the Woodcock and the Pheasant pay their lives for their feed, and the Hare after a Course makes his Hearse in a Pye. The Oxe and the fat Weather now furnish the Market; and the poor Coney is so ferrited that she cannot keep in her Burrough; The Curryer, and the Lime-Rod are the death of the Fowle, and a long Peece, and a good water Spaniel are no bad company. The Faulcons Bells ring the Mallards knell, and the Hare and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41233:5"/>
Hound put the Huntsman to the horne. The barren Doe subscribes to the dish, and the smallest seed makes sawce for the greatest flesh, but the shoulder of an hog is a shooing horne for good drink. The Maid is stirring betimes, and slipping on her shooes and her Petticoat, groaps for the tinder box, where after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict between the steele and the stone she begets a spark, at last the Candle lights on his March; then upon an old rotten foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of broaken boards she erects an artificiall fabrick of the black Bowels of New-Castle soyle, to which she sets fire with as much confidence as the Romans to their Funerall Pyles; the comfortable light whereof is the good fellows Cynosure, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more magnetick then the Loadstone; for there he stayes till like the fly he scorches himself in the flame, which like that strange Lightning melts the Blade in the Scabberd, I mean the plate in his Pocket, whilst he is making his offering to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> To conclude, this Month is the rich mans charge, and the poor mans misery.</p>

The Frog goes to seek out the Paddock; and the Crow, and the Rook mislike their old Mates. The Usurer now is lapt in his furres, and the poor makes his breath a fire to his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends.

And for the small pleasure that I find in it, I will thus briefly conclude of it: It is the poor mans pick-purse, and the miser's Cut-throat; the enemy of pleasure, and the exercise of patience.</p>
            <p>In this Month eschew all such things as oppilate and stop the Liver and Veines or doe thicken the blood, of which kind are Milk and Rice, and slimy fish; and yet also forbear medling with Physick or blood-letting, except necessity doth urge, and the Learned advise you.

The Dew hangs in Pearles upon the tops of the grasse; while the Turtles sit billing on the little green boughs. The beasts of the Wood look out into the plaines: And the Fishes out of the deep run up into the shallow waters. The Fowls of the Aire begin to build their Nests, and the sencelesse Creatures gather life into their bodyes. The Sun with his refulgent rayes enlightens and warmes the Aire, and the little Flyes to Flock and swarme in it. Now the Muses try the Poeta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Sheeps eye in the Lambs head tell kind-hearted Maids strange tales; and Faith and Troth make the true Lovers Knot: It were a World to set down the worth of this Month; for it is Heavens blessing, and the Earths Comfort; It is the Messenger of many pleasures; the Courtiers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, and the Farmers profit; the Labourers Harvest, and the Beggers Pilgrimage.

            <p>In the month of <hi>Aprill</hi> finish up all your Barley Seed, and begin to sow your Hemp and Flax, sow your Garden Seeds and Plant all sorts of Hearbs, finish your graffing in the Stock, but begin your principall inauguration, for then the rind is most pliant and gentle. Open your Hives, and give your Bees free Liberty to look into the Garden and the blossoming buds; leave to succour them with food, and let them alone to labour for their living.</p>
            <p>Now cut downe all great Oake timber, for now the Bark will rise and be in season for the Tanner. Now scower your Ditches, and gather such manure as you make in the Streets, or high wayes into great and convenient heaps together. Now also lay your Meadows and sleight your Corne ground; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away stones, and repair your high-wayes; set Oziers and Willowes, and cast up the banks and mines of all decayed fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As yet ye may graffe or proine Vines, and also set Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Melons, Cucumbers, Artichoaks, and Pole-hops. And you that are Tanners, it is your season now to look out for the ruffe skins of the lofty looking Oake that yields to good Day-men natures abundance.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41233:12"/>The best time to put your Stallion and Mares together is about the Middle of last Month, if you have any graffe, and you should have great care for that purpose, and one foal falling in <hi>March</hi> is worth two failing in <hi>May,</hi> because he passeth as it were two winters in a year, and is thereby so hardened, that almost nothing can afterward impaire him: And the best time to take your Horse from the Mares againe is at the end of <hi>April</hi> or middle of <hi>May,</hi> a months continuance together is ever sufficient; but be sure to put them together in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Moone, for foals got in the Wane are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted strong and healthfull.</p>
            <p>In this instant Month of <hi>Aprill</hi> the pores of mans body are opened by the approach of the Sun, and apt to receive Physick, and they that refuse the same, I commit them to the benefit of Nature, for of all times of the year, this is the best to prevent causes of sicknesse, or for speedy Remedy in extremities, for now nature doth renew strength through all the body of man, so that where sicknesse happeneth she soone disburdeneth her self by the assistance of Physick, and of this be confident, what cannot be done now will hardly be ever capable of Remedy after: Take time therefore by his foretop for he is bald behind; you may very safely either take purging Medicines or any physick your approved Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian shall advise you to. You may Bathe freely or bleed, provided the Patient be not under fourteene years, or above fifty six Old, or be exceeding fat or very lean; in such cases, by all means abstaine. Lastly, Use wholsome Dyet that breeds good sanguine Juyce, such as Pullets, Capons, sucking Veal, Beef not above three years Old, a draught of morning milk fasting from the Cow, Grapes, Raysons, and Figs be good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat, Rice with Almond Milk, birds of the Field, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants and Partridges, and fishes of Stony Rivers, Hen Eggs potcht and such like.

word, it is the moneth wherein Nature hath her full of mirth, and the Senses are stored with delights; It is therefore from the Heavens a grace, and to the Earth a gladness; I hold it a sweet and delicate Season, the Variety of Pleasures, and the Paradice of Love.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> sow Barley upon all light sands and burning grounds, so likewise order your Hemp or Flax, and also all sorts of tender Garden Seeds, as are Cucumbers, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and all kinde of sweet smelling Herbs, and Flowers; Fallow your stiff Clayes; Summer-stir your mixt earth, and Soil all loose hot sands; prepare all barren earth for Wheat and Rye; Burn Bait, Stub Gorse, and Furres, and Root out Broom and Fern; Begin to Fold your Sheep, lead forth Manure, and bring home Fewel, and Fencing; Weed your Winter Corn, follow your common Works, and put all sorts of Grass either in Pasture, or Teather; You may this moneth also put your Mares to Horse; let nothing be wanting to furnish the Dayrie, and now look and Pot up your Butter; true it is, you may if you please Pot it up at any time betwixt <hi>May</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> observing to do it in the coolest time of the morning; yet the most principal season of all is in this moneth of <hi>May</hi>; so now the Ayr is most temperate, and the Butter will take Salt the best, and be the least subject to reesting.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41233:17"/>
the sweet Herbs put the Distiller to his Cunning, while the green Apples on the Tree are ready for the great-bellyed Wives; Now begins the Hare to gather up her heels, and the Fox looks about him for fear of the Hounds. In brief, I thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I hold it a sweet season, the Senses perfume, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits comfort.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of <hi>Iune,</hi> carry Sand, Marl, Lime, and Manure of what kinde soever, to your Land; Bring home your Coals, and other necessary Fewel, fetcht far off; Cut rank low Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and make the first Return of your fat Cattel; Gather early Summer Fruits; It is now good time to distil all your Simple Waters, as Roses, and all manner of Herbs and Plants, and to make Syrups of Flowers and Juyces; Now also gather what Herbs you mean to lay up for Winter Service, but be sure you dry them in the shade, for the vigour of the Sun will else exhale all the vertue from them, and leave only the Terreity or earthy part, which signifies nothing in Physical Use; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless after you have dryed them in the shade, it is necessary to expose them in a Sive or brown Paper to the Sun, to exhaust the Flegme, and make them thorow dry, left when you paper them up, they do in moist weather give again, and mould. Good Husbands and Huswives are now be-weeding the Corn, and the Garden, and Shearing their early fat sheep. The Season serves to set Rosemary and Gilly-flowers; take heed of cutting Trees, Hedges, or Herbs with a knife, but rather gather them with your Fingers; Now you may set Saffron, carry out Compost, make Hay, rid Gardens of Snails, Ants, and Pismires.</p>
            <p>I promised you in the conclusion of my last monethly Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise a further accompt of the Recreation of Angling, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you be for the <hi>Bleak, Ruffe,</hi> or <hi>Perch,</hi> you must know, they are Fishes which bite neither high nor low, but (for the most part) in the midst of the water, therefore your Line must be very lightly plumb'd, and far from the Hook; the Baits which most entice them, besides the red Worm, are the House-fly in the Summer, and fat of Bacon in the VVinter; In <hi>April, May,</hi> or <hi>Iune,</hi> they will bite at the Bob-worm, or the Maggot, and in all other Seasons, they seldome refuse any VVorm or Canker; your Line would be small, and well armed from the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41233:17"/>
Hook, a handful at least, with small wyre, for the teeth of the Perch will else gnaw it asunder.</p>
            <p>For a Chevern, the best standing to take him is, concealed, behinde a Tree, or an Arch of a Bridge, or a VVall; their haunts are in clear waters, which run upon Sand or Gravel; and they are in best season from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>Michaelmass.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>IT is now <hi>Iuly,</hi> and the Worlds great eye, the Sun, is moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the highest loft of the Horizon. The grasse of the Mountaines withers, and the parched earth would be glad of a draught of Raine to slake her thirst. Now doth the Farmer make ready his Teame, and the Carter with his whip hath no small pride in his whistle. The Cannons of Heaven begin to rattle, and when the fire is put to the Charge, it breaketh out among the Clouds, and the Stones of congealed water cut off the ears of the Corne. The Cuckoe spits and storms, and the blacknesse of the Clouds affright the faint-hearted. The Stag and the Buck are now in their Pride and their prime, and the hardnesse of their Heads makes them fit for the Horner. Now hath the Sparhawk the Partridge in the foot: And the Ferret is tickling the Coney in the Burrough. The Sparrows make a charme upon the green Bushes, till the Fowler comes and take them by douzens. The Lark leads her young out of the Nest, for the Sythe and the Sickle will downe with the Grasse and the Corne. The old Partridge calls her Covey in the Morning, and the Shepheard folds his flock in the Evening. The Hedges are full of Berries, the high wayes of Rogues, and the lazy Limbs sleep out their dinner. Malt is now above wheat with a number of mad people. Pears and Plumbs now ripen apace, and being of a crude watery substance are the cause of many diseases. The Butler now hath the better of the Cook, and a fine shirt is as comfortable as a freeze Jerkin. The Pipe and the Tabor now follow the Markets, and he that hath money gets many a good Penny-worth. The Ant and the Bee are at work for their Winter provision: and after a frost the Grassehopper is no more seen. Milk, Butter and Cheese are the labourers dyet; and a pot of good Beer quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens his spirit. If there be no plague the people are healthfull, for continuance of motion is Natures preservative. The fresh of the morning, and the coole of the evening are the time the Court walks; but the poor dusty Traveller treads out the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41233:19"/>
whole day. The Smelt is now in season, and the Lamprey out of the River leaps into the Pye. The Souldier now hath a hot March, and the Lawyer sweats in his lined Gowne. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> the Pedler hath a long walk; and the dram of the bottle sets his face on a fire. In a word, this is a profitable season, The Labourers gaine, and the rich mans wealth.</p>
            <p>Now Courteous Country man, make Hay while the Sun shines, for a day slackt is many pounds loft, chiefly when the weather is unconstant; sheare all manner of field Sheep, and Summer-stir rich stiffe grounds, soyle all mixt earths, and latter soyle all loose hot sands. Let Hearbs you would preserve now run to seed. Cut off the stalks of outlandish Flowers, and cover the Roots with new earth, so well mixed with manure as may be. Sell all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In this Month use cold Hearbs and coole dyet, and abstaine from physick by reason of the intemperate heat of the weather. The Rivers now are more wholsome and delightfull then the Baths. Let the Sun be up before ye walk abroad in the time of contagious diseases, as plagues or pestilence. Keep your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber windowes shut, and open then only when the Sun shines with vigour, be sure every morning to perfume your house well with Tarr and Angelica Seeds burnt in a fire-pan, or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing dish of coales, then which nothing is better.

            <p>The Recreations and Country contentments more properly appertaining to this Month are Bathing and swimming in the coole and Christall Rivolets; or shooting at Buts, Pricks, or Rivers. And Bowling (however tearmed like Cards and Dice

unlawfull) I am sure is an healthfull exercise and good for the body, and hath been prescribed for a recreation to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the Learned Physitians, in which there is a great deale of art and judgment to be seen especially in the expert Bowler in choosing out his ground, and preventing the many hanging, win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Bowles being best for close Allies, your round byassed bowles for open grounds of advantage, and your round Bowles like a Ball for greene swarths that are plaine and levell. Others are Fishing in the Christall current for the fine speckled Trout, whose baits are this Month either the Grashopper or the humble Bee, dryed Wasps or dryed Hornets, or some of their young brood in the Combs, these are your baits proper to the Season, and I think a word of caution and Direction is not much out of season.</p>
            <p>Having gotten your baits you must look that they be good sweet and fine, for else they are uselesse, and you might as well have been at home as by the Riverside; then you must not angle in unseasonable times, for the Fish being not enclined to bite, it is a strange enticement that can compell them. You must also be carefull neither by your apparell motion or too open standing to give affright to the fish; for when they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then you must labour in clear and untroubled waters, for when the Brooks are any whit white or Muddy, or thick through inundations or other trouble, it is impossible to get any thing with the Angle. In the next place, you must be sure to have a respect to the temper of the weather, for extream wind, or extream cold taketh away all manner of appetite from Fish, so doth likewise too violent heat, or Raine th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>NOw do the Reapers try their Backs and their Arms, and the lufty Youths pitch the sheafs into the Cart, the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menty pot welcomes home the Harvest Cart, and the Garland of Flowers crowns the Captain of the Reapers; the Battel of the Field is now stoutly fought, and the proud Rye must stoop to the Sickle; the Sun is somwhat towards his Declination, yet such is his heat, as hardneth the soft Clay, dries up the standing Ponds, withereth the sappy Leaves, and scorcheth the skin of the Naked; now begin the Gleaners to follow the Corn-Cart, and a little Bread to a great deal of Drink makes the Travellers Dinner; the Melon and the Cucumber are now in their season, and Oyl and Vinegar dance attendance to the Sallad-herbs; the Ale-house is more frequented then the Tavern, and a gently gliding River is more comfortable then a fiery Furnace; the Bath is now much visited by diseased bodies, and in the fair Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, swimming is a sweet exercise; the Bowe, and the Bowl pick many a purse, and the Cocks with their heels kick away many a mans wealth: <hi>Zephyrus</hi> now with his sweet breath cools and perfumes the parching beams of <hi>Titan,</hi> while the ripened Fruits dangling down the Boughs, shew the wealth and the beauty of the Earth; the Pipe and the Taber are now busily set a work, and the Lad and the Lass will have no lead on their heels; the new Wheat makes the Gossips Cake, and the Bride-Cup is carryed above the heads of the whole Parish; O 'tis the merry time wherein honest Neighbours make good cheer, and God is glorified in his blessings on the Earth. In sum, for that I finde, I thus conclude, <hi>August</hi> is the worlds welfare, and the Earths warming pan; or thus, I hold it to be the Heavens boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Earths beauty, and the Worlds benefit.</p>
            <p>Apply your selves now to your Harvest, for if ye had as many hands as <hi>Briarius,</hi> they must all turn Corn-cutters; Shear down your Wheat and Rye, and Mowe your Barley and Oats; but have a care your early Sickle prevents not the maturation and ripening of your Corn. And as I would not you should reap too

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, so that the grain either becomes dung or dirt, or at best it is so stinking and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury, that it is good for no use or purpose, as is daylie to be seen, where careless Husbands gather in their Corn without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or Government, making the old Proverb true, that <hi>Haste bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gs Waste.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cure and prevention of this inconvenience, is the well-husbanding and managing of the Harvest, first with a careful and well-judging eye to look upon your Corn, and to know by the hanging downward of the Ear, whether it be ripe or not; for when it is so, it will look as it were back again to the ground, then to look into the cleanness of the Corn, as whether it be full of greeness, as grass, weeds, and such like; or clean of it self, without any mixture; If you finde there be any weeds mixt with it, then you may reap it so much the sooner, though the kernel be not so well hardened as you could wish; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shorn it so full of weeds, by no means sheaf it, but spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thin in the Sun, let the grass wither all the day, which when you perceive to change colour, and grow dry, then binde it up in sheafs, and let it lye single a day, that the Wind and Sun may get into it, and dry the greeness more sufficiently, then lay it in shocks of six or eight sheafs a piece, and in those shocks turn the Ears so inward, that the other bigger ends may defend them from rain, wet, or dew that may fall upon them; then a day or two after lay them in shocks of twenty, or four and twenty sheafs a piece, and in those shocks let them take a Sweat; then b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eak them open in a bright Sun-shine day, and let the Ayr pass thorow them to dry them, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thwith lead the Grain home, and either house or stack it, and (be sure) when thus ordered and dryed, it can never take hurt.</p>
            <p>Now ye may make the second return of your fat Sheep and Cattel; Gather all your greater Summer fruits, Plumbs, Apples, and Pears, make your Perry and Cyder; set slips of all sorts of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41233:22"/>
Gilly-flowers, and Siens of other Flowers, and transplant them that were set the Spring before; and at the end of this moneth, begin to winter-rig all fruitful soyls whatsoever; you may now also very seasonably geld your Lambs, carry Manure from your Dove-cots, and put your Swine to the early or first Mast.</p>
            <p>They that would have good seeds for their Gardens next Year, must now gather of their own, lest in buying their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be frustrate, and so they lose their labour, and their layings out; and such as desire to have Lettice, or other Herbs for the Winter, they must sow their seeds in the Increase of the Moon.</p>
            <p>In <hi>August</hi> moderate diet is good Physick, for now there is danger of surfets, and take heed of heats, and then colds, for it is the high way to a Pleurisie, and use not to sleep much, especially after Noons, for fear of oppilations, and stopping Flegme, and for the avoiding of Agues, Head-ach, and Catarhs; avoid Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, unless necessity compells, and abstain from Wine, shun Feasts and Banquets, and only take delight in diet and drinks that are cool, and temperate.</p>
            <p>I had a touch at your Recreations before, and that your Cock may not kick your Coyn out of your pocket, I shall give you some marks to choose a good one by; know then, that the best characters observable in a fighting Cock, are his shape, colour, courage, and sharp heel; for his shape, the middle size is ever accounted best, because they be ever most matchable strong, nimble, and ready for your pleasure in his battel; and so the exceeding little Cock is as hard to match, and is commonly weak, and tedious in his manner of fighting; He would be of a proud and upright shape, with a small head, like a Spar-Hawk, quick large eye, and a strong back crookt, and big at the setting on, and in colour sutable to the plume of his feathers, as black, yellow, or reddish; the beam of his leg would be very strong, and according to his plume, blew, gray, or yellow, his spurs long, rough, and sharp, and a little bending, and looking inward; for his colour, the gray pyle, the yellow pyle, or the red with the blanck breast, is esteemed the best, the pyde is not so good, and the white and dun are the worst; if he be red about the head like scarlet, it is a signe of lust, strength, and courage; but if he be pale it is a signe of sickness and faintness; for his Courage,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41233:23"/>
you shall observe it in his walk, by his treading, and the pride of his going, and in his Pen by his oft Crowing; for the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his heel, it is only seen in his fighting, for that Cock is said to be sharp or narrow heel'd, which every time he riseth, hitteth and draws blood of his adversary, gilding his spurs in blood, and threatning at every blow an end of the Battel. I wish you such a Cock. Farewell.</p>

               </gap>hering leaves fall after it; the lofty Ash that but the other day lockt up his moisture in his arms, and vertical boughs, now hath got a Palsie, and lets his keys fall. In a word, the whispering woods are now fain to quit their leavie pretences, and come to the naked truth; the Meadows are left bare by the mouths of the hungry Cattel, and the Hogs (those four-footed Swains) are become the Plowers of the Corn-fields; the wind begins to bluster among the Apples, and knock their heads together on the Trees, and the wind-falls are gathered to fill the Pies for the Houshold, except the old Sow return by chance from her Field-labour, and eat them raw to qualifie the heat of her stomack; the Saylors fall to work to get afore the wind, and if they spy a storm it puts them to prayer; the Souldier now begins to shrug at the weather, and prays for the dissolution of the Camp, that he may get to his Landladies fire side in a Garrison. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer now is hard at his Harvest, and with his Tongue and his Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box reaps most of the gain of his poor Clients Sickle, while his labouring hands pay for his lying tongue; the Inns now begin to provide for guests, and the night-eaters in the Stable pinch the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Quinces should not be kept with other fruit, for the scent is offensive both to the other fruit, and to them that keep it, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or in half filled Sacks, where they may be bruised; and thus much for fruits. Now to other Concerns.</p>

            <p>Lastly, In this moneth such as have need, may safely take Physick, or if occasion be, may bathe, and bleed, all such things are in their proper Nature and Vertue; and such Fruits as are ripe, and not corrupted, may safely be eaten by those that have good stomacks; It is now good time to make Conserve of Quinces and Barberries; Winter Herbs may now be sown; now likewise is the time to set your Artichoaks, Rose-trees, Apple-trees, Wardens, Strawberries, Violets, Gilly-flowers, sowe Parsnips, and in dry weather gather your Hops, and it is no bad Huswifry to make Verjuyce, and pluck Hemp.

Muffing and Cuffing are now in request, and he that will goe to Billinsgate fort may have a Cuff on the ear: It is now not amisse to play at Hot-coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles hot, unlesse Coals be the cheaper.

The Load horses goe apace to the Mill: and the Corn is in the flower puddings, and Pancakes are meat for the Lads, and — Pyes are the delight of the Lasses. The Hare on the hill makes the Greyhound a faire course; and the loosing of labour is the saving of life. The Fox just unkenneld makes the Huntsmen laugh, and the Hounds cry. The scarcity of people makes a plenty of Wares, but a smooth and soft tongue vents many a hard bargaine. The Marriner now bestirreth his stumps while the Merchant liveth in feare of the weather. The Cooks are preparing the great feasts for the City; but the poor must not beg for fear of the Stocks. A good fire and a paire of Cards keep the guesse in the Ordinary; and the smoak of Tobacco is precious, and held soveraigne for Catatths, and troublesome Rheums. The Shuttle-cock and Battledore is a good house ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and occupies the Lady before she be drest.

Now sell all such Sheep as you will not Winter; give over your Foaling, and separate the Lambs from the Ewes which you purpose to keep for your own stock, and follow hard the making of your Malt, not forgetting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that <hi>Soft Fire makes sweet Malt.</hi> Nor shall I here think it amisse, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> you (I hope) tedious, if I insert a few directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the young and unexperienced touching the drying and cleansing your Malt.</p>
            <p>Dry it with a gentle and soft fire, ever and anon turning it (is it dryeth on the Kilne) over and over with your hand, till you find it sufficiently well dryed. Now as soon as you see the Corne begin to shed, you shall in the turning the Malt rub it well between your hands, and scowre it to make the Come fall away; then finding it all sufficiently dryed, first put out your Fire, then let the Malt dryed coole upon the Kilne for four or five hours at lest, then raising up the foure corners of the hair cloath, and gathering the Malt together on a heap, empty it with the Come, and all into your Garner, and there let it lye (if you have not occasion to use it) for a month, or two, or three to ripen, but no longer, for as the Come or dust of the Kilne for such a space melloweth and ripeneth the Malt, making it better both for sale, or expence, so to lye too long doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender weevell, wormes and Vermine which doe destroy the graine.</p>
            <p>Now for the dressing and cleansing of Malt at such time as it is either to be spent in the house, or sold in the Market; you shall first winnow it with a good wind either from the Aire, or the Fanner, and before the winnowing you shall rub it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41233:28"/>
well between your hands to get the Come or sproutings cleane away; for the beauty and goodnesse of Malt is when it is smug, cleane, bright, and likest to Barley in the view, for then there is least wast and greatest profit, for Come, and dust drinketh up the liquor, and gives an ill tast to the drink. After it is well rub'd and winnowed, you shall then Ree it over in a fine sieve, and if any of the Malt be uncleansed, then rub it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the sieve till it be pure, and the rubbings will rise on the top of the sieve, which you may cast off at pleasure, and both those rubbings from the sieve, and the chaffe, and dust which cometh from the winnowing should be safe kept, for they are very good swines meat and feed, well mixt with whey or swillings; and thus after the Malt is well Ree'd, you shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sack it up for especiall use, or put it into a well cleansed Garner, where it may lye till there be occasion for expense; and thus much I think sufficient to speak of Malt.</p>
            <p>Now to your health. As for what concerns your health, take my counsell, refuse not any needfull physick if you be advised thereunto by your skilfull Physitian. If occasion serve use warme baths; get good hot meat and drink, and good and wholsome wines to nourish good blood. Keep your feet dry, and warme, and beware of taking cold, for quartane Agues are gotten this Month, and gotten rid of God knows when. Use all moderate Recreations, for any thing is good which by stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and warming the bloud reviveth the spirits.</p>

            <p>If you intend to have an excellent piece of Hempen Cloth, which shall equal a piece of very pure Linnen, then after you have beaten your Hemp excellently well, and Heckled it once over, you shall then rowl it up again, dry it as before, and beat it again as much as at the first, then Heckle it through a fine slaxen Heckle (and the Towe which falls from the Heckle, will make a principal Hemping) but the Leaf it self a cloth as pure as fine Huswifes linnen, the endurance and lasting whereof is rare and wonderful. But,</p>
            <p>Now concerning Flax a word also; Flax, after it hath been twice swingled, needeth neither more drying or beating, as Hemp doth, but may be brought to the Heckle in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you did Hemp, only the Heckle must be much finer and straiter, and (as you did before) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst Heckle being much courser then the latter, holding the strike stisse in your hand, break it very well upon that Heckle, then the Hurds that come off you shall save to make fine Hurden cloth of, and the strike it self you shall pass thorow a finer Heckle, and the Hurds which come from thence, you shall save to make fine middle cloth of, and the tear it self for the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t linnen.</p>
            <p>To dress Flax for the finest use that may be, as to make fair Holland cloth of great price, or thread for the most curious use, you shall take your Flax after it hath been handled as is before shewed, and laying three strikes together, plat them in a plat of three, so hard and close as is possible, joyning one to the end of another, till you have platted so much as you think convenient, and then begin another plat, and thus plat so much as you think will make a rowl like unto one of your Hemp-rowls, and then wreathing them hard together, make up the rowl, and so many rowls more or less, according to the purpose you dress them for;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41233:30"/>
this done, put the rowls into a Hemp-trough, and beat them soundly, rather more then your Hemp, and then open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plat it, and divide every strike from other very carefully; then heckle it through a finer Heckle then any formerly used, for of heckles there be ever three sorts, and this must be the finest, and in this Heckling you must be exceeding careful to do it gently, and deliberately, lest what you heckle from it should run to knots, as it is apt to do, but being done artificially, as it ought, you shall have it look and feel like fine Cotton, or Jersey wool, and this which thus looketh and feeleth, and falleth from the Heckle, will notwithstanding make a pure fine Linnen, and run at least two yards and half in the pound; But the Tear it self will make a perfect strong, and most fine Holland, and run at least five yards in the pound.</p>
            <p>After your Tear is thus drest, you shall spin it either upon Rock or Wheel, but the Wheel is the swifter way, and the Rock maketh the finest thread; you shall draw your thread according to the tear, and as long as it is even, it cannot be too small, but if it be uneven, it will never make a durable cloth; now for as much as every Huswife is not able to spin in her own house, you shall make choice of the best Spinners you can hear of, and to them put forth your Tear, weighing it before it go, and weighing it again after it is spun, and dry, allowing weight for weight, or an ounce and half for waste at the most; as for the prices for spinning, they are according to the Natures of the Countrey, the fineness of the Tear, and the dearness of provision; some spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the pound, some by the lay, and some by the day, as the bargain shall be made.</p>
            <p>For your health, eat good, wholsome, and strong meats, very well spiced and drest, and free from rawness, and use meat nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing the blood, and drink sweet and insophisticate Wines, and for digestion, ever before apples, or cheese, or such trumperies, prefer good and moderate exercise, keep your body from head to foot warm and dry, lest Tooth-ach and Rheum make ye wish ye had; beware of Hot-houses this moneth, lest the pores of your body set open by violent heat, as violent and piercing colds make their entry, not easily to be driven or complemented out of their new possessions; and let me here advise what Physick you mean to take, to finish now till the next <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> unless urgent occasion. If the 10. day be cloudy, it denunciates a wet; if dry, a sharp winter.</p>

The Asse that hath borne all the yeare must now take a little Rest. The Oxe and the Cow, and the Horse and the Mare shall have their christmasse provant. Now Plumbes and Spice, Sugar and Honey, square it among Pies and broath; and Gossip I drink to you, and how doe you, and you are heartily welcome, I pray be merry, and I thank you. Now are the Taylors and the Tyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers full of work against the Hollidayes, and a journey man cares not a rush for his Master, though he beg his Plum-pottage all the 12 dayes. Now or never must the Musick be in tune, for the youth must dance and sing to get them a heat, while the aged set by the fire; Nature hath made it a Law, and reason finds no contradiction. The fat Oxe must dye, and the leane one live till he be more worthy the slaughter. The Footman now shall have many a fowle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Country maid leaves half her Market, and must be sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if she forgets a pair of cards on christmasse Even. Great is the contention of Holly and Ivy, whether Master or Dame weares the breeches. The price of meat riseth apace, and the Aparrell of the proud makes the Taylors rich, and as proud as themselves. Dice and the cards benefit the Butler; and if the cook doe not lack wit he will sweetly lick his fingers. Now Starchers and Laundresses have their hands full of work, and and periwigs; and paintings will not be a little set by; strange Stuffs will be well sold, strange tales well told, strange sights much sought, strange things much bought, and what else as falls

out. To conclude, I hold it the costly purveyer of excesse, and the after-breeder of necessity; the practise of folly, and the purgatory of Reason.</p>
            <p>In the month of <hi>December</hi> put your Sheep and Swine to the Pease reeks, and fat them for slaughter, or the Market. Now kill your small Porks, and large Bacon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd rise up in an extraordinary furrow, then in this Month begin to plow up that ground whereon you meane to sow cleane Beane only. Now cover your dainty fruit-trees over with Canvase; and hide all your best flowers with rotten horse-litter from the impetuous tyranny of frosts and stormes. Now draine all your Corn-fields, and as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion shall present it self, so water and keep moyst your Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows for the utility of the soyle.</p>
            <p>Now fish for the Carp, the Breame, Pike, Tench, Barbell, Peale, and Salmon; omitting the rest I shall give you a word of direction for angling for the Pike, the Barbell, the Breame, the Salmon. The Pike is a fish of great weight, in so much that you can hardly have a line of haire to hold him; therefore your best anglers use most commonly a chaulk line, your angle rod also must have no small top, but be all of one peece and bigness, and the Line made exceeding fast from slipping, your hoose would be of the strongest wire, white or yellow, and made dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the poynts turning two contrary wayes, and then armed with strong wyer, a foot at least; his best bait is a little small Roch, Dace or Minim, the hook being put in at the Taile, and coming out at the Gills, and you must seldome or never let your b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it lye still in the water, but draw it up and downe, as though the fish did move in the water, and fled from the Pike, for this will make him more eager and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sty to bite; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bit, you must be sure to tire him well before you venture to take him up. The yellow live Frog is also an excellent bait for the Pike, for you must understand they naturally delight not in any dead, or unmoving food.</p>
            <p>There is also another way, which is to snickle a Pike, the manner thus, first find the Pike where she lyeth, (which about
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41233:33"/>
Noon you may easily doe) then take your chaulk-Line with a noose of small wyer at the end of it, put it gently into the water about two feet before the nose of the Pike, then when you feele it touch the ground, cause one to goe behind the Pike, and with a pole to stir him; then as he shooteth meet him with your noose and with a sudden and quick Jerk throw him upon the Land; in this sport you must be very nimble, ready, and quick-fighted, for if you give him the lest time he will escape you.</p>
            <p>The Barbell or Graveling, which some call the Ember, is a very subtle and crafty f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh, you must therefore be carefull that your baits be sweet and new, and when you angle for them, doe in all things as you use for the Trout, for they bite aloft in the Summer, and at the bottome in the Winter; your line must be extraordinary strong, and your hooks of a three-penny compasse, for they are Fishes of very weighty bodies, and being struck must have liberty to play and tire themselves, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> else they will endanger the breaking of your rod, and therefore your line must be the longest size. The best season to angle for the Bream is from the latter end of <hi>February</hi> till <hi>September.</hi> He is a very lusty strong Fish also, and therefore your tools must be able, and good; the baits in which he most delighteth are the butter-flies, green-flyes, wormes of all sorts, past of bread-crumbs, or the brood of wasps.</p>
            <p>Now Lastly, touching the angling for the Salmon, albeit he is a fish which in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uth is unfit for your travell, but because he is too hege and cumbersome; as also in that he naturally delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to lye in the bottome of great deep Rivers, and as near as may be in the middle of the channel; yet forasmuch as many men esteeme that best which is got with most difficulty, and trouble: you shall understand that the baits in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e most delighteth are those that serve for the Trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as paste or flyes in the Summer, and red wormes, Bobwormes or Cankers on the Water docks after Michaelmasse; and thus much for Fishing at this time.</p>
            <p>You may also now seasonably become a Fowler, for all fowls whatsoever with Peece, Nets, or any manner of Engins, for in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41233:33"/>
this Month no Fowle is out of season, and I presume a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spanniel is now better to keep, then to hang. Christmasse is come and the Wild Swan, the Teals, and the Mallard are meat for the Landlords mouth, and the Tenants too if he can get them.</p>
            <p>For your health, keep your bodies warme, let your meat be hot of quality, abstaine from physick, and let your Kitchin be your Apotheca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
