         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ever ſince its Recovery from the Darkneſs of Popiſh ignorance and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has been no leſs the envy of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the Honour and Glory of all other <hi>Reformed Churches:</hi> for its <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are Holy and Primitive, its <hi>Liturgy</hi> pious and devout, all her <hi>Doctrines</hi> conſonant and agreeable to the word of God. She retains the Ancient <hi>Creeds,</hi> She Rejects all novel and ſuperſtitious Doctrines, that are neither to be found in, nor warranted by the Word of God: She retains the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtituted by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and rightly and duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters them, and that whole and entire according to Primitive Inſtitution, and that too, neither Superſtitiouſly advancing them above the nature of Sacraments, nor yet prophanely, or irreverently, detracting from the Greatneſs and Holineſs of their Myſtical, and inviſible ſignificance. <hi>Marvel not therefore Brethren if the World hate you,</hi> for even our dear Redeemer was hated and ſcorned and ſhamefully put to Death, and ſhall the <hi>Diſciple</hi> be above his <hi>Maſter?</hi> 'Tis what our Saviour himſelf foretold, <hi>they hate me, they will hate you alſo:</hi> Now altho' it may be objected, that there are ſeveral ſcandalous and looſe Livers among the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> what then? does not the Church reprove ſuch? Does it not correct ſuch?
<pb facs="tcp:59256:3"/>
And if they prove obſtinate and incorrigible, does ſhe not diſown ſuch? And 'tis no wonder that among ſuch a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Clergy there ſhould be ſome ill perſons; Our Saviour when preſent upon Earth in his humanity, was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut a <hi>Judas</hi> among twelve, and no doubt it will be ſo in all numerous Aſſemblies, while the world endures. But this is matter of Compaſſion, not of ſcorn, they are Perſonal Blots, but does not injure the Conſtitutions or Doctrines of the Church. All theſe things are more amply and fully handled in the following Book, which was firſt Printed in 1663. and then humbly Dedicated to the King and his great Council the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> and it having fallen into my hands of late, after a careful and delightful peruſal of it, I thought it not improper to Reprint in theſe times, and therefore recommended it to the Bookſeller as a uſeful piece, and ſo I do to thee <hi>Reader,</hi>

If we may believe the integrity of thoſe Reformers that ſetled this Church, whoſe learning, worth, and piety, hath been confirmed by the Teſtimony of ſo many wiſe and religious Princes, by the approbation of ſo many learned and reverend Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the applauſes of ſo many other reformd Churches:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59256:5"/>
if we may believe the preaching living and dying of ſo many hundred excellent Biſhops and Miniſters, or the Prayers and proficiencies of ſo many thouſand of godly Chriſtians; or if we may believe the wonderful bleſſings and ſpecial graces of a merciful God, atteſting the verity, integrity and ſanctity of my Chriſtian Conſtitution for many happy years: or if you will believe all men in <hi>England,</hi> who have by oaths and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, by Vows and Proteſtations reſolved to maintain the Proteſtant Religion as it was eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who diſpair any where to find the way of truth and peace, of holineſs and happineſs, but in the uſe of thoſe holy means, and in the exerciſe of thoſe divine graces which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſalvation, within me profeſſed and enjoyed. I know nothing excellent in any Church for outward policy, inward tranquilitie, and eternal felicity; nothing that was pious or peaceable, moral or vertuous, ritual or ſpiritual, orderly or comely, or any way conducing to truth and holineſs, to grace or vertue, to the ſouls edification and comfort, which was not by me entertained with competent Maintenance, noble Encouragements, ingenuous Honours, peaceable Serenity, and munificent plenty; In which I flouriſhed ſo many years by Gods goodneſs, and mans indulgence.</p>
               <p>Alas, whatever I have done in the ſettlements of the Rites, Circumſtances and Decencies of Religion, I have obſerved that modeſty, wiſdom and humility that became a Church of Chriſt, in diſcreetly and ingeniouſly complying with ſober, primitive and venerable Antiquity in the Church, as far as it obſerved the Rules of Gods Word, and went not beyond the liberty allowed it in point of Order and Decency. O you are too knowing to be ignorant, and too ingenious to be inſenſible of your duty to God, and your reſpect to me; who was heretofore ſo much loved by my Children, applauded by my Friends, reverenced by my Neighbours, ſeared and envyed by mine Enemies for thoſe ſpiritual Gifts, Miniſterial, Devotional and Practical, which were evidently ſeen in me, thoſe heavenly influences which people received from me, thoſe gracious examples and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent good works ſet forth by me, the bleſſed experiences men enjoyed with me, the charitable ſimplicities exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by my members, the numerous Aſſemblies, the frequent

Devotions, the reverent Attentions, the unanimous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, the well-grounded hopes, and unſpeakable comforts which thouſands enjoyed, both living and dying, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to, and communion with me; which to impartial men were moſt impregnant evidences, and valid demonſtrations of true Religion, and a true Church, ſetled by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and publick piety of a Chriſtian Nation. He was a wiſe, holy, and reverend Son of my boſome, who ſaid, <hi>That in the greateſt maturity of his Judgement, and integrity of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when moſt redeemed from juvenile Fervours, popular Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies, vulgar Partialities, and ſecular Flatteries, he declared to the preſent Age and poſterity, that ſince he was capable to move in ſo ſerious a ſearch, and weighty a diſquiſition as that of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is; as his greateſt deſign was through Gods grace to find out and perſevere in ſuch a profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion as hath moſt of truth and order, of power and peace, of holineſs and ſolemnity, of divine verity and Catholick antiquity, of true charity and holy conſtancy: ſo he could not (apart from all prejudices and prepoſſeſſions) find in any other Church or Church-way, ancient or modern, either more of the good he deſired, or leſs of the evil he would avoid, then he had a long time diſcerned, and upon a ſtricter ſcrutiny more and more in the frame and form, in the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Diſpenſation of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>No where,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>diviner Myſteries, no where ſounder Doctrinals, bolier Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, warmer Devotionals, apter Rituals or comlier Ceremonials. All which together by a meet and happy concurrence of piety and prudence, brought forth ſuch Spirituals and Graces, both in their Habits, Exerciſes and Comforts, as are the Quinteſſence and Life, the Soul and Seal of true Religion; thoſe more immediate and ſpecial Influences of Gods holy Spirit upon the Soul, thoſe joynt Operations of the bleſſed Trinity, for the Juſtification, Sanctification, and Salvation of a Sinner.</hi>

               <p>Would you have me give offence to the whole Chriſtian World, which either is or would be governed by Biſhops, as the moſt Apoſtolick, Primitive, and Univerſal Way?

I endeavour that my Biſhops may be among Chriſtians the moſt faithful; among Men, the moſt civil; among Preachers the moſt painful; among Orators, the moſt perſwaſive; among Governours, the moſt moderate; among pious Men the moſt fervent, among Profeſſors, the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; among ſevere Men the moſt exact; among Sufferers, the moſt patient; among Perſeverants the moſt conſtant: the moſt compleat every way, and perfect unto every good work.

My Rule to them is, That they ſhould over-rule with vigilance, ſhould rule with joynt counſel, neither levelled with younger Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Novices, nor exalted too much above the grave and Elder.

Indeed the whole compoſure of my Liturgy is (in my judgement) ſo wholeſome, ſo holy, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, ſo diſcreet, ſo devout, ſo uſeful, ſo ſavoury, ſo well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed, that I find nothing in the eighteen Liturgies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Eaſtern and Weſtern Church, that is excellent, but is in this of mine; and many things which are leſs clear or neceſſary in them, are better expreſſed or wiſely omitted here; the whole being ſo ordered, as might beſt inform all peoples underſtandings, ſtir up their affections and quicken their devotions, in a wholeſome form of ſound words; ſuch as <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> the Prophets, and the Lord Jeſus left behind them, ſolemnly recorded in the Scriptures. So that according to the primitive care, I firſt laid down Scripture grounds in the Creeds and Confeſſions, and then I enlarged and fixed my Liturgies and devotions as near as I could to the majeſty, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and exactneſs, unanimity and fulneſs of publick Prayers upon all holy publick occaſions, ſo plainly, that the devout ſoul knows well what it ſhould deſire of God; and ſo affectionately, that it earneſtly deſires in it, what it knoweth God alloweth; and ſo uniformly, that it peaceably goeth along with the Congregation, with one mind and one heart <hi>in the unity of the ſpirit, in the bond of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Is it the Rites and Ceremonies I impoſe that diſpleaſe you? Alas I find the God of Heaven which we worſhip in <hi>England</hi> enjoyning more Ceremonies on his own people, and forbidding no holy cuſtom to any Chriſtians, in order to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the decency and order of his ſervice, or Chriſtians mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual edification and joint devotion under the Goſpel. Our bleſſed Saviour hath by his ſpirit guiding the pens and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Apoſtles, ſufficiently manifeſted the Power and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty given the Church, and the Governours of it, for the choice and uſe of ſuch decent cuſtoms, Rites and Ceremonies, (not as divine inſtitutions upon the conſciences, butashu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59256:7"/>
injunctions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the practiſes) as agree with godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the truth of the Goſpel, and may beſt ſerve for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, decency, peace, ſolemnity, and mutual edification of Chriſtians, agreed upon by publick conſent; in which every ones vote is perſonally or vertually included. It's true, as the Liturgy, ſo the Ceremonies have ſomething of <hi>Rome</hi> in them: for to deal plainly, I did freely and juſtly aſſert to my own uſe and Gods glory whatever upon due tryal I found to have the ſtamp of Gods truth and grace, or the Churches wiſdom and charity upon it. I would not refuſe any good I found amongſt them, becauſe it was mixed with ſome evil; but trying all things, I held faſt that which was good, being intent upon the great ends of piety, devotion and charity. It's true I enjoyn my people an inward worſhip of ſoul, in ſpirit and in truth, before God; but withal I enjoyn outward worſhip of the body; (which is but a reaſonable ſervice to God that made the body) exemplary and ſignificant before men, in ſuch habits and geſtures as may moſt conduce (by the advice of the whole Church; for the private ſpirit of the prophets, in thoſe things ought to be ſubject to the publick ſpirit of the Prophets) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, devotion and edification, in knowing, humble, meek and quiet ſpirits, rightly diſcerning the innocent nature of ſuch things not prohibited and ſo indifferent; and the Chriſtian liberty allowed to them, to uſe thoſe things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent when commanded, and to lay them aſide when not commanded. However, let the many Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to unity by the true Faith you joyntly profeſſe give you more ſatisfaction, then the occaſions of dividing the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in which you differ give you offence: ſo that you may not upon ſo ſmall occaſions, in ſuch ſmall matters, ſacrifice to your private paſſion and perſwaſion the publick Peace and Proſperity of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially ſince I never heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſober Chriſtian, or truly godly Miniſter, who (being in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things prudent, unblameable, and ſincere) did ever ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any check of conſcience meerly upon the account of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been conformable to, and keeping communion with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor did they ever complain of Ceremonies, Liturgy and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, as any damps to their real graces, or to their holy communion with Gods bleſſed ſpirit; but admired them as the united influence, the joynt conſent, the combined devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59256:8"/>
of all good Chriſtians in this Nation, who publickly agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one mind, and in one manner to ſerve the Lord, in a way allowed by the moſt pious of Princes, practiſed by the beſt Nobility, owned by the wiſeſt Gentry, maintained by the moſt learned Clergy, and embraced by the beſt ſort of Commons. I allow only ſuch Ceremonies as make religious Duties not more pious, but more conſpicuous; not more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, but more ſolemn; not more ſpiritual and holy, but more viſible, imitable and exemplary; to quicken my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to allure others, to inſtruct and edifie all.</p>
               <p>5. Are ye offended with my Canons and Injunctions? Is it fit that a few men whom order and Policy hath made infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to others, as the Rulers and Repreſentatives of the whole ſociety, ſhould prefer their own private Opinions and Judgements before the well-adviſed Reſults, the learned Connſels, the pious Endeavours, and ſolemn Sanctions of ſo many, eminent for piety, prudence, integrity, publick influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and juſt Authority?</p>
               <p>6. Are my ſolemn Faſts and Feaſts, your grievances? thoſe ſolemn remembrances of Gods Mercy to men in Chriſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with prayer, praiſes preaching and communicating to Gods glory, and all ſober Chriſtians improvement, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the known preſident of the Jews, and the general practice of the Chriſtian Church? What harm is there if ſome good men obſerving a day, obſerve it to the Lord; and others not obſerving a day, obſerve it not to the Lord?</p>
               <p>7. Do you reſent my Endeavours for Unity and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? Alas, I deſire only that men ſincerely worſhip one true God, and profeſs the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be partakers of the gifts and graces of the bleſſed Spirit, and may have an holy communion with that adorable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with one another in love and charity, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, enjoying the nobleſt life, the ſweeteſt ſociety, and moſt heavenly fraternity; imitating God, emulating Angels; Children and expectants of happineſs, Partakers of grace, and daily preparing for eternal Glory: that all men who have been called, baptized and inſtructed by lawful Miniſters here, in the myſteries and duties of the Goſpel, may make a joynt and publick profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and Reformed Religion, in the name, and as the ſenſe of the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59256:8"/>
grounded upon the holy Scripture, guided alſo and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by that uniforme order, due authority, and holy. Miniſtry for Worſhip and Government, which according to the mind of Chriſt, the pattern of the Apoſtles, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all primitive Churches, hath been lawfully eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wiſdom and conſent of all Eſtates in this Kingdom, for Gods honour, the Churches ſafety, the publick peace, and the common good of ſouls.</p>
               <p>8. Do I not allow you a juſt liberty to do ſuch things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and chearfully which are moſt proper and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the nature and excellency of men? to think what is true, to do what is fit, and enjoy what is juſt in reference to God, others and your ſelves? I have taken from you no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty but that of <hi>doing evil:</hi> you are at liberty to enjoy all the comforts, priviledges, and Ordinances which Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, in an holy order, and regular way, for private or publick good; and to hope for that reward and crown which God the righteous judge hath promiſed thoſe that perſevere in well doing. My higheſt aim is, that you may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to exerciſe a good conſcience, void of offence towards God and towards man, that they may willingly in all things live honeſtly.</p>
               <p>9. Are ye diſpleaſed with my Members? Alas, innocent men, they purſue after the knowledge of, and communion with God, in order to a rational, religious, ſpiritual, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, perfect, and unchangeable life; enjoying themſelves in the bleſſed enjoyment of God, the enjoyment of whom ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth all their deſires, rewards all their duties, requites all their ſufferings, compleats all their happineſs; crowns and perfects true Religion. They endeavour that <hi>on earth</hi> which they hope for <hi>in heaven;</hi> viz. a right knowledge and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling performance, which as reaſonable they owe for ever to God their Maker, Preſerver, and Redeemer in Chriſt. With this religious frame and temper, of which themſelves only are conſcientious they prepare for a glorious and bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, with a ſincerity of heart, and uprightneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which hath no other Rule but Gods Word, no other End but Gods Glory, no other Comfort but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this Diſpoſition to their Lives end. Innocent men, they look for one common Salvation, they uſe one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59256:9"/>
Sacrament, they profeſſe one Faith and Rule of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have one Gracious Temper, the ſame inward ſenſe of Duty and Devotion; they walk in the ſame order with the Catholick Church over the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>10. Do you envy me my Patrimony and Maintenance, what the Law of God allows me, what the Goſpel hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided me, what the Piety of Elder times hath beſtowed upon me, what good Kings, Peers and people of their own endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with, freely <hi>honouring the Lord with their ſubſtance,</hi> that they that ſerved the Altar, might live by the Altar? O why may not my children who attend the Goſpel, live by the Goſpel, ſince they attend a Miniſtry as venerable in its My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, as clear in its Doctrine, as glorious in its chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as painful to it's Miniſters, and as comfortable to pious and devout ſouls, as the Miniſtry of the Law? Why are you offended that they of my children that are taught, ſhould communicate to them of my children <hi>that teach in every good thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Do you envy my juſt Power and Authority, whereby with the wiſdom gravity and integrity of ſuch men as are inveſted with that power, I may check all abuſes and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, and by a well-ordered diſcipline, I may recover my ſelf to my former glory and renown, for which I was ſpoken of throughout the World?</p>
               <p>12. Do you except againſt the private infirmities, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal failing of my Biſhops and Miniſters, as leſs ſtrict and unblameable in their lives, leſs painful in their calling, leſs prudent in their undertakings, or leſs compaſſionate in their Government? though all the world knoweth that within me Learning flouriſheth, knowledge multiplyeth, Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, excellent Preaching thriveth, Sacraments are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred, the fruits of Gods ſpirit are mightily diffuſed, hoſpitable kindneſs is exerciſed, Chriſtian Charity is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, plain heartedneſs and Good works are eminent; though I know the Chriſtian world cannot ſhew men more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent then ſome of my Clergy are for well-weighed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for Chriſtian Courage and Patience, for ſincere piety, for indefatigable induſtry, for Care and Vigilancy, for exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vertue, for ſound Doctrine, uſeful Writing, prudent Governing; for a firm Conſtancy, for fatherly Inſtructions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59256:9"/>
charitable Corrrections, and imitable converſations; who guide the people without any allowed licentiouſneſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, any undecency in Devotion, any irregularitie in Adminiſtration; in all which according to the ſacred directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Word, according to the heavenly aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, they teach them to worſhip the only true God, who is bleſſed for ever; as the admirable inſtruments of Gods glory, and the good of mens ſouls: teaching them a fruitful and effectual Faith, a ſound and judicious knowledge, an hearty and ſincere Love, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and prudent Zeal, a ſevere and through Repentance, fervent and devout Prayers, godly and unfeigned Sorrow, ſpiritual and unſpeakable Comforts, well grounded and firm Hope heavenly and holy Converſation, a meek obedience and ſubmiſſion in the general frame of Chriſtian mens car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Though I have men famous for greatneſs of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſoundneſs of Judgement, gravity of Manners, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of Lives; yet among my ten thouſand Miniſters, it's likely ſome may do amiſs. If when there was but three men in the world, one was a Murtherer, if among <hi>Noah's</hi> ſons, one of the three was diſobedient; If among <hi>Jacob's</hi> children, of two one was prophane; if of twelve Apoſtles, one was a Devil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother diſſembled, and a third denyed his Maſter; if among the Aſian Angels, there is none but was to be reproved; if among the few Primitive Preachers, there was a <hi>Demas that loved the preſent world,</hi> a <hi>Diotrephes that loved the preeminence:</hi> among my ſo many thouſand Clergy; it's not likely but that ſome may fall ſhort of the ſevere exactneſs required in all Miniſters, who ought to be patterns in good works.</p>
               <p>Oh my Clergy are not Angels, but men ſubject to the like infirmities with other men. <hi>If they ſhould ſay they have no ſin, they would deceive themſelves, and the truth would not be in them: but if they confeſs their ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive them their ſins, and to cleanſe them from all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Be Perfection the glory of other Church-members, the glory of mine is Sincerity. <q>Without all peradventure, the moſt holy and all-ſeeing God, who walketh in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks, whoſe pure eyes are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the Miniſters of the Church, hath found iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his ſervants the Biſhops, and other Miniſters, both as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59256:10"/>
to their perſons and profeſſions; all things being open and naked to him with whom we have to do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1. He obſerves how many conſecrated and ſet apart to the ſervice of God and his Church in the name, place power and authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and approaching his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with <hi>Aaron</hi> in the holy of holies, in the glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of God in Chriſt to his Church, by publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and ſpiritual Influences, have not ſo ſanctified the Name of the Lord God, their God, in their Hearts and Lives, in their Doctrines and Duties.</p>
               <p>2. The great Searcher of hearts knoweth how raſhly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Miniſters undertake, how careleſly they manage that great and terrible work, under which Angels may ſwoon, and great Apoſtles cry, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things!</hi> how vulgarly they converſe, how lazily they live, how looſely they behave themſelves, how ambitiouſly they deſign, how covetouſly they reach, how enviouſly they repine, how unexemplarily they walk unworthy of the favour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence ſhewed them, to the amazement of their High-cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the diſhonor of their Profeſſion, to the forfeiture of their Dignity and Plenty, the endangering of their Peace and Safety.</p>
               <p>3. He that is about our paths, and about our dwellings hath obſerved how unpreparedly, negligently and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, how partially, popularly and paſſionately, how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and vainly, without any power of godlineſs, Life of Religion, ſome perform the work of God, the great work of Eternal concernment to our own and other mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>4. He whoſe eyes ſee, whoſe eye-lids try the children of men, hath looked down from heaven, and obſerved the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of ſome mens holy things; their dead and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, inſtead of a living and acceptable ſervice: he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of that ſupine negligence which hath ſunk ſome mens Miniſtrations below the juſt majeſty, ſolidity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Goſpel-diſpenſations; others by an affected height and depth, for want of plain inſtruction, and charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending, amuſe the poor people, who know not what they ſay, nor whereof they do affirm.</p>
               <p>5. He that will reprove, and ſet mens ſins in order before
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59256:10"/>
them, hath taken notice of ſome mens remiſs compliance, and others exact rigours, (according to their private tempers, judgements and paſſions) whereby they ſwerved too much from that juſt charity, diſcretion, legality and conſtancy which my Canons intented, and my conſtitution, health and peace required; eſpecially in the peeviſh touchineſſe of theſe times, when ſo many ſubtile and envious ones lie in wait to deſtroy me.</p>
               <p>Yet my Church-mens exorbitancies are not my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their failings are not my frame, their infirmities are not my nature; their fall is no more mine who diſallows it, then the Angels fall may be the Heavens that forbid it: their weakneſſes are humane, my authority is divine: that charity which thinketh no evil, will not lay upon me thoſe enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which I forbid by a Law, which I reſtrain by Diſcipline, which I mourn for in mine Humiliation, and diſcountenance in thoſe great patterns that ſhew a moſt excellent way. Theſe ſins (O the Chriſtian world!) are tranſgreſſions of my Law, affronts to my Authority, the baffles of my Cannons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions. O that my Apologie were written, yea, printed in a book, for the ſatisfaction of the world, <hi>that the good that I would do, that I cannot do? and the evil that I would not do that I do! I find a law of my members againſt the law of my mind:</hi> So that it's no more I, but the ſins and the ſinners that dwell in me.</p>

It's you, it's you whom I have nouriſhed and brought up as children, whom I have encouraged as Miniſters, whom I have promoted as Governours; it's you that have brought this reproach and danger upon me. When I had with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick patience endured the oppreſſion of adverſaries, by a Chriſtian prudence defeated the attempts of Schiſmaticks, by an exemplary humility and piety turned the hearts of enemies, and by a miracle of Reſtauration ſilenced the mouths of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you my Sons, opened the mouth of ſcandal, ſtrengthned the cry of reproach, raiſed the clamours of the envious. Oh, if an enemy had done this, I could with the ſame Chriſtian courage I have ſuffered theſe twenty years, have born it; but it`s you of my own boſom, family and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: O you, my Clergy, whom I expected more glorious, more eſteemed, more reverenced before all the world, after

your conſtant ſufferings, who coming out of this fiery furnace, might ſhine brighter then ever you did with the love of Chriſt, and of me his Church, both as to the care of thoſe private charges and publick inſpections, committed to you in excellent order, and by due authority: and I expected that neither pride nor envy, pomp nor popularity, neither cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs nor ambition, ſhould diſtract the thoughts, divide the hearts, exaſperate the humours, or provoke the reproach of an incenſed people againſt my Order and Government, and the good of all ſorts of Chriſtians. Whoſoever of you, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the miracles both of your ſufferings and relief, at ſuch a time as this, when the mouth of Hell is open againſt me, ſhall open any other mouth to joyn in the cry againſt the Church, give life or tongue to any ſcandalous ſin, and ſet that to its <hi>clamans de terra,</hi> crying from the ground; that by lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury or ſloth, by covetouſneſs or griping, by inſolence or pride, by careleſneſs or looſeneſs, by diſorder and irregularity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall juſtifie mens malice againſt me, and by that means perſwade credulous and eaſie people, that is true that hath been ſaid of me, all is juſt that hath been inflicted upon me; I know not what Wo is heavy enough for him: <hi>O alas, my Brother!</hi> O it had been better for him <hi>he had never been born.</hi>

                  <p>YEt I will juſtifie you (O ye my reverend Sons) in this, that though you were ſurprized to ordain young men, yet you hoped that years might <hi>improve them;</hi> and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet you may hope that Diſcipline may <hi>reform them;</hi> and unlearned men, yet you may hope that time (with Gods bleſſing upon their private induſtry and ſtudious piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) may <hi>inſtruct them;</hi> but I cannot with patience ſee your hands laid upon their heads ſo ſuddenly for their Ordination, who laid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59256:16"/>
their hands lately upon you for your ruine. O that mine head were waters, that mine eyes were a fountain of Tears, to weep for the unhappineſs of the daughter of my people, that muſt needs unadviſedly authorize men principled againſt its Government, prejudiced againſt its Order, prepoſſeſſed againſt its Liturgy, and privately practiſing againſt its peace and happineſs! In vain doth Authority ſilence your old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, if you <hi>conſecrate</hi> new ones: in vain do they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the former race of <hi>Non conformiſts,</hi> if you raiſe up a new Generation, <hi>a ſeed of evil doers, children that are corrupters.</hi>—Shall we perpetuate our miſeries, and keep up our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs? Muſt a ſad race of Diſſenters run paralel with the Orthodox ſucceſſion to the end of the world? whereby I muſt languiſh and die, my reformed Religion muſt decay, my pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and charity muſt be weakned, and my Authority and diſcipline languiſh. What eye will pity me, when I have raiſed thoſe men that ſhall ruine me, when I have commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned thoſe men that ſhall oppoſe me, and given them an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for popular applauſe who ſhall uſe it againſt me? without my leave no Ordination; no Ordination, no pretence to preach; no preaching, no publick opportunity to ſeduce whole multitudes againſt Doctrine and Diſcipline, againſt Order and Government. My ſafety is now in mine own hands: If I take care whom I prefer, I need not care whom I may fear: If I carefully chuſe my Miniſters, I need not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſuſpend them: If I took care whom I ordained, I might without any noiſe put an end to all my trouble: Mortality would ſilence thoſe Miniſters that now diſturb my peace, and my care may prevent any more. How ominouſly do ſome men diſcourſe? how popularly do they endeavour to preach? what dangerous intimations do they make? how untowardly do they confirm? how auckwardly do they uſe my Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? and read my Liturgy? when I conſider the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and ſubmiſſion to my Government and Diſcipline before the Wars, by all the Clergy &amp; Layty of theſe Kingdoms; and withal, remember how contrary to true Learning and honeſt Integrity, as if they underſtood not what they did, or that they did conform contrary to their conſcience, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their former oaths and practiſes, againſt their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws in being before the points in controverſie

had any free and impartial debate, theſe men cryed down the eſtabliſhed Government and Religion, and approved and encouraged the violent and moſt illegal Extravagancies, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the utter ruine of Religion and Government.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I muſt confeſſe that moſt of all ſides who have thought or done amiſſe, have done ſo not out of malice or wilfulneſs, but out of miſ-information or miſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>apprehenſion of things: and therefore I charitably think none will be more faithful then thoſe perſons who upon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made ſenſible of their errours, do feel in their hearts moſt vehement motives of repentance, and earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to make ſome reparations for former defects. Yet ſuch <hi>ſincere Converts</hi> are they, who are not ſo much frighted with the ſudden miſcarriages, as convinced of the continued er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of their ways; who are rather perſwaded by the truth and reaſon I always urged, then <hi>awed</hi> by the authority and power I now enjoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo are not blindly carried on by that Providence that <hi>advanceth</hi> me now, as it did, and may again <hi>overturn</hi> me; but are rationally wrought upon by the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant evidence of the Word, the clear practice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, the beſt Comment upon that Word, and the irreſiſtable ſtrength of Reaſon for Order and obedience, upon which I was alwayes Eſtabliſhed, which they have not raſhly complyed with, untill they had examined all Allegations impartially, ſurveyed the merit of the Cauſe leaſurely, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon God by prayer humbly, ſearched the will of God and the conſtant practiſe of good men diligently and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, converſed with good and knowing men profitably and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily, and denyed themſelves in all worldly reſpects moſt Chriſtianly. The Lapſed were not formerly admitted to the communion of Chriſtians, much leſs to the honour of Miniſters, without that diſcreet delay wherein they might have time to ſatisfie themſelves in the <hi>reaſon,</hi> and others in the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of their repentance and converſion. With that caution, was the Jewiſh Proſelyte received to the ſynagogue? with what care ought a Chriſtian be brought to the Pulpit? Do they ſerve God in this compliance, or do they ſerve the time? If they ſerve God, he was the ſame as yeſterday, ſo to day, and for ever. Do they ſerve the times? God forbid that they who teach a Religion whoſe intereſt is in another
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59256:17"/>
world, ſhould yet own no more Religion then may conſiſt with their intereſt in this, Alas, (ſay poor ſouls, diſtracted with alterations of times and men, to their unconſtant Miniſters) is this way lawful, you ſubmit to? why then did you declare it ſuperſtitious, Popiſh, and intollerable theſe twenty years, before God, Angels, and Men? Is it unlawful? why do you practiſe it now? was it againſt your Conſciences all the while it was diſcountenanced, and is it agreeable to your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences now it is upon a ſudden countenanced? Oh have you perſwaded us theſe twenty years to venture Lives and Eſtates againſt thoſe things you now allow and practiſe? Is it for this you prayed? Is it for this we fought? is this the iſſue of all our blood and treaſure? <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Oh it's a ſad thing to ſee men in the ſame Desk reading Common-prayer in a Surplice, where they preach'd againſt both Common-prayer and ſurplice. Oh it's a ſad thing to ſee men build up in a day, that which they have deſtroyed theſe twenty years. It's intolerable to ſee men keep their places by Conformity, which they gained by Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; when they turned out honeſt men by crying down my Government and Worſhip, now they keep them out by compliance with my Government and Worſhip. Alas, to ſee men Presbyterian in the beginning of the War, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the end of it, and now Epiſcopal. Where ſhall we ſtop? Where we are now, we know; where we ſhall be a year hence, God knoweth. Alas, is a good Living the only Creed men have? and Preferment their only Confeſſion of Faith? It was a miracle that St. <hi>Peter</hi> could convert three thouſand at one Sermon, It's nothing now that his Majeſty hath converted ten thouſand Miniſters with one glance of his eye. Ah, bleſſed <hi>Hammond,</hi> thou didſt write rationally; excellent <hi>Gauden,</hi> thou didſt perſwade powerfully; devout <hi>Taylor,</hi> thou didſt urge pathetically: honeſt <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> thou didſt anſwer ſatisfactorily: ſolid <hi>Sanderſon</hi> thou didſt ſtate clearly: holy <hi>

The King is reſtored, I flouriſh, and diſpoſe of all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and my Converts are innumerable. Well, I have but two Wiſhes; the firſt is, That all who are gone aſtray may be reclaimed to the way of truth; the ſecond is, That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59256:17"/>
all who are reclaimed, may be reclaimed from mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and a ſerious conſideration of all that can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged on all hands, <hi>trying all things</hi> and upon good grounds <hi>holding faſt that which is good.</hi> Give me the men who conform upon the conſcience of my principles, and not upon the proſperity of my Cauſe—who can neglect the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful errour, and own the moſt afflicted truth; who are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my principles which are conſtant, and not upon upon my preferments which are uncertain. Is it the Kings Majeſties favour they depend upon? he may fail. Is it the Church-Government they depend upon? that may fail, Is it Church-encouragement they ſtick to? that may fail. Is it the antient Truth and Faith they comply with? that hath never failed, and that will never fail. Give me Miniſters who as they preach, ſo live upon the things which are not ſeen, and not the things which are ſeen; the things which are ſeen are <hi>temporal,</hi> the things which are not ſeen are <hi>eternal.</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59256:18"/>
well aſſured that their hearts are upright in this affair: and in order thereunto, not to content themſelves with ſlight and overly examination, (there is more wickedneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceitfulneſs in the hearts of <hi>all men,</hi> then <hi>moſt men</hi> are aware of) but to make the more diligent, diſtrict and impartial ſearch poſſible in the true <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of this Change; (and for ſo much as fears and hopes have been ever found the fitteſt engines to work ſuch feats) to enquire particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly what influence or opperation either the <hi>fear</hi> of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what they had, or the hope of <hi>getting</hi> more might have in this work towards the producing ſuch an effect.</q> It will beſt become others to judge as charitably as they may; but doubtleſſe it will be ſafeſt for them to be very jealous over themſelves, leſt <hi>ſo great a Change</hi> could not have been wrought in <hi>ſo ſhort a ſpace,</hi> without a ſtrong infuſion of the one, or of the other, or both, into the Medicine that wrought it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the conjuncture of time wherein this change hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, may very probably raiſe ſome ſuſpition that a viſible hope and advantage had ſome co-operation at the leſt with whatſoever was the <hi>principal</hi> cauſe of this ſo ſudden an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If not ſo, nor ſo, but that they find themſelves clearly convinced in their judgements of their former errour, and that they are fully perſwaded that they are now in a better way then that wherein they formerly walked, it is happy for them, and I doubt not but that they will find matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in it if they be not miſtaken (a thing not impoſſible) in the tryal of their own hearts. O that I had men that in the change of times were unchangeable in their mind and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and to hold to their former and well grounded Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo long as they can neither apprehend any reaſon of ſufficient ſtrength to convince their underſtandings that they are in the wrong, or to manifeſt unto them the neceſſity of making ſuch a change.</p>

Is this the return you make to a gracious God, to diſhonour him? Is this your kindneſſe to me, to undoe me?

               <p>1. <hi>Have you never read that in</hi> Acts 8. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. And when Simon ſaw that through laying on of the Apoſtles hands the holy Ghoſt was given, he offered them MONEY, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Give me alſo this power, that on whomſoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Ghoſt. But <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto him, Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe that thou haſt thought that the gift of God may he purchaſed with money. Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God. Repent therefore of this wickedneſs; and pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity. <hi>You will ſay,</hi>

Shall a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation.</hi> They ſay wherein have we robbed God: in Tyths and Offerings. The Lay-patron takes from God, and you take from him: he ſteals from God, you receive from him. Is it his? why do you ſay Tythe belong only to Miniſters? Is it the Miniſters? why do you pay him for it? why do you juſtifie his encroachment, betray Gods right, wrong me and undoe your ſelves? <hi>Who goeth to warfare at his own charge?</hi> You do it.

of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the man of God, ſaid, <hi>Behold, my Maſter hath ſpared</hi> Naaman <hi>the</hi> Syrian, <hi>in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; but as the Lord liveth I will run after him, and take ſomewhat of him.</hi> So <hi>Gehazi</hi> followed after him: and when <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaw him running after him, he lighted down from the Chariot to meet him, and ſaid, Is all well? and he ſaid, all is well: my maſter hath ſent me, ſaying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> two young men of the Sons of the Prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of ſilver, and two changes of garments. And <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid, Be content take two talents; and he urged him, and bound two talents of ſilver in two bags, with two chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Garments, and laid them upon two of his ſervants, and they bare them before him. And when he came to the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he took them from their hand, and beſtowed them in the houſe; and he let the men go and they departed. But he went in, and ſtood before his Maſter: and <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid unto him, Whence comeſt thou, <hi>Gehazi?</hi> And he ſaid, Thy ſervant went no whither. And he ſaid unto him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and Olive-yards, and vineyards, and Sheep, and Oxen, and men-ſervants, and maid-ſervants? the Leproſie therefore of <hi>Naaman</hi> ſhall cleave unto thee, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſeed for ever. And he went out from his preſence a leper as white as ſnow.</p>

Will you add a cheat to your Sacriledge? rob God, and put a trick upon the Law? is this, is this to obey for conſcience ſake?</p>

ſouls? thoſe ſouls are provided for already. Do you aim at the benefit of the place? O unworthy man! What, embrace the preſent world! is the Tythe a Miniſters? what need you buy it aforehand? Is it the peoples? why do you take it at all?</p>
               <p>2. And is the Church grown ſo contemptible, that it may be bought and ſold for money? Is Preferment rather a prize for the Richeſt, then a reward for the Worthieſt? who will ſpend their dayes in ſerious ſtudie, and their life in weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome retirement, and their eſtates in a chargeable educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at laſt muſt either buy their preferment, or live ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and die unobſerved? what ingenious man can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure tedious allowance, unſupportable fees, intollerable baffles, and not retire to his Cloſet, and there give himſelf to diſpondency and diſpair, curſing the <hi>day wherein he was born,</hi> and the years wherein he was bred up; ſaying, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> ſecretly to his ſoul, <hi>Lord, it is enough, take away my life,</hi> ſince I have out-lived the glory of the Church, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Calling, the encouragements of Parts and Worth?—I cannot live uſefully; O that I might die comfortably!</p>
               <p>3. Have I no true Miniſters, but a Generation of <hi>Demaſſes,</hi> that embrace the preſent world? Have I no Miniſters called of God, that will live upon God? none that can truſt God with their maintenance? Will you all crouch for the Prieſts office only, that you may eat a Morſel of bread? will you all degrade your ſelves, and buy and ſell your ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and employments? Juſtly would the Catholick Church have degraded you, <hi>Can. ap. 10. Conc. Chalc. 2. Conc. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaſ.</hi> 14. And will you go on making merchandize of the Word? and will you go on in the Miniſtry, out of <hi>filthie lucre, and not out of a ready mind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, thus are my worthy Sons laid aſide, the unworthy are promoted: my people periſh, my Religion decaies, my enemies break in upon me, and I have only here and there one to ſtand by me. The <hi>weak,</hi> the ſcandalous that came in by <hi>Simonie,</hi> betray me. Oh ſacred Majeſty, O ye the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Nobility, O ye worthy Gentlemen, let it be your honour that you can diſpoſe of Livings to the glory of God, the honour of the Church, and your own comfort: let it

be your ſhame that you make any advantage of your Livings to the diſhonour of God, the danger of the Church, and the ruine of ſouls. O ye ingenious Miniſters, content your ſelves rather that you deſerve Preferment, then endeavour to enjoy them in this vile, unworthy and dangerous way: never ſtoop to theſe low terms: be rather buried in an honeſt privacie, then appear with a publick infamy. <hi>Non ſi nunc &amp; olim ſic erit.</hi> Oh ſacred and auguſt Authority of King and Parliament, own your former Laws; vindicate your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meet this threatning miſchief; ſet a watch upon Patrons and their Stewards; frown upon the reaching Clergy; find out the Panders of <hi>Symonie</hi> that lie about town, and ſet up as it were an Office for abomination.

               <p>IS your portion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oh my Sons in this life, or is it in another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is the ſatisfaction your immortal ſouls look for in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie, vain, low and periſhing contents of this world, or in the full, high and everlaſting enjoyments of the other world? If in this life you have hope only, you are of all men the moſt miſerable, the moſt contemptible, and moſt deceitful: if in another, why ſo many Imperial Laws, ſo many Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons, ſo many Decrees of Councils, ſo mans ſevere Reproofs from Fathers and Caſuiſts, ſo many Complaints and Reproaches, ſo many Laws and Injunctions, ſo many Attempts and Endeavours in Parliament theſe ſixtie years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Monopolie of Livings and Pluralities of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Why do you heap upon your ſelves this envie? why do you provoke theſe Reproaches? I provided for you libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; I checked thoſe that oppoſed your maintenance, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonablie, I encouraged your Induſtrie and Merit carefully, beyond any reformed Church in the world; I reſtored you to your Rights handſomly, I ſecured your Rights legallie: will not this ſatisfie you? will not this content you?</p>
               <p>1. It's but lately that you were thought uncapable of one Living; and now three, four, five, cannot ſuffice you. It's not long ſince you wanted neceſſaries, and do you now heap up ſuperfluities? Lately you could not provide for your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <hi>Wants,</hi> and do you now provide for their <hi>Exceſs</hi> and Pride? have you forgot how lately <hi>you graſped all,</hi> and <hi>you loſt all?</hi> Alas! Alas!</p>
               <p>2. And will you eat bread out of your Brethrens mouths, and will you ſtarve your fellow-ſervants? Are you Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? ſo are they. Are you Orthodox? ſo are they. Are you Loyal? ſo are they. Have you been conſtant? ſo have they. Are you ſerviceable to the Church? they more; <hi>in labours more abundant.</hi> Oh how many excellent men who out-lived the late miſeries, Articles, Committees, Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Proteſtations, Covenants, Engagements, <hi>lingring out their lives,</hi> laden, and almoſt oppreſſed, worn out, and quite tired with the burthen of years, cares, fears, labours, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59256:25"/>
and afflictions, are now fain to die in obſcurity, want and contempt, as if the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only this to make up the meaſure of their ſufferings, <hi>That they ſhould be undone when the Church is reſtored!</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds, ſober and able men are laid aſide, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by ſome as Orthodox, and deſpiſed by others as poor? whom the people would relieve, but that they are faithful to me: whom I would relieve, but that I am ſwallowed up by you. When you look big with your abundance and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and glory in your preferments, how many hundred able and ſober men are aſhamed of their Order and Function, are wrapped up in poverty and diſcontent, and loſt in poor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments? whoſe faithful labours I want, whoſe ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations might honour me, whoſe diligence and care might reſtore me, whoſe reaſon and learning might uphold me, whoſe powerful preaching might eſtabliſh me, whoſe ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and devotedneſs to publick good might ſave me. Alas, Sirs, <hi>let none of you think of himſelf more highly then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith, for as you have many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame Office;</hi> ſo I being made of many, am one body in Chriſt, and every one in me is a member one of another. You, my Sons, having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given you, whether Propheſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why ſhall not they that propheſie be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according to the proportion of Faith? or Miniſtrie, why ſhould not all be encouraged that wait on the Miniſtrie? or they that teach, on teaching? or they that exhort, on exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? The body is not one member, but many: now hath God ſet the members in the bodie as it pleaſeth him; and if they were all <hi>one member,</hi> where were the bodie? the eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay to the head, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more thoſe members of the body which ſeem to be more <hi>feeble,</hi> are <hi>neceſſarie;</hi> and thoſe <hi>leſs honourable,</hi> upon theſe we ought to beſtow more abundant honour. And our uncomely parts have a more abundant comelineſs: for our comely parts have no need, but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked, that there ſhould be no ſchiſm in the body, but that the members
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59256:26"/>
ſhould have the ſame care one for another. Now ye, my Sons, are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular: and God hath ſet ſome in the Church; firſt, Apoſtles; ſecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Prophets: thirdly, Teachers: Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all provided for? Oh covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts, not the beſt Livings! And yet I could ſhew you a more excellent way.</p>
               <p>Why is that Preferment engroſſed by one, which might maintain Twenty? Why are thoſe Revenues loſt upon the folly, vanity and ſuperfluitie of one family, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the honeſt occaſions of five? Oh <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the equal Diſtributer of Affairs, whither art thou fled! Oh <hi>Equity,</hi> whither art thou retired!</p>
               <p>3. If you conſider not the ſin, do you conſider the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe miſcarriages: the envie that you already ſink under, the occaſion given unto them that ſeek occaſion, which hath already diſgraced you; the great diſcontent that alreadie endangereth you. Have not you enemies to your Order, Calling and Judgement, and muſt you incenſe your friends? Muſt you provoke that God that hath hitherto upheld your Order and Function, by abuſing the maintenance he allows for his ſervice and ſervants to your own advantage? Muſt you diſpleaſe his ſacred Majeſty, by appropriating to a few ill beloved perſons, for whoſe ſake his Majeſty is thought the worſe of, that encouragement which might be equally beſtowed upon well-deſerving and well-beloved, who might in each Pariſh teach his ſubjects their duty faithfully, perſwade them to obedience ſucceſsfully and ſettle them in the Doctrine of Government according to the great Principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, moſt happily? Muſt you provoke your Brethren of the Clergy to diſcontent, by taking up all the encouragements of their Studies, all their employments and hopes? How many hopeful young men in City and Country are forced either to want, or, which is worſe, to live upon your ſmall Penſions, and ſcant allowance; and, what is natural for parts, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, in want to diſpair their fortunes, and envy yours? How readily do they now, hopeleſs of any regular favour, apply themſelves to popular applauſe, that their compliance may gain that among the people, which their merit could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you? Do not you ſee how the people forſake you, as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59256:26"/>
Self-Seekers? how the Gentry cenſure you, as Unconſcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? how the Clergy abhor you as invaders of their places and preferments? Do you not ſee that the Law can hardly ſecure you? that authority can ſcarcely defend you from all the affronts and baffles that Malice do ſuggeſt to an incenſed people? the adverſaries triumph, the many friends I have weep, the Sober and Serious are amazed, to ſee fourſcore or an hundred odious men filling up a whole Church. Do you imagine thoſe many active men will reſt in a diſpirited, poor, mendicant, decayed, dejected and vexatious condition? Do not you fear their melancholy thought, their retired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, their forlorn meetings? You know there are none ſo dangerous as the <hi>Diſcontented Scholars.</hi> Monopolie is the Ruine of the State; Pluralities are the ruine of the Church; the one neceſſitates the indigent Subject to dangerous courſes and practiſes; the other, the poor Scholar to as dangerous diſcourſes and thoughts.</p>
               <p>Is it not enough that mens late malice and inſolencie againſt the Miniſtry, reduced them to want and contempt, but that (to my ſhame, who am bleſſed of God with abundance and honour) one ſmall part of the Miniſtry ſhould reduce the other to ſmal Contributions, poor Dependencies; ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſo baſe, that men of ingenious ſpirits and learning muſt deteſt them, who cannot endure when they do their work to beg for their wages, not without forbid compliances and flatteries with vile men in their vileſt humours? Oh look upon the poor Curates, and their Families; what is their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the proſperity we now enjoy? Alas, they live by Gods mercy, and mens charity. How deſpicable is their Calling? How little their Authority? how inconſiderable their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? How ſucceſsleſs their Doctrine? how uncreditable their Lives? Do not you ſee that your fellow-Miniſters under theſe neceſſities will not long be able to aſſert the honour of their Calling; and that no after-Generation will ſucceed to inherit their poverty and pains, unleſs ſuch as will further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the Dignity of the Function? What, muſt all the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters be Stipendaries! The Faction threatned no more. Muſt they have only their allowances? Anarchie could have done no more. Are you reſtored to reduce your fellow-ſervants to that penurie by Law, which Fanaticks
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59256:27"/>
would have brought them to without Law? they wanted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this miſery, to be undone by their Brethren, and periſh by them of their own profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Obſect. <hi>Theſe poor men,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>are provided for anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to their Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Have they Parts for the Calling of Miniſters, and have they not Parts for the Maintenance of Miniſters? Can they preach the Goſpel, and can they not live by the Goſpel? Are they worthy to diſcharge your Cures, and are they not worthy to enjoy them?</p>
               <p>5. Do you deſire the advantage of ſo many Benefices, or do you deſire the charge? if the <hi>advantage,</hi> then the poor Separatiſt was in the right, when he called you <hi>Hirelings;</hi> then indeed you make <hi>merchandiſe of Souls;</hi> then you are the greateſt Juglers and Deceivers in the world; and you laugh among your ſelves, (as the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Sooth-ſayers) and confer Notes, as that Pope with his Cardinal, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>How much gain doth this fable of Chriſt bring us?</hi>—and poor ſouls ſhould avoid you as the ſhadow of death. What, ſhall I hear him whoſe godlineſs is gain! whoſe God is his belly! whoſe faith is his advantage! whoſe hope is only in this world! His watchmen are blind, they are ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they <hi>cannot bark;</hi> ſleeping, lying down, loving to <hi>ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> yea, they are greedy dogs which can <hi>Never</hi> have <hi>enough,</hi> and they are ſhepherds that cannot underſtand: they all look for their <hi>own way,</hi> every one for his gain from his <hi>quarter.</hi> Come ye, ſay they, I will <hi>fetch wine,</hi> and we will <hi>fill</hi> our ſelves with <hi>ſtrong drink;</hi> and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundantly, <hi>Fſai.</hi> 56. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Charge,</hi> do you know what you do? do you know that you muſt watch over the Congregation as they that muſt <hi>give an account?</hi> ſo many Benefices, ſo many more hundreds of ſouls that you muſt anſwer for? Do you know what it is to anſwer the great God for an immortal ſoul? do you know what it is to give an account of the purchaſe of Chriſts bloud? do you know what is the work, what is the charge of a Miniſter? Oh poor ſouls! you conſider not whether ſome have not accuſed you to God, whom you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw; whether ſouls under your charge are not daily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another world, with doleful complaints againſt you,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59256:27"/>
whom you never knew; whether any in Hell do not cry out againſt you, whom you never ſaw: thouſands have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Judgement-ſeat of God, excuſing themſelves with your faults, though you lay it not to heart; alledging, that they ſaw no more Religion in the world then Intereſt and Gain, they knew not what to do to be ſaved. Alas, you are not ſenſible that there may be hundreds in Hell that you looked not after, curſing the day that ever you were born, that ever you were ſent into the World, that there ſhould be ſo many Wretches that lived only to damn men. If it be a Charge you deſire, why do you not attend unto that flock over which the holy Ghoſt made you overſeers? Why do you not in that calling wherein you are called abide with God? Is it poſſible for you to ſerve two Cures? you will hold to the one, and deſpiſe or neglect the other: and is it poſſible for you to be ſaved? Lord, what if you gained the World at the rate of undoing ſouls? Do you conſider that the bread you eat is the price of ſouls? How can you eat with comfort, and think Oh ſome of my charge may be now going to Eternity, and I prepared them not? How can you ſleep ſecurely, and think, Some of my charge may awake to morrow in another World, whether of Wo or Well I know not? How can you die peaceably and think, <hi>Where ſhall we meet the many ſouls that have gone before us out of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations?</hi> Oh where are ye, O immortal ſouls! with God, or for ever departed from the preſence of the Lord! Oh did you ever read that of St. <hi>Bernard, Qui non unus ſed plures in beneficiis, non unus ſed plures in ſuppli<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iis?</hi> If you pity not me once again by theſe courſes decaying, if you pity not poor ſouls by this means periſhing, Oh pity your ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have mercy upon your own fouls: Alas, that men ſhould be educated chargeably, ſhould ſtudy diligently, ſhould be ordained ſolemnly to delude ſouls, to mock God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deceive the world, and undoe men, for two, or three, or four hundred pounds yearly, during a ſhort life! that you ſhould appear in a Pulpit (if yet you do appear in a Pulpit) for a little Maintenance! that you ſhould appear very ſolemnly every Sunday, only to put a trick upon God and men! I hope bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of you, and things that accompany ſalvation, though thus I ſpeak. <q>In the Primitive times every <hi>Church</hi> of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59256:28"/>
ſouls as are of your Pariſhes, had many Miniſters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ableſt ſpeakers did moſt in publick, and the reſt did the more of the leſs publick work, (which ſome miſtake for ruling Elders) but now one of you takes the care of many Churches.</q> The Popiſh times, I mean years 632. could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide <hi>England</hi> into Pariſhes, for the better diſcharging of the cure of ſouls: our times unite thoſe Pariſhes again, for the better maintenance of pride and vanity. Is it for this that we are reformed? is it for this we are Proteſtants? then each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh had their Miniſters to pray with them ferventlie, to teach them faithfully to comfort them ſeaſonablie, to converſe with them uſefully. Ah! <hi>in quae nos reſervamur tempora!</hi> Now, now my people are neglected, my buildings are ruined, my hoſpitality is loſt, my authority is ſhrunk and faln, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> is thought to be nothing elſe but the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a few crafty Clergymen, ordering all things to their beſt advantage.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Envy</hi> may know, and <hi>Prejudice</hi> it ſelf may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I am a Church made up of godly and religious men: Princes, Nobles, Gentry, Biſhops, Miniſters and people main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing an Orthodox Doctrine, a Primitive Government, a pure and orderly Worſhip, a ſevere Diſcipline, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion in Word and Sacrament; who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid theſe extravagancies by wholſome Laws, checked them by ſevere Canons, and diſallowed them by fair and juſt means imaginable. In the darkeſt and moſt ſuperſtitious times, I ordered, <hi>That no Monks,</hi> i. e. <hi>idle perſons, ſhould take Livings of Biſhops, or appropriate the Revenues of them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but that the Prieſts ſerving thoſe Cures, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, might be provided with neceſſaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you know why Monks were pulled down in <hi>H.</hi> 8. time? Lay it to heart, I beſeech you, for many look for your fall too.</p>
               <p>1. They were accuſed for engroſſing Wealth and trade; and do you hear what the world ſaith of you? 2. They were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for impoveriſhing Pariſh-Prieſts, and decrying Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as miniſtring Matter of Schiſm and Diſputes, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying their own performances of Prayer and Devotion: by which and other Artifices, they undermined the poor Prieſts, and procured that many Churches preſentative, with their Glebes and Tyths, were appropriated to their Covents, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59256:28"/>
but a poor pittance for the <hi>Pariſh-Vicar.</hi> This was the occaſion of the firſt Impropriations, I pray God your careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not occaſion another.</p>
               <p>Oh remember <hi>Robert Whitgifts,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Wellow's</hi> ſpeech, who was wont to ſay, <hi>That they and their Religion could not long continue, becauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I have read the whole Scripture over and over, and never found that Monaſteries</hi> (and I may add pluralities) <hi>were founded by God: for</hi> (ſaid the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Abbot) <hi>every planting which my heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you remember that Lay-parliament in King <hi>H.</hi> 8. his time? wherein the Nobles and Commons aſſembled ſignified to the King, that the Temporal profeſſion of Abbots, Priors, &amp;c. vainly ſpent, would ſuffice to find 150 Earls, 1500 Knights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6200 Eſquires, 100 Hoſpitals? do you remember thoſe Mock-Parliaments that often conſidered how many 1000 men your Tythes (ill beſtowed upon you, as they thought) would maintain?

Therefore we would have come unto you, I <hi>Paul,</hi> at leaſt once or twice, but Satan hindred us.</hi> Such a zeal and care had he over the people of God. Oh in what caſe then are they that are careleſs, and have no regard of the people of God! which hunt after Livings, and bend not themſelves to do good! which ſerve their own belly, and ſeek to be rich, and eat up the people of God as if they were bread! they cannot ſay they have a deſire to ſee the face of their flock, and that their heart is with them: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they find time for other matters; they can never take time to know their ſheep, and they do the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry among them: they care not for them, they think not of them; they plant not, they water not, they watch not, they give no warning of the dangers at hand: they teach them not to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world. It were happy if all ſuch were removed out of the Church of God: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſouls and lead them to deſtruction by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.

We have indeed ſome Prophets, ſome Apoſtles, ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, ſome Doctors: but no Curates. Your Commiſſion (O my Sons) is, <hi>Go ye, and teach all Nations;</hi> not <hi>Go ye,</hi> or ſend <hi>your Curates</hi> to teach all Nations. Hath your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant liberty to bring whom he will to your ſervice, while he takes his pleaſure; and have you liberty to bring whom you will to Gods ſervice, while you take your pleaſure? Oh Sirs, the Scriptures run thus: <hi>Son of Man, I have made thee a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the houſe of Iſrael: therefore hear the word of my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way to ſave his life: the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniqnity, but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul. Again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, and I lay a ſtumbling block before him, he ſhall die: becauſe thou haſt not given him warning, he ſhall die in his ſin, and his righteouſneſs which he hath done ſhall not be remembred, but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheleſs, If thou warn the righteous that the righteous ſin not, and he doth not ſin; he ſhall ſurely live becauſe he is warned; alſo thou haſt delivered thy ſoul. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom: Preach the Word be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon; reprove, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure ſound doctrine, but after their own luſts ſhall they heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears. And they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned into fables: But watch thou in all things endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do the work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi> If you would be ſaved only by Curates, then ſerve God by Curates: if you may be damned only by Curates, then truſt your charge to Curates. But how do you read? <hi>Son of man propheſie againſt the ſhepherds of Iſrael, propheſie and ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God unto the ſhepherds, Wo be to the ſhepherds of Iſrael, that do feed themſelves: ſhould not the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59256:32"/>
wool ye kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock. The diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have ye not ſtrengthned, neither have ye healed that which was ſick neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt: but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. And they were ſcattered, becauſe there is no ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: and they became meat to all the beaſts of the field, when they were ſcattered. My ſheep wandred through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was ſcattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did ſearch or ſeek after them. Therefore ye ſhepherds hear the word of the Lord: As I live ſaith the Lord God, ſurely becauſe my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beaſt of the field, becauſe there was no ſhepherd, neither did my ſhepherd ſearch for my flock, but the ſhepherds fed themſelves, and feed not my flock: Therefore, O ye ſhepherds, hear the word of the Lord, Thus ſaith the Lord God, behold, I am againſt the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding the flock, neither ſhall the ſhepherds feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any more, for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.</hi>

               <p>2. Are Curates Miniſters, or are they not? if not, why do you employ them? if they are, why do they not live upon that maintenance that God hath allowed Miniſters? You could not endure rationally in theſe late times to hear of Stipends yet now your Brethren muſt be content with Allowances: and beſides, if they are Miniſters, then either they have cure of ſouls, or not: if they have cure of ſouls, why do they not attend their own charge if they have no cure of ſouls, how can they exerciſe any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial act, ſeeing they have none to exerciſe it upon? no people being obliged to attend any but their own Miniſter: yea, all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being obliged to attend only their own Miniſter.

O Sirs, if you neglect your Calling when you have maintenance, what will you do if you had none? Oh you that condemne Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, do you live by it? You that ſay a man ſhould not rob the Church, do you rob it? You that preach and write againſt taking away Miniſters maintenance, do you take away Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters maintenance?

And you who now cannot content your ſelves with handſome and honeſt competencies, were like to be brought to a morſel of Bread.
