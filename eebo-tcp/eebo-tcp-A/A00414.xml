         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If any aduersaries doe say,
that much I haue ommitted,

answere, the thing is more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

I neither am, neither neede to

hath nature taught the Bee out
of all flowers to chuse those as

grace mooue Christians to

               <p>The reedes when they beginne to

is it to make greate accompt of the

It is vanity to hunt after the winde

               <p>The men of riches haue slept their

of the world as seruants, referring the

So the men of this world while they

they are forgetfull of the Celestial

they to loath their former state and
greatly to desire the happinesse of

Let the loue therefore of the worlde

               <p>It is the lawe of vnfained loue,

them: but man being created, he was
neither said to be good nor ill, not
thereby preferring other creatures
aboue man, for whose sake they
were all created. Why then said God
of all other creatures how they were
good, and said not so of man, who
was better then they? The reason is
because God he looked that man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

and as he made his choise, so should
his titles be, good or euil. When hee

in the sight of men, but to God
onely, which regardeth not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
partes, but the heart within<note n="c" place="margin">Ie. 11. 20,</note>.</p>
               <p>The wisdome of God is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

The iudgemetes of God differ
much from the iudgements of men.
For the worlde looking vnto those
thing; which appeare to the outward
senses, taketh him for happie which
is of power, and rich. When Samuel
went to annoint one of the sonnes
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him whome the father made great
account of, he annointed Dauid,
which no man would haue thought.
So, whome the worlde accounteth
wise men, GOD numbreth among
fooles. He whome the world reiected
as an abiect, was elected afore all to
be a king.</p>
               <p>He which hath a matter to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before a iudge of learning, and
integritie, taketh it not too heauily,
though afore hee be condemned by
an vnskilfull Iudge, inasmuch as hee
reposeth confidence in the sentence
of that Iudge which is well seene in
the lawes. The men of this worlde,
like partiall and vnskilfull Iudges,
they iudged the pouertie of Th'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and the beggerly condition
of the Martyrs but very foolishnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
bnt the iudgement of God touching
this matter is quite contrarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:14907:79"/>
When it was said to S. Paul, that

he answered that he was not mad, but
spake the wordes of truth and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Hereby we may see that it is
no newe thing for the worlde blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to iudge that which it knoweth
not neither vnderstandeth, meere
foolishnesse. But death will one day
come when the seruantes of Christ
will appeale vnto God the chiefe and

will consider the cause, and
then will hee condemne the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

our iniquities before thee, &amp; our secret
sinnes in the light of thy countenance.
For alour dais are past in thine anger,
wee haue spent our yeeres as a thought.

which so much labour sustaineth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by a little blaste of sicknesse or

               <p>This is not the heauenly, but the
terrestriall life; the place where wee
liue, it is not our natiue Country,

Surely this world is not our owne

herein, as, in al other thinges the Lord

eies, what wicked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

they proue, if they knew of a certaine
that their daies were many.</p>
               <p>The vncertainety of the houre of
death, it bridleth many from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sinne. who if they knew that
they should liue many yeares, would
wrap and defile themselues with
most lothsome wickednesse. Againe,
though the vncertainty of death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame
not all men from their sinnes:
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14907:142"/>
yet maketh it many not to continue
still, and perseuere in vngodlynesse.</p>
               <p>If a man might knowe assuredly
the houre of his death, yet is it plaine
that hee could not know it, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one of these two conditions, to
wit, either that hee should dye sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
or else haue some certaine
time after appointed and praefixed
him to die in. Now if hee knew that
his death were sudden, and so defer
his repentance vntill then, it were a
daungerous thing. For hardly can hee
truely repent, which repenteth sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.
Againe, if hee knew his time
of life to bee long, then it may bee
thought he would take more liberty
to sinne, putting-off the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his wicked life vnto the last day.
Both which are very daungerous and
inconuenient for the saluation of
man.</p>
               <p>Therefore to deliuer thee from
both these daungers, the all wise God
hath so ordained that the houre of
death should bee alwaies kept from
thy knowledg, that suspecting
death alwaies to bee nigh at hande,
thou wouldest alwaies liue in the
feare of God; and bee thankefull to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14907:142"/>
his Maiesty for this so singuler bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of concealing the houre of death,
whereby as with a spurte he pricketh
thee on to follow &amp; practise the works
of godlinesse,</p>
               <p>Besides, God would not haue thee to
know the houre of death, because thou
shouldest learne to liue for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of others, and not to thy selfe, For
a publique benefite is alwaies to bee
prefered afore a priuate.</p>
               <p>Diddest thou knowe that quickly
thou shouldest die many good workes
thou wouldest leaue vndone, which
might bee profitable to the common-weale;
and thy study would bee of
thine owne saluation, neglecting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the more grace of God, the profite
of thy neighbour.</p>
               <p>Aud what more? If many did knowe
beeing sicke that their sicknesse were
not vnto death, surely neither would
they hartely turne vnto the Lord
by repentance, nor doe those workes
which Christians are to doe. But now
many lying greeuously in paine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their bed, they turne vnto the
Lord God knowing themselues neere
vnto death, which questionlesse they
woulde not doe, if they knewe they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14907:143"/>
should liue still, and not die.</p>
               <p>Last of all, euen for the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christian peace and concorde
among men, God would not haue
vs aforehande to knowe the time of
our departure out of this world. For
did wee know that yet many yeeres
wee should continue heare, there
would follow, or bee nourished stil
in vs, hatred, desire of reuenge, and
such like sinnes; againe, did we know
that very speedely wee should die, we
should be euermore sad, and full of
melancholy passions, and so be vncom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fortable
to our selues, and to all such
as are about vs. All which doe violate
the common peace, and fellowshippe
of man.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore by this vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of our life, God hath prouided
so well for the benefite both of our
selues, and of others, there is great
cause why for the same, wee
should thanke him, loue

               <p>The sinne of the flesh, is a fire of
hell; and the maintainer thereof is
riotousnesse, and gluttonie. The
flame thereof, is filthinesse; the ashes,
vncleannesse; the smoake, infamie;
the ende, vexation of the minde,
destruction of the bodie, shipwrack of
a good conscience, and an horrible
contempt of the holy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God.</p>
               <p>Many of them bee vtterly cast
away through the wrath of GOD,
which giue themselues to this vice.
If thou wouldest ouercome, thou
must flye from this sinne, according
to the commandement of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
from God himselfe<note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 18.</note>. This vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
is gotten by flying, and not by
violence.</p>

               <p>A wonder it is that euer thou canst
auoide this persecution of the flesh,
faring deliciously, and liuing in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The water of teares quencheth the
flame of concupiscence: and vnlesse
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14907:157"/>
thou auoid occasions hereunto, it is
almost impossible but at one time or
other thou wilt yeeld vnto his sinne.</p>
               <p>Few there be but either in youth,
or in age do humble themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this idole, and giue themselues
to the flesh. Many there bee which
commende the unspotted life, but few
retaine the chastitie of the body,
much lesse of the mind: they would
seeme honest, and praise honesty,
but yet they auoide not, as they
ought, the occasions which cause
them either to bee, or to be thought
dishonest. Their meaning is good,
but their knowledge is but smal, and
not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Happy is that soule which in a

The reason is, Nothing in this worlde

               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:14907:172"/>
Nothing so soone will make thee to
despise the vanitie of earthly things,
as the loue of God: but because thine
heart was neuer touched throughly
with the fire of his loue, thereof it
groweth that thou art so in loue with
the corruptible goods of this wretched
world.</p>
               <p>Hence is it that thou art so troubled
with cares and griefe of minde; and
hence thou settest not thine hart vpon
the loue of God.</p>
               <p>O that thou hadst but some small
taste of Gods spirit to begin withall?</p>
               <p>It is the nature and propertie of loue
to make his account of that which it
loueth. That is well verified here in
this worldly loue, where we see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times that for the attaining of that
which they loue, they make no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
either of goods, honor, or name:
they forget themselues through mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vpon the thing beloued. After
their example therefore, thou which
sayest thou louest God, giue thy selfe
wholy to loue him, and casting aside
all other matters of the world, occupy
thy selfe wholy and altogether in his
seruice.</p>
               <p>So did the holy Fathers in times
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14907:173"/>
passed showe themselues, they were
transformed into a heauenly nature,
they thought not of themselues, nor
of the world: for which cause they
were iudged of the world to be very

               <p>Let it be thy chiefest exercise that
God and thy soule may agree well
together, as though there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
besides vnder heauen to bee
done, and as though thy selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

mightest truely say, as the Apostle

               </p>
               <p>Be not so taken with the thinges of
this worlde, as to make them the end
of thy loue; since all that thou canst
loue in this world is more perfectly
a great deale in God, than in the
world.</p>
               <p>If thou loue any thing because it
is beautifull, why louest thou not
God, the fountaine of all beautie? If
goodnesse bee the thing wherevpon
thine heart is fixed, what is better
than God? <hi>None is good, saue one, euen
God</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Lu. 18. 19</note>.</p>
               <p>God is purely good in his essence,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14907:173"/>
and substance. The goodnesse of a
creature is so farre good, as it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
some little drop from that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
sea, I meane, from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
goodnesse of God the
creator thereof.</p>
               <p>If thou dost so much loue any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for some showe of goodnesse
that thou perceiuest therein, although
it haue besides many imperfections
why louest thou not God, who is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
good of himselfe, and the
perfection of all goodnesse?</p>
               <p>The lesse materiall substance there
is in a bodie, the lighter it is, and so
much the more apt to ascende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde:
so againe, the more thou art
loden with the loue of earthly things,
the more hardly shalt thou ascend in
heart vnto God.</p>
               <p>The fewer thine inordinate passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

if thou loue God perfectly, thou wilt
make none account of earthly things.</p>

                  <hi>The Apostle saith</hi>

                  </note>, God is faithful,
which wil not suffer you to be tempted
aboue that you be able, but wil euen giue
the issue with the tentation, that ye may
be able to beare it.</p>
               <p>It is the manner of those which bee
iudges in combates, to measure the

in the listes. This doeth
God, the most righteous iudge, for
he suffereth none of vs to bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>When two in all thinges equall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

preuaile which hath another to assist
him.</p>
               <p>If thou cheerish thy bodie with
ease', drinke, good fare, and sleepe,
thy bodie it will ouercome, and thy

soule of the body shall bee subdued;
but if thou assist thy soule with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>It is better that the soule should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
that soule and body may be

               <p>If thou loue the flesh, make it obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

of wisedome<note n="c" place="margin">Prou. 1. 7.</note>, thou art
first to begin at the knowledge of thy

               <p>If thou haue a desire to know who
thou art, take a glasse, and beholde
thy selfe in it. The glasse that a man
may best beholde himselfe in, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man. Nowe if another man
which thou beholdest, is but earth,
ashes, and a very worme, surely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
such art thou, how rich soeuer
and of great estimation thou seemest
to be in the world:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:14907:188"/>
And that thou maiest not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
beholde not thy selfe in a
glasse that is hollow, which maketh
a shewe of the thing represented
therein, cleane contrary to that
which it is indeede, but take vnto
thee a glasse that is plaine, which set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out a man according as hee is in
truth. If thou beholde thy selfe in the
inside of a siluer spoone that is
bright and cleare, thou shalt see thy
face with the wrong end turned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
thy bearde aboue, and thy
fore-head beneath.</p>
               <p>So in man there be two glasses, and
states, one is of life, the other of death.
Life is the hollow glasse, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vs to seeme otherwise than wee
be. It sheweth thee forth to bee
sound, lustie, strong, and long-liued,
all which is vanitie, and lies. If thou

doe not trust therein, for it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

               <p>This false life of ours it seemeth
some great thing vnto men, when it
is nothing so. But the state of death,
or of a dead man is the plaine and
true glasse, which doeth manifest
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:14907:189"/>
thinges euen as they bee without
fraude and deceite. Therefore if thou
wouldest see what thou art in deede,
then looke not vpon thy selfe aliue,
but vpon another man that is dead.
So thou shalt perceiue that thou art
earth, ashes, a very sinke of all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
a little set out and beautified on
the out side by a liuely hewe that
life hath lent thee, there thou shalt
see the foundation of your stocke, and
the largenesse of thy dominion. That
which thou now art, thine ancestors
were, and as they are, such shalt thou
bee.</p>
               <p>If thou looke well into thy selfe,
thou shalt finde greate matter why
to contemne thy selfe. For what art
thou, as touching the bodie, but a

borrow helpe from those base crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Whereby hee may learne to

               <p>Man hath no peace in this worlde,

               <p>For to kindle the fire of

meditation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
are necessarie: betweene

to those, which with difficultie and
paine doe thinke vpon heauenly
matters: and contemplation to
them which bee exercised in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Spirit. But neither in the
one, nor in the other consisteth our
perfection, but in the loue of God
onely.</p>
               <p>Contemplation is the worke of
the vnderstanding, and the way or
meane vnto perfection: But perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is in lifting vp the will vnto God,
through that heauenly vnion, and
soueraigne loue which is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:14907:195"/>
There is small pleasure in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating,
but in louing there is a great
ioy. The vnderstanding doth not
giue sustenance vnto our soules, but
onely prepareth the meate that our
soule is fed withall. There is no ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
taste in preparing that which
must bee eaten, but in eating that
which is prepared.</p>
               <p>And for so much as the obiect of
our will, or that thing which our will
tendeth vnto, is either good, or see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be good, so that nothing can
be loued, but that which is good, or
else taken for good, vnder the coulor
of some thing that is good; &amp; the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
conceaueth a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
depth of goodnesse in the Lord,
very colde should the will be, if, like
another Phenix, it consumed not it
selfe euen with the fire of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
loue, beholding by contemplation
the glorious beames of the Sunne of
righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Shake thy winges like the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,
and lift vp thine heart in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and surely thou shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
thy selfe to bee conuerted into
dust and ashes as it were, while thou
confessest thy loathsome basenesse
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:14907:195"/>
before the infinite aud incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
goodnesse of the Lord.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt enioy the sweetnesse
of godly prayer, &amp; be refeshed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by heauenly contemplation, thou
must lift vp the force of thy will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God.</p>
               <p>Some are exercised onely in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
part, and not in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
part of the will, whose ende is
not to bee enflamed with the loue of
God, but onely to attaine some curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
speculation in hie matters; hence
are they still musing how our Sauiour
Christ was borne, how he liued, how
he suffered, and rose againe from the
dead. But these bee farre from true
contemplation in deede, if they fixe
their felicitie in the knowledge, and
pure speculation of such misteries
of God: for they are to ascende vnto
the firie sea of Gods loue to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
to whom by a reciprocall loue
of their owne; they should be vnited
and incorporate, so as all the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of thine owne mortification
may be made perfect &amp; pure through
him and his loue.</p>
               <p>If thou hast gotten any knowledge
of God, thou must not staie there,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:14907:196"/>
but thou art withall to proceede vnto
the loue of God.</p>
               <p>They which truely thinke of these
things, they may well bee called and
counted the friendes of God: such
were the blessed Apostles vnto whom
the Lord saith<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn. 15. 15.</note>: <hi>Hence foorth, call I
you not seruants, for the seruant
knoweth not what his master, doth; but
I haue called you friendes: for all things

I made known vnto you.</hi> But they which
neither thinke hereof, nor giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto the workes of pietie, may
well bee called not the seruantes of
God, but the bondslaues of Satan.</p>
               <p>True contemplation is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of glorie. Through it a man
commeth to the knowledge both of
God, and himselfe; and that beeing
attained, hee falleth out of loue with
this world, and thereby God blesseth
him with newe strength to serue him
withall.</p>

               <p>It is dangerous riding of a colt

For it is great quietnesse to liue with

Spirite.</p>
               <p>Onely the men of high authority
in the world, they may lament and
mourne that they want this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
But worldlings they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
not yet the sweetenesse of
holy obedience. Hence it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which would seeme religious,
hauing not thoroughly perceaued
howe pleasant a thing it is to obey
for Christs sake, they both couet
prelacy, and shunne the quietnesse
of the Spirite; and while they thinke
to finde ease, they fall into troubles,
and are tyred continually with cares
and molestations. Onely therefore
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:14907:226"/>
the good soules which bee religiously

the Spirite, and liue with ioy and
comfort.</p>
               <p>Many of their owne free will doe
chuse out places of comfort for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
where beeing once come, they
finde themselues voide of all ioy and
comfort. But the Godly doe euen
there finde most consolation, where
they thinke to haue no comfort at
all. To bee short, look not to finde
any true comfort but in God, which
dwelleth in the heart of the obedient
person.</p>
               <p>If thou bee truely obedient, thou
shalt finde comfort wheresoeuer thou
shalt dwell, because God is with thee;
but if thou bee led by thine owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
what place or land soeuer thou
chusest to dwell in, euen there shalt
thou finde an hell, where thou thinkst
to haue paradise. For thether shalt
thou carry thine own will which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
bloudy battell vnto thy soule in all
places; thether shalt thou carry thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which night and day wil vexe
and trouble thee.</p>
               <p>But submitting thy selfe vnto the
authority of others, as thou shouldest,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:14907:226"/>
thou shalt make thy selfe a Lord and
