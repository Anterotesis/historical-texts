            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is to be wondred at, what wondrous paines they take to doe wickedly; how their unholy and crooked imaginations have pumped into their impious fancies the falſe conceptions of ſome vertuous matter; then are they in extreame paine and travell till they are delivered from the abortive Iſſue of their addle Brains: for which (although they have no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from God, nor thanks from good men (but rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from all) yet out their ſtinking ſtuffe muſt, or the muſty Verſe muſt breake or crack all the hoopes, or the Divell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may want his due if authority be not reviled againſt, and a long ſciſmaticall Oration hyppocratically ſtretcht out to the Rabble of their diſobedient and unlick'd Auditors, who out of their deepe ignorance, doe extoll the vapourous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a wine-drawne ſpeech and lowting courteſie, bleſſe them for that dayes exerciſe, in inveighing ſo vehemently and bitterly againſt all Rule and Government, in Church and State; when indeed his admired mouth better deſerved the help of Doctor Executioner, that hee might wipe it with a hempen wiſpe.</p>
            <p>Their Tongues have been the Wedges their Heads the Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and their Pens the Axes that have ſplit, rent and cloven all our bleſſed peace, content and happineſſe which we lately inioyed: their Books have beene ſhot (like Bolts) whereby this Kingdomes diſgrace is not only overſpread over it ſelfe; but alſo our diſhonour is ſcattered over the face of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome; and though they be ſo ignorant that they cannot diſpute with a Sexton; yet they will take upon them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place Biſhops and learned Divines, and place in their roomes Weavers and Wyer-drawers.</p>
            <p>But the wiſedomes of theſe Martiniſts, will anſwer, that Biſhops have beene erronious, negligent proud, contentious, covetous, uncharitable, ambitious, &amp;c. all which is granted,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125616:3"/>
but it is not granted that all Biſhops have been ſo (nor at leaſt) ſo bad as theſe fellowes would make them) as men are men, ſo men are ſubiect to error and failings: if ſome great men in high and eminent places have done amiſſe, doth it ſtand with your witleſſe reaſons quite to overthrow and caſt downe their high Callings, Functions and neceſſary Offices: ſome Iudges perhaps have done corruptly; <hi>ergo,</hi> wee will have no more Iudges: you may better argue, that many Separatiſts are malicious or ignorant Knaves, and therefore wee would have no more Separatiſts. This were to be as wiſe, as he that pul'd downe his houſe, becauſe there was one old rotten poſt in it, or that all your Tribe ſhould have no eaſier cure for the Tooth-ach, but by knocking out your braines: No, no, my friends (a farre off) there is no doubt but if the State were ſettled, (which by your Sectaries have too much diſturb'd) there are (under God) Parliamentall Chyrurgions and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians that with his Royall Maieſties moſt humble, hearty, loyall and all deſired aſſiſtance and protection, would ſoone recover this almoſt gangrean'd Church and Common-weale to its former health, and moſt renowned reputation and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>I would wiſh theſe ſhuttle-heads that deſire to rake in the embers of Rebellion, to give over blowing the Coales too much, leſt the ſparkes flee in their faces, or the aſhes choake them: ſome of them have made ſuch hot worke already with tutoring their Tutors; that their owne lips are burnt: It is well known that their magnified Teachers have three ſeverall times in the preſence of God taken their Oaths, wherein they have vowed all Canonicall obedience, and they ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſaid oathes, till ſuch time as the wiſedome of that power and authority which ordained theſe oathes doe alter or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

ſeemed conſtantly to ſweare obedience to thoſe venerable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of the Church; yet it is found that their humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was but diſſembling intruſion; and now they are poſſeſt of their Pulpits, they take great care that no learned conformable Preacher ſhall come there at any time, for feare that if truth come once to light, then their Cake will bee dough, and they being once diſcovered to their Auditors (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially their good Dames) may happen to want their pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Bacon, with other good cheere, beſides ſome other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies at Conveticles,</p>
            <p>Thus, when theſe extraordinary qualified <hi>Theologues</hi> are mounted in their Thrones, a Popiſh Prieſt can hardly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe him in ſtrange poſtures, as in lifting up the pureneſſe of the whiteſt whiteneſſe of his eyes; then marke how hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes his armes as if he were ſwimming; alſo the terrible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and battery that the poore cuſhion endures, the haukings, hemmings, hummings, coughings, ſpittings (with other Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis while there is more matter a pumping) beſides the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thundring voyce againſt our Church-Lyturgie, although they doe know that they lye, and that that Booke was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by the learned <hi>Calvin</hi> and all the reverend Fathers of the bleſſed Reformation in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reigne. That five martyr'd Biſhops, (namely, Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Farrar,</hi> with many more godly men and glorious Martyrs, (whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts moſt cruelly burnt and perſecuted; yet they all at their very deaths did acknowledge our Church-Liturgie, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer Booke, and ſealed their faiths with their bloods, by the Papiſt Tyranny; and is it poſſible that any ſhould be ſo ſhameleſſe as to ſay that Booke is Popiſh now</p>
            <p>The ſaid Booke was ſuppreſt in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> Reigne becauſe it was not Popiſh: The ſaid Booke was not Popiſh in all the

happy Reigne of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> nor was it eſteemed either Popiſh or Romiſh in all the Reigne of King <hi>Iames:</hi> in both the times of theſe three mighty Princes (of ever-bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) and till within theſe three or foure yeares, there hath ſcarce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y beene heard of any learned or Religious minded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant that did ever hold that Booke to be ſtuft with <hi>Romiſh Raggs</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> although ſome things in it may be amended, and ſomethings quite omitted.</p>
            <p>But you have ſuch nice ſtomacks that nothing will downe with you except it be ſawc'd with diſobedience and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you being ſuch odd ſellowes whom Learning, Witt, ſence or Reaſon can by no meanes ſatisfie. Whips are for ſlaves and not ſwords, and it is fit that ſuch as wiſedome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie, ſhould have their mouths bung'd up with ieeres, will nothing agree with your appetites, or reliſh well in your pallates, but the bald-rib of a Biſhop, or the iole of a Iudge? truely I hold it better that ſome of you were taken away with <hi>Gregories</hi> Voyder; the Reaſon is, there are Caps with foure corners, and thoſe you diſtaſt; there are creatures to bee met in one corner, hold there; and there is a Tree neere <hi>Padding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> with three corners; but no more of that (I pray) though it is neceſſary that ſome of you ſhould eſcape no worſe.</p>
            <p>I am ſo cleare-ſighted that I can ſee through the very veines and ſinnewes of your Conſciences; for your Religions you may (many of you) caſt Croſſe and Pile, and for your iuſt dealing you may play at my Sow ha's Pigg'd. Therefore it is wholſome for the times that ſuch Cocks as you ſhould be let blood in the Combe.</p>
            <p>It is a marvell that moſt of your perverſe Sects have not wry mouthes, for very few of you do ſpeak right at any time; but out of the concupiſcence of your Conſciences, and the Learning you are indued withall in Crooked-Lane Lattin,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125616:5"/>
hath got you with child with <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and being with child you long to ſwallow <hi>Churches,</hi> and devoure <hi>Authority,</hi> but you will be told one time or other that there is ſome odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Libelling.</hi>

            <p>I know ſome that will doe their ill-good will to outlaw my Soule for writing this, and they wil ſerve an execution of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon me, but if I be aware of their comming I will meete them with ſuch a powder that ſhall make their bones to rattle in their Skins like 3. blew beanes in a blew bladder rattle bladder rattle.</p>
            <p>And for a concluſion, It is as lawfull, for honneſt men by either ſpeaking or writing to make the malicious Facts and Acts of Knaves knowne, as it is for Knaves to ſlaunder and abuſe honeſt men; and moſt certaine it is that the Leaders of theſe Factions doe know they are out of the way, and would be glad to returne againe (were it not for ſome worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) for which cauſes they muſt impudently goe on, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old Proverb, over-ſhooes, over Bootes.</p>
