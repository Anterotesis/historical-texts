            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>of, and by themſelues,</hi> to God, euen as by Earles and
Princes, they can make way to Kings. Is there any man ſo
mad, or forgetfull of his owne ſaluation, to attribute a
Kings honour to a Prince or an Earle? Why, we ſee, that
if any man ſhould dare but to ſpeak this of his own King,
of good right hee ought to bee condemned, as guilty of
treaſon. Shall not they then be held for much more faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as dare attribute the honour of Gods name, to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
And, in leauing our Lord ſhall honour ſuch as are
but ſeruantes with themſelues? Though men in Kings
Courts, are in more eminent place then others: yet in the
King of Kings Court, the greateſt &amp; meaneſt are all but
ſeruantes, and the pooreſt as ſoone heard as the proudeſt,
and ſooner too. For this cauſe, men gaine acceſſe to a
King, by meanes of Princes and Lords, becauſe the king
himſelfe is but a man, and knowes not otherwiſe how to
deale in matters faithfully, concerning his common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
But, to gaine the fauour of God, from whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be hidden; becauſe he knowes the hearts of all
men, their works, wants or whatſoeuer: There needs no
other fauourite, to preſent our ſupplication by, but only

And the ſtreetes beeing thicke ſet
with Torch-bearers at noone day, which neere
hand obſcured bright day light, by ſuch an infinite
number being lighted all the way: They marched
a long to <hi>S. Peters</hi> Church, in this manner. An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
graue matrone, named Lady <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> walked
on foremoſt. After her, with a ſober pace, and
demure countenance, followed <hi>Worldly Wiſedome,</hi>
bearing the Salte, Creame, and Spittle, to baptiſe
the Infant. Then came Madame <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her head ſomewhat downe, as hauing verie
ſpeciall care of the Childe: And ſhee carried the
water to fit the intended buſines. <hi>Subbornation</hi>
went next, bearing the Towell, which was all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
with precious ſtones, and round imbrodered
with the fires of Purgatorie, which was deſcribed
in very antique great carracters. Then vnder a
ſumptuous Cannopie, came <hi>Abuſe</hi> the Godfather,
who carried the Childe, being attended on by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi>
and <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> twoo hard-fauoured Ladyes,

Lord, ſo bigge, as his legs could ſcarſe ſupporte

what haſte he could after the reſt. Dame <hi>Auarice,</hi>
and Dame <hi>Symonie,</hi> being the appointed God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
followed cloſe after, in a very ſad and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

named <hi>Humaine Traditions;</hi> with whome
walked <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and they, with the
reſt of the quiere, ſung very ſolemnly. Now, to glad
the people the more, and in ſigne alſo of liberality,
the Iubilie, which had beene ſold before at a verie
deare rate; was proclaimed freely, and Bulles and
Pardons were now as cheape as ſtrawing hearbes.</p>
            <p>When they came to name the childe, ſtriuing to
haue it a name of immortall renowne; there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to growe a great difference among them,
and euery one ſtroue to pleaſe his owne appetite.
One would haue him to bee named <hi>Holy Mother;</hi>
An other thought it more fit to call him <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Hypocriſie</hi> would haue him to bee tearmed,
<hi>The ſupreme Biſhop:</hi> But the Gosſips named him,
<hi>The Seruant of Seruants. Idolatry</hi> ſaid it were better
to call him, <hi>God on earth.</hi> When the Preiſt, that was
to performe the ſolemnity, ſaw no likelyhoode of
any other agreement, but the contention ſtill to
grow on more and more: He concluded, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
his owne authority, and bethinking him on a
