         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Am far from being fond of their Practice, that affect to give pompous and promiſing Titles to their Books; in ſo much that my Friends have ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me with inclining too much to the oppoſite Extream. But yet I am not averſe from prefixing to the enſuing Paper, the Title of <hi>Medicina Hydroſtatica</hi>; not only for the Conveniency of Citations, (which are uſually troubleſome to make in Tracts that have long Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;) but becauſe too I am Invited, if not Authorized to do it, by the Example of the famous and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sanctorius</hi>; who ſcrupled not to prefix the Name of <hi>Medicina Statica,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98188:3"/>
to a Writing almoſt as Small, as 'tis Ingenious, which applys the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to <hi>Some</hi> Uſes relating to the Medicinal Art, perhaps <hi>not More,</hi> than will be here found propoſed of the ſame Inſtrument, improv'd by ſome Additions. And 'tis ſcarce to be doubted, but that in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Age, the Sagacity of the Curious will make, both of what he has diſcovered, and of what I have delivered, uſeful Applications, that neither He, nor I, ever thought of.</p>
            <p>If the chief thing, I aimed at in Writing, had been to gain Applauſe, I would have taken a more likely way to obtain it, than by treating of a Subject, wherein few will think themſelves concerned, (tho' many in reallity be ſo, and whoſe Importance does not at firſt view appear.) And this Subject too, the Nature of it has obliged me, to treat of in ſuch a way, that it will be almoſt as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant to the Reader to peruſe ſo unadorned a piece, as it was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to the Author to write ſo
<pb facs="tcp:98188:3"/>
Toileſome an One. And indeed when I came to take notice of the Number of Particulars, that I had brought together into this little Book; I did my ſelf ſomewhat won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how I came to be prevailed with to lay out ſo much Pains upon ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inviting a Subject. But Knowledge and Health are two ſuch valuable things, that I durſt not refuſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, even a toileſome Task; whilſt I was encouraged by the Hope, that was given me, that this kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may conduce ſomewhat to thoſe deſirable Ends; if not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, yet at leaſt by exciting the more curious among Phyſicians, Chymiſts, and Others, to inlarge their Inquiries, and by helping them to remark divers things relating to Medicinal Bodies, that they are wont to overlook.</p>
            <p>I had probably better conſulted my Reputation, as well as my Eaſe, if, having contented my ſelf with thoſe few uncommon Notions, and Obſervations, that the reſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:98188:4"/>
Book was built upon; I had left the Applications made of them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bodies, to the induſtry of Others. I ſhall not ſolicitouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelf, for not having beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more Ornaments upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Eſſay; ſince the Nature of the Subject and Drift of the Writer, are ſufficient to juſtifie the Plainneſs of my Style to the Judicious. I may have ſomewhat more cauſe to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for this; That I have not caſt a Treatiſe about a Subject wherein Mechanicks are ſo much imployed, into the Form of Propoſitions; and given it a more Mathematical Dreſs. But I was unwilling by that means to diſcourage thoſe many, who, when they meet with a Book, or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein the Titles of <hi>Theoreme, Probleme,</hi> and other Terms of Art, are conſpicuouſly placed, uſe to be frighted at them; and thinking them to be written only for Mathematical Readers, deſpair of underſtanding it, and therefore lay it aſide, as not meant for the uſe of ſuch, as they.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98188:4"/>But there is another thing, upon whoſe ſcore, I confeſs, I ought to wiſh for indulgent Readers. For the Papers compiled into this Eſſay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been written in looſe Sheets, and at ſuch diſtant times, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Accidents interven'd between them; the loſs of ſome of thoſe Papers, as well as others of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Natures, and my want of Health, and Leiſure, obliged me to change more than Once my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſign, and to imploy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Style of a private Letter, and ſometimes again, that of a Diſcourſe intended for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; By which, means ſome Things, and ſome Expreſſions, that were ſuitable to the Deſign I had, when I committed them to Paper, became incongruous, when the Scope and Scheme of my Diſcourſe were altered, eſpecially Some parts of the Copy being out of my hands, when I ſhould have adjuſted the Others to them. But tho' theſe Irregularities may keep the parts of this Eſſay,
<pb facs="tcp:98188:5"/>
from being ſo coherent as they ſhould be; yet they will not prove very prejudicial to an intelligent Reader; who, finding the Matters of Fact, and the Notions, to be true, may, notwithſtanding the want of an uniform Contexture, make good uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Tho' divers little <hi>Memoirs</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, that occured to me from time to time, whilſt I was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the following Papers, have inſenſibly ſwelled them into a Book; yet the Eſſay it ſelf was in my Firſt intention, but a large Fragment of a greater work: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an Account is given in the Letter to a Friend, (that is premis'd to a Paper annexed to the following Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,) which (Letter) having been intended for a kind of Preface to the laſt Scheme of the whole larger work; if the Reader pleaſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it, he will there find the Riſe, and Scope of this little Tract, as well as of the other parts of that deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book; and ſome other things,
<pb facs="tcp:98188:5"/>
that may make it needleſs to lengthen this Preamble by any thing more than two Advertiſements. Of theſe, <hi>One</hi> is, that, being reduced by divers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and unwelcome Accidents to forego my firſt deſign, and give on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two or three <hi>Specimens</hi> of what was intended, and more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; I made choice of the Title of the Chymical Changes of Bodies by Coloration, as a Sample of the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of the Treatiſe; and I pitcht upon the Subject of this preſent Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Mechanical part of the ſame Treatiſe; The <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Advertiſement, is, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der need not be ſtartled, to find ſome little Variations of Specifick Gravity, among ſome of the <hi>Memoirs</hi> laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this Eſſay, becauſe he will in due place be told,<note place="margin">See the Chapters.</note> why ſuch things ought to be expected. And in the mean time, it may, I hope, ſuffice to ſay, that ſuch Variations are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new, nor eaſily avoidable things, in making <hi>Hydroſtatical</hi> Experiments or others of Affinity to them. For
<pb facs="tcp:98188:6"/>
Proof of which, to Readers, that, for want of having made Tryals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may diſtruſt what we have ſaid, I ſhall produce a Couple of notable Teſtimonies. The firſt is given by ſo induſtrious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent a Mathematician, as <hi>Merſennus</hi> himſelf. For he candidly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, when he has occaſion to mention ſome Tryals of the learned <hi>Ghetaldus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Varietas ponderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, quae ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius in quibuſdam Granis contingit, ſimilis eſt Varietati Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micarum Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum quae ſemper fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ré quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutis, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Primis, ſive Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus in Phoenomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Hydrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis.</hi>
               </note> and of the accurate French Engineer <hi>Monſieur Petit,</hi> &amp; of his own; that the Variety of weighing, which often happens to amount to ſome Grains, is but like the Variety of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomical Obſervations; which do almoſt always differ in ſome Minutes or ſome Seconds. To which he ſoon after adds an Intimation, that ſhews, that he expected not an exact uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity between the Obſervations of <hi>Ghetaldus,</hi> &amp;c. already made, and the Tryals of an Experimenter, that would examine them by making the like again.</p>
            <p>To this firſt Teſtimony we ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Second, which is, that our
<pb facs="tcp:98188:6"/>
famous Experimenter, the Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam</hi> himſelf, writing of a Subject, that in ſeveral things has much Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with ours, confeſſes, that 'tis not to be doubted, but that many of the Bodies, which he has ſet down in his Table of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,<note place="margin">Hiſt. denſit &amp; Rarit. <hi>P. M. 12.</hi> Editionis Londinen. in Octavo.</note> and Weights differ in the ſame <hi>Species</hi> or Denomination; ſome being heavier than others, and that therefore there is ſome Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency in this Affair, ſo that 'tis not neceſſary, that the Individuals he made his Tryals with ſhould be exact Standards of the Nature of their reſpective <hi>Species,</hi> or ſhould, (which makes directly to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) agree altogether to a Title with Experiments of other Men.</p>
            <p>But this ſcarce evitable Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Hydroſtatical</hi> and the like Experiments does not hinder, but that by their help we may make good Eſtimates of the Weights, and Bulks, of very many Bodies; and among them of not a few that belong to two ſorts of the three, that our Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious

And theſe Eſtimates will (if I miſtake not) be found, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to thoſe that can be made of the ſame Bodies by Geometrical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; but (which is more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for the Reader) accurate enough to be very uſeful on a great Number and Variety of Occaſions. Which laſt Clauſe, I purpoſely add to inſinuate, that the Hydroſtatical Way of Menſuration may be uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply'd to ſeveral Bodies and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that do not at all ſeem to relate to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> as would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by inſerting here what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>about Metrical,</hi> and <hi>about Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratory Experiments and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in other Papers; if that were not too foreign to the enſuing Eſſay, as not belonging to the Subject, or to the Deſign of it.</p>

                  <p>I have, in a former Tract, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd (and, as I am told in Print, and otherwiſe, not altogether unſucceſsfully) to make it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that divers, if not moſt, of the real Virtues (for many fabulous Ones have been aſcrib'd to them) of Gems or precious Stones, may in great part proceed from the Qualities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline and Mineral Subſtances, That, whilſt the Matter was either fluid or ſoft, were (more or leſs plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) incorporated with the ſtony Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98188:13"/>
which hardned afterwards into a Gem. The ſame <hi>Phoenomena</hi> and Reflections, that led me to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion newly recited, induced me to think it alſo very probable, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Boles, Clayes, and other Earths, and, much more, that ſeveral Minerals; which, tho' not looked upon as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Oars, and ſeveral Stones or ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subſtances, that, by reaſon of their Bigneſs or Opacity, or perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant Colours, have been judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be numbred among Gems or precious Stones, may yet be indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conſiderable Medical Virtues; &amp; perhaps with greater than the finer Gems themſelves, becauſe in theſe deſpiſed Stones and Minerals, there is often found a greater ſtore of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick and Mineral parts, which while they were in <hi>ſolutis Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piis,</hi> as Chymiſts ſpeak, might with eaſe plentifully inſinuate themſelves into theſe more open Bodies, where being ſetled they were not lockt up ſo faſt and ſtrongly, as in the noble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Saphirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are of ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and as 'twere Glaſs-like, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that divers Corroſive Liquors, and <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it ſelf, are unable to penetrate and diſſolve them; tho', as hereafter will appear, theſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Medical Stones, and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, may be opened by the like <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon theſe Grounds, I thought it might be a thing of uſe to Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as well as to divers Mineraliſts and Mine-workers; if I imparted to them a Way of Exploring many Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, that I do not remember I had met with, either among Phyſicians or Chymiſts: And tho' this Way of Exploration pretends not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver directly more than one Quality of the Body examined by it; yet that Quality, being its ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, is ſo radical and conſiderable a one, that it may lead a Sagacious Enquirer further than at firſt ſight one would think.</p>
                  <p>I conſidered then, that the moſt pure and homogeneous kind of Stones
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98188:14"/>
we know of, and that ſeems the freeſt from all adventitious Mixtures, and even <note n="*" place="margin">Tinctures</note> TR's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is Rock-Chryſtal: And therefore I pitched upon This, as the Standard I would imploy, to make Eſtimates of the greater or leſſer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from Simplicity or Homogeneity of the Stones, or other Stone-like Subſtances, whoſe ſpecifick Gravity I ſhould examine.</p>
                  <p>We took then ſome Pieces of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chryſtal, clear and colourleſs, and having carefully weighed them firſt in the Air, and then in Water, we found, by Computation, that pure Chryſtal was to clear Water of the ſame Bulk, as Two and an half, or thereabouts, are to One: So that, to clear the Matter by an Inſtance, if we ſuppoſe an hollow Cube, of Braſs or other Metal, to be filled as carefully as may be, (for the upper Surface will ſcarce be exactly Level) with ℥j. of Water, and if afterwards the Cavity of the empty'd Veſſel be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly filled with a Cubical piece of Rock Chryſtal; this Stone will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98188:14"/>
weigh ℥ij and about an half. Some of my Tryals indeed, made with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ballances, repreſented the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of theſe two Bodies, with ſome petty Variation. But beſides, that 'tis not improbable, that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pieces of Rock Chryſtal it ſelf, tho' of equal Bulk, may not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely equal in Ponderoſity; beſides this, I ſay, the Variation I found from the newly aſſigned Proportion was ſo ſmall, that having juſt intimated, that for the moſt part it rather ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a little the ſpecifick Gravity of the Chryſtal, than fell ſhort of it; we may neglect it without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, worth taking notice of, to the Uſe that is to be made of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in this Paper. And for as much as there may be ſome Scruple, tho' groundleſs, made about the Origin and Nature of Chryſtal: I ſhall add, by way of Confirmation of what has been delivered, that I procured ſome ſtrong Icicles, that had been faſten'd to Vaults, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that would be acknowledged to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98188:15"/>
be true Stones, and yet to have been in a Liquid Form; and having Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatically examined theſe Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſpecifick Gravity, tho' not exactly the ſame in all, appeared to be little differing from that of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal; the ſolid Body exceeding the Weight of the fluid water, it Was Weigh'd in, about two times and an half, (a little more or leſs.)</p>

                     <head>The Way of weighing ſinking Bodies in Water.</head>
                     <p>The Solid Body, given to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, is to be ty'd about with an Horſe-hair of a competent length, which Hair at its other end is to be faſtened to one of the Scales of a tender and exactly equilibrated Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, ſo that, the propoſed Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly weighed in the Air, and then immerſed in a Glaſs or other fit Veſſel, almoſt full of fair Water, may hang freely in that Liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on every ſide encompaſſed by it. This done, you muſt put into the oppoſite Scale as many Weights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſerve to bring the Body hanging in the Water, to an exact <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with the Counterpoize, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Beam of the Ballance to an Horizontal Scituation. Then take out the Weights newly imployed, which give you the Weight of the Body in the Water, and deducting it from the Weight formerly taken of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98188:17"/>
the ſame Body in the Air, and by the remainder, which will be the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe two, divide the whole Weight of the given Body in the Air, and the Quotient (whether conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whole Numbers, or a Fraction, or both) will ſhew the Proportion, in ſpecifick Gravity, between the examined Solid, and as much Water as is juſt equal to it in Bulk. To make this more eaſily intelligible by an Example; We took a fine piece of white Marble, (that Stone ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt pure, and moſt free from Mineral Tinctures of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opacous Stones) this being put into a good Ballance, whoſe Scales were well equilibrated, was found to weigh in the Air, ℥ij <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij ℈1. Grains IX. which, for Conveniency of Supputation, we reduce to 1169 Grains, then an Horſe-hair was ty'd about this piece of Marble, and the other end of the ſame Hair was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to one of the Scales, under which, at a convenient diſtance, was plac'd a ſomewhat deep Glaſs, almoſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98188:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
full of fair Water, in this Liquor the Stone was made to hang freely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Surface, and in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Scale, there were put Weights enough to bring it to an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with the other, theſe Weights were found, being reduced to the former Denomination, to amount to 738. Grains, which gave us the Weight of the Marble in Water, (which was much leſs Weight than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe the Stone was partly ſuſtained by the Water) this being ſubſtracted from the Weight of the ſame Stone in the Air, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 431. Grains, which gave us the Weight of as much as was equal to the Stone in Bulk. By this remainder the Weight of the Marble in the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> 1169 being divided, the Quotient was found to be 2 &amp; 71/100, or near enough 7/10 for the Proportion in ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of White Marble to water. The Demonſtration of this Practice is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on what I have elſewhere given,<note place="margin">Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes.</note> and it may, in another way, be found in ſome of the Commentators on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98188:18"/>
                        <hi>Archimedes, de Inſidentibus, humido.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For underſtanding of the Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Direction newly given, it may be uſeful to ſubjoyn the following Notes: Firſt, 'tis manifeſt by the Nature of the thing, that the Body, propoſed to be weighed, ought to be heavy enough to ſink in Water, ſince otherwiſe its Weight in that Liquor being none at all, cannot be ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly deducted from its Weight in the Air; but if there be occaſion to Weigh in Water a Body lighter <hi>in Specie</hi> than it, as Bees-wax, a piece of Firr-wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be done, tho' not without ſome trouble, by joyning to it a Body, heavy enough to make the Wax ſink with it, but this Caſe belongs not to this place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An Horſe-hair is made choice of, for Hydroſtatical Operations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its ſaid to be Equiponderant to ſo much Water; and tho' I have not found that to be ſtrictly true, yet an Horſe hair is fitter to be imployed in theſe Tryals, than any other ſtring, I know of; and its ſpecifick Weight
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98188:18"/>
uſually differs ſo little from That of Water, that the Difference may be ſafely enough neglected; and if the Solid propoſed be too heavy to be ſuſtained by a ſingle Horſe-hair, one may twiſt two, (or, if need be) more of them, to make the ſtring ſtrong enough to ſuſtain the Solid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I ſhall add, that I have met with Bodies, about which, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Roundneſs, as in Bullets, or of ſome other inconvenient Figure, we could not well faſten an Hair, or other ſtring, wherewith to tye it to the Ballance. Now, on ſuch occaſions, I cauſed ſome Hairs to be ſo contex'd, as to make a kind of a little Hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, whoſe Meaſhes were not great enough to let the Body ſlip through them. In this ſmall Veſſel, whether you call it a Net or a Basket, which was ty'd by an Horſe-hair (ſingle or twiſted) to one of the Scales, we put the ſolid Body to be weighed, and proceeded in the Operation, as if the Body were tyed but with a ſtring.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98188:19"/>4. But here it muſt be carefully noted once for all, that whenſoever any Hydroſtatical Tryal is made with an Horſe-hair; there muſt be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scale that holds the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize, as much of the ſame Hair, as can be gueſt to be of the ſame Weight with that part of the ſtring that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains the Body in the Water, which appears to be above the Surface of the Water; for this Liquor takes off the Weight only of as much of the Hair as is immers'd in it, ſo that the unimmers'd part of the ſtring adds to the Weight of the Solid hanging in Water; and therefore, ought to be compenſated by an equal Weight put into the oppoſite Scale.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When I kept a Ballance, only or chiefly, for Hydroſtatical Tryals; I found it expedient, on divers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to take off one of the Scales with the ſtrings belonging to it, and ſubſtitute in its room a piece of Lead, or other Metal of a Conical, or ſom other convenient, ſhape, exactly Equiponderant to the oppoſite Scale,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98188:19"/>
and at the ſame end of the ſtring, to faſten one end of the Horſe-hair that tyed the Body to be weighed in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And ſometimes alſo, when I did not take off one of the Scales, I cauſed it to be perforated in the middle, (yet, without leſſening its Weight) that ſo the Body, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt, might hang very Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from the midſt of the Scale. The Motives, that induced me to theſe Practices, cannot be ſo well ſet down in few words; and therefore ſhall be now left unmentioned, eſpecially becauſe the Practices themſelves, tho' on ſome occaſions convenient, are not neceſſary.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There remain yet a couple of Remarks, which muſt leſs than any be pretermitted, if Men would avoid ſome Errors, that are but too often ſlipt into, by the Makers of Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Tryals. We are then (Firſt,) to take notice, that the Body, to be examined, hang freely in the Water, ſo that no part of it any where touch the bottom or the ſides of the Veſſel,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98188:20"/>
or reach above the upper Surface of the Water contained in it; for, if any of theſe Circumſtances be not taken care of, (as it happens, when we are not heedful enough) the true Weight of the Solid is ſomewhat altered; and if any Corner, or other part of the Body, (and the like may be ſaid of the Horſe-hair, 'tis tyed with) tho' but a ſmall one, appear above the Surface of the Water: That extant Portion, being not at all ſuſtained by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, adds (more or leſs) to the Weight, that the immerſt Body ſhould have. Care alſo muſt be had, that, as nothing but the Water do touch the hanging Body, ſo, no part of the Water may touch the Scale whence it hangs. I have ſeveral times obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that immerſt Bodies have been concluded to weigh more in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than really they did; becauſe, through ſuch a want of Heedfulneſs, as is not uncommon, the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters did not take notice, that if the ſtring were too ſhort, or the Veſſel too full; the vibrating Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98188:20"/>
of the Ballance, would, at one time or other, carry down the Scale, the ſuſpended Body was ty'd to, ſo low, as to make one part or other of it touch the Surface of the Water: ſome Drops of which Liquor would readily ſtick to it, and, becauſe they adher'd to the nether part of it, would lye concealed from an Eye that was not prying, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would ſenſibly add to the Weight of the Scale, and make the Body be thought heavier than indeed it was; which Over-ſight muſt needs be very prejudicial, when one makes Experiments that require Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But the moſt uſual Cauſe of Miſtakes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Hydroſtatical Tryals, (eſpecially ſuch, as are made on ſmall Bodies) wherein a little Error may be greatly conſiderable, is this; that Men are wont to think it ſufficient, (in theſe Tryals) that the Body to be examined, be totally immerſt in the Water; whereas it does not only often, but moſt commonly happen,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98188:21"/>
that the given Solid, and the ſtring that is tyed about it, carry down with them divers Particles of Air; and perhaps too, it may find and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate others, that lay concealed in the Pores of the Liquor it ſelf; which <hi>Aerial</hi> Particles faſten themſelves to the little Aſperities, that they meet with on the Surface of the immerſt Bodies, in the form of Bubbles, which, like ſo many little Bladders full of Air, endeavour to buoy up the Body they adhere to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on that account do, in Proportion to their Number and Bigneſs, leſſen the Weight, which the immerſt body would otherwiſe have in Water. And therefore, great care is to be had, eſpecially in nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments; that, by ſhaking the ſtring, and warily knocking the Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſides of the Glaſs, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering Bubbles may be diſplaced, and emerge to the top of the Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I ſhall add a deſire, that on ſome occaſions this Caution be made uſe of more than once in the ſame Tryals; becauſe I have ſeveral
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98188:21"/>
times obſerved, that now &amp; then after the immerſt Body was freed from the firſt Bubbles that appear'd about it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did ſucceed, before an end was made of weighing the Body; out of ſome of whoſe unperceived Cavities, or Pores, (whether ſuperficial or lying deeper) perhaps the latent Air could not eaſily on a ſudden be driven by the Water. I have been the more Circumſtantial in explaining the ſummarily propoſed Method of Weighing Bodies in Water, becauſe Experience hath ſhewn, that 'tis not near ſo eaſie, as, upon the firſt reading of it, one would preſume<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in the Practice of it.</p>
                     <p>Having obtained the Weight of a Body propoſed; Firſt, in the Air, and then in Water, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod plainly delivered; 'twill not be difficult to diſcover <hi>Practically</hi> the Proportion in Weight, between the Solid and the Liquor. I ſay <hi>Practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> becauſe the Rule is eaſie enough, tho' the Demonſtration is not ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to be underſtood by them, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98188:22"/>
are not acquainted with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Hydroſtaticks. The <hi>Theorem,</hi> upon which our Practice is grounded, was firſt, that we know of, delivered by the moſt ſagacious <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>; whoſe Commentators have buſied themſelves in demonſtrating it in a Mathematical way, as I have ſince endeavoured to do in a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, and more eaſie to Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts in the Hydroſtatical Paradoxes. <hi>Archimedes</hi>'s Propoſition is this, <hi>That a Body, heavier than Water, weighs leſs in Water than in the Air, by the Weight of as much Water as is equal to it in Bulk or Magnitude</hi>: Whence 'tis not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to deduce a Rule ſufficing for our preſent purpoſe. For if you ſubtract the Weight of the Body propoſed, whilſt it is every way environed with Water; from the Weight of the ſame Body, which it was found to have in the Air; the reſidual Number or Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence gives you the Weight (taken in the Air) of as much Water as is equal in Magnitude to the Solid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98188:22"/>
ſo that, having now two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, one Firm, and the other Liquid, together with the Weight of each of them apart; to find their Proportion, you need but divide the greater by the leſſer; and the Quotient compared to One, that is, to an Unite, will be the Antecedent the of the Proportion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired between the ſolid Body and the Water; which is mentioned, but, as it is the Liquor that is generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in theſe Experiments, for otherwiſe the Rule will hold, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> in other Liquors, as well as in Water.</p>

                  <p>ANd now having premiſed theſe Remarks, and thereby made way for the clearer Underſtanding of the ſubſequent part of this Paper; we ſhall proceed to the Examples, that this not unneceſſary Digreſſion has diverted us from propounding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98188:23"/>There is a deeply Red and Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Mineral, that commonly paſſes in the Shops under the Name of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Haematites,</hi> tho' it ſeems to have more Affinity to that which divers Authors call <hi>Schyſtos.</hi> But whatever be the moſt proper Name that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, it is an hard Foſſile, which, tho' little uſed by our Engliſh Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is in ſeveral Places abroad in great Requeſt; &amp; that not without cauſe, as far as I can judge, by what I yet know of it; and eſpecially, for that Somni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Quality, that may be obſerved in ſome of its Preparations. But 'tis not here, tho' 'tis elſewhere, my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deliver its Medicinal Virtues; but only to examine, whether, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Method, it ought to be concluded to abound with Metallick Particles, (perhaps but Embryonated,) to whoſe Intermixture ſome of its Virtues may probably be aſcrib'd. Therefore, in a very good Ballance, having weigh'd a piece of Engliſh <hi>Haematites,</hi> that chanced to amount to about ℥iij <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98188:23"/>
and then in Water; we found its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to this Liquor, as 4 15/100 to 1. At which Ponderoſity, if I had not formerly made the like Experiments, I ſhould have been ſurprized; as you probably will be, when you conſider, that this Metalline Stone did not very much want of almoſt twice the Weight of a mere Stone of the ſame Bulk. This great Weight much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in the Conjecture I had made; that in this Lump was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a good deal of Metalline Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And this induced me (to add that upon the by) to examine my Gueſs, by ſubliming it, when finely powdered, and diligently mixt with an equal, or double, Weight of <hi>Salar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

A famous and not unlearned Empyrick, to whom I willingly communicated ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, that he deſired of me; when I asked him about a Medicine, whoſe Succeſs brought him a great number of Patients, for griping Fluxes, and ſome Dyſenterical ones; candidly

This made it obvious for for me to conjecture, that <hi>Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris</hi> participates of a Metallick Nature, as may be argued from its Operation upon Copper, which is thereby turned into Braſs. Wherefore weighing a piece of this Foſſile, firſt in Air, and then in Water, it appeared to be to this Liquor as 4 169/100 to 1.</p>

ſome further Uſes of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Way of exploring hard and ponderous Concretions, hitherto treated of.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not therefore forbear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you, that, <hi>tho'</hi> when an hard Foſſile propounded, is found to be much heavier than Chryſtal of the ſame Bulk; 'tis a very probable To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that in the Solid Concretion, there is a notable Portion, greater or leſſer, of ſome Metalline or other ponderous Mineral Body, whence its good or evil Qualities, in reference to human Bodies, may probably be deduced; <hi>Yet,</hi> this hinders not, but that 'tis very poſſible, for a Foſſile to be endowed with Medicinal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or to have noxious Qualities, on the account of a Portion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Matter; tho' its ſpecifick Gravity doth but little exceed that of Chryſtal, or the advantage ſeem but inconſiderable. For, (to paſs by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reflections) a very ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Adventitious, Metalline, or Mineral, Subſtance, if it be of an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98188:26"/>
Operative Nature, may, in ſome Caſes, ſuffice, to diffuſe its ſelf through the reſt of the Maſs, and impregnate it with active Qualities. Which may be partly Illuſtrated, and partly Proved, by ſome Experiments that will be hereafter met with, in one of the Chapters.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Uſe II.</note>TO hint ſomewhat about the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Utility of our Hydroſtatical Way of Inquiry; I ſhall take notice in the firſt place, that it may aſſiſt us to gueſs, with probability, whether a Mineral Body propounded, as likely to be a Stone, or of a ſtony Nature, be ſo indeed. Thus Coral, for inſtance, is by ſome thought to be a Plant, by others a <hi>Lytho-dendron,</hi> but, by the greater Number, 'tis reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Precious Stones. In this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Opinions, the ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity may be of conſiderable Uſe.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98188:26"/>
Wherefore, we thought fit to weigh a piece of choice and well colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed red Coral; firſt, in the Air, and then in the Water, and found its Proportion to the Weight of as much of that Liquor, to be as 2 68/100 to 1. So that its ſpecifick Gravity much favours their Opinion, who take it to be a Stone, ſince it not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals that of Chryſtal, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what exceeds it.</p>
                  <p>There are Some, that will have Pearls, becauſe of their Hardneſs, and their being treated of by Jewelers, and others that write of Gems, to be of a ſtony Nature. Wherefore I thought fit examine their Pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alſo. But not having now with me any Tryal of that kind; I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute One that I made upon a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Pearl, that was preſented me by a Perſon that took it out of the Oyſter. I call it Monſtrous, becauſe tho' it be well enough coloured, yet its Shape is irregular, and its Bigneſs extraordinary; as is alſo its Weight, amounting to full 206 Grains. This
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98188:27"/>
being weigh'd in Water, its Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gravity to an equal Bulk of the Liquor was found to be as 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>00 to 1. So that its ſpecifick Weight was much about the ſame, with that of Chryſtal.</p>
                  <p>There are Many, that take the Stones formed in Mens Bladders, for as true and genuine Stones, as Thoſe that Nature forms in the greater World; and ſpeak much, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not without ground, of the great Hardneſs of divers of them. But, tho' I deny not, that, in a laxer Senſe, they may well enough paſs for Stones; yet I ſhould rather call them <hi>Animal Stones,</hi> than ſimply <hi>Stones</hi>; this Name having been conſtantly and generally uſed, to ſignifie Mineral or Foſſile Stones: which, by our Way of Explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from human <hi>Calculus</hi>'s, and other like hard Concretions, found in the Bodies of ſome Animals. For, having examined a good Number of theſe Stones, I found, that not only the Chymical <hi>Analyſes,</hi> I made of them, of which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98188:27"/>
I elſewhere give an Account, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted them, how hard ſoever they were, to be Concretions belonging to the Animal Kingdom, not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: But, by an Hydroſtatical <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of divers of them, I found them to differ much, in ſpecifick Gravity, from true Foſſile Stones. Of this you will, in its proper place, meet with ſeveral Inſtances; ſo that it may here ſuffice to mention Two, that now chance to come to hand. Namely, that a <hi>Calculus humanus</hi> weighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vjſs was found to be in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an equal Bulk of Water, as 1 76/100 to 1. And another, that weighed <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iv and above an half, in the Air, being alſo weighed in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, appeared to be to this Liquor, as 1 69/100 to 1.</p>
                  <p>I mention theſe Stones as belonging to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> tho' they are lookt upon rather as Diſeaſes, of which, indeed, they are very ſad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, becauſe a famous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Phyſician, that Practiſed long in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98188:28"/>
Opportunity than almoſt any <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> had before him, to try the Virtues of <hi>Bezoar,</hi> does either equal or prefer the <hi>Calculi,</hi> we are ſpeaking of, even to Oriental <hi>Bezoar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to ſhew, that Men are not the only Animals, wherein Stone-like Concretions differ in ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, (and ſo may be diſtinguiſhed, by that difference,) from Chryſtal and ſuch like true Stones; we ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn Two or Three Experiments, made upon choice <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stones, not exceeding a middle Size, ſuch being the likelieſt not to be adulterated. The firſt of theſe weighing in the Air <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij, and odd Grains, was found to be in Proportion to Water of the ſame Bulk, as 1 47/100 to 1. Another weighing ſomewhat leſs than <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij, was to the Weight of an equal Bulk of Water, as 1 53/100 to 1. I might add divers other Inſtances of the like Import; and tho I think them not neceſſary, yet I ſhall ſubjoyn One more, becauſe 'tis afforded by a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar</hi> ſtone, taken out of another of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98188:28"/>
the ſame kind: This Kernel-ſtone, if I may ſo call it, being Weighed in the Air wanted Nine Grains of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij, and its Proportion to Water of the ſame Magnitude, was found to be as that of 1 55/100 to 1. In all which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we may obſerve, that theſe Animal Stones not amounting to twice the Weight of Water equal to them in Bulk, have leſs of ſpecifick Gravity, by above a Fifth part, than a true Foſſile Stone (ſuch as Chryſtal) is wont to be endowed with.</p>

                  <p>This comprehends two, ſomewhat differing, Ways of applying the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, we have lately mentioned. For firſt, we may by the Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks

be aſſiſted to diſcover, with Probability, the reſemblance, or the difference that may be between Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſame Denomination, ſo that ſome ſubordinate <hi>Species</hi> of them, may perhaps be diſtinguiſhed, as well as ſeveral <hi>Individuals</hi> of the ſame, or lowermoſt, <hi>Species.</hi> Since, for Inſtance, we have found a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference between the ſpecifick Weights of ſeveral Loadſtones, that were dug up in ſeveral Countries or Mines; if greater Number and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Experiments, of this kind were made, we ſhould poſſibly find, that, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> the Loadſtones of one Country, or of one Mine, are conſiderably heavier than Thoſe of another; as, if I miſtake not, I uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerved, the <hi>Norwegian</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Loadſtones to be heavier <hi>in Specie,</hi> than Thoſe that are ſaid to come out of a warmer Region, <hi>Italy</hi>; whoſe Iſland of <hi>Elba</hi> abounds with Mines, whereof I ſaw one intire Maſs, that I judged to weigh a great many hundred of Pounds. And this difference

of Weight between Foſſiles of the ſame kind, when 'tis conſiderable, may be of good uſe to help us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Stones of the ſame loweſt <hi>Species,</hi> that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to differing Countries or Mines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, in Caſe the unequal Weight proceeds, as it often does, from an Adventitious Matter, that inſinuated it ſelf into the more genuine Matter of the Foſſile, whilſt 'twas Fluid or Soft, it may much aſſiſt us to gueſs at the greater or leſſer Purity of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneouſneſs of the Foſſile propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which Diſcovery may, on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions, be of no ſmall uſe to the Phyſician, the Jeweller, or the Naturaliſt.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Uſe IV.</note> may in divers Caſes be of much greater Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Importance, as being very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98188:30"/>
proper to help us to diſcern genuine Stones, whether Animal or Mineral, from counterfeit Ones; which too often paſs for true, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Phyſicians and Patients, and the great Loſs of <hi>Lapidarie</hi>'s, and their Cuſtomers.

prove difficult in many Caſes to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Cheats, and Counterfeiters, or Adulterators of Gems, and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Minerals; becauſe the little knowledge they have of the Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs, and Variety, of Natural and Artificial Productions, confines them to a ſmall Number and Diverſity of Means, to accompliſh their fradulent Deſigns. And whilſt they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but upon counterfeiting the more obvious Qualities of things; and perhaps of eluding the known and vulgar Tryals Men are wont to acquieſce in; they are not like to take Care to maintain the ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and ſecure their adulterated Wares, againſt an Hydroſtatical Way of <hi>Examen,</hi> which, probably, they never ſo much as heard of. By this means, ſeveral Perls, for Inſtance, may be diſcovered to be Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, without, in the leaſt, injuring them. And I remember, That ſome factitious Corals, that, for Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I made, to ſhew what might be done in that kind; were, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98188:31"/>
their fine Colour, Shape, and Gloſſineſs, eaſily diſcoverable, by their having a ſpecifick Weight manifeſtly exceeding That, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to natural Corals.</p>
                  <p>Before I knew better Ways, I have ſometimes, for Recreation, by the help of <hi>Minium</hi> made Paſtes, or factitious Gems, which, tho' tranſparent, and finely enough coloured, yet, becauſe they contained ſome vitrified Lead, added to the other Ingredients to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Fuſion, were liable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by an eaſie Hydroſtatical Tryal of their Ponderoſity. I have likewiſe ſeen a fair <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stone, that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a genuine Stone, That a great Price was ſet upon it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought me to be judged of, I made little doubt of its being Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, by reaſon of its appearing to me as heavy as a Mineral Stone of that Bulk; tho' the Poſſeſſor being loth to expoſe it to an uncommon Tryal, I could not ſo cogently evince, that I had a clear Reaſon to diſadviſe the purchaſe of it.</p>

                  <p>AFter theſe Inſtances, (which are not the only,<note place="margin">Uſe V.</note> that might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of this kind) the affinity of the Subjects invites me to take notice of another Uſe, or, at leaſt, a Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, which may be made of our Hydroſtatical Way of examining Solids. For it may, on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions, aſſiſt us, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Eſtimates of the Genuineneſs, or the degree of Purity of ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that are, or may, uſefully be imployed in Phyſick; tho' they be not Stones or Minerals, provided they be heavy enough to ſink in Water. For when we have once found the ſpecifick Gravity of a Concretion of this ſort, that we know to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, and well-conditioned in its kind; this degree of Ponderouſneſs may ſerve us for a kind of Standard,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98188:32"/>
whereby to judge of others, of the ſame Denomination, or that are ſaid to be of a like Nature.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate a Remark, that has no more of Difficulty in it than This, fewer Inſtances will ſuffice, (if any be neceſſary) than you will meet with in the following Part of this Tract, wherein they will opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occur. And therefore, inſtead of ſetting them down in this place, I chooſe to give you an Advertiſement, that would ſurprize you, if I had not formerly hinted ſomewhat, applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame purpoſe, by no great Variation. For that which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to obſerve to you, is, That, I think, there ſhould be made a great difference between the Eſtimate, that Men make of ſome Stones, to which the Shops give the Name of Gems, according as the Eſtimate is to be made by Jewellers and Goldſmiths, or by Phyſicians and Chymiſts. For the Tradeſmen, who uſually aim but at the Beauty and Luſtre of the Gems they would Sell, may juſtly eſteem
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98188:32"/>
thoſe <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi> the beſt, that are <hi>in Specie</hi> the lighteſt, becauſe ſuch are generally more uniform as to Senſe, and more Tranſparent; and alſo, receive their Colour from Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of finer Parts. But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thoſe, that in Gems ſeek main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not only, for the Medicinal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; may juſtly value Thoſe moſt, that are moſt Ponderous: as having more plentiful Portions of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick, or Mineral, Subſtances, whence the greateſt part of their Virtues is, as has been formerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in Probability, to be derived. And this difference in ſpecifick Weight, in Stones that have the ſame Name given them, I ſometimes found to be far greater, than one that has not try'd it would imagine, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by ſome Inſtances, applicable to this Argument, that will hereafter be met with. But yet, I would not hence infer, that even ſuch Stones, whether tranſparent or not, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear fine, and are but light in their kind, muſt be devoid of Particles,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98188:33"/>
whether Metalline, or of kin to them, whence they may be endowed with conſiderable Medicinal Virtues. For there are Mineral Pigments of ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Nature, that ſo ſmall a Quantity as will ſcarce make them ſenſibly heavier than Gems that are leſs, or perhaps not at all coloured, may be diffuſed through the whole Matter; and, at leaſt, impregnate every ſenſible part of it: This I ſhall Illuſtrate by the following Experiment, deviſed for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Five Grains of powdered <hi>Zaphora,</hi> being mixed with ℥j <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>
                     <hi>ſs</hi> of finely powdered <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſs, and kept a full hour in Fuſion in a Furnace, that gives an exceeding violent Fire, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a tranſparent Maſs, that was throughout of a fine blew Colour, and that deep enough; ſo that one part of the Pigment ſufficed to tinge, by Fuſion, above an hundred parts of the Glaſs: And when for Curioſity, we made the Proportion of the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phora</hi> a little greater, taking Eight Grains of the Pigment to ℥j of Glaſs,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98188:33"/>
that is, One to ſixty; the Mixture ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been kept for the like time in ſtrong Fuſion, the Maſs was ſo deeply coloured, that the Proportion of the Tinging ſtuffe to the reſt of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, appeared too great to make a handſome Gem.</p>
                  <p>And further to manifeſt, that a Quantity of Metalline Matter, tho' it be but very ſmall, may ſuffice to give a Tincture, and ſo to impart a Virtue to a Glaſſy Body, and even to Gems; I ſhall add an Experiment, that perhaps you will think ſomewhat ſtrange. I had long conjectur'd, that there was in <hi>Granats,</hi> eſpecially in ſome that were deeply coloured, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtore of Metalline <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> of a Martial Nature, and that thoſe <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles</hi> are more than ſufficient for the <hi>Granate</hi> it ſelf, into whoſe Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they enter, tho' not viſibly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their extream Minuteneſs. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition, I took a <hi>Bohemian,</hi> or rather <hi>German, Granate,</hi> (for I never ſaw any <hi>Bohemian</hi> ſo large) that I had kept by me for a Rarity, becauſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98188:34"/>
of its Bigneſs and deep Colour, tho it was not a fine Stone to look on, notwithſtanding its being tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in thoſe Edges that were thin. This being reduced to very fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (but not in an Iron Mortar, leſt ſhould take ſomthing from the Metal) we exactly mixt Eight Grains with an Ounce of finely pulverized Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Glaſs; afterwards the Mixture was kept two hours in a Furnace, that gives a ſtronger Fire than ordinary VVind-Furnaces, by which means we obtained, as I expected, a pretty uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Maſs tinged of a ſufficiently green Colour, ſuch as prepared Iron, or Steel, gives to pure Glaſs.</p>

                  <p>WHat has been hitherto deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, may ſerve to ſhew, in ſome meaſure, the Uſes of our Hydroſtatical Way of examining Drugs, upon a Suppoſition that they are Solid, and neither very minute, nor too light to ſink in Water. But I muſt not forbear to confeſs, and even
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98188:34"/>
give Notice, that there are many Simples, and other ponderable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that may, upon good Grounds, be ſaid to belong to the <hi>Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica</hi>; which yet want One, or More, of the newly expreſſed Conditions. Wherefore I muſt not conceal, that there are Three things, which, tho' not neceſſary to the Underſtanding of the Uſefulneſs of the foregoing Part of this Diſcourſe; may, if they can be performed, much conduce to Facilitate (for I dare not ſay, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat) the Hydroſtatical Way of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Bodies, heavier <hi>in Specie</hi> than Water. And therefore, tho' I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it no eaſie Task to ſurmount the Difficulties to be met with in this Attempt; yet I ſhall endeavour to leſſen them as much as I can, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you the Expedients, that I was wont formerly to make uſe of in the Three Caſes, I am about to mention: Namely, <hi>Firſt,</hi> When the Body to be examined was Liquid, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, I could not be immediately taken hold of by an Horſe-hair, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98188:35"/>
any other ſlender String. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Body propoſed was either in the Form of Powder, or conſiſted of Fragments that were ſo ſmall, that it 'twas not poſſible, or, at leaſt, not fit, to faſten each of them to an Hair; and ſuſpend it after the manner of a Body of a greater Bulk. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Solid to be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatically examined, though great enough in Bulk to be tyed about, was diſſoluble in Water; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly unfit to be weighed in that <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> Since therein its Gravity muſt continually decreaſe, whilſt the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was performing.</p>
                  <p>As to the Firſt of the Three Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; lately mentioned, I ſuppoſe, I need not ſolicitouſly premiſe, that the Liquid Subſtance, to be Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically examin'd, ought to be heavier <hi>in Specie,</hi> than the Water, or other Fluid, 'tis to be weighed in; and of ſuch a Nature, as not to be apt (at leaſt, ſpeedily) to mingle it ſelf with it: ſince, otherwiſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Liquor will either emerge in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98188:35"/>
that it ſhould be weighed in, or elſe be confounded with it, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no diſtinct Maſs, or Gravity.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing then, that the Liquor, to be examined, has belonging to it the Two newly recited Conditions, we made uſe of this Expedient to explore its ſpecifick Weight. We took a ſmall Jar, or wide-mouthed Glaſs capable of containing an Ounce or two of common Water, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Air about, Three or four Drams (more or leſs, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.) This Glaſs, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities ſake, we are wont to call Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical, or elſe Glaſs-Bucket; we weigh very carefully once for all, firſt in the Air, and then in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by the difference of the Weights we find, according to the known Hydroſtatical Method, a Weight equivalent to That of the Subſtance of the Glaſs in Water is ſo that ſuch a Weight being put into the oppoſite Scale of the Ballance, the Veſſel hanging under the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ace of the Water, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98188:36"/>
as having no Weight at all, that is, no Praeponderancy. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the Weight of a Body contained in this Bucket may be looked upon, as That of the Body it ſelf in Water, without being increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that of the Veſſel; ſo that, in our Inſtance, the Bucket makes a Maſs of Quick-ſilver, tho' Fluid, as ponderable as if 'twere coagulated into a Solid Body.</p>
                  <p>The Glaſs-Bucket being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided once for all, we put the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Mercury</hi> into it, and weigh them together in the Air; whence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the already known Weight of the Veſſel it ſelf in the Air, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue gives the Weight of the Quick-ſilver alone in the Air. This done, by the help of an Horſe-hair, we tye the Bucket to one of the Scales, (or to either end of the Beam,) and letting it, with the Quick-ſilver in it, ſlowly ſink into a Glaſs, or other Veſſel, competently full of fair Water, and hang ſo, that the Bucket may not any where touch,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98188:36"/>
either the bottom, or the ſides of the larger Veſſel; we reduce by Weights, put into the oppoſite Scale, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the formerly mentioned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe of the Bucket in the Water, the Ballance to an exact <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> without raiſing the Bucket quite to the Surface of the Water; this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained Weight, of the immerſt Quick-ſilver, being deducted from its Weight in the Air, 'tis eaſie, by the known Hydroſtatical Method, to obtain the Proportion in Gravity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the given <hi>Mercury,</hi> and an equal Bulk of Water.</p>
                  <p>To expedite this Operation, it may be convenient to have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs (as I was wont to do,) a couple of Weights, of Lead, or Tin; the greater exactly equal to the Weight of the Glaſs-Bucket in the Air, and the other equal to the Weight of the ſame Bucket in Water. For, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two Weights conſtantly in readineſs, One has at hand a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe of the Veſſel, in which ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the two <hi>Medium</hi>'s 'tis employ'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98188:37"/>
in; which ſaves them, that have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſion to uſe the Ballance, much of the time that muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſpent to adjuſt it.</p>
                  <p>This Advertiſement being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the lately propounded Operation will be beſt underſtood by an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; we took a ſmall Glaſs-Jar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of holding about ℥ſs. of Water, and put it into one Scale of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ballance; whoſe other Scale we furniſht with a Counterpoiſe, or Weight, equal to the Glaſs. Into this little Veſſel, we then put ℥ 1, that is, Four hundred and eighty Grains of <hi>Mercury</hi> (affirm'd to be <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> which is counted the richeſt) and the Glaſs with this <hi>Mercury</hi> in it was, by an Horſe-hair, made to hang from one of the Scales, into a deep Glaſs Veſſel of Water.

of the Glaſs, being already accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for. But Care was firſt taken, that the open-mouth'd Veſſel ſhould be every where environed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and diligently freed from adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Bubbles; and that a piece of Horſe-hair ſhould be added to the Counterpoiſe, to compenſate that part of the String or Hair tyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Bucket, that was in the Air, intercepted between the Scale, it was faſtened to, and the Surface of the Water. By this means, we found the Weight of the Quick-ſilver in that Liquor, to amount to 446 Grains, which being ſubſtracted from the Weight of the Quick-ſilver in the Air, the difference was 34 Grains, by which the greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being divided, the Quotient was 14 and about 1/1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

To which I ſhall add,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98188:38"/>
That this I may here give you No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in general; That, having on Chymical and other Accounts, had more occaſion than moſt Men, to make Tryals of this ſort, I did not find all running Mercuries, tho' they did not appear adulterated, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely of the ſame Weight: Nay, even deſtilled Mercuries, if once combin'd with Metalline Bodies, and particularly, if they were animated, and drawn from fine Gold; I found to differ more from common Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſold in Shops, than Theſe did from one another; and even between common Mercuries, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their having been Deſtilled, we found a notable Diſparity. But to inlarge on this Subject, were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this Place, where I mentioned the Weight of Mercury: But to give ſo clear (tho' but ſingle) an Inſtance of the Way of meaſuring the Weight of ponderous Liquid Bodies in Water, as may warrant me to ſay; That, by this Method, tho' not always with the ſame eaſe, we may explore the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick

Weight of other Liquors, that are in equal Bulk heavier than Water, and yet are indiſpoſed to mingle with it; ſuch as are the Chymical Oyls of Cinnamon, Cloves, <hi>Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c. But the chief thing, that has made me the the more Circumſtantial in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foregoing Experiment, was, that this practical Direction, for weighing one Liquor in another, will hereafter appear to be applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to uſeful Purpoſes, eſpecially when we come to mention, in the following Chapters, ſeveral Caſes, wherein Liquors of a Nature very different from Water, may be ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in its ſtead.</p>

of their Littleneſs or inconvenient Shape, are <hi>ſingly</hi> unfit to be tyed with an Horſe-hair to the Ballance; as the Fragments of Rubies, and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, wont to be ſold by Weight at the Drugſters or Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Shops: the Way of diſcovering the Weight of theſe in Water, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not much from That lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of weighing Quick-ſilver in that Liquor. For on theſe occaſions alſo, we imploy ſuch a Glaſs-Bucket, as was lately deſcribed; and having made it very dry, as well within, as without; We put into it the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line <hi>Calx,</hi> or other heavy Powder, or a convenient Quantity of the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gems, or a competent Number of ſmall, tho' intire, Bodies, as Pieces of Native <hi>Cinnabar, Seed-pearl, &amp;c.</hi> and proceed with theſe, as we did with Quick-ſilver. Only this Caution is to be heedfully taken along, that we warily, and little by little, put into the Bucket, whilſt 'tis yet kept in the Air, and hath the already weighed Powder, or Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98188:40"/>
in it, a convenient Quantity of the ſame Water, 'tis to be weighed in; that the Liquor may have time to inſinuate it ſelf between the dry Bodies, and even the <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> of the Powders, and expel thence the Air, that was harbored in the Intervals betwixt them; which little <hi>Aerial</hi> Portions, if not thus ſeaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, would, upon the immerſion of the Veſſel, produce in the Water ſtore of Bubbles, that would buoy up, or faſten themſelves to the Fragments, or other ſmall Bodies, and make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment uncertain, or fallacious. And if it be a <hi>Powder,</hi> that is to be weighed; unleſs it be before hand throughly wetted, and thereby freed from <hi>Aerial</hi> Particles, and reduced to a kind of Mud; there is Danger, that ſome dry <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> of the Powder, will, when the Veſſel is under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be buoy'd up, and get out of it, and, floating on the Surface of the incumbent Water, take off from the true Weight, that the immerſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould have in that Liquor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98188:40"/>If this Way of examining Bodies be carefully imployed by a dextrous Man, furniſhed with a tender Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, it may be of conſiderable uſe, not only to Phyſicians, Druggiſts, and Apothecaries, that are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the more precious Kinds of ſinking Bodies, that belong to the <hi>Materia Medica</hi>; but alſo to Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Gold-ſmiths, whom it much concerns not to be impoſed upon by counterfeit Gems, or by other Stones of price, that are not duly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, in their kind. Thus the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Five precious Stones,</hi> That (upon what grounds, I now inquire not,) are made Ingredients of ſome Noble Compoſitions, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio Hyacinthi,</hi> &amp;c. theſe Fragments, I ſay, may each ſort of them apart be uſefully examined by their Weight in Water, by him that knows the true ſpecifick Gravity of a parcel of the fineſt, or elſe of ſuch as he jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be fitteſt for his purpoſe. And, to add That upon the By, whereas <hi>Granates</hi> are reckoned among the

Five Medicinal precious Stones, and in ſome <hi>Pharmacopoea's</hi> are preferr'd to the Firſt place, as the beſt: I have found ſo great a difference, in point of Ponderoſity, between <hi>European Granates</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Ones, whereof ſome were ſent me as a Preſent from <hi>New England,</hi> and others, I my ſelf pickt plentifully enough out of an odd <hi>American</hi> Mineral, that I ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to contain them; that it was very obvious to think, their Virtues might be very different, if not as to <hi>Kind,</hi> yet, at leaſt, as to <hi>Degrees</hi>: And <hi>not only</hi> ſuch factitious Pearls as have delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many, and ſometimes even fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, Jewellers, (as one of themſelves, that was Lapidary to a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, confeſſed to me) may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by this Expedient be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, eſpecially if Mercury (tho' diſguis'd) be imploy'd in making them; <hi>but,</hi> we may probably by the ſame Method diſcriminate the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pearls of ſeveral Countries and Sorts, whereof I have ſeen a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difference than one would expect;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98188:41"/>
and I have ſomewhere yet by me na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Pearls of ſuch various Colours, as well as Shapes, as have ſomewhat ſurprized even the Curious. But becauſe it more concerns Phyſicians and Patients, to be able to make Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of Seed Pearl, that are on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions of good uſe to health; than to know the Genuineneſs of thoſe bigger Ones, that are ſeldom made uſe of, but for Ornament; I ſhall here mention the reſult of an Experiment, which I find among my old Notes, to have been made by me, when I was furniſhed with very fine Oriental Seed-Pearls. For having examined theſe by the Way, we are now diſcourſing of, as judging them Orient enough to be fit to be Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, wherewith to compare Others; we found theſe to Water of the ſame Bulk, 2 75/100 (<hi>i. e.</hi> ¾) to 1.</p>
                  <p>But in This, and in thoſe other Tryals, whoſe Difficulty, or Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, require, that we make them as exactly, as we are able. I muſt advertiſe you, that 'tis not fit to truſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98188:42"/>
to the Steddineſs of your hand, in holding the Ballance, but that you make uſe of a Gibbet, (as they call it,) or ſome other ſtable Prop to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. For the Hand often ſhakes, and makes the Inſtrument that it holds, to do ſo: and oftner grows weary before the Scales have had time to play up and down, and at length ſettle in a determinate Scituation; wherein if you miſs of a true <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium,</hi> the Hand muſt undergo a new Pennance: Whereas, when the Ballance hangs on a ſtable <hi>Fulcrum,</hi> you have both your Hands to help you, and need not be tempted by Wearineſs to deſiſt, before the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance be brought to reſt in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> The Neglect or Omiſſion of this Practice, I take to be one main Reaſon, (for the want of good Ballances, or of Skill to uſe them, is oftentimes Another) why ſo many of the Experiments, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire weighing, are Erroneous; as they that cautiouſly examine them (as I have ſometimes had occaſion to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98188:42"/>
do) may eaſily find. And therefore, (to add That, upon the By,) I hope, you will not make haſte to cenſure the Accounts I give of Hydroſtatical Tryals, becauſe they do not always agree with Thoſe of other Mens; ſince perhaps they did not imploy, either more Diligence, or better Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than I.</p>

                  <p>THe laſt of the Three Caſes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned: Namely, <hi>What is to be done, when the Body to be Hydroſtatically examined, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in Water, or eaſily mingle with it?</hi> Imports a Queſtion, difficult and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome enough to be reſolved. Nor can this <hi>Examen</hi> be performed by a ſingle Operation, which yet ſufficed in each of the Two foregoing Caſes. And having ſeriouſly conſidered the Matter, the beſt Expedient I could then think of was, That, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98188:43"/>
years ago, I propounded in an Aſſembly of the Royal Society, and grounded on this Reflection, That tho' the Body propoſed could not be immediately weighed in Water, yet we may ſubſtitute another Liquor that will not diſſolve it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inveſtigate the ſpecifick Gravity, in reference to <hi>that Medium</hi>; and then, by comparing the difference of thoſe Two Liquors in point of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, One may come to diſcover, What the Body propoſed would have weighed in Water, in caſe it could have been kept there a competent time, without having any part of it diſſolved. Conſidering then, that, except Quick-ſilver, the viſible Fluids we can command, are either of an <hi>Aqueous,</hi> or of an <hi>Oily,</hi> Nature; and that moſt Bodies, whereof we can make Solutions in Liquors of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, will not (at leaſt, ſenſibly) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be diſſolved by thoſe of the later, Kind, whilſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Solid is weighing in them: We preſum'd that the moſt Saline Bodies,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98188:43"/>
ſuch as <hi>Allum, Vitriol, Sal Gem,</hi> to which may be added, <hi>Borax, Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> &amp;c. might be commodiouſly weighed in <hi>Oleous</hi> Liquors. Among theſe I made choice of Oil of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,</hi> rather than Oil-<hi>Olive,</hi> or any Chymical Eſſential Oil: <hi>Partly,</hi> becauſe, being of common uſe, 'tis to be procured in ſufficient Quantity, and, being very cheap, is ſeldom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated, as Chymical Oils are too often found to be; and, <hi>partly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being a diſtilled Body, it may be preſumed to be free from <hi>Aqueous</hi> Parts, of which Experience has ſhewn me, that common expreſſed Oil is far from being deſtitute: But becauſe Two Liquors, that are indeed both of them Oils, are wont to have diſtinct Names given them in the Shops; I ſhall here intimate, that I do not, when I have my Choice, make uſe of that which many call the <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> but of That which firſt comes over, which thoſe that diſtinguiſh them, call the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Turpentine:</hi> I prefer This,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98188:44"/>
(I ſay,) becauſe 'tis clear, almoſt like fair Water; whereas, That which is called the <hi>Oil,</hi> beſides that 'tis leſs Fluid, is commonly of a Yellow Colour, which does leſſen its Tranſparency, and may be compounded with ſome of the coloured Bodies to be weighed in it.</p>
                  <p>There are many Perſons, that would find it very <hi>difficult,</hi> and to whom, on moſt occaſions, 'twill not be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to know the determinate Proportion in Gravity, between <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and the Solid that is weighed in it; and to diſcover, by the help of that Gravity, what the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy propoſed would weigh in Water, in caſe it could be kept for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent time in that <hi>Medium,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any part of it diſſolved therein. And therefore, <hi>Tho',</hi> if you deſire it, I ſhall, God permitting, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the Method of performing this Task (which, you know, requires more Calculation, than every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reader is able to go thorow with) to the end of this Tract: <hi>Yet,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98188:44"/>
for the preſent it may perhaps be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as well as fit, that I give you notice, that thoſe, that have not Skill enough to determine, by the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks, the Proportion between ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Solids, and the Liquor they are weighed in, may yet be aſſiſted by what we have delivered about <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> to make a not unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eſtimate, What is the ſpecifick Gravity of divers Bodies, in reference to others of the ſame, or a differing, <hi>Species</hi>; and by that means, to make a probable Gueſs, Whether or no it be rightly Conditioned; if he be but provided with one piece of the Body, which he knows to be Genuine or well qualified. For This may ſerve him as a Standard, whereby to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine other Bodies of the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, that he may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Purchaſe, or to Sell, or to Imploy. As, ſuppoſe a Trades-man be to buy a parcel of Sublimate, he may take an Ounce, for inſtance, or half an Ounce of ſome of That he knows to be good or rightly made: Then having

                  <p>BEfore I go off from this Subject, 'tis fit that I give you notice, that the Hydroſtaticks may ſupply us with another Way of Eſtimating the intenſive Gravity of Bodies, Solid or Fluid, that may on ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be of good uſe. The Way I mean is this; we take a ſolid Body more than heavy enough to ſink in Water, and carefully obſerve, once for all, its Weight in the Air; then we weigh the ſelf ſame Solid, firſt in One of the Liquors we would examine, and then in another; and ſo onwards, if there be more than two: And having noted the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Solid, and each of the Liquors, 'tis eaſie to find, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Practice elſewhere delivered, the ſpecifick Weight of each, and the Proportions betwixt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98188:46"/>
them. And in regard 'tis but One and the ſame Solid, that is compar'd to the differing Liquors; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Number be, it will not be difficult, to compare the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Gravities of thoſe Liquors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves, and to diſcover by the Weight of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> That of any of the Others that One pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>The propos'd Way having been but Summarily delivered, it will not be amiſs to ſubjoyn ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks relating to it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you intend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy but One Solid in your <hi>Examen</hi> of Liquors, 'twill be neceſſary you make Choice of ſuch an one, as hath a much greater ſpecifick Gravity, than is neceſſary to make it ſink in <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For there are ſome Liquor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that are far, perhaps twice, more ponderous than This newly named. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Body ought to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy enough to ſink in all Liquors but Quick-ſilver, (for in That, none but Gold is ponderous enough to ſink.) But if your Tryals are to be made
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98188:46"/>
upon Liquors that belong to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or Animal, Kingdom, the Body you imploy need not be near ſo ponderous; tho' it ought to be more ſo than Water, becauſe (as I found by Tryals purpoſely made) ſome Liquors, that are very Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and Volatile, are yet much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier <hi>in Specie,</hi> than Water. 'Tis not very eaſie to pitch upon ſuch a ſingle Solid, as may have all the Qualities in reference to our Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that may be deſired in it, if it be to be made uſe of for a long time. For <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beſides that, it ought not to loſe of its Weight, (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to change it,) by the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Avolation of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and that it muſt be, as was freſhly noted, of a conſiderable ſpecifick Gravity. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It ought not to be too big, or too intenſely heavy, leſt it be too heavy for a tender Ballance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire too much Liquor to inviron it. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It ought to be of ſuch a Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as not to be diſſolved, or corroded by any of the ſeveral Liquors, ſome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98188:47"/>
of which may be ſharp and pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> that 'tis to be weigh'd in; and thoſe too of differing Natures. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It ſhould alſo be of ſuch a Make, as is not eaſily lyable to be broken, or otherwiſe ſpoil'd, that it may laſt, till all the deſign'd Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, tho' many, be made with it. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and laſtly, 'tis deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it ſhould be of a natural and uniform, as to Senſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Subſtance; that the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made with it, may be eaſily enough communicated to Others, and, if they think fit, tryed over again by them; and that, if any be judged worthy, they may be tranſmitted to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Several Bodies there are, that I looked upon as more fit than moſt Others to be imploy'd about the Tryals, we are treating of. The chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of theſe were <hi>Brimſtone, Hard Wax Ivory,</hi> and <hi>White Marble.</hi> But tho each of theſe, eſpecially if fitly ſhaped, may be of uſe on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſions; yet every one wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98188:47"/>
ſome of the deſirable Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations lately mentioned. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I made much more uſe of Three other Bodies, not becauſe they were ſuch as I could Wiſh; but becauſe they were the leaſt remote from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, among thoſe I could Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe was a piece of <hi>Amber</hi> between Three and Four Drams in Weight, of an high Yellow Colour, but very Tranſparent, and of an uniform Texture and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Shape. This was judged fit to be imployed, when we were to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the lighter ſorts of Liquors, ſuch as common Water, Rain-water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wine, Brandy, rectified Spirit of Wine-Vinegar, and the Liquors drawn from it, Cydar, Beer, Ale, Urine, many Waters and Spirits deſtilled from Bodies belonging to the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and to the Animal, Kingdoms. But 'tis not proper for the more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous kind of Liquors; ſince 'twill not ſink to the Bottom, but float at the Top, not only of ſome Liquors of the Mineral Kingdom, (as will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98188:48"/>
ere long appear;) but in ſeveral Liquors afforded us by the Saline parts of Bodies belonging to the Vegetable Kingdom; as you will find within a few Pages.</p>
                  <p>The Second Body, I imployed, was a <hi>Globular</hi> Glaſs, which I cauſed to be blown at a Lamp, and to be Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically ſealed at the Neck, which was purpoſely made very ſhort, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there had been Lodged in it as much Quick-ſilver, and no more, as we gueſſed would ſerve to ſink it in any Liquor, except Quick-ſilver; This, by reaſon of its great Bulk, in reference to its Weight, was fit to diſcover Differences in Weight, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute enough between the Liquors 'twas weighed in; and 'twas out of Danger of being corroded, even by ſharp <hi>Menſtruums</hi>; and therefore, on divers occaſions, I preferred this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to any of the other Two; but 'tis diſadvantag'd by theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, <hi>that</hi> 'tis difficult to be made, or procured, <hi>that</hi> 'tis hard to be preſerved, being very eaſie to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98188:48"/>
be broken, and <hi>that</hi> partly on this Account, and partly on Others, it can ſcarce be a fit Standard in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſuch Obſervations, as are to be communicated to Others, and tranſmitted to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore for Experiments that are to be imparted &amp; recorded, I made uſe of a Solid, which <hi>tho'</hi> heavier <hi>in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> than was neceſſary to inable one to compare together the lighter ſorts of Liquors, and to diſcover their minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diſparities in point of Weight, is yet a natural Standard not ſubject to be broken without groſs Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor to be diſſolved, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded by the Liquors, 'twas to be immerſt in, however of various Kinds, and very ſharp, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough to ſink in all of them, except Quick-ſilver, and yet not near ſo ponderous, as the lighteſt Metals, or many Metalline Bodies; this Solid I ſpeak of is Rock Chryſtal, which I formerly repreſented, as for its Purity, Homogeneity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fit to afford a Meaſure, to which other
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98188:49"/>
Bodies may be compar'd in Weight, and by that means among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And of this pure Concrete, we imployed an almoſt compleat Globe, (weighing in the Air ℥ij <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs Grains 3,) ſave that it had in one part of it two ſmall Holes near one another, and eaſily ſtopt up with hard Wax, after there had been put through them an Horſe-hair, by whoſe means the Ball was eaſily faſtened to the Scale from whence 'twas to hang in the Water. The bigneſs of this <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bular</hi> Body made it the more fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the leſſer Differences between Liquors in point of intenſive Gravity. But becauſe we may have oftentimes occaſion to know the Weight of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, of which, by reaſon of their Preciouſneſs, or Rarity, we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but ſmall Quantities, as it frequently happens, if we be to try the Weight of Chymical Oyls, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Eſſences, &amp;c. We thought fit, for ſuch Liquors, to provide a piece of Chryſtal, ſuch as Nature had framed it, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Hexagonal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98188:49"/>
Priſme,</hi> with a kind of Pyramide at the end, which is oppoſite to the extream, at which 'twas broken off from the Body, it grew on. For this clear and finely ſhaped Chryſtal, (or, what is very near of kin to it, white <hi>Amethyſt</hi>) by reaſon of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Figure, might be commodiouſly weigh'd in ſo ſlender a Cylindrical Glaſs, as required but a ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Liquor to cover and ſurround a conveniently ſhap'd Body, that weighed, in the Air, but half an Ounce and ſixteen Grains. And to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obſervations, made with theſe two Bodies of Medicinal and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, (for there are ſeveral of theſe Tryals, that belong not to this Tract) the more uſeful to Experimenters, I ſhall here deſire you to take notice once for all, that the Ball of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal was to Water of the ſame Bulk, as 2 57/100 to 1 or thereabouts; and the Priſmatical Oblong piece of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal was to a Quantity of the ſame Liquor, equal to it in Magnitude, as 2 66/100 to 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98188:50"/>I have the more particularly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Way of exploring the Gravity of ſeveral Liquors with one Solid, becauſe there may be made of it a couple of Applications, that may, on ſeveral occaſions, be of uſe, not only to Chymiſts, Phyſicians and Apothecaries, but to divers other Experimenters, that are not of either of their Profeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Applications do, I confeſs, belong to another Paper, (<hi>viz.</hi> an Eſſay about ſome Uſes of Chymiſtry improved) that was written divers years ago. But ſince, by reaſon of the loſs of divers Leaves of it, I know not <hi>whether,</hi> much leſs <hi>when,</hi> 'twill come abroad, I ſhall at preſent borrow ſome few things of it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my preſent Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the piece of clear <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> formerly mentioned, or ſome ſuch convenient Body, that is not too little, nor <hi>in Specie,</hi> too heavy, may ſerve the Chymiſt, Apothecary, and others, to make probable Gueſſes of the Degree of Spirituoſity, or of Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98188:50"/>
that is to be found in many Liquors belonging to the Vegetable, or the Animal, Kingdom; which may be done with far leſs Error by this Way, than by thoſe uncertain Signs, on which the common Ways of gueſſing are wont to be grounded. For having once provided a Liquor, by Compariſon whereto One may ſafely make Eſtimates of Others of the ſame Kind, or Denomination, 'twill be eaſie, by obſerving the differing Weights of the <hi>Amber</hi> in ſeveral Liquors to judge of the Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any of them in its Kind; for, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> That is the thinneſt, or abounds moſt in Spirituous parts, where the Solid weighs more than in the Other, as for inſtance, The <hi>Amber</hi> we imployed, that in Water weighed 6 ¾ Grains, in common Red French Wine weighed 8 ½ Grains, in common Brandy of a pretty good ſort, ſuch as that of <hi>Nantz</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Grains. The ſame Way one may imploy, to judge of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98188:51"/>
the Strength of Spirits of Vinegar, <hi>Acetum Radicatum, &amp;c.</hi> but with a great difference in the Application. For it may paſs for a general Rule, That, 'tis probable, that, of Liquors deſtilled from Wine, Cydar, Ale, and other fermented Liquors, the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Body (if I may ſo call it) weighs more or leſs, according as the Liquor 'tis weighed in, is more or leſs Spirituous; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in <hi>Acid</hi> Spirits and Liquors, the leſs the Solid weighs, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger One may repute that Liquor to be: That greater Decrement of Weight proceeding uſually from the greater Proportion, it contains, of Salts that are not Volatile.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not here pretermit one Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the Way newly propoſed, that may, in tract of time, ſave you ſome Money, and, at leaſt, will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you to Husband better, than in the vulgar Method you can, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that you may have but ſmall Quantities of, or that are worthy to be preſerved. For, you know, 'tis
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98188:51"/>
uſual with many Chymiſts, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that are more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect than others, to try the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Spirit of Wine, or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or other Spirits drawn from fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Liquors, by ſetting Fire to a ſpoonful of the Spirit to be examin'd, in order to ſee, how much of it is totally inflammable, and how great, or little, a Portion of Phlegm will be left behind. But, not here to mention the Scruples I propoſe in another Paper, about this Way of trying Ardent Spirits, I ſhall now only take notice, that, by the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recited Way, you loſe or ſpoil all that you try, and the better the Spirit is, the greater is your Loſs, whereas by the Hydroſtatical Way, the Liquor is examined without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis now fit to add, that, by the help of the foregoing Obſervations, One may alſo make Eſtimates of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors</hi> of the ſame kind <hi>not deſtilled,</hi> whether fermented or not fermented; as ſeveral Sorts of Beer, or of Ale, or of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98188:52"/>
Cydar, or of Juices of Apples, or of Pears, newly preſt out. And the ſame Hydroſtatical Solid may be imployed, to compare with one another, in point of intenſive Weight, Liquors of differing kinds, as Wine, Beer, Ale, Meads, Cydar, Perry, Verjuice, expreſt Oyls, Eſſential Oyls of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, in caſe the Liquors to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed be very ponderous, <hi>Amber</hi> will not be a fit Solid to be examined about them; for I have found by Tryal, (what one would ſcarce ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) not only that it would ſwim or float, in divers Liquors made by Solution of Salts, whether in the moiſt Air, or even in Water, ſuch as Oil of <hi>Tartar per Deliquium,</hi> Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in as little Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as may be, and Solution of the Salt of Pot-aſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſome deſtilled Liquors would not ſuffer my pellucid <hi>Amber</hi> to ſink to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as I found by Tryal made with Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> with Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and even with good Spirit of <hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98188:52"/>Beſides, there may be another Uſe made of our Hydroſtatical Solid, which may, on divers occaſions, be <hi>as</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Experimenters in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, by aſſiſting them to proportion, to their purpoſes, the Strength of the <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> and other Liquors, they are to imploy; <hi>as</hi> the former uſe is to Deſtillers and Apothecaries, for diſcovering the Strength of the already prepared Liquors, that they would examine. For there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Experiments, that either do not ſucceed, or, at leaſt, do not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo well, unleſs the <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> or other Liquors, imployed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, be of a determinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Strength, (which is uſually knowable by a certain Degree of intenſive Weight.) This will be the more eaſily granted, if (as I have elſewhere ſhewn) the Strength and Spirituoſity even of ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, whoſe chief Virtue and Uſe is to be good Solvents, may yet be unfit to diſſolve, as well becauſe their Strength exceeds a certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98188:53"/>
as becauſe, by their Weakneſs, they fall ſhort of it; Of this, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I gave an Inſtance in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> whoſe ſtrength, as it's Name intimates, is reckon'd the beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it can have; for I found, that if it were rectified ſo much as to make it as ſtrong, as we could, or but ſomewhat leſs ſtrong than that, it would not diſſolve Silver, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be weakened by an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water; and I found, that the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> tho' it were not much rectified, would not near ſo well diſſolve the Filings or Raſpings of crude Lead, when 'twas moderately ſtrong and fit to diſſolve Silver, as when 'twas allayed with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quantity of Water, eſpecially if afforded by Rain, or by Deſtillation. I ſhall add, that, in making Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from many vegetable Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for Medicinal Uſes, Chymiſts themſelves may fall into a Miſtake, when they affect to employ their moſt rectified Spirit of Wine, as the beſt <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for their purpoſe:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98188:53"/>
For the Medicinal Virtue of not a few ſuch Bodies does not reſide only in what Chymiſts call their <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and might perhaps more properly be called the Reſinous Part, which indeed is beſt diſſolved by ſuch Spirit of Wine, as is carefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd; but alſo in a more Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and, partly perhaps, almoſt Mucilaginous Subſtance, for whoſe Extraction a moderately Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit is more proper; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Aqueous Portion, that is mingled with the inflammable One; ſince we ſee, that ſome Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bodies, as <hi>Gum Arabick, Gum Tragacanth,</hi> &amp;c. are not diſpoſed to be diſſolved by the beſt rectified Spirit of Wine, as they are by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Liquors, as Water, weak Spirit of Wine, &amp;c. and ſome, tho' diſſoluble in both kinds of <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi> are yet leſs eaſily ſo in ſtrong Spirit of Wine, than in wateriſh <hi>Menſtruums</hi>; as may be obſerved particularly in <hi>Myrrh</hi>; for other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances applicable to theſe Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98188:54"/>
belong to another Paper.</p>
                  <p>And what has been now ſaid, may ſerve to perſuade you, that it may be of good uſe, on divers Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to take Notice of the Degree of Strength of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or other Liquor, we employ about this or that nice Experiment; that when we have occaſion to reiterate it to the ſame Purpoſe only, we may be able to bring the Liquor we make uſe of to the ſame Degree of Strength with That, which we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly emyloyed, and by which the deſign'd Effect was produced. But, in Experiments that ſhould be very Critically made, 'twill not be amiſs to bear in mind this Caution, that if the Liquor be very ponderous <hi>in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> as <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar per del quium,</hi> 'twill be fit to put ſomething into the Scale, from which the Solid hangs, to make Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for that part of the Hair that is immerſed, ſince Horſe-hair not being of the ſame Specifick Gravity with this Liquor, (tho' it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed

to be ſo with common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is to be conſidered, as a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lighter Body, capable of buoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Solid a little; and therefore its Comparative Levity ſhould be compenſated.</p>

                  <p>BEſides the Way, we come from diſcourſing of, there is indeed another Way, which we have, on divers Occaſions, found uſeful, to compare different Liquors, that are of the ſame Magnitude, in point of Weight. This is done by ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filling a Vial greater, or ſmaller, furniſhed with a pretty long and ſlender Cylindrical Stem, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtable Mark made near the Top, with the ſeveral Liquors to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together in point of Gravity.</p>
                  <p>But this Way I muſt here do no more than name, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſpeak of it in a convenient
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98188:55"/>
place of another Paper, as becauſe 'tis not Hydroſtatical. But there is alſo another Way to diſcover, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, Two, or more, Liquors propoſed differ in Specifick Weight, and to make ſome, not groundleſs, Eſtimate of their Differences. This is done by a hollow Cylinder of Braſs, or other Metal, made ſomewhat hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy at the bottom to make it ſwim upright, that ſinks more, or leſs in ſeveral Liquors, as they are lighter, or heavier, one than another. But the diligent <hi>Merſennus</hi> himſelf, who propoſes this Way, confeſſes it to be very difficult to make ſure Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations by it. To which, I ſhall therefore add but this, that, being a Metal, it may be corroded by Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> and if it be of Braſs, or Copper, it may be wrought upon or injur'd by Urinous <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Merſennus</hi> ſaid of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, may be applied to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' differing from it, both in Shape and Matter. For 'tis made of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98188:55"/>
two Glaſs Bubbles, and a very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Stem, which is Hermetically Sealed with a Ballaſt in the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of Quick-ſilver, to keep it ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when partly immerſt in Liquors, in which this Inſtrument, like the Metalline Cylinder, ſinks deeper in lighter Liquors, than in heavier, in a meaſure ſomewhat anſwerable to their Differences in Gravity. But, tho' I have, on ſeveral occaſions, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed theſe Inſtruments, and found them not unuſeful, when I did not confine my ſelf to One, or Two, but made uſe of ſeveral of different Sizes, according to the various Liquors, I was to examine; yet what you may elſewhere find about this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, diſpenſes me from ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more of it in this place, than that, for ſome of the ends aimed at in this Chapter, it is inferior to the Way of examining Liquors by the help of the Ballance.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another Way, that <hi>is</hi> Hydroſtatical, propoſed by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus,</hi> of weighing of Liquors in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98188:56"/>
Water, and it is This; He bids you take a Glaſs Vial, to which, being firſt weighed in Air, and then in Water, you are to adjuſt a Stopple of Wax, or Cork, that will fit it exactly. This done, you are to fill the Vial with the Liquor you would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſo that no Air be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it, and the Stopple. The Veſſel thus filled, you are to weigh in Water, and ſubſtract from its Weight there, the formerly noted Weight of the Glaſs it ſelf in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo That of the Stopple; which done, the remains will give the Weight of the Liquor propoſed in Water. This Method I lately chanced to find propounded by (the Writer newly nam'd) the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Merſennus</hi> in his <hi>Hydraulicks</hi>; but, I remember not, that he affirms himſelf to have made uſe of it; And tho' it may be ſerviceable on ſome occaſions, yet, I fear, it will be troubleſome in Practice. For, (to omit ſome inconvenient Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) ordinary Vials, capable of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98188:56"/>
containing a competent Quantity of Liquor, are, uſually, too heavy to be imployed with tender Ballances; and common Stopples (ſuch as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus</hi> may be well ſuppoſed to have imployed) will be ſubject to divers inconveniencies; as, that they may be penetrated by ſome Liquors, and corroded by others, and if they be made of Cork, or of common Wax, or any other Subſtance lighter, <hi>in Specie,</hi> than Water, 'twill not be eaſie to find its ſpecifick Gravity; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince Evaporation, and other Accidents make this it ſelf vary; and whatever Matter, Vegetable or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, it be made of, the Veſſel will coſt you two Operations, One to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Weight of the <hi>Veſſel</hi> in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Other that of the <hi>Stopple,</hi> (at that time) which is troubleſome. Wherefore, when I met with this Way in the ingenious <hi>Merſennus,</hi> it ſeemed to me more inconvenient, than One, that, I remember, I had formerly thought of, and which I have ſometimes put in Practice, by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98188:57"/>
chuſing a Vial not too large, and of a round Figure, that being the moſt capacious under ſuch a Superficies, and, inſtead of other Stopples, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with one of (the like) Glaſs, carefully ground to the Neck of it. For, by this means, the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Stopple lighter than Water were avoided, nor would the Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alter its ſpecifick Gravity, either by Imbibition, or Evaporation, nor would it be penetrated by the moſt ſubtil Spirits, nor corroded by the moſt fretting Ones. To which may be added, becauſe, in ſome Caſes, it may be conſiderable, that a Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopple, as it will not be wrought on by the Liquor contained in the Vial, ſo it will not communicate any Tincture, or extraneous Quality, to the Liquor, which cannot be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Stopple of Cork or Wax, in reference to ſome Subtil and very Corroſive, or otherwiſe very penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Liquors, this Hydroſtatical Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel (as for diſtinction ſake I call it) being together with its Stopple care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98188:57"/>
weighed, Firſt in Air, and then in Water, (that the Gravity of the whole Inſtrument in that Liquor may be ſetled once for all) we fill'd it exactly with the Liquor to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and ſo proceeded, as we if were to weigh Quck-ſilver according to the Manner formerly declared in the Eigth Chapter. The Weight of the given Liquor in Water being thus obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, its Proportion in Weight to Water of the ſame Bulk may be eaſily diſcovered by the Way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered in the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (or the Tenth Chapter.) This way of examining Liquors may, on ſome occaſions, do good Service, and I did the rather, now and then, make uſe of it, becauſe 'tis applicable to all kind of Liquors, whether heavier <hi>in Specie</hi> than Water, or lighter.</p>
                  <p>If you lay aſide the Stopple, the round Ball it ſelf may be made uſe of, on ſeveral Occaſions, inſtead of that Hydroſtatical Bucket, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned; for the weighing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98188:58"/>
of Quck-ſilver, and divers heavy Powders; eſpecially if they be Courſe Ones. But if the Inſtrument be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaped, and not too heavy, there may belong to it a greater Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency than. This. For when you have, and are willing to ſpare, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor enough to inviron the little Bottle, it may be uſefully ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Hydroſtatical Bubble, with Quick-ſilver incloſed, that I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended. For, by reaſon of its exact Stopple, it has no need of an Hermetick Seal, (which is not eaſie to be be made or procured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and 'tis far leſs Subject to be broken, than a Bubble. And yet that which I moſt made uſe of, (and which weighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ℥i <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

'twas eaſie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98188:58"/>
to make it fit to be weighed in them alſo; by putting into it a Quantity of Quick-ſilver (or ſome other fit Body) of a determinate Weight, as two, three or four Drams, before we ſtopped it: Which Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, when the Operation is over, may, if it be Quick-ſilver, be eaſily taken totally out, and kept apart for the like Uſes: and the empty Bottle, and Stopple, may thereby become fit again, to be weighed in Water and lighter Liquors.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Glaſſes, for ſize, ſhape, and weight, fit for Ballances, tender enough, and furniſht with Glaſs Stopples exactly fitted to them, are very difficult to procure; and the Way it ſelf is ſubject to ſome of the Inconveniencies, that we imputed to other Ways not long ſince mentioned: it ſeems, that, generally ſpeaking,<note place="margin">See the Chapter.</note> this Way of finding the Weight of Liquors in Water, is Inferiour for common uſe, to thoſe more ſimple Ones, that we formerly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

And <hi>tho'</hi> by the Inſtances we lately had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to propoſe in ſome of the Chapters preceding This, divers things referable to this Uſe, are ſet down already; <hi>Yet</hi> I ſhould not content my Self, (as I now muſt do) to point at the chief <hi>Heads</hi> or <hi>Kinds</hi> of things referable to it; if, on a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is more fertile, than it ſeems,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98188:59"/>
want of leiſure did not reſtrain me from deſcending to treat of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances, that belong to them.</p>
                  <p>Among the Services then, that the Hydroſtaticks may do a ſagacious Phyſician, I muſt not omit One, tho' it has not hitherto, that I know of, been propounded by any Author. And, I hope, you will not think it improper to be taken notice of here, tho' it do not regard <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Medica,</hi> but is applicable (as I may elſewhere relate that I made it) to divers Subjects, that are refera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to other Parts of Phyſiology: Since divers Bodies, that ſeem not ſo directly to regard the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> as 'tis uſually repoſited in the Shops of Drugſters, have been, in <hi>ſome times and places,</hi> and may deſervedly be <hi>now</hi> made to afford Matter for Remedies, to a free and ingenious Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Liquors, whoſe ſpecifick Gravity it may be uſeful to know, not only, as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98188:60"/>
it may help to diſtinguiſh Genuine, or well conditioned Ones, from Them that are not ſo, but for other good Purpoſes too.</p>
                  <p>Inſtances of this kind may be afforded by the Juices of Herbs and Fruits; where (according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given in the laſt Chapter) we firſt weigh a determinate Quantity, as an Ounce, or ſo many Drams, in our Hydroſtatical Jar, or Bucket; and putting ſome Oil of <hi>Turpentine</hi> on it, we ſink it warily into that Liquor; whoſe ſpecifick Gravity in reference to refined Silver, clear Rock Chryſtal, (or ſome other Body, if we know it to be as pure) has been <hi>carefully</hi> found out and regiſtred: For, by this means, (as we have lately manifeſted) ſubſtituting this Oil for common Water, we may diſcover the ſpecifick Gravity of Liquors, not to be weighed in Water, becauſe they mingle with it. And thus we may find, not only the difference in Ponderoſity between the Juices of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98188:60"/>
Plants of differing kinds, as of Wormwood and Roſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the ſubordinate <hi>Species</hi> of the ſame <hi>Genus,</hi> as of <hi>Abſynthium Vulgare, Ponticum, Romanum,</hi> &amp;c. and Roſes <hi>White, Red, Damask, Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> &amp;c. but we may on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions obſerve, whether, and, if at all, how far, the keeping of a Juice for ſome time, more or leſs, or the Fermentation of it, or the Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will alter its ſpecifick Gravity. There are alſo other Liquids us'd by Phyſicians, and not ponderable in Water, that may be by this Way examin'd, as Honey, Vinegar, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by the ſame Way may be alſo diſcovered and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the ſpecifick Weight of the Juices of Fruits of different kinds, as of Grapes, Apples, Pears, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> of ſubordinate <hi>Species</hi> belonging to the ſame <hi>Genus,</hi> as the newly expreſſed Juices, that make Sacks, French-wines, Rheniſh-wines, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> thoſe Liquors, that are preſſed out of ſeveral ſorts of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98188:61"/>
Apples, as Pippins, Pear-mains, John-Apples, Queen-Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in divers of theſe, a Perſon that is curious enough, may probably, by the Method we have been propoſing, be enabled to take Notice of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences produced in the ſpecifick Gravity (whoſe Changes are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompanied with thoſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in the ſeveral ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive States, wherein the Liquors may be found at different times; as (not to mention the Juice of unripe Grapes, <hi>viz. Verjuice</hi>) the Juice of ripe Grapes is in very differing States, <hi>when</hi> 'tis newly preſſed out; <hi>when</hi> it begins to ferment; <hi>when</hi> 'tis yet but New Wine; <hi>when</hi> it has attain'd its full Maturity and Perfection; <hi>when</hi> it begins to degenerate into Ropy, prick'd Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely changed into Vinegar, or elſe into <hi>Vappa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from you, That in this kind of Experiments, to make uſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully of the Hydroſtatical Bucket
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98188:61"/>
is a Task difficult enough, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that a few Tryals will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. And therefore, tho' I would not diſcourage the Skilful, yet for thoſe that do not find themſelves dextrous at making Experiments, I think it adviſeable to imploy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Bucket, Amber, or ſome other convenient Hydroſtatical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, or rather (which is better) a Glaſs-bottle and Stopple, ſuch as We formerly deſcribed; but as large, as may well be imploy'd without over-loading, or injuring, the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>

                  <p>AS I thought 'twas fit to give the foregoing Advertiſement, by way of Caution, in the Caſes that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned it; ſo having conſidered the Nature and Scope of the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Experiments in General, that belong to this Eſſay; I ſhall venture
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98188:62"/>
to add for the Encouragement of thoſe, that are better furniſhed with inquiſitive Minds, than with nice Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances; that <hi>tho'</hi> in divers Tryals, eſpecially Thoſe that are made about precious things, as Gold, Pearls, Diamonds and other Gems; there is no relying upon any, but very Good and tender Ballances; <hi>Yet,</hi> on many other occaſions, 'tis not neceſſary, tho' it be deſirable, that the Scales, we employ, ſhould be extraordinary Good. And this for two Reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe many Hydroſtatical Experiments are ſuch, that a little Variation from the exact Proportion of the Solid to the Liquor, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bodies of the ſame Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, can lead us into no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Error; or, at leaſt, not defeat the Experimenters main Deſign; as, with a Ballance that is not nice, One may ſufficiently diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an human <hi>Calculus,</hi> and a Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or other ordinary Stone; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Courſe and Fine, native <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar</hi>: And between a true Guinea,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98188:62"/>
or other piece of coyned Gold, that is not very ſmall, and a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit One, of Braſs, or any ſuch mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho' never ſo finely guilt.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe, <hi>as</hi> there are few Phyſical Experiments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mathematical Preciſeneſs is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and fewer wherein 'tis to be expected; <hi>So</hi> in many Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tryals, 'tis very probable, that the difference of Bodies of the ſame kind, or Denomination, flowing from their Compoſitions, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Textures, will make a diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, tho' but ſmall, difference in their ſpecifick Gravity: As, in Rock-Chryſtal it ſelf, we have found ſome pieces to be to Water, as 2 1/10, or a little more, to One; and others, to be to the ſame Liquor, as Two and Six, or between Six and Seven Tenths to One. And therefore, how exact ſoever the Ballance be, there muſt be ſome Allowance made for the diverſity, that may be found in the Bodies themſelves, that are exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which diverſity may perhaps
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98188:63"/>
produce, at leaſt, as great a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Proportions we ſeek for, as needs to be expected from a ſmall Difference of tenderneſs, in the Ballances we imploy. And indeed, neither One of thoſe Differences, nor the Other, (nor perhaps Both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) is wont to be ſo conſiderable, as to challenge much regard in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Experiments; or at leaſt, as to hinder it to be true, that, on moſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Hydroſtatical Way of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the ſpecifick Weight of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is preferable by far to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way of doing it, that has been Practiſed.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to the remaining part of this Eſſay, it will be worth while to obviate an Objection, that I foreſee may be made by Critical Naturaliſts, againſt the Method hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deliver'd, of finding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in Weight, betwixt a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body, and Water of the ſame Bulk. For it ſpeciouſly may, and probably will, be objected, that, by this Method, we cannot diſcover
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98188:63"/>
the Proportion between a Solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Water in General; but only betwixt the propoſed Body, and the particular Water 'tis weighed in; becauſe there may be a great Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between Liquors that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that deſervedly, common Water. And ſome Travellers tell us from the Preſs, that the Water of an Eaſtern River, which, if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not, is <hi>Ganges,</hi> is by a Fifth part lighter than our Water.</p>
                  <p>But to this plauſible Objection, I have Two things to Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> having had, upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions, the Opportunity, as well as Curioſity, to examine the Weight of divers Waters, ſome of them taken up in Places very diſtant from one another; I found the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between their ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities far leſs, than almoſt any Body would expect. And if I be not much deceived by my Memory, (which I muſt have recourſe to, becauſe I have not by me the Notes I took of thoſe Tryals) the difference between
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98188:64"/>
VVaters, where One would expect a notable Diſparity, was but about the Thouſandth part (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perchance very far leſs) of the VVeight of either. Nor did I find any Difference conſiderable, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Queſtion, between the VVeight of divers VVaters of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring kinds, as Spring-water, River-water, Rain-water, and Snow-water, tho' this laſt were ſomewhat lighter, than any of the reſt. And having had the Curioſity to procure ſome VVater brought into <hi>England,</hi> if I much miſ-remember not, from the River <hi>Ganges</hi> it ſelf; I found it very little, if at all lighter, than ſome of our common VVaters.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall repreſent in the <hi>Second</hi> place, that I do not pretend, (and indeed 'tis not neceſſary) that the Proportion, obtainable by our Method, ſhould have a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preciſeneſs. For in Experiments where we are to deal with groſs Matter, and to imploy about it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Inſtruments; 'tis ſufficient to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98188:64"/>
have a Phyſical, and almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to obtain (unleſs ſometimes by Accident) a Mathematical Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as they will ſcarce deny, that have, as I have done, conſidered, and made Tryal of the Difficulties, that oppoſe the Attainment of ſuch a Preciſeneſs.</p>

'Tis known, that the Writers of the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> are wont to ſet down the Bigneſs of the Bodies they deſcribe, by very uncertain Gueſſes; and thoſe that, to be more accurate, aſſign them determinate Meaſures, are wont to do it, by ſaying, that ſuch a Fruit, or other Body, is, for Example, an Inch, or two Inches, or half a Foot long; and half an Inch, or a whole Inch, or two Inches and an half, in breadth. But 'tis obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thoſe that are not great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Mathematicks, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Way of deſcribing Bodies, there may be, by reaſon of the great Variety of Figures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially irregular Ones, they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, a very great Diſparity of Magnitude, or Bulk, in Bodies, to each of which, the ſame Length and Breadth may belong or be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould here be able to preſent you an Hydroſtatical Way of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Bulk of Bodies, both much nearer the Truth, than that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98188:66"/>
newly recited, and grounded as well on Experiments as Mathematicks; if among other Papers, I had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately loſt One, that I wrote many years ago, about <hi>the meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Solids, by the help of Liquors.</hi> But tho' I cannot, out of my Memory, recover the <hi>Theoretical</hi> part of that Writing, (whoſe Loſs I regret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been examined by One of the exacteſt, as well as famouſeſt, Mathematicians of our Age, whom I invited to be preſent at the chief Experiments) yet, I think, I can call to mind as much of the <hi>Practical</hi> Applications of it, as may ſuffice for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The ground of the Way, I am about to propoſe to you, will be eaſily underſtood by the following, tho' but ſhort, Account.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98188:66"/>
One, according to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which is ſaid to differ very little from the correſpondent One of the old <hi>Romans.</hi> Theſe Cubes were carefully weighed in truſty Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Firſt, in the Air, and then in common Water. And tho' I found ſome little (and but little) difference, between the Products of the Tryals; yet that Difference being no more than might reaſonably be expected from the ſcarce avoidable Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, even of good Artiſts and their Tools; We concluded, that One might, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Error, take a <hi>Medium</hi> (as they ſpeak,) between theſe Products, and allow even to this <hi>Medium,</hi> a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſome Grains; ſince that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude will not amount to the Sixtieth part of the Weight of a Cubical Inch of Water. Since therefore ſome of our Tryals inclin'd us to judge, that about Two hundred and ſixty; and ſome others to think, that about Two hundred fifty two; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again, that about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98188:67"/>
fifty ſix, came neareſt to the true Weight of a Cubical Inch of Water; we thought our ſelves at liberty to make uſe of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ſhould appear moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Practice, by reaſon of its Diviſions and Subdiviſions into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquote</hi> Parts; Eſpecially if the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be examined were not great; ſince, in that Caſe, Two or three Grains more or leſs would not be conſiderable, eſpecially in a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Experiment, where Geometrical exactneſs is not to be expected, nor indeed required; and a far leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Eſtimate will be leſs unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, than can with any certainty be made by the formerly mentioned Way of judging, by the Length, Breadth, and Depth (or Thickneſs) of the Body propoſed.</p>
                     <p>I made the leſs Scruple to pitch upon the laſt of the Three foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Numbers of Grains, <hi>not only,</hi> becauſe it affords many <hi>Aliquote</hi> parts for a Number that is no greater, ſince barely by a ſucceſſive Biparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98188:67"/>
it affords Seven ſuch Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> 128.64.32.16.8.4. and 2; <hi>But,</hi> becauſe I was incouraged by an Experiment differing from thoſe already mentioned. For, having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be purpoſely made by a good Artiſt, an hollow Cube of Braſs, whoſe Cavity was fitted to contain a juſt Cubical Inch of Matter; (either Solid or Liquid,) we put it into one Scale of a tender Ballance, with a juſt Counterpoize in the other, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it there, as Horizontally as we could. Then we warily put into it, little by little, as much common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it would contain, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overflowing, or having its Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, manifeſtly turgid; putting alſo from time to time in the oppoſite Scale, ſmall Weights to keep it from ſwerving too much at once from an <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> And tho' it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult in Practice, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with certainty, when the Veſſel is ſo exactly filled, that a Drop, or even Two, or Three drops, more or leſs, cannot be added, or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98188:68"/>
without being obſervable by the Eye; <hi>Yet,</hi> for this very Reaſon, we thought our Experiment agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to our Suppoſition, when we found, that by ſo light an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Weight of the Water, when the Scales were heedfully Counterpoized, amounted to near about Two hundred fifty ſix Grains, which Number we ſhall therefore hereafter imploy, as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Weight of a Cubical Inch of Water.</p>
                     <p>And now to apply the paſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to our preſent Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe, for Example, that a Solid, heavier <hi>in Specie</hi> than Water, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been weighed firſt in the Air, be found to loſe of its Weight in the Water ℥<hi>ſs</hi> Sixteen Grains, that is, Two hundred fifty ſix Grains, I ſay, that the Dimenſions of this Solid, if it were of a Cubical ſhape, would make it equal to a Cubical Inch: So that, (to expreſs the thing yet more clearly,) if the given Body be ſuppoſed to be an eaſily fuſible
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98188:68"/>
Metal, as Tin, or Lead; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melted to be warily poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hollow Cube formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and ſuffered to cool, it would juſt fill it and no more; and conſequently be a Cube of Metal; whoſe Length, Breadth and Depth are equal to one another, and each of them to an Inch. For, as 'tis a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>Theorem</hi> in Hydroſtaticks; demonſtrated Mathematically by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes,</hi> and elſe where Phyſically by me; that <hi>a ſinking Solid weighs leſſe in Water than in Air, by the Weight of as much Water as is equal to the Solid in Bulk</hi>; and ſince we have lately ſhewn by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that a Cubical Inch of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weighs ℥<hi>ſs.</hi> 16.) Grains, that is, 256 Grains; it will follow, that when the Decrement of a Bodies weight in Water is found to be 256 Grains, the Solid content of that Body is a Cubical Inch: Since an <hi>Aqueous</hi> Body weighing 256 Grains is equal in Magnitude, as well to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98188:69"/>
the Solid propounded, as to a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Inch of Water. And here it may prevent a Scruple, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, to make Bodies equal in Magnitude, it is not at all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they ſhould be of the ſame Weight, or of the ſame Matter; as is evident in Bullets of Copper, Tin and Gold, caſt ſeparately and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly in the ſame Mould. For tho' they be equal in Bulk; yet the Bullet of Copper will be much, heavier than that of Tin; and the Bullet of pure Gold will be more than twice as heavy, as that of Copper. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore you meet with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, ponderous enough to ſink in Water, that being weighed in that Liquor loſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

happen) loſe of its Weight in the Water leſs than 256 Grains; you may conclude its Bulk to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably leſs than a Cubical Inch. And ſuch is the Conveniency of the Number we have pitch'd upon, which abounds in <hi>Aliquote</hi> parts; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 32 Grains, that the Solid loſes of its Weight in the Water, anſwers to an Eighth (that is, half a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) of an Inch in the Bulk of the Body: as, if the Decrement be 128 Grains, the Solid will be half a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Inch; and if it be but 64 Grains, 'twill be but a quarter of a Cubick Inch; and ſo if it be 160 Grains, 'twill be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To begin with the Firſt ſort of Bodies: 'Tis known to Hydroſtatici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that, according to a <hi>Theorem</hi> of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the weight of a Body belonging to that kind, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the weight of the Water, that is equal, in Magnitude, to that part of the Body, that is immerſt in that Liquor, when the Solid floats freely upon it; as, if a <hi>Paralelipipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or a <hi>Cylinder,</hi> of Wood, 12 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, being placed upon Water, ſhould reſt there, when a 12th part of it lyes beneath the Surface of the Liquor; in this caſe, the Weight of the Water, equal in Bulk to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt 12th part, would be equal to the weight of the whole wooden Body.

In the Firſt ſtep of this, tho' not in the Second, we may be helped by the induſtrious <hi>Merſennus</hi>: Who proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly borrowed his Way of <hi>Ghetal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> from whoſe <hi>Promotus Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> he profeſſedly borrows many things.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe, that, on this occaſion, <hi>Merſennus,</hi> affecting Brevity, hath made himſelf obſcure; ſo that what
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98188:71"/>
he writes can ſcarce be underſtood, but by Mathematical Peruſers; I ſhall, for the ſake of another ſort of Readers, deliver the propounded Method, tho' not in ſo few words, yet more clearly, and orderly: <hi>Firſt</hi> then, you ſhall weigh in the Air, the Body, (lighter than Water) to be examined: <hi>Secondly,</hi> you ſhall take a Place of Lead capable of making this Body ſink with its ſelf in Water, and of ſome Weight not incumbred with Fractions, as juſt a Dram, half an Ounce, an Ounce, &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you muſt weigh this Plate in Water, and by ſubſtracting its Weight in this Liquor, from what it weigh'd in the Air, you muſt obtain a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which will give the weight of as much Water, as is equal in Bulk to the immerſed Lead. This, for diſtinctions ſake, may be called, <hi>The ſpecifick Weight of the Lead in Water. Fourthly,</hi> you muſt tye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (which you may beſt do by One or more Horſe-hairs,) the Plate of Lead, and the lighter Body, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98188:72"/>
note the Weight of the Aggregate; which, as you know, is nothing but the Sum of the reſpective Weights of the lighter, and of the heavier, Body. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> you muſt weigh this Aggregate in the Water, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract its Weight in that Liquor, from the Weight that the ſame Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate had in the Air; and the Difference will be the Specifick Weight of the ſaid Aggregate in Water. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> From this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſubſtract <hi>the</hi> formerly found <hi>Specifick Weight of the Plate alone in Water,</hi> and the Remains will give you the Weight of the lighter Body in the ſame Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Thus far our Author; without whoſe help, we may eaſily diſpatch the reſt of our Work, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod imployed already of meaſuring Solids heavier than Water. For the lately obtained Weight of the light Body in Water, being, (according to the Method formerly propoſed,) divided by 256 Grains, will give you the Solid content of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally floating Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98188:72"/>But becauſe a Method, that is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult enough to be put in Practice by thoſe that are not more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily well verſed in Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, requires to be illuſtrated by an Example; I ſhall ſubjoyn an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, that may ſerve, not only to clear up this Practice, but, in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to confirm it too; We took then a piece of Oak conveniently ſhaped, and that weigh'd in Air, 193 ½ Grains. To this we tyed with an Horſe-hair, a Plate of Lead weighing juſt half an Ounce, <hi>i. e.</hi> 240 Grains. But before we tyed them together, the Lead was weighed in Water, where it loſt of its former Weight 20 Grains, which, being deducted out of the 240 Grains lately mentioned, left a Difference or reſidue of 20 Grains, for the Specifick Weight of this piece of Lead, (For I have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found Lead quite ſo heavy) in the Water. Then the Aggregate of the Wood and Lead was weighed: Firſt, in the Air, and found to be 433 Grains and an half, and Then in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98188:73"/>
Water, where it amounted but to 162 Grains; which being ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Aggregate of the ſame Bodies in the Air, the Reſidue, or Difference, was found to be 271 and ½ Grains: From which Difference, the other Difference of 20 Grains (which had been lately found) of the Leaden Plate alone in the Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deducted, there remained 251 Grains and ½ for the Weight of Water equal in Bulk to the given piece of Wood. If this number had amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 256 Grains, of which it fell ſhort but 4 ½ Grains, we might have concluded the Solidity of it to be a Cubick Inch; ſince 256 Grains of Water, which we formerly found equal to a Bulk of Water of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Inch, was alſo now found equal to the Bulk of the given piece of Wood. And indeed, intending (as I formerly intimated) to give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that ſhould not only Illuſtrate, but Confirm, the propoſed Practice; I cauſed the Wood I imployed to be formed into as exact a Cube of an
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98188:73"/>
Inch every way, as I could procure from a Joyner, that bragged of the Pains he had taken about it: So that the Difference of its Weight in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from 256 Grains, the Weight of a full Cubick Inch of that Liquor, may probably be imputed to ſome little Imperfection in the Figure of the Wood, or ſome other light Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, not conſiderable enough to be much regarded.</p>

already ſaid, ſubjoyn this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement; That the ſame Way may be applyed to meaſure the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Solids diſſoluble in Water, if, inſtead of this Liquor, we ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Oil of Turpentine; whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and Specifick Gravity to Water, we have found, or is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe known to us. When I firſt made this Reflection, I had not ſuch Conveniencies, as when I found the weight of a Cubick Inch of Water, to determine the weight of a Cubick Inch of Oil of Turpentine. But, having yet lying by me the hollow Veſſel of Braſs, whoſe Cavity was an exact Inch, that I imploy'd to find out the weight of a Cubick Inch of Water; I made uſe of it on this occaſion too: and found that, when it was carefully filled with ſuch Oil of Turpentine, as we were wont to imploy about Hydroſtatical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the contained Liquor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted but to 221 Grains, and an Eighth (part of a Grain;) by which number the Difference of the weight

                        <hi>Merſennus</hi> (more briefly than clearly) propoſes an Expedient in this caſe, which is to cover over the Body to be weigh'd in Water with Wax, Pitch, or ſome other Gluten, as he calls it, whoſe Specifick Weight in Water muſt be firſt known. But,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98188:75"/>
I take Bees-wax to be much prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the other Two. For Pitch is ſo apt to ſtick to Ones Hands or Cloathes, that 'tis troubleſome to apply it, and very difficult to get it off: And as for Glues, moſt of them, eſpecially the more common, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble in Water, and therefore not ſo fit for the purpoſe as Bees-wax, (for That, I preſume, he means by Wax;) which has this Conveniency in it, that its Proportion to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being uſually conſtant enough, and the Gravity of thoſe two Bodies differing but little, one may more eaſily diſpatch a good part of the Experiment; which is thus to be performed. Take the Solid (lighter than Water, that you would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Hydroſtatically, and having weigh'd it in the Air, over lay it carefully with a thin Coat of Bees-wax, ſo that no part of it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uncovered, or acceſſible to the Liquor. Then take alſo in the Air the Weight of the Wax you have imploy'd, and faſten to the Body

thus coated, a Plate of Lead, or Tin, heavy enough to make it ſink, and obſerve the weight of the Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in Water. This done, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the weight of as much Water, as is equal in Bulk to the Wax, and proceed with the reſt, as is before taught. <hi>Merſennus</hi> declares this Practice by this Inſtance, if the Wax that inveſts the propoſed Body be of ℥xxij in the Air, the Bulk of Water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to it will be ℥xxi; and therefore a Quantity of Water of ℥xxi, muſt be firſt taken away, or ſubſtracted, that the remaining Bulk, equal to the (immerſt) Body, may, by its Gravity, ſhew the Gravity of the Body (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,) as has before been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But, becauſe the Way, above deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, can help us but to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Weight</hi> of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Body in Water; we muſt, to diſcover the <hi>Solid Content</hi> of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further than our <hi>Merſennus</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to goe; and therefore we muſt divide the Weight of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in Water, already found, by 256
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98188:76"/>

                     <p>I have ſometimes (to add That upon the By,) thought of, and try'd, another Expedient, to hinder ſmaller Solids, whether lighter or heavier <hi>in Specie</hi> than Water, from imbibing the Ambient Liquor. In order to this, I <hi>firſt</hi> found the Weight of a Cubick Inch of Quickſilver, (which is not difficult to diſcover by its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to Water of the ſame Bulk.) And <hi>then</hi> we brought the Body to be meaſured, into a Veſſel, whoſe Solid Contents were known before; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> all that was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the firm Body, being filled with Quickſilver, 'twas eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know by the Difference in Weight of That Quickſilver, from the Weight of the Quickſilver, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to fill the whole Veſſel, to how much Quickſilver the environ'd Body was equal. And by this means, and the knowledge before gained of the Weight of a Cubical Inch of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98188:77"/>
Mercury, the Solid Contents of the Body propoſed was not difficult to be obtained. But I forbear to give more than this Intimation of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, which, beſides that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs properly to another Eſſay, is rather Mechanical than Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. And for the ſame reaſon, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſet down one Way of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Contents of Irregular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, delivered in ſome Books of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Geometry; and another, but yet unpubliſhed, Way, differing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the Former, that tends to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98188:77"/>
Queſtions, that, I foreſee, may juſtly enough be asked me by a Peruſer of the foregoing Eſſay.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> I preſume it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Whether I have propoſed the beſt Ways that can be thought of, to examine Bodies Hydroſtatically?</hi> To which Queſtion I anſwer, that, upon divers Conſiderations, ſome of which have been mentioned here and there in the Body of the foregoing Eſſay, I did not think my ſelf obliged ſolicitouſly to Invent, or propound, new Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Hydroſtatical <hi>Examen</hi> of Bodies. For <hi>tho'</hi> I am not Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that divers more curious and Artificial ways of finding out their Weight in Water, or their Solid Contents by it, may be deviſed by Perſons more skilful and ſagacious than I. And <hi>tho'</hi> alſo I think it not unlikely, that, when the Utility of ſuch Practices comes to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, Artificial Inſtruments will be found out to Facilitate, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Improve them: <hi>Yet,</hi> I thought it became me at firſt <hi>to</hi> propound
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98188:78"/>
only the more ſimple Ways of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as the moſt likely to invite the Generality of thoſe, for whoſe ſake this Eſſay is made publick; and <hi>to</hi> require, for the main part of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, only the Uſe of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as an Inſtrument eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and already, for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, in moſt Mens hands, without mentioning, at this time, any more Artificial Inſtruments; tho' ſome of them are ſuch, as I have long ſince not only had thoughts of, but, for my own Uſes, practiſed; which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation may be countenanced, if it were needful, by the mention of that little Inſtrument, for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between true and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Guineas, or the like Pieces of coyn'd Gold, by the help of Water; which was ſeveral Years ago pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Philoſophical Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and has ſince (without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my Improvements of it) been made Uſe of by Some, and uſurp'd by Others. But of ſuch things, no more in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:98188:78"/>Having anſwered the Firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it remains, that I conſider the Second, wherein tho' I ſhall aim at Brevity as much, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet I fear, I ſhall not be able to diſcuſs it in as few Lines, as I did That. I preſume then, it will be asked, <hi>What Credit may be given to the Eſtimates of the Weight, and Proportions of Bodies, obtained by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Tryals?</hi> Since, we ſee, that <hi>tho'</hi> Mathematicians, not knowing, or not applying, our Obſervation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Specifick Gravity of Rock-Chryſtal, and the Nature of Oil, eſpecially that of Turpentine, have given us but the Proportions of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and ſome very few other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Bodies, as the Loadſtone, Wax, Hony, Oil and Wine; <hi>yet</hi> thoſe few that have not tranſcrib'd from one another, differ in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they have left us, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative weight of thoſe few Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>This Queſtion is ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that, I think, it cannot well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98188:79"/>
a ſingle Anſwer; and therefore, I ſhall offer Two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> I freely acknowledge, that there is no exact Uniformity in the Obſervations delivered about the weight of Metals, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d the other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies newly nam'd, among the few Authors that have written of this Subject; and there would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been yet more Difference in their Accounts, if ſome, even of thoſe Writers, had not avowedly made uſe, to their purpoſes, of as much as they thought fit of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Ghetaldus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, I ſhall not think it very ſtrange, if I find, that the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſame Man, made at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant times, and in other differing Circumſtances, ſhould not all of them exactly agree. For I have already noted, and, I think, in more places than One, that there will ſcarce be found ſo great an Uniformity in Qualities, and particularly in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick weight, among Bodies of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98188:79"/>
ſame Kind or Denomination, as there is generally preſum'd to be. There may be alſo ſome Difference, tho' but little, betwixt the Waters Men employ, eſpecially if the Air be at One time (as in <hi>July</hi>) intenſely hot, and at Another (as in <hi>January</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Cold. The Difference alſo of Degrees of Goodneſs of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, Men employ about nice Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, is not altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. But there is a thing of greater Moment than this, towards the hindering Hydroſtatical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and even Statical Ones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from being ſo accurate, as thoſe, that are not verſed in ſuch Matters, may require. The thing I mean, is, the Difficulty of finding an exact Uniformity in Weights of the ſame Denomination, which, for that Reaſon, are vulgarly ſuppoſed to be exactly equal; But, to know how far this Suppoſition is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on, it may at preſent ſuffice to ſet down ſome Paſſages of a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician juſtly famous for his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98188:80"/>
and who has made it his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Work to examine theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſcrupuoluſly. The firſt Paſſage, I ſhall allege out of his Writings, ſhall be the ſhort Account he gives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tryals he made of natural Grains, whence all ſorts of weights have been deduced.<note place="margin">In Praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Librum de Menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus &amp; nummis.</note> 
                     <hi>Cùm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia grana, vel ſemina, quae reperiri ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in atriis venalibus Lutetiae, ad Stateram expendiſſem, vixque granum ullum inter ejuſdem ſpeciei grana grano alteri exacte reſpondiſſet, in incertis ludere nolui.</hi> The ſame Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Grains dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the <hi>French</hi> Grains; ſince, as, he obſerves, 688 Grains of the former ſort, are Equiponderant but to 576 Grains of the later ſort. And he ſubjoyns, that, whilſt he was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe things, there was found by the more exact weights of the Mint, an Error in the former Eſtimate, of at leaſt half a Grain in 36 Grains.</p>
                  <p>And elſewhere he gives notice, that, by two Relations, ſent him from
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98188:80"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Number of Grains,<note place="margin">

And yet this I do not wonder at, becauſe I have my ſelf found it ſo difficult in Practice, to <hi>get</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> Weights (for, as little as this is wont to be ſuſpected, the the very Air may, in time, a little alter them,) as exact, as I deſired, that I left off the hopes of it. And one Remark, tho' commonly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, I think too conſiderable to be here omitted. For,<note place="margin">In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per called <hi>Galic.

                     </note> whereas the accurate <hi>Ghetaldus</hi>'s Tables of the Weight of Metals, and ſome few other Bodies, in reference to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are looked upon as the moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick that have been publiſhed &amp; are accordingly made the moſt uſe of: 'Tis certain, that the Weights he employ'd are not divided, as Ours are. For, tho' indeed according to him,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98188:81"/>
as well as with us, the Ounce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Four and twenty Scruples; yet the Scruple, which with us is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided but into 20 Grains, he divides into 24. But to return to <hi>Merſennus,</hi> a while after he had told us of the Difference between his repeated Tryals, and Thoſe of other Men, in determining the Weight of a certain Body, he has this Paſſage; which ſhews, that he was not over-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Preciſeneſs of all his own Determinations. <hi>Cum autem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pag.</hi> 37. <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>Dixi, Chelin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Having gone thorough the Firſt part of my Anſwer, to the Second Query above propoſed, it remains, that I proceed to the Other part; which perhaps will not need more than the following Reflection.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then, that <hi>tho'</hi> it be granted, that Hydroſtatical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments are not always either ſingly accurate, or exactly agreeable among
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98188:81"/>
themſelves; <hi>yet</hi> they may well be, <hi>both</hi> accurate enough to be of very good Uſe, eſpecially in Practice; <hi>and</hi> leſs remote from being quite accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, than any other Ways that have been hitherto known to be Practiſed, of determining the Proportions of Bodies in point of Weight and Bulk, and of meaſuring the Solid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of ſtable Bodies, whether hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier <hi>in Specie</hi> than Water, or ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> part of this Reflection may be deduced, as a Corollary <hi>from,</hi> or at leaſt confirmed <hi>by,</hi> the greateſt part of the foregoing Eſſay. And indeed, as little Skill as I have in Hydroſtaticks, I would not be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Uſe of them, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sum of Money; it having already done me acceptable Service, and on far more occaſions, than I my ſelf at firſt expected; eſpecially in the <hi>Examen</hi> of Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies, and of ſeveral Chymical Productions. And I have been able
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98188:82"/>
more than once or twice, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Artiſts and other Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that, <hi>bona fide,</hi> believed they had made, or were Poſſeſſors of, <hi>Luna fixa,</hi> (as they call it) and other valuable things: And to make a good Judgment of the Genuineneſs or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the Degrees of Worth, or Strength, in their kind, of divers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or poorer Metalline Mixtures, and other Bodies, (ſome Solid, and ſome Liquid,) whoſe fair Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances might otherwiſe have much puzzled, if not deceived, me.</p>
                  <p>But of This more may be found in another Paper. For I muſt haſten to the <hi>Second</hi> part of our deſigned Reflection, by repreſenting, That our Hydroſtatical Methods of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Weights and Bulks of Bodies, tho' they be not Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically accurate, yet they are leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from being ſo, than any Way of Menſuration of Bodies, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch little Ones, as we uſually have need to examine on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98188:82"/>
of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi>) by the Geometrical Inſtruments, that are hitherto known to be Practiſed; or, by the Way,<note place="margin">Verulam in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ denſi &amp; rari, p. m. 8. &amp;c.</note> whereby the <hi>Tabula Coitionis &amp; Expanſionis Materiae per Spatia in Tangibilibus, &amp;c.</hi> was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the renowned Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>; whoſe judicious Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rarity and Denſity of Bodies, ſuch as their meaſures are delivered in that Table, do ſufficiently manifeſt, as the Philoſophical <hi>Genius</hi> of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſo the Utility that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from even ſuch Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bulks and Weights of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as fall ſhort enough of being accurate.</p>
                  <p>I might here relate, that, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſome curious Perſons, how much Hydroſtaticks may be made ſerviceable to as accurate Menſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as ought to be expected in Phyſical Experiments; I deſired a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> Firſt, to put together two Lumps of Metal (<hi>viz.</hi> of Tin, and of Lead) in a certain Proportion,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98188:83"/>
that he was to conceal from me, but to ſet down in Writing to prevent Miſtakes. Then I deſired him to melt the Metals (whoſe reſpective Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Gravities I knew before) into one Maſs, and give me that Maſs. And Thirdly, I weigh'd it carefully in Water; and did alſo Algebraically examine it. Which being done, I told him, that the Lead, he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, amounted to ſuch a Weight, and the Tin to ſuch another; which being compared with the Quantities he had committed to Paper, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was found to be little more than one Grain, and this it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably proceeded from ſome ſcarce avoidable Imperfection in the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pouring out, &amp;c. of the given Bodies. But becauſe ſpecious Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick was employ'd in this Work, (to which, yet it was not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary,) I ſhall lay no Streſs upon it; becauſe, if I miſtake not, the paſt Diſcourſe may ſuffice to give the Hydroſtatical Ways, of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration

to the Seekers of Subterraneal Treaſures, if my deſire to do them a piece of Service, make me borrow of a Paper, I long ſince wrote about ſome things relating to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> a few Paragraphs, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Way of Exploration of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; which tho' it reaches but to One of their Qualities, will, perhaps, by reaſon, of the Conſiderableneſs of of This, keep, on certain Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome Searchers after Mines from beginning chargeable Works, or proſecuting them with too great Expectations, which are uſually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by proportionable Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And I make the leſs Scruple to ſuffer this Fragment to leave its Company, and preſent it ſelf to you; becauſe, after the misfortune, I have formerly ſignified to you, of the Loſs and Spoiling of ſeveral of my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I know not when, if ever, I may have Opportunity of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to my Friends the Treatiſe, that theſe Paragraphs belong to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:98188:88"/>That Part of the forementioned Treatiſe, that concerns my preſent purpoſe, is founded on an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof what you are about to read, is One of the Applications.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall then ſuccinctly inform you, that the Obſervation, whereon my Diſcourſe was grounded, is double, as will by and by appear; and that the Riſe of it, which will help to underſtand the Nature and Influences of it, was this. I thought fit, (for Reaſons elſewhere given) to find out, what was the Specifick Gravity of a pure Stone, ſuch as I ſuppoſed Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal or White Marble, or a Stony Iſicle, to be; and found it by the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Way of Tryal, (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs not unknown to You,) that is delivered in the Eſſay called <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina Hydroſtatica,</hi> whereof when you pleaſe, you may command a ſight, to have to clear common Water, equal to it in Bulk, or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, pretty near the <hi>Ratio,</hi> or Proportion of two and an half to one; or, which is ſomewhat more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98188:89"/>
obvious to conceive, as five to two. I ſaid, <hi>pretty near,</hi> becauſe 'tis not always exact, nor need be for our preſent purpoſe, but uſually enough does ſomewhat rather exceed that Proportion than fall ſhort of it; but that is ſo little, that it may, on all common Occaſions, be ſafely enough neglected by a Mineraliſt: Tho', if one pleaſes, one may make uſe of the Proportion of 2 ¾ to 1, that is, of 11 to 4.</p>

                  <p>THe Uſes, that may be made to our preſent purpoſe of this Fundamental Obſervation, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a more General, or of a more Particular, Nature.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe; <hi>When</hi> my Intention is only to diſcover in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Whether a Foſſile propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or perhaps caſually lighted on, may with probability be judged to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98188:89"/>
contain any Subſtance, either Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, or belonging to ſome Foſſile of Affinity to a Metalline Nature; and alſo, Whether, in caſe the firſt Queſtion be reſolv'd in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the propoſed Body does, indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſpeaking, contain much, or but little, of the Metalline or other Adventitious Subſtance: <hi>When,</hi> I ſay, I would only make thoſe General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, I weigh the Body I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, firſt in Air, and then in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and obſerve the Proportion in Specifick Gravity between them; and if I find it weigh either leſs, or but <hi>little</hi> more, than Chryſtal or Marble of the ſame Bulk, I judge it unlikely to contain any Metalline Portion, conſiderable for its Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. And if it weigh manifeſtly, or ſomewhat <hi>conſiderably,</hi> more than Marble or Chryſtal, I gueſs, that, in Proportion to that Exceſs, it abounds, more or leſs, with a Metalline In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, or one or other of Affinity to a Metalline Nature.</p>

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:98188:90"/>To explain my ſelf a little by two or three Examples; 'tis known, that the <hi>Magnet</hi> is vulgarly reckon'd amongſt <hi>Stones,</hi> and its great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs confirms Men in that Opinion. But having obſerved, that Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, eſpecially thoſe that come from ſome Places, that I elſewhere take notice of, ſeem to be <hi>apparently</hi> more ponderous than common <hi>Stones</hi> of the like Bulk; We weigh'd them in Air and Water, and found their Specifick Gravity, eſpecially of ſome of them,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor means a Paper containing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, as 'tis a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> ſo far to exceed That of Chryſtal or Marble, that it could not be difficult for us to conclude, that theſe Foſſiles contained a not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Proportion of Metalline Matter, which, by Collateral Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, delivered in another Paper, appear'd to be of a Martial or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruginous Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emeri</hi> is a Foſſile well known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tradeſmen, eſpecially <hi>Armourers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gunſmiths,</hi> by whom 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed a mere Stone. But finding that its Weight in Water conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98188:90"/>
exceeded That of Chryſtal of the ſame Bulk, ſince it was to that Liquor very near, as 4 to 1; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that it contained a Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Subſtance, as afterward, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tryals, I found it to do. Upon the ſame ground, (its Weight in my hand) I concluded, that <hi>Lapis Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matites,</hi> that is commonly ſold in Shops, and, as its Name witneſſeth, paſſes for a Stone, did not ſparingly participate of a Metalline Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; in proſecution of which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, I quickly thought on Ways whereby I diſcovered, that Iron or Steel was the Metal it contained.</p>
                  <p>And not to accumulate Inſtances in this place, I ſhall advertiſe you in general, (what perhaps may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be found uſeful to ſeveral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers) that, upon the Grounds hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto mentioned, I was invited to gueſs, that divers Bodies, that were little ſuſpected to be of a Metalline, or Mineral, Nature, did really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Portion of Subſtance that was ſo. And, I remember, in particular,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98188:91"/>
that, having met with <hi>Granats</hi> of ſeveral ſizes, that were not <hi>Bohemian,</hi> but were found in other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſome that I diſcovered in a kind of <hi>Talc,</hi> that was brought me from <hi>America</hi>; which Angular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figured Stones, I ſuſpected by their Weight to be Metallick, and found, by Hydroſtaticks, to have a Specifick Gravity conſiderably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing That of Chryſtal. Upon theſe Grounds, I ſay, I ſuppos'd them to participate, and that not very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, of a Metal, one or more; and, by other Ways of exploring, found, that I had gueſſed aright; ſince I was able, notwithſtanding the great Compactneſs of ſuch ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly vitreous Bodies, to diſcover there a Decompoſition, and extract thence a Metallick Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>To theſe I might add other Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles, and ſome that were not, even by Men not unskilful, ſuſpected to have any Metalline Ingredients. But I have not time to ſpeak of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98188:91"/>
Them, and therefore ſhall proceed in the lately begun Diſcourſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>TO illuſtrate then the general Obſervation, formerly laid down, and make it more diſtinct, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do not pretend, by this Way, to make any more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjectures and Eſtimates, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Contents of the Bodies, I examine by it: But tho' the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, grounded on it, be not always True, yet they may be frequently Uſeful, as may be gathered from ſome of the ſubſequent Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Foſſile propoſed be lighter, eſpecially if it be much lighter, than ſo much Chryſtal, it is an almoſt certain Token, that it is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98188:92"/>
not a Metalline Ore. And this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative uſe, if I may ſo call it, of our <hi>Hydroſtaticks,</hi> may be more ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed on, than the Affirmative Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences uſually can be. Thus, when I find that <hi>Jet,</hi> tho' a Foſſile dug up in Veins, eſpecially in the <hi>Pyrenean Mountains,</hi> (as a Learned Man, whoſe Brother has there a Mine of <hi>Jet,</hi> aſſured me) has far leſs of Specifick Gravity, than Chryſtal, I conclude it to be no Metalline Body. The like Inference I make, on the ſame ground, as to Foſſile Amber or <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinum, Sulphur vive,</hi> and the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation holds in common <hi>Sulphur,</hi> (clear or <hi>Semidiaphanous</hi>) Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Talc,</hi> Venetian <hi>Talc,</hi> and ſome other firm Concretions, whether Brittle or not, that are dug out of the Earth. Among theſe, I think fit to mention particularly Black-Lead, leſt the Name it bears, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Men into a Belief, that 'tis an Ore of that Metal. For having found its Weight, in reference to Water, to be but as 1 86/100 to 1. And, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98188:92"/>
from the Smalneſs of its Specifick Gravity, that it would prove to be very unlike our true common Lead Ores, I found, upon Tryal purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, that, 'twas a Mineral <hi>ſui ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> and ſeemed, upon the ſcore of more than one Quality, to be of kin to a ſort of <hi>Talc,</hi> that I have met with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould diſtinguiſh between the ſeveral Uſes, that Foſſiles may be ſought for, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by Men of different Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Deſigns. And therefore, if a Foſſile be found to be ſomewhat, and yet but very little, heavier in <hi>Specie,</hi> than Chryſtal or Marble; it may poſſibly have a Metalline or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Portion, which, tho' very ſmall in quantity, may conſiſt of ſuch Efficacious parts, as may make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Eſteem of a Jeweller, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, or a Chymiſt. But if the Surplus of Specifick Gravity be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, the Foſſile it ſelf will be ſo too to a Mineraliſt, that ſeeks not to gratifie his Curioſity, or make a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98188:93"/>
good Medicine, but to fill his Purſe. For the Charge and Trouble of working a Foſſile, ſo poor in Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Subſtance, will probably either exceed the Profit, or keep it from being conſiderable; whereas, if the Specifick Gravity do much exceed That of Marble or Chryſtal, it may give good hopes of proving a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject profitable to be wrought on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But, here I muſt give notice, that, <hi>tho'</hi> for the moſt part, the great Ponderoſity of a Foſſile proceeds from a Portion of ſome Metalline Subſtance, more ſtrictly ſo called, that is imbody'd with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Concrete; <hi>yet</hi> this alone is indeed a certain Sign, that the Foſſile is not a mere <hi>Stone,</hi> but is not alone a ſure Sign, that the Mineral Portion is properly <hi>Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>; and therefore, where there is juſt Cauſe of doubt, 'tis beſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by ſome Collateral Signs to reſolve it. The Reaſon, why I thought fit to give you this Admonition, is, that, beſides <hi>Metalline Ores</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98188:93"/>
ſo called, there are other Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles, which ſome call <hi>Semi-Metals,</hi> others <hi>Media Mineralia,</hi> and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain give other Appellations to; which Foſſiles, tho' of Affinity to Metals, are wont to be diſtinguiſhed from true Metalline Ores; ſuch (Foſſiles) as are (that I may here name the principal of them) <hi>Antimony, Biſmuth,</hi> (uſually in our Shops called <hi>Tin-glaſs) Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> and <hi>Pyrites,</hi> commonly called <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> and vulgarly, in Engliſh, <hi>Vitriol Stones.</hi>) But there will not perhaps occur many Caſes, wherein it will be neceſſary to have recourſe to Collateral Signs, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, Whether the Mineral Portion of a Foſſile, be, in a ſtricter Senſe, of a Metalline Nature, or not: For theſe <hi>Semi-Metals</hi> that I ſpeak of, are moſt commonly found either in Veins, or in Maſſes, or great Lumps of their reſpective Kinds; and eaſily diſcover, to one that conſiders them with ſo much as a moderate meaſure of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Skill, what <hi>Species</hi> of Foſſiles they belong to. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98188:94"/>
from <hi>Devonſhire</hi> received a Lump of Matter, which the Owner of the Mine, not knowing what to make of, deſired my Opinion of, wherein I found ſome <hi>Antimony</hi> mixt with Lead, which was the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Body. But ſuch Mixtures oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not often enough, at leaſt here in <hi>England,</hi> to keep our Way of Eſtimating ponderous Foſſiles from being, on moſt occaſions, uſeful.</p>

                     <hi>FIfthly,</hi> 'Twill be almoſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give you notice in this place, that there may be a two-fold Eſtimate made of the Specifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Ores; <hi>One,</hi> when the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Body propoſed is weigh'd in its natural State, that is, as 'tis taken out of the Earth, accompanied with the Sparr, or other Heterogeneous matter, that firmly adheres to it, (only the looſe Earth being firſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed off:) and the <hi>Other,</hi> after it has
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98188:94"/>
been beaten ſmall and ſeparated from ſtony, and other Heterogeneous, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by the help of Water; where being skilfully agitated, there is eaſily diſcovered a notable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in Weight between theſe, and the Genuine, or Metalline, parts of the Ore, which being thus ſever'd from the reſt, are called, for inſtance, waſhed Tin, if afforded by a Vein of that Metal. And ſometimes alſo 'tis very Uſeful, if not Neceſſary, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Ore by roſting it, (as they ſpeak) once, or oftner, or by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſeveral hours in a competently ſtrong Fire, as is uſually enough done to prepare Copper-Ore, eſpecially if it be ſtubborn. I have diſtinctly mentioned theſe Two States, wherein the Weight of an Ore may be eſtimated; becauſe, I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that in ſeveral Caſes 'twill much import the Experimenter to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them carefully. For ſeveral Ores, which, in their natural State, have too little of Specifick Gravity, to make them judg'd worth the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98188:95"/>
Charge of being wrought, may yet, being prepared by Water and Fire, afford a Metalline Portion ſo heavy <hi>in Specie,</hi> that it may give fair hopes of containing in it ſome Portion of Silver, or of Gold; and, in that caſe, a ſmall Proportion of the Former, and a much ſmaller of the Later, would render the Ore conſiderable, and make it pretty Rich; tho' not in reference to the quantity it yeilds of the predominant Metal, as Lead, Tin, or Copper; yet in a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Senſe, as it may better recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the Charges of him that ſhall work it. Which brings into my mind, that ſometime agoe a piece of Lead Ore, then brought out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being offered me to judge of; I found it ſo light in the Lump, that I thought it not at all worthy to be wrought for Lead; but afterwards upon Tryal it appeared to be, tho' very poor in that Metal, yet ſo well ſtor'd with Corpuſcles of Silver, that I ſcrupled not to incourage the Owner to beſtow Pains and Coſt upon it.</p>

                  <p>BUt there is one Kind of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, that I have obſerved to impoſe on Men ſo often, that I think it neceſſary to take a particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them in this place. For, not to mention Examples, that I might draw out of the Books of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Navigators, I have met with I know not how many, that have built great hopes, and ſome, (which is worſe) that have been at Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon thoſe illuſory Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great matters from <hi>Marcaſites.</hi> And, I remember, I have had ſent me, or brought me, not only from Places nearer home, but from hotter and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Countries of the <hi>Indies</hi> themſelves, Foſſiles, whereof I was earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to give my Opinion, that I found to be but <hi>Marcaſites</hi>: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Foſſiles having two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that make them very fit to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98188:96"/>
delude the vulgar, and the unskilful, namely, firſt, a Multitude of ſhining ſtreaks, or other gliſtering parts uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of a Colour near enough to That of Gold, and ſometimes to That of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and then, a Ponderouſneſs uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not inferior, at leaſt, to that of true Metalline Ores; <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> I ſay, being thus fitted to delude the unskilful, I have had much ado to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive ſome, that brought or ſent me them from <hi>America,</hi> of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Confidence they had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe promiſing Foſſiles were Lumps of rich Ore of Gold, or Silver. Wherefore ſince their Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſneſs (which is the <hi>Criterion</hi> of Minerals, I am now treating of,) is One of the Two chief Things that delude ſo many, I think it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to ſubjoyn ſome few, but vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Inſtances of the Specifick Gravity of <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> whereby it may appear, that ſome of them are, Bulk for Bulk, far more ponderous than divers true Metalline Ores, that I have try'd, have been found to be. And indeed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98188:96"/>
this great Ponderoſity has ſeveral times invited me, before I made any Artificial Tryal of propounded Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles, and ſometimes before I took them out of the Bags or Papers to look on them, to judge, tho' perhaps to the Surprize of thoſe that brought them, that they were not true Ores, but <hi>Marcaſites.</hi> And, becauſe this Miſtake is ſpeciouſly grounded, and has deceived many, whereof ſome have undertaken Voyages betwixt <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> upon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the value of theſe gliſtering Stones; I ſhall decline a little the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of this Paper, which confines me to the Hydroſtatical Way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring Minerals, to advertiſe thoſe whom it may concern, that they may eaſily try almoſt any Stone, that, by its great Weight and Luſtre, they ſuſpect to be a <hi>Marcaſite,</hi> if they put it, either within a Crucible, or, without One, into a well-kindled Fire, and blow now and then upon it with a pair of Bellows. For, by this means, the Sulphur, wherewith
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98188:97"/>
                     <hi>Marcaſites</hi> are wont to abound, (ſo that I remember, that even by Deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in a cloſe Veſſel, I had ℥iv of good Brimſtone, like the vulgar, out of <abbr>lb</abbr>iij of the Stones) will take Fire, and burn with a Flame for the moſt part blew, like that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur. And, if when it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to flame and ſmoak, you take it out of the Fire and let it cool, you will find it deprived of all the gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy appearance of rich Metal it had before, and turned to a brittle blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Subſtance, differing enough from That of a Metalline Ore, <hi>more ſtrictly ſo called.</hi> Theſe laſt words I add, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in a lax Senſe, 'tis eaſie to ſhew, that <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> at leaſt thoſe that I have tryed, may be looked upon as a kind of Metalline Bodies. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that I have found divers of them to contain Particles of Copper, I found all, that I purpoſely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to contain, and ſome of them plentifully enough, Corpuſcles of Iron or Steel, as plainly appeared, when, after the newly mentioned
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98188:97"/>
Calcination, (for with crude <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites</hi> I found not the following Tryal to ſucceed) I applyed to the pulverized Remains a vigorous Load-ſtone; to which great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Martial Corpuſcles quickly adher'd. And, I remember, I found in a Catalogue of the Foſſiles of <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> publiſhed by the experienced <hi>Kentmannus,</hi> that, under the Head or Title of <hi>Pyrites,</hi> he brings in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> whereof ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Copper, others Silver, others Gold, and others both the laſt nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Metals; which brings into my mind, that, having preſented, among other Engliſh Minerals, a curiouſly ſhaped, and very fine <hi>Marcaſite,</hi> to a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> that is now Overſeer of one of the Emperors beſt Mines; He quickly examined it by a peculiar Way, not known to me, hoping to find in it ſome Gold or Silver; but, inſtead of that, obtain'd a Portion of running Mercury, which he was pleaſed to preſent me, and which, I preſume, I may have yet by me.</p>

                  <p>ON this occaſion, I muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give an Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that may be of good Uſe to divers Examiners of Ores, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch, as are Novices in the Art of reducing them. And it is This, that, as to many, who make Tryals of Ores, tho' they much value their own Flux-Powders, or Thoſe that are cry'd up by others, yet they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly act, as if they expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from thoſe that they prefer, but that they ſhould more than O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers facilitate the Fuſion of the Ores; as that which being once done, the Metalline part will be ſeparated by its own Weight, or, as it were, Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly. But yet, having purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined the Matter more nicely, and compared the Quantities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that we obtain'd from two Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of equal Weight of the ſame
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98188:99"/>
Ore, we found that thoſe Proportions did very conſiderably differ, tho' that which yeilded leaſt Metal was flux'd down with a <hi>Fondant</hi> (as the French compendiouſly call, what Our men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Germans, call a Flux-Powder,) that is dear enough, and not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly eſteemed, when ſuch Ores are to be handled. And I little doubt, but that from other Metalline Ores, a greater Portion of pure Metal may be obtained by ſome, but little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed or known, <hi>Fondants,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cheap Ones too, than by Others that are much more in uſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; Of which I may elſewhere give ſome Inſtances: Now, One that firſt occurs to my Memory, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me, by two equally heavy Portions of the ſame Lead Ore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of Sparr; whereof One, being reduced with a due Weight of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> and <hi>Tartar</hi> fulminated together, afforded much leſs of Malleable Lead, than was obtained by means of half or a quarter of the Quantity of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Mars,</hi> which, for Tryals ſake,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98188:99"/>
I then imployed on the Other; to ſhew, how much better a Reductive of that kind of Ore, that Metalline Flux was, than even a ſharp and fiery fixt Salt.</p>
                  <p>And yet, (to give you an Inſtance in a much more precious Mineral than Lead Ore,) I ſhall add, that having, for Curioſities ſake, try'd ſome Ounces of good native <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> finely pulverized; one half with a fixt Alcaly of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a different Flux-powder, we obtained from the firſt Parcel twice as much Mercury, as we did from the other half, deſtilled with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fixt Alcaly; even tho' it were of a Mineral Nature.</p>

it altogether unmentioned; and therefore, tho' I have but Two, or Three, Obſervations pertinent to my preſent Subject, to offer about it, yet I think it may not be uſeleſs to ſay ſomewhat of that Ore in this place.</p>
                  <p>I know, there are many learned Men, and even Chymiſts, that think, there are no ſuch things as <hi>Gold Mines,</hi> properly ſo called. And, I confeſs, that I my ſelf was long kept from being confident of the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And I was induced to this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence by conſidering, that tho' ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the Honour for divers Years to be a Member of his Majeſties Council for Foreign Plantations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had the opportunity to converſe with a conſiderable Number of Navigators, and other great Travellers, and with divers Perſons, that had ſetled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the <hi>Indies,</hi> I made it more than once my buſineſs to inquire, not, Whether they knew of any <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mines</hi> in the popular ſenſe of the word, for, I knew, that there are in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98188:100"/>
                     <hi>Hungary, Macedonia,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, <hi>Mines</hi> that afford Gold enough to deſerve to be wrought for it: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether there are any real Mines, or Veins, whereof Gold is manifeſtly the predominant Metal. Having, I ſay, propoſed to many this Queſtion, I was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That ſome of them indeed had heard of ſuch Mines, but none of them had ever ſeen any. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I ſaw ſome Ore that I judg'd true, that was preſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty (<hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and I alſo received from an unknown <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> reſiding in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> together, with a very civil Letter (which I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had been more Hiſtorical and leſs Complemental,) among other leſs valuable pieces of Ore, One in whoſe Clefts, and a little beyond them, there appear ſome Lumps, wherein by their Colour, and other Signs, 'tis ſo apparent, that Gold is the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Metal, that I little doubt, but that, if I would ſpoil the Lump by breaking the Spar, I ſhould find
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98188:101"/>
theſe Metalline Protuberances Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable, without the help of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>But being unwilling to deſtroy the Entireneſs of it, I ſhall make only a few, and ſhort, Remarks about this Ore.</p>
                  <p>The biggeſt Piece, and that which was beſt furniſhed with Metalline parts, being about an Ounce and a quarter in Weight, contained ſo great a Proportion of <hi>Spar,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Metal, that its Weight to an equal Bulk of Water was but as 2 91/100 to 1.</p>
                  <p>But ſomewhat to compenſate this Smalneſs of the Metalline Portion; That, that was of it, ſeemed to be all Gold, there being no Sign of any other Metal in that Lump of Ore, nor in ſome leſſer Ones that I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spar</hi> (as our Mine-men uſe to call that ſtony Matter, in which the true Ore is immediately lodged,) did not look like the <hi>Spar</hi> of Lead Ore, or that of any other of our Engliſh Metals that I have ſeen, but ſeemed at
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98188:101"/>
firſt view to be a kind of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a daſh of Yellow.</p>
                  <p>And upon Tryal, I found it to differ more from the <hi>Spar</hi> of Lead Ore, which, with us, is uſually White, and and almoſt <hi>Semi-diaphanous</hi> than in the Colour. For, whereas our <hi>Spar</hi> of Lead Ore is oftentimes ſo ſoft or tender, that it may eaſily enough be cut with a knife, we found the <hi>Sparry</hi> Portion of our Gold Ore to be a Solid ſtone, and that ſo hard, that, being ſtruck with a piece of Steel, it would yield Sparks of Fire.</p>
                  <p>Whereas alſo I found, that the <hi>Spar</hi> of Lead Ore would be eaſily enough, and in a ſhort time, (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an hour) calcin'd to a kind of Lime; our Golden <hi>Spar,</hi> tho' kept ſome hours red hot in a Crucible, did not appear to be at all calcined. And whereas I had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd, that I could eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the <hi>Spar</hi> of Lead Ore in ſome <hi>Acid Menſtruums</hi> and even in deſtilled Vinegar it ſelf, I did not find, that our
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98188:102"/>
Golden <hi>Spar,</hi> tho' kept divers hours in ſtronger <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> as <hi>Spirit of Salt, Aqua Fortis,</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> was diſſolved or manifeſtly wrought upon by any of them; as if it were of a glaſſy Nature, as well as of a very hard One.</p>
                  <p>A piece of <hi>Spar,</hi> that had ſcarce any Gold at all that could be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being Hydroſtatically exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was in Specifick Gravity to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as 2 65/100 to 1. which Ponderoſity does but very little exceed That of white Marble, or That of ſome good <hi>Spar</hi> of Lead Ore that was compared with it.</p>
                  <p>If I had received a greater Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gold Ore, I ſhould have given a leſs imperfect Account of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But theſe Notes, ſuch as they are, may, perchance, not be unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to ſome of thoſe many Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and other Searchers for Mines, that have never ſeen true Gold Ore, or have not had Liberty to make any Tryals upon it, and yet are in Search of Gold Mines, eſpecially in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi>

notice, that I have ſeen an Engliſh Tin-Ore, Part of which I preſented to the King, wherein there lay, in little Cells, a good number of ſmall Leaves or Chips of Gold, which I ſaw there with pleaſure. And tho' the Tin-men, not being able to ſeparate them with Profit, uſually melted both the Metals together, and ſold the Product for mere Tin; yet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Gentleman, who was Owner of the Mine, aſſured me, that One of his Workmen, who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little Children, imployed them with good Profit, to pick the Gold with their ſmall Fingers out of the skilfully broken Ore. And <hi>tho'</hi> Lead-Mines be looked upon, as thoſe, which the Matter, whereof Gold is made, is ſeldomeſt found to be near, and does as it were avoid; <hi>yet,</hi> there is a place in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (whoſe Name I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not,) where, over a Lead Mine, upon or near the Surface of the Ground, they oftentimes find Grains or bigger pieces of Native Gold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Spar</hi>; ſome of which by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious

Owners favour, I was Maſter of, and thought ſometimes worthy of being preſented to that curious Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of Ores, his Highneſs <hi>Prince Rupert.</hi> And ſtill I have one bit of Native Metal by me, which, if I much miſtake not, I had from the ſame place: which Foſſile, tho' I found it Hydroſtatically (becauſe being Native I would not melt it) not to be, as the Owner ſuppos'd, pure Gold; yet Gold is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Metal in it, and the piece weighs forty odd Grains.</p>
                  <p>Since I wrote the laſt foregoing Lines, I have, in an old Collection of my Notes, found Three; whereof the <hi>Firſt</hi> is thus ſet down, <hi>A Grain of Scotch Gold, ſuch as Nature had made it, without any adhering Stone or Spar,</hi> weighed <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij + 21 Grains: The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> thus, <hi>Another Grain of the ſame Gold, that had here and there ſome little Stone or Spar ſticking to it, and partly incloſed in it,</hi> weighed <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij + 3 Grains; So that the Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Subſtance being, according to

                  <p>This Lightneſs of a Yellow Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal (heavier than Braſs or Silver) deſerves a Reflection; but I cannot ſtay to make it.</p>
                  <p>It ſeveral times happens, that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the leſſer Grains of Gold, that are more properly called <hi>Sand-Gold,</hi> there are found pieces, ſome of which I have ſeen, that are ſingly big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be tyed about with an Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, and ſo weighed in Water, as Lumps of Ore of other Metals are wont to be. And to ſuch bigger Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gold, 'tis manifeſt, by what has been already delivered, that our Hydroſtatical Way of exploring may be uſefully applyed. For ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the famous and diligent <hi>Merſennus,</hi> and ſome eſteemed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, pure Gold is to Water of the ſame Bulk, as (about) 18 to 1; and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98188:104"/>
by my <hi>Examen</hi> of very fine Gold, I found, that it equals <hi>about</hi> Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times the Weight of as much Water, (I ſay, <hi>about,</hi> becauſe I unhappily loſt the exacteſt of my Tryals upon Gold, among thoſe made upon the other Metals in a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Ballance) as is equal to it in Bulk; it will readily appear, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fragment propos'd be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure or not. For, if its Weight amount to near Nineteen times as much Water in Quantity, we may conclude it to be unallayed; and, as it wants leſs or more of this Pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, we may conclude it to be more or leſs pure.</p>

                  <p>'TIs known, that, ſince we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan effectually to cultivate the <hi>African</hi> Trade, it frequently brings into theſe Parts, beſides things of leſs value, conſiderable Quantities of what, from the moſt uſual Size of it,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98188:105"/>
is by many called <hi>Sand-Gold</hi>; but which, by reaſon of the very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Bulks of the Grains, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps juſtly be called <hi>Fragments of Gold</hi>; ſince being brought from the Maritime parts, where no Mines of Gold are yet found, they ſeem to have been broken off and waſhed away from hidden Veins by the violence of Waters, that, having carried them as far as they were able, left them a Prey to Men. Now, (becauſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be perhaps brought by, or for, ſome <hi>Virtuoſo)</hi> there is ſcarce any Gold that comes into <hi>Europe</hi> in Lumps, under the form of <hi>Ore</hi>; but a great deal that is brought from <hi>Guinea,</hi> (and thoſe other parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> which, for that reaſon, are comprized under the Name of the <hi>Golden Coaſt</hi>) in the Form chiefly of <hi>Sand</hi> or <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> groſſer or ſmaller, and partly alſo of leſs minute Pieces; it may conduce to the ſcope of theſe Papers to take notice, that, in making E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimates of the Genuineneſs, and the degrees of Purity of theſe native
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98188:105"/>
Fragments of Gold, our Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Way of exploring may be of no ſmall uſe.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> when we have once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Proportion between pure or exquiſitely refined Gold, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter equal to it in Bulk; (which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion I have lately given exactly enough, for our preſent purpoſe,) tis eaſie, by our Hydroſtatical Method, to examine the Fineneſs of any other Gold propoſed; ſo, at leaſt, as to know, whether it be perfectly Fine; and if it be not, whether it do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably fall ſhort of perfect Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But ſince of this I elſewhere treat, I think it more proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in this place, that when once a Man has found the true Specifick Gravity of a parcel of Sand-Gold, (ſmaller or courſer,) whoſe Degree of Fineneſs he knows by Collateral Tryals, or ſome other Means, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be) He may (as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly noted when I ſpoke of Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Ores,) take this Specifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for a Standard, with relation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98188:106"/>
to which, he may make his Eſtimates of the Fineneſs of other parcels of the like native Gold, that he is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to buy, or to examine. And, by this means, he may oftentimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that chief Fraud of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> whereof ſeveral Traders to the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Coaſt are not a little apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; as being in danger to be much damnified by it. For they complain, that, tho' the <hi>Blacks</hi> be otherwiſe, for the moſt part, but a dull ſort of People; yet they have often made a ſhift to cheat the Traders, by clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely mixing, with the right Sand-Gold, Filings of Copper, or rather of Braſs, whoſe Colour does ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that of Gold, that the Fraud is not eaſily diſcerned. And in the Account of a late Voyage, made by the French, to the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> to Trade eſpecially for Gold, 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the Officers were egregiouſly cheated by the <hi>Blacks,</hi> who, inſtead of paying them for the Wares they brought, with Powder of true Gold, gave them Powder of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98188:106"/>
Braſs, or gilt Copper, which thoſe that were not accuſtomed to make Tryal of, are, as the Relater complains, ſuch Wares, in a ſcarce evitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be cheated: as theſe French men confeſs they were in one day to the worth of a thouſand Crowns. But, in regard, that, as Tryal has informed me, Braſs is not quite half ſo heavy as fine Gold of the ſame Bulk; if there be any conſiderable Quantity of Filings of Braſs with the Gold; This Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being put into ſuch an Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Bucket, or wide-mouth'd Glaſs, as is mentioned in the Eſſay, will manifeſtly weigh leſs in Water, than if it were all Gold. And by comparing its Specifick Gravity, with that formerly found, to the Grain-Gold pitched upon for a Standard; the greater or leſſer Decrement of the ſuſpected Gold, will help to make an Eſtimate of the Quantity of Braſs, mingled with the natural Gold.</p>

For, 'tis known to Chymiſts, that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will not work upon Gold, and therefore, if there be Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Braſs mixt with it, the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> upon thoſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Colour betwixt blew and green, it will thereby acquire, will diſcover the Deceit. But, becauſe if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath mingled much Silver with the Gold, the Proof by <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will require Skill, and may puzzle thoſe that want it; I ſhall add, that good Spirit of Urine may be ſubſtituted in its ſtead. For, I elſewhere ſhew, that 'twill readily work upon Filings of Copper or Braſs in the Gold, and gain from them a fine blew Colour; and this being a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive, like the other, but harmleſs to <hi>moſt</hi> Bodies, and a good Medicine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98188:108"/>
for <hi>human</hi> Bodies in ſeveral Diſeaſes, (as the <hi>Jaundice, Pleuriſies,</hi> ſome kind of <hi>Feavers, Coughs</hi> and <hi>Aſthma's</hi>) may be fit to be carried about in Voyages, and to be preferr'd to <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi> And, to make the Operation of this Liquor on Filings of Braſs far more quick, than if the Solution be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted an ordinary Way; I thought upon the following Expedient. I took Filings of Braſs, (and the like may be done with thoſe of Copper,) amounting to the Weight but of Eight or Ten Grains, or perhaps leſs; and having with my Finger ſpread them ſomewhat thin upon a ſmall piece of white Paper, I moiſtned them throughly with good Spirit of fermented (or putrified) Urine, (which will not diſſolve Gold) that, by this means, the Air might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the diſſolutive Action of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi>; which, accordingly, it did ſo well, that, to the ſurprize of the Beholders, there appeared, in leſs than a quarter of an hour, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a few minutes, a manifeſt, if
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98188:108"/>
not alſo a deep and pleaſant, blew Colour upon the Paper, or on ſome of the Filings, (as both. Thoſe that carry with them Spirit of <hi>Hartshorn,</hi> or ſuch other Volatile Alcalys for Medicinal Uſes, (as ſome modern Ship-Chirurgeons do;) may, for a need, imploy That inſtead of Spirit of Urine. Nay, one may for the ſame purpoſe make uſe of Urine it ſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſtill'd, if it be Stale and Rank enough, (as it grows to be, ſooner in hot Airs than in others:) Since ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for Tryals ſake moiſtn'd with ſuch Urine ſome Filings of Braſs, thinly ſpread on a piece of Paper, there was a manifeſt Blewneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in about a quarter of an hour. But I thought alſo of another Way, which I preſumed would be better lik'd by moſt Traders, as more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious; becauſe the Agent, being in a dry Form, cannot, like Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liquors, be ſpilt; and tho' it be more eaſily procur'd, may ſerve the turn almoſt as well. This Agent is common <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> of which,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98188:109"/>
when I have occaſion to uſe it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a greater quantity to Powder, than I gueſs the quantity of Water, I ſhall need, will diſſolve; that the Liquor may be ſatiated with the Salt. With this Brine I throughly wet Filings of Braſs, (or Copper) after the forementioned manner, thinly ſpreading them with my Finger on a piece of Paper, or ſome other fit and flat Body; and in a ſhort time (as about a quarter of an hour or leſs,) there will appear a Greeniſh blew Colour, drawn from the Braſs by the Liquor: Which (Liquor,) I ſuppoſe, I need not tell you, will not work on the Gold, wherewith the Braſs is mingled.</p>

                  <p>I Have obſerved ſuch a Variety of appearances, and diſguiſes, of Metalline Bodies, and ſome other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, that I would adviſe thoſe that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98188:109"/>
are given to the Search of Mines, and other Foſſiles to have their Eyes always open, when they paſs (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by Land) from one place to another; that they may be ready to take notice of any unknown, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, Foſſile, that they chance to ſee in their Way; and that having taken it up, they do not neglect to ponde it in their hands (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little Practice 'twill not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to do, tho' not exactly, yet not unuſefully) and, if they judge it to exceed the Weight of Chryſtal, or Marble, to examine it Hydroſtatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their firſt Conveniency. For there are in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in divers other Countries, uſeful Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles, that are wont to be overlooked by the unskilful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I have found in this Kingdom, even upon, or very near, the Highways, Eagle-ſtones; and ſome other Minerals, that were not ſuſpected to be of Engliſh growth. And, I remember, that having occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Country, to paſs by the Work-houſe of an ingenious Potter,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98188:110"/>
that I ſometimes imploy'd in his Profeſſion; and having view'd the ground ſomewhat attentively, among ſome other uncommon Foſſiles that I took notice of, I made a diſcovery of <hi>Manganeſe,</hi> or <hi>Magneſia,</hi> whereof I gave the Potter an Advertiſement, which he afterwards thankfully made uſe of, having found the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral very proper for the glazing and and colouring of his Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this the only kindneſs, that skill in Mineralogy, as little as mine was, enabled me then to do him. For he having invited me to view, very privately, a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was great ſtore of a Foſſile Subſtance, that Men knew not what to make of, becauſe they had not ſeen, nor heard of, the like in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: The knowledge I had of ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Mines, made me quickly gueſs, What it was that was taken for an unknown Metal. For 'tis true, that this Mineral was not divided into Lumps of ſuch Shapes and Bigneſſes, as make glittering Foſſiles paſs for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98188:110"/>
Stones among the unskilful, ſuch as are the <hi>Marchaſites</hi> whereof they make <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and are found by the Sea-ſhore, in or near the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and, (tho' not ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly) in other parts of <hi>England</hi> (where I have found them;) but ran a great way (and I had not Time or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to try How far) under ground, like a Veine of Metalline Ore. But this notwithſtanding, I judg'd the Mineral to be but a <hi>Marchaſite,</hi> in a Form, unuſual indeed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but which is not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers in ſome parts of <hi>Italy</hi>; which Conjecture I found true the ſame day, by ſome eaſie Tryals, that manifeſted it to abound much more in <hi>Vitriolate</hi> Salt, than any <hi>Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi> that I had examined in the form of Stones. So that, tho' I had no opportunity to try, whether or no it contained any better Metal than Iron; yet I concluded, that, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> it might be employed to to make ſtore of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> in far leſs time, and with far leſs coſt, than the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98188:111"/>
                     <hi>Marchaſites</hi> made uſe uſe of, in the <hi>Vitriol</hi> Works at <hi>Deptford,</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I remember alſo, that a Mineral of an odd, tho' pretty, appearance, being ſent me, whoſe Species was unknown to the Mine-men that dug it up, I gueſs'd that it was a Foſſile, that I had not found in a good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Catalogue of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Minerals, (namely) the Ore of <hi>Biſmuth.</hi> And in this Conjecture ſome Tryals, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of that Mineral, ſufficiently confirmed me; and gave me cauſe to be ſorry, that the Vein, that afforded it, was ſo very ſmall, as the Diggers found it, of an Ore, that has Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Curious enough; and is by ſome famous Chymiſts affirmed to have ſome that are, not only Rare, but Wonderful.</p>
                  <p>But the chief thing that invites me to recommend, in this place, to thoſe that Travel, an heedful eye on the Ore-like, or ponderous Subſtances, that may occur to them, is, That One of the Applications of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

Remark, about the Specifick Gravity of Foſſiles, may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Uſe, that has not, that I know of, been made by Mineraliſts, and and which yet I thought fit not to overlook: becauſe I ſee no need, we ſhould be confin'd to examine only thoſe Foſſiles, whereof we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Parcels, big enough to be weigh'd in Water in the entire Body. For beſides other Minerals, that may be found profitable to the Phyſician, the Drugſter, or the Mineraliſt; the Ores, or Wombs, of Metals themſelves, may be divers times found diſguis'd in the Form of Earth, or of Mud, eaſie to be dry'd: Which Foſſiles, tho' (becauſe they chance not be found in Lumps) unfit to be kept imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſuſpended by an Horſe-hair; may be conveniently enough exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the help of a Glaſs-Jar, whoſe Weights in Air, and Water, and their Difference, (which gives the Specifick Weight of the Veſſel) have been taken once for all, which I uſually call an Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Bucket.

                  <p>TO manifeſt, that This Expedient may be of uſe in divers Caſes, I ſhall only here obſerve, that a late Author, who hath publiſhed an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Swedland,</hi> declares, that one of the beſt ſorts of <hi>Swediſh</hi> Iron (which, you know, is much eſteemed in its kind) is divers times found, in the Form of a red Mud, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Lakes, or far leſſer Stagnant Waters: which I the more readily believe, becauſe I have found ſome Engliſh <hi>Okers</hi> (that paſs but for red Earth, or Stone of that Colour;) to be richer in Iron, than I found ſome famous Ores of that Metal to be. And another experienced Writer, who gives us an Account of the Gold and Silver Mines of <hi>America,</hi> among which he ſpent ſeveral Years, takes notice, that Gold it ſelf is found, from time to time, diſguiſed into a

I have obſerved ſome <hi>Europaean</hi> Diamonds, as many call a ſort of clear and finely-Figured Chryſtals, to grow in a red Earth; whence I have taken up pretty ſtore of them. And an inquiſitive Traveller, who has been in the <hi>Indies,</hi> preſented me with a certain Earth, which he affirmed to be from the Diamond Mines, (I preſume, in the Kingdom of <hi>Colchon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>) which I found to be alſo red, and which I made ſome Tryals of, that belong not to this place.</p>

                  <p>BUt the profitableſt Uſe, that a Mineraliſts may make of our Hydroſtatical Bucket, is, to imploy
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98188:113"/>
it much in weighing Variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Sands, and Gravels; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome hereafter to bementioned.</p>
                  <p>And to let you ſee, by an eaſie Inſtance, how apt we are to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look Sands for want of trying them by Weight, I ſhall not tell you, that I have ſometimes ſeen a ſort of Sand that was ſlighted as common or worthleſs, which, being waſhed and viewed in a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> tho' none of the beſt, looked like an Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate of ſmall Granats, and perhaps was ſo; but ſhall here content my ſelf to inſtance in that black Sand, that is commonly uſed in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, only to dry up the Ink of Words that have been new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written. For having obſerved when I had ſome quantity of this in my hand, that it was manifeſtly heavier than common Sand; I thought it worth the being examined by the Hydroſtatical Bucket; by which Tryal, that which we imployed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be to Water of the ſame Bulk, near about as 4 6/10 to 1. And
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98188:114"/>
having, for Reaſons that I cannot ſtay to mention, judged this Sand to be a Mineral of a Martial Nature, I was confirmed in my Conjecture, by mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it down with two or three parts of Antimony, and caſting it into an Iron Cone. But I was more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the ſame Conjecture, when, having try'd it with a vigorous Loadſtone, I found it to be far richer in Metal, than any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iron Ores I had made Tryal of, and (except perhaps One) than any of the Outlandiſh: For, having taken, at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, ſome Drams out of a much larger Quantity, and weigh'd it; I found, that at leaſt Seven parts of Eight would eaſily be taken up by the Magnet. But ſuch Obſervations as theſe, are not the things that chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move me to recommend the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of Sands and Gravels to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſt; particularly, thoſe ſorts of them, that, being ſomewhat ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, are Reddiſh or Yellow, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they retain thoſe Colours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been made red hot, and quenched in cold Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:98188:114"/>Therefore to proceed to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of richer Sands, 'tis known, That, from the Coaſt of <hi>Guyny, Europaean</hi> Traders, of ſeveral Nations, do yearly bring Gold, to a great value, which is waſht or pickt out of the Sand. And even in <hi>Europe</hi> there are Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whoſe Sand is inricht by Grains of Gold, for which the <hi>Tagus</hi> that runs by <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and <hi>Pactolus,</hi> were famous among the Ancients. I knew an induſtrious Chymiſt, who own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that he got Gold with Profit, from the Sand, which he found in ſome places of the Banks of the <hi>Rhine</hi>: and there is a litle River in <hi>Savoy</hi> proceeding from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains there, on whoſe Banks, after a Land Flood, I ſaw poor People bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie themſelves in ſeeking for Grains of Gold. Some Tryal, (alſo) that I cauſed purpoſely to be made, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me in a Conjecture, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may hereafter prove Beneficial to many; namely, that the Sands of divers places, if they be Skilfully treated by a dextrous Chymiſt, may
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98188:115"/>
afford much more Gold, than is pickt or waſht, out of them in Form of Grains. For beſides, that there may be many Atoms, or Corpuſcles, of Gold that are ſo very minute, and ſtick ſo cloſe to Grains of Sand, that they are neither taken notice of by the Eye, nor ſeparable by waſhing, and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; beſides this, I ſay, there may, as I conceive, be many Particles of Gold incorporated with the Body of the Sand, which may be a Kind of Womb for matter of a Golden Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a skilful Artiſt, by the help of proper Additaments, may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate with Profit eſpecially, if, with <hi>Litharge</hi> or <hi>Minium,</hi> he firſt reduce the Sand to a Glaſs, and then take care to get the <hi>Volatile Gold,</hi> by giving it a pure Body fit to retain and fix it, ſuch as is fine Silver: Out of which, I remember, we ſeparated by <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> (tho' without Profit, becauſe of the Charges, and of the ſmall Quantity we could work with at once,) from as much vitrified Sand, and two or three fluxing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98188:115"/>
of ſmall price, as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one Crucible, (that broke too, before Operation was near done,) ſixteen Grains of pure Gold; that you may yet ſee, if you deſire it.</p>

                  <p>IT need not ſtartle you, that, in reciting this Experiment, I made mention of <hi>Volatile Gold.</hi> For, tho', I know, that divers learned Men, and ſome able Chymiſts themſelves, look upon it as a Fictitious thing; and that ſeems to bear a kind of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in its very Name; in regard of the perfect Fixity they preſume to be an Eſſential property of Gold: yet I do not ſcruple to diſſent from them, being warranted ſo to do by my own Experience. For, I have, more than once, made uſe of a Way, wherein, by the help of an Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inconſiderable as to Bulk, and leſs as to Weight; one may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98188:116"/>
a naked Fire, and in a Glaſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, ſublime Gold, (not prepared by previous Calcination) ſometimes in the Form of a yellow, or golden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, Salt; and ſometimes, when the Operation ſucceeded better, in the Form of thin Chryſtals prettily ſhapt, Gloſſy, and as red as Rubies. But this upon the by; it may perhaps be more uſeful to Searchers of rich Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles not found in Lumps, if I take this occaſion to obſerve, that when they meet with Sands, Earths, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Fragments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably exceed Chryſtal in Specifick Gravity; and by the Place wherein they are found, or by other Tokens, give hopes of their containing Corpuſcles of a golden Nature: When this, I ſay, happens, it will not be adviſeable, haſtily to reject ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but rather carefully to try, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not deſerve a better U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. For, having ſometimes had the opportunity to diſcover Corpuſcles of <hi>Mars,</hi> as Chymiſts call Iron and Steel, in a far greater Variety of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98188:116"/>
Foſſiles, and of Diſguiſes, than even many noted Chymiſts would have imagined, or ſome of them could, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heedful Tryal, diſcover; I was much confirmed in my Suſpicion, That Corpuſcles of a Golden Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be concealed in divers Bodies, which are thought not to contain <hi>any</hi> Metal; and that in more of thoſe Minerals, that are lookt upon as Ores of ſome <hi>other</hi> Metal, becauſe of its being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly Predominant, there may be mingled pretty ſtore of Particles of Gold or Silver; which (becauſe of the greater Quantity of that other Metal, or Mineral, that doth, as it were cover or diſguiſe them;) lye unperceived, &amp; uſually unſuſpected, by Perſons not very well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch Matters; and yet may, by One that is very skilful, be ſeparated even with Profit.</p>

                  <p>BUt the Grounds of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Suſpicion being as yet but Conjectural, I ſhall decline the particular mention of them in this place; and ſhall rather <hi>Adviſe,</hi> with reference to Ores in General, that thoſe that would apply the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks to Them, do labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Samples of the Ores of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mines, eſpecially if they be found in the ſame Country; and do either by Tryal or ſtrict Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inform themſelves, what Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Metal, that denominates them, they contain. For theſe Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ores and Minerals, being carefully weighed in Air and Water, and their Specifick Gravities, being thereby made known, they may ſerve for a kind of Standard, by Compariſon whereto we may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes

make not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful Eſtimates of the Metalline Portions contained in other Parcels of Ore, of that <hi>Species,</hi> whether afforded by the ſame Mine, or Vein of it, or by any other of the ſame Metal) Hydroſtatically examined.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance, our Engliſh Lead-Ores, that are worth taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, may be, for diſtinction ſake, divided into Three Kinds or Orders, and in each of theſe, there may be allowed a Latitude for greater, or leſſer, Degrees of Goodneſs. The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſort is of thoſe Ores, that, in the ordinary Way of melting, hold ſome of them from 30 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Lead, in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Weight of Ore, to 40; and others to 45 <abbr>lb</abbr> of the ſame Metal, and theſe by ſeveral are ſlighted, as mean; and ſcarce, if at all, worth work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; eſpecially, thoſe that hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 35 or 40. As for the <hi>Second</hi> ſort, that reaches from 45. to 60 <abbr>lb</abbr>, in the hundred; the moſt uſual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, I have found in many Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98188:118"/>
hath been about half the Weight of the Ore in clean and Malleable Lead. Theſe Ores are thought in, differently good and worth work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But other Ores compriſed in this Second ſort, held about 55, and ſome near 60, and theſe were lookt upon, not only as Good, but pretty Rich. And for the <hi>Third</hi> Sort, it conſiſts of thoſe that yield from 60 to 80. in the hundred, and theſe Ores are juſtly reputed very Rich, (in lead) eſpecially theſe that come any thing near 80; for, I confeſs, I never met with any that reacht ſo far, but was aſſured by an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; skilful Gentleman, Maſter of his Majeſties Royal Mint, that he had found ſome ſuch upon Tryal. But for me, I think that I have not above twice or thrice met with any that yielded me above 75. Theſe lookt exceedingly Promiſing, as if they were all Metal, and I obſerved, whether the thing were caſual or not, ſome Lumps to be compoſed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98188:118"/>
of divers great Cubes like Dice, ſticking very hard to one another.</p>
                  <p>The Conſiderations, that moved me to offer the Advice given at the beginning of this Section, invited me to make Reſearches of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Gravity, <hi>not only</hi> of divers Engliſh Ores, as of Lead, Tin, &amp;c. Of which I had carefully made a Collection, (that was loſt by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fire, broke out in the place where I kept them,) but of the Ores that were preſented me from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America</hi>; as <hi>Swediſh</hi> Copper and Iron Ores, <hi>German</hi> Silver and Tin-Glaſs Ores; <hi>Hungarian</hi> Antimonial Ores; <hi>New Engliſh</hi> Lead, Iron, and Copper Ores, &amp;c. The Effects of ſome few of which Reſearches, that chanced to come to hand, whilſt I was ſeeking for ſome Hydroſtatical Tryals of Drugs, I thought it not amiſs to inſert in a Table annext to the <hi>Medicina Hydroſtatica</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perhaps they may be of ſome

            <p>WHen I began to ſend the Eſſay, called, <hi>Medicina Hydroſtatica,</hi> to the Preſs, and drew up the foregoing Preface to it, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſhould in the ſame Book or Volume, be accompany'd by another Help or two, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, and Improve the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> But when the Eſſay it ſelf, and the annex'd Epiſtle about a previous Exploration of Ores had been Printed off; I could not but perceive, that the Bulk of thoſe two Tracts ſo far exceeded what I expected, that if I ſubjoyned what I at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to add to it, it would prove a mis-ſhapen Book, and inconvenient to be open'd, wherefore it ſeemed expedient to divide the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Work into two Volumes or Tomes, whereof what had already paſt the Preſs, ſhould make the firſt, which that it might be the ſooner ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable ſhould forthwith come abroad by it ſelf, and the Second ſhould conſiſt partly of the other Papers abovementioned, as relating to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> and partly, of a Supplement to the firſt Tome, containing divers Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> that by miſtake were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and are fit to be there ſupply'd out of a fuller Copy, then that which by an Overſight was made uſe of at the Preſs.</p>
