            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:33516:48"/>I have not wiſely, nor timely conſidered that the grace of repentance is thy heavenly Gift, and ought to be early begg'd of thee by Prayers and Tears; but have ſinfully imagin'd it in mine own power to repent when I would; when I have been neither ſure of time to ask it, of hope to obtain it, grace to receive it, or of mercy to enjoy it.</p>

unto ſin daily (as I ought) that this my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for ſin hath been but ſuperficial, my hope of thy pardon deceitful, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my very mortification to ſin, exceeding ſinful.</p>

               <p>I have readily remembred that there is no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſt Jeſus; but ſinfully forgotten that it is to thoſe only which walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit: thus have I wretchedly put of the puniſhment of ſin, from the guilt of it, and am thereby become guilty of thy double pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; that for the committing of evil, and this for denying thee (in Chriſt) to be the rewarder only of good.</p>
               <p>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</p>
               <p>I have willingly believed, that it is the blood of God which cleanſeth me from all iniquity; and that if I believe in thee, although I were dead yet ſhall I live, and that if I live, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thee, I ſhall never die: but I have wilfully forgotten, that by my daily ſinning, I have daily trampled on thy precious blood, and am therefore dead while I live; and may therefore juſtly fear, that (without mercy) I muſt live in endleſs torments when I am dead.</p>

               <p>Lord be merciful to be a ſinner.</p>

               <p>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</p>
               <p>I have not ſo freely, and ſo fully forgiven, and forgotten thoſe injuries which man hath offer'd unto me; as I ought to have done, but have too often come unto thy holy Table with reproach in my mouth, and malice in my heart: Thus, O Lord, have I had ſinfully to do with malice, that ſtood in ſo grea need of mercy; and by refuſing to forgive my brother upon Earth, may juſtly fear

Doth the more furiouſly reiterate his buffetings, the more zealouſly doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Prayers; and at length he receives this comfortable anſwer, to his ſorrowful complaint, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee;</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cure thy wound, and to pardon thy guilt; ſufficient to ſtrengthen thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to perfect thy deliverance.</p>
