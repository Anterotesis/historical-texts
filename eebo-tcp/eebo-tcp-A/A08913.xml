            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Plague is a cruell and contagious Diſeaſe, which euerie-where, like a common Diſeaſe, inuading Man and Beaſt, kils verie many; being attended, and as it were aſſociated with a continuall Feauer, Botches, Carbunkles, Spots, Nauſeouſneſſe, Vomitings, and other ſuch maligne accidents. This Diſeaſe is not ſo pernitious or hurtfull, by any Elementarie qualitie, as from a certaine poyſonous and venenate malignitie, the force whereof exceeds the condition of common putrefaction. Yet I will not deny, but that it is more hurtfull in certaine Bodyes, Times, and Regions, as alſo many other Diſeaſes, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> makes mention. But from hence we can onely collect, that the force and malignitie of the Plague may be increaſed, or diminiſhed according to the condition of the Elementarie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3293:4"/>
qualities concurring with it, but not the whole nature and eſſence thereof to depend thereon.</p>
               <p>This peſtiferous Poyſon principally aſſailes the Vitall Spirit, the Store-houſe and originall whereof is the Heart, ſo that if the Vitall Spirit proue ſtronger, it driues it farre from the Heart; but if weaker, it being ouercome and weakned by the hoſtile aſſault, flies backe into the Fortreſs of the Heart, by the like contagion infecting the Heart, and ſo the whole Body, being ſpred into it by the paſſages of the Arteries.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, peſtilent Feauers are ſome-times ſimple and folitarie, other-whiles aſſociated with a troope of other affects, as Botches, Carbunkles, Blaines, and Spots, of one or more colours.</p>
               <p>It is probable ſuch affects haue their originall from the expulfiue Facultie, whether ſtrong or weake, prouoked by the malignitie of the raging matter: Yet aſſuredly diuers ſymptomes and changes ariſe according to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body of the Patient, and condition of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in which the virulencie of the Plague is chiefely inherent, and laſtly in the nature of the efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p>I thought good by this deſcription to expreſſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Plague, at this my firſt entrance into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for we can ſcarce comprehend it in a proper definition. For although the force thereof be definite and certaine in Nature, yet it is not altogether certaine and manifeſt in Mens minds, becauſe it neuer happens after one ſort: ſo that in ſo great varietie it is verie difficult to ſet downe any thing generall and certaine.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a confirmed, conſtant, and receiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all Ages amongſt Chriſtians, that the Plague and other Diſeaſes which violently aſſaile the life of Man, are often ſent by the iuſt anger of God puniſhing our offences. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath long ſince taught it, ſaying, <hi>Shall there be affliction, ſhall there be euill in a Citie, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> On which truly we ought alwayes to meditate, and that for two cauſes: The firſt is, that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beare this in mind, that we enioy health, liue, moue, and haue our beings from God, and deſcends from that Father of Light: and for this cauſe we are alwayes bound to giue him great and exceeding thankes. The other is, that knowing the calamities, by ſending whereof the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine anger proceeds to reuenge, we may at length repend, and leauing the way of wickedneſſe, walke in the pathes of godlineſſe. For thus we ſhall learne to ſee in God, our ſelues, the Heauen and Earth, the true knowledge of the cauſes of the Plague, and by a certaine Diuine Philoſophy to teach, God to be the beginning and cauſe of the ſecond cauſes, which well without the firſt cauſe cannot goe about, nor attempt, much leſſe performe any thing. for from hence they borrow their force, order, and conſtancie of order; ſo that they ſerue as Inſtruments for God, who rules and gouernes vs, and the whole World, to performe all his workes, by that conſtant courſe of order, which he hath appointed vnchangeable from the beginning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the cauſe of a Plague is not to be attributed to theſe neere and inferiour cauſes or beginnings, as the Epicures, and Lucianiſts commonly doe, who attributing too much,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3293:5"/>
yea all things to Nature, haue left nothing to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence. On the contrarie, we ought to thinke and beleeue in all our thoughts, That euen as God by his omnipotent Power hath created all things of nothing, ſo he by his eternall Wiſedome preſerues and gouernes the ſame, leads and enclines them as he pleaſe, yea verily at his pleaſure changes their order, and the whole courſe of Nature.</p>
               <p>This cauſe of an extraordinarie Plague as we confeſſe and acknowledge, ſo here we will not proſecute it any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but thinke fit to leaue it to Diuines, becauſe it exceeds the bounds of Nature in which I will now containe my ſelfe. Wherefore let vs come to the naturall cauſes of the Plague.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Naturall cauſes of the Plague, and chiefely of the Seminarie of the Plague by the corruption of the Aire.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE generall and naturall cauſes of the Plague are abſolutely two, that is, the infection of corrupt Aire, and a preparation and fitneſſe of corrupt humours to take that infection; for it is noted before out of the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> that our humours may be corrupted, and degenerate into ſuch an alienation which may equall the malignitie of Poyſon.</p>
               <p>The Aire is corrupted, when the foure ſeaſons of the yeere haue not their ſeaſonableneſſe, or degenerate from themſelues, either by alteration, or by alienation: as if the conſtitution of the whole yeere be moyſt and rainie by reaſon of groſſe and blacke Clouds; if the Winter be gentle and warme without any Northerly wind, which is cold and dry, and by that meanes contrarie to putrefaction; if the Spring which ſhould be temperate, ſhall be faultie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3293:5"/>
in any exceſſe of diſtemper; if the Autumne ſhall be omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous by Fires in the Aire, with Starres ſhooting, and as it were falling downe, or terrible Comets, neuer ſeene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome diſaſter; if the Summer be hot, cloudy and moiſt, and without Winds, and the Clouds flye from the South into the North. Theſe and ſuch like vnnaturall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſeaſons of the yeere, were neuer better, or more excellently handled by any, then by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Booke <hi>Epidemion.</hi> Therefore the Aire from hence drawes the Seeds of Corruption and the Peſtilence, which at the length, the like exceſſe of qualities being brought in, it ſends into the humours of our Bodyes, chiefly ſuch as are thin and ſerous. Although the Peſtilence doth not alwaies neceſſarily ariſe from hence, but ſome-whiles ſome other kind of cruell and infectious Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But neither is the Aire onely corrupted by theſe ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cauſes, but alſo by putrid and filthy ſtinking vapours ſpread abroad through the Aire encompaſſing vs, from the Bodyes or Carkaſſes of things not buried, gapings or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſes of the Earth, or Sinkes and ſuch like places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened: For the Sea often ouer-flowing the Land in ſome places, and leauing in the Mudde, or hollowneſſes of the Earth (cauſed by Earth-quakes) the huge Bodyes of monſtrous Fiſhes, which it hides in its Waters, hath giuen both the occaſion and matter of a Plague. For thus in our time a Whale caſt vpon the Tuſcane ſhore, preſently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Plague ouer all that Countrey.</p>
               <p>But as Fiſhes infect and breed a Plague in the Aire, ſo the Aire being corrupted, often cauſes a Peſtilence in the Sea amongſt Fiſhes, eſpecially when they either ſwim on the top of the Water, or are infected by the peſtilent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the Earth lying vnder them, and ryſing into the Aire thorough the Body of the Water, the latter whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, hapneth but ſeldome. But it often chances, that the Plague raging in any Countrey, many Fiſhes are caſt vp on all the Coaſt, and may be ſeene lying on great heapes. But ſulphurous vapours, or ſuch as partake of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3293:6"/>
any other maligne qualitie, ſent forth from places vnder the ground by gapings and gulfes opened by Earthquakes, not onely corrupt the Aire, but alſo infect and taint the Seeds, Plants, and all the Fruits which we eat, and ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the peſtilent corruption into vs, and thoſe Beaſts on which we feed, together with our nouriſhment. The truth whereof, <hi>Empedocles</hi> made manifeſt, who by ſhutting vp a great Gulfe of the Earth opened in a Valley betweene two Mountaines, freed all Sicily from a Plague cauſed from thence.</p>
               <p>If Winds ryſing ſodainly ſhall driue ſuch filthy exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from thoſe Regions in which they were peſtiferous, into other places, they alſo will carrie the Plague with them thither.</p>
               <p>If it be thus, ſome will ſay, it ſhould ſeeme that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſtinking and putrid exhalations ariſe, as about ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pooles, Sinkes, and Shambles, there ſhould the Plague reigne, and ſtraight ſuffocate with its noyſome Poyſon, the People which worke in ſuch places: but experience finds this falſe.</p>
               <p>We doe anſwer, that the putrifaction of the Plague is farre different, and of another kind then this common, as that which partakes of a certaine ſecret malignitie, and wholly contrarie to our liues, and of which we cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giue a plaine and manifeſt reaſon. Yet that vulgar pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction whereſoeuer it be, doth eaſily and quickly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and welcome the peſtiferous contagion as often as, and whenſoeuer it comes, as ioyned vnto it by a certaine familiaritie, and at the length, it ſelfe degenerating into a peſtiferous malignitie, certainely no otherwiſe then thoſe Diſeaſes which ariſe in the Plague time, the putrid Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our Bodyes, which at the firſt wanted virulencie and contagion, as Vlcers, putrid Feauers, and other ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes rayſed by the peculiar default of the humours, eaſily degenerate into peſtilence, preſently receiuing the tainture of the Plague, to which they had before a certain prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.

all Men to ſhun ſuch exceeding ſtinking places, as they would the Plague it ſelfe: that there may be no preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Bodyes, or humours to catch that infection, (without which, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, the Agent hath no power ouer the Subiect, for otherwiſe in a Plague time the Sickneſſe would equally ſeaze vpon all) ſo that the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the peſtiferous qualitie may preſently follow that diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>But when we ſay the Aire is peſtilent, we doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſincere, elementarie, and ſimple as it is of its owne nature, for ſuch is not ſubiect to putrefaction, but that which is polluted with ill vapours ryſing from the Earth, ſtanding Waters, Vaults, or Sea, and degenerates, and is changed from its natiue puritie and ſimplicitie. But certainly amongſt all the conſtitutions of the Aire fit to receiue a peſtilent corruption, there is none more fit then a hot, moyſt, and ſtill ſeaſon: For the exceſſe of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities eaſily cauſes putrefaction. Wherefore the South Wind reigning, which is hot and moyſt, and principally in places neere the Sea, there Fleſh cannot long be kept, but it preſently is tainted and corrupted.</p>
               <p>Further, we muſt know, that the peſtilent malignitie which riſes from the Carcaſſes or Bodyes of Men, is more eaſily communicated to Men; that which riſes from Oxen, to Oxen; and that which comes from Sheepe, to Sheepe, by a certaine ſympathy &amp; familiaritie of Nature: no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the Plague which ſhall ſeaze vpon ſome one in a Family, doth preſently ſpread more quickly amongſt the reſt of that Family, by reaſon of the ſimilitude of temper, then amongſt others of another Family diſagreeing in their whole temper. Therefore the Aire thus altered and eſtranged from its goodneſſe of nature neceſſarily drawne in by inſpiration and tranſpiration, brings in the Seeds of the Plague, and ſo conſequently the Plague it ſelfe, into Bodyes prepared and made ready to receiue it.</p>

               <p>Humours putrefie either from fulneſſe, which breeds obſtruction, or by diſtemperate exceſſe, or laſtly, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of corrupt matter and euill iuice, which ill feeding doth ſpecially cauſe to abound in the Body: For the Plague often followes the drinking of dead and muſtie Wines, muddy and ſtanding Waters which receiue the ſinkes and filth of a Citie, and Fruits and Puls eaten without diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſcarcitie of other Corne, as Peaſe, Beanes, Lentiles, Vetches, Acornes, the Roots of Ferne, and Graſſe made into Bread. For ſuch meats obſtruct, heape vp ill humours in the Body, and weaken the ſtrength of the Faculties, from whence proceeds a putrefaction of humours, and in that putrefaction a preparation and diſpoſition to receiue, conceiue, and bring forth the Seeds of the Plague: which the filthy Scabbes, maligne Sores, rebellious Vlcers, and putrid Feuers being all fore-runners of greater putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and corruption doe teſtifie. Vehement paſſions of the Mind, as Anger, Sorrow, Griefe, Vexation, and Feare helpe forward this corruption of humours, all which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Natures diligence and care of concoction: For as in the Dogge-dayes the Lees of Wine ſubſeding to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome are by the ſtrength and efficacie of heat drawne vp to the top, and mixed with the whole ſubſtance of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3293:7"/>
Wine, as it were by a certaine ebullition, or working: So Melancholly humours being the Dregges or Lees of the Blood, ſtirred vp by the Paſſions of the Mind, defile or taint all the Blood with their feculent impuritie.</p>

Yet notwithſtanding, thoſe Airie impreſſions doe not ſolely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3293:8"/>
corrupt the Aire, but there may be alſo others rayſed by the Sunne from the filthy exhalations, and poyſonous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the Earth and Waters, or of dead Carkaſſes, which by their vnnaturall mixture, eaſily corrupt the Aire ſubiect to alteration, as which is thin and moyſt, from whence diuers Epidemiall Diſeaſes, and ſuch as euerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſeaze vpon the common ſort, according to the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds of corruptions, ſuch as that famous Catarrhe with difficultie of breathing, which in the yeere 1510 going almoſt ouer the World, and raged ouer all the Cities and Townes of France, with great heauineſſe of the Head (whereupon the French named it <hi>Cucuita)</hi> with a ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Heart and Lungs, and a Cough, a continuall Feauer, and ſometimes rauing.</p>
               <p>This although it ſeazed vpon many more then it killed, yet becauſe they commonly dyed who were either let Blood, or purged, it ſhewed it ſelfe peſtilent by that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and peculiar and vnheard of kind of malignitie.</p>
               <p>Such alſo was the Engliſh Sweating-ſickneſſe, or Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Feauer, which vnuſuall with a great deale of terrour invaded all the lower parts of Germany, and the Low Countreys, from the yeere 1525 vnto the yeere 1530, and that chiefly in Autumne.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as this peſtilent Diſeaſe entred into any Citie, ſuddainly two or three hundred fell ſicke on one day, then it departing thence to ſome other place, the people ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with it languiſhing, fell downe in a ſwound, and lying in their Beds, ſwet continually, hauing a Feauer, a frequent, quicke, and vnequall Pulſe, neither did they leaue ſweating till the diſeaſe left them, which was in one or two dayes at the moſt: yet freed of it, they languiſhed long after, they all had a beating, or palpitation of the Heart, which held ſome for two or three yeeres, and others all their life after.</p>
               <p>At the firſt beginning it killed many, before the force of it was knowne: but afterwards verie few, when it was found out by practice and vſe, that thoſe who furthered, and continued their ſweats, and ſtrengthened themſelues
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3293:8"/>
with Cordials, were all reſtored. But at certaine times many other popular Diſeaſes ſpring vp, as putrid Feauers, Fluxes, Bloody Fluxes, Catarrhes, Coughes, Phrenzies, Sqinancies, Pleuriſies, Inflamations of the Lungs, Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Eyes, Apoplexies, Lethargies, ſmall Pockes, and Meaſels, Scabbes, Carbuncles, and maligne Puſtules. Wherefore the Plague is not alwayes, nor euerie-where of one and the ſame kind, but of diuers; which is the cauſe that diuers names are impoſed vpon it, according to the varietie of the effects it brings, and ſymptomes which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie it, and kinds of putrefaction, and hidden quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Aire.</p>
               <p>They affirme, when the Plague is at hand, that Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes grow in greater aboundance out of the Earth, and vpon the ſurface thereof many kinds of poyſonous <hi>inſecta</hi> creepe in great numbers, as Spiders, Caterpillers, Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes, Graſſe-hoppers, Beetles, Hornets, Waſpes, Flyes, Scorpions, Snailes, Locuſts, Toads, Wormes, &amp; ſuch things as are the of-ſpring of putrefaction. And alſo wild Beaſts tyred with the vaporous malignitie of their Dennes, and Caues in the Earth, forſake them; and Moles, Toads, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Snakes, Lezards, Aſpes, and Crocodiles are ſeene to flye away, and remoue their habitations in great troopes. For theſe, as alſo ſome other Creatures, haue a manifeſt power by the guift of God, and the inſtinct of Nature, to preſage changes of Weather, as Raines, Showers, and faire Weather; and Seaſons of the yeere, as the Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter, which they teſtifie by their Singing, Chirping, Crying, Flying, Playing, and Beating their Wings, aud ſuch like ſignes; ſo alſo they haue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a Plague at hand. And moreouer, the Carcaſſes of ſome of them which tooke leſſe heed of themſelues, ſuffocated by the peſtiferous Poyſon of the ill Aire contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Earth, may be euerie-where found, not onely in their Dennes, but alſo in the plaine Fields.</p>
               <p>Theſe vapours corrupted not by a ſimple putrefaction, but an occult malignitie, are drawne out of the Bowels of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3293:9"/>
the Earth into the Aire, by the force of the Sunne and Starres, and thence condenſed into Clouds, which by their falling vpon Corne, Trees, and Graſſe, infect and corrupt all things, which the Earth produces, and alſo killes thoſe Creatures which feed vpon them; yet brute Beaſts ſooner then Men, as which ſtoop and hold their Heads downe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Ground (the maintainer and breeder of this Poyſon) that they may get their Food from thence.

               <p>But on the contrarie, that Peſtilence which proceeds from ſome maligne qualitie from aboue, by reaſon of euill and certaine coniunction of the Starres, is more hurtfull to Men and Birds, as thoſe, who are neerer to Heauen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing declared the ſignes fore-ſhewing a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence: now we muſt ſhew by what meanes we may ſhun the imminent danger thereof, and defend our ſelues from it. No preuention ſeemed more certaine to the Ancients, then moſt ſpeedily to remoue into places farre diſtant from the infected place, and to be moſt ſlow in their returne thither againe. But thoſe who by reaſon of their buſineſſe, or employments cannot change their habitation, muſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally haue care of two things: The firſt is, that they ſtrengthen their Bodyes, and the principall parts thereof againſt the daily imminent inuaſions of the Poyſon, or the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3293:9"/>
peſtiferous and venenate Aire. The other, that they abate the force of it, that it may not imprint its virulencie in the Body; which may be done by correcting the exceſſe of the qualitie inclining towards it, by the oppoſition of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. For if it be hotter, then is meet it muſt be tempered with cooling things; if too cold, with heating things: yet this will not ſuffice. For we ought beſides, to amend and purge the corruptions of the venenate malignitie diffuſed through it, by ſmels and perfumes reſiſting the Poyſon thereof. The Body will be ſtrengthened and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſiſt the infected Aire, if it want excrementitious humors, which may be procured by purging and bleeding, and for the reſt a conuenient dyet appointed, as ſhunning much varietie of Meats, and hot and moyſt things, and all ſuch which are eaſily corrupted in the Stomacke, and cauſe obſtructions, ſuch as thoſe things which be made by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit-makers; we muſt ſhun ſatietie and drunkenneſſe, for both of them weakens the Powers, which are preſerued by the moderate vſe of Meats of good iuice.</p>
               <p>Let moderate exerciſes in a cleere Aire, and free from any venemous tainture, preceed your Meales.</p>
               <p>Let the Belly haue due euacuation either by Nature or Art.</p>
               <p>Let the Heart, the ſeat of Life, and the reſt of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els be ſtrengthened with Cordials and Antidotes applyed and taken (as we ſhall here-after ſhew) in the forme of Epithemes, Ointments, Emplaſters, Waters, Pilles, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Tablets, Opiates, Fumigations, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Make choyce of a pure Aire and free from all pollution, and farre remote from ſtinking places, for ſuch is moſt fit to preſerue life, to recreate and repaire the Spirits, whereas on the contrarie a cloudy, or miſtie Aire, and ſuch as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with groſſe and ſtinking vapours, duls the Spirits, deiects the Appetite, makes the Body faint and ill coloured, oppreſſes the Heart, and is the breeder of many diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The Northern Wind is healthfull, becauſe it is cold and dry. But on the contrarie, the Southern Wind, becauſe it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3293:10"/>
is hot and moyſt, weakens the Body by ſloth or dulneſſe, opens the Pores, and makes them peruious to the peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous malignitie. The Weſtern Wind is alſo vnwholſome, becauſe it comes neere to the nature of the Southern: wherefore the Windowes muſt be ſhut vp on that ſide of the Houſe on which they blow, but opened on the North and Eaſt ſide, vnleſſe it happen the Plague come from thence.</p>
               <p>Kindle a cleere Fire in all the Lodging Chambers of the Houſe, and perfume the whole Houſe with Aromaticke things, as Frankenſence, Myrrhe, Benzoine, Ladanum, Styrax, Roſes, Mirtle-leaues, Lauender, Roſemary, Sage, Sauory, Wild Time, Marierome, Broome, Pine Apples, peeces of Firre, Iuniper Berries, Cloues, Perfumes: and let your Cloathes be aired in the ſame.</p>
               <p>There be ſome, who thinke it a great preſeruatiue againſt the peſtilent Aire to keepe a Goat in their houſes, becauſe the capacitie of the Houſes filled with the ſtrong ſent which the Goat ſends forth, prohibits the entrance of the venemous Aire: which ſame reaſon hath place alſo in ſweet ſmels, and beſides, it argues, that ſuch as are hungry are apter to take the Plague, then thoſe who haue eaten moderately: for the Body is not onely ſtrengthened with Meat, but all the paſſages thereof are filled by the vapours diffuſed from thence, by which otherwiſe the infected Aire would find a more eaſie entrance to the Heart.</p>
               <p>Yet the common ſort of People yeeld another reaſon for the Goat, which is, That one ill ſent driues away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as one wedge driues forth another; which calles to my mind that which is recorded by <hi>Alexander Benedictus,</hi> that there was a Scythian Phyſition, which cauſed a Plague aryſing from the infection of the Aire, to ceaſe, by cauſing all the Dogges, Cats, and ſuch like Beaſts which were in the Citie, to be hilled, and caſting their Carcaſſes vp and downe the Streets, that ſo by the comming of this new putrid vapour as a ſtranger, the former peſtiferous infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as an old gueſt, was put out of its Lodging, and ſo the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3293:10"/>
Plague ceaſed. For Poyſons haue not onely an antipathy with their Antidotes, but alſo with ſome other Poyſons.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Plague is hot it is not good to ſtirre out of doore before the ryſing of the Sunne: wherefore we muſt haue patience, vntill he haue cleanſed the Aire with the comfortable light of his Beames, and diſperſed all the foggy and nocturnall pollutions, which commonly hang in the Aire in dirtie, and ſpecially in low places and Valleys.</p>
               <p>All publike and great meetings and aſſemblyes muſt be ſhunned.</p>
               <p>If the Plague begin in Summer, and ſeeme principally to rage, helped forward by the Summers heat, it is the beſt to performe a Iourney begun, or vndertaken for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of neceſſarie affaires, rather vpon the night time, then on the day, becauſe the Infection takes force, ſtrength and ſubtiletie of ſubſtance, by which it may more eaſily permeate and enter in, by the heat of the Sunne; but by night Mens Bodies are more ſtrong, and all things are more groſſe and denſe. But you muſt obſerue a cleane contrarie courſe if the malignitie ſeeme to borrow ſtrength, and celeritie from coldneſſe. But you muſt alwayes eſchew the Beames of the Moone, but ſpecially at the full: For then our Bodyes are more languid and weake, and fuller of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humors. Euen as Trees which for that cauſe muſt be cut downe in their ſeaſon of the Moone, that is, in the decreaſe thereof.</p>
               <p>After a little gentle walking in your Chamber, you muſt preſently vſe ſome meanes that the principall parts may be ſtrengthened by ſuſcitating the heat and Spirits, and that the paſſages to them may be filled, that ſo the way may be ſhut vp from the Infection comming from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Such as by the vſe of Garlike haue not their Heads troubled, nor their inward parts inflamed, as Countrey people, and ſuch as are vſed to it, to ſuch there can be no more certaine preſeruatiue and antidote againſt the peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fogges or Miſts, and the nocturnall obſcuritie, then to take it in the morning with a draught of good Wine;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3293:11"/>
for it being aboundantly diffuſed preſently ouer all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, filles vp the paſſages thereof, and ſtrengheneth it in a moment.</p>
               <p>For Water, if the Plague proceed from the tainture of the Aire, we muſt wholly ſhun and auoid Raine-water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot but be infected by the contagion of the Aire. Wherefore the Water of Springs, and of the deepeſt Welles are thought beſt. But if the malignitie proceed from the vapours contained in the Earth, you muſt make choyſe of Raine-water. Yet it's more ſafe to digeſt euerie ſort of Water by boyling it, and to preferre that Water before other, which is pure and cleerer to the ſight, and without either taſt or ſmell, and which beſides ſuddainly takes the extremeſt mutation of heat and cold.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe Medicines that haue proper and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues againſt the Peſtilence are not to be neglected to be applyed outwardly, or carried in the Hand. And ſuch are all aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, aſtringent, or ſpirituous things which therefore are endewed with vertue to repell the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous and peſtiferous Aire from comming and entring into the Body, and to ſtrengthen the Heart and the Braine. Of this kind are Rue, Baulme, Roſemary, Scordium, Sage, Worme-wood, Cloues, Nutmegs, Saffron, the Roots of Angelica, and Louage, and ſuch like, which muſt be mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one night in ſharpe Vineger and Aqua Vitae, and then tyed in a knot as bigge as an Egge: Or rather let it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in a Sponge made wet or ſoaked in the ſaid Infuſion. For there is nothing that doth ſooner and better hold the ſpirituous vertue and ſtrength of aromaticke things, then a Sponge. Wherefore it is of principall vſe either to keepe or hold ſweet things to the Noſe, or to apply Epithemes, and Fomentationsto the Heart.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſweet things ought to be hot or cold, as the ſeaſon of the yeere, and kind of the Peſtilence is. As for example, in the Summer you ought to infuſe and macerate Cinamon and Cloues beaten together with a little Saffron in equall parts, of Vineger of Roſes, and Roſe Water, into which you muſt dip a Sponge, which rowled in a faire Linnen Cloath you may carrie in your Hand, and often ſmell to.</p>
               <p>Take of Worme-wood halfe a Handfull; ten Cloues; of the Roots of Gentian and Angelica, of each two Drams; of Vineger and Roſe Water, of each two Ounces; of Treacle and Mithrid te, of each one Dramme: beat and mixe them all well together, and let a Sponge be dipped

therein, and vſed as aboue-ſaid. They may alſo be encloſed in Boxes, made of ſweet Wood, as of Iuniper, Ceder, or Cypreſſe, and ſo carryed for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But there is nothing more eaſie to be carryed then Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: the forme of which is thus. Take of Yellow Saunders, Mace, Citron Pilles, Roſe and Mirtle Leaues, of each two Drammes; of Benzoin, Ladanum, Storax, of each halfe a Dramme; of Cinnamon, and Saffron, of each two Scruples; of Camphire, and Amber Greece, of each one Scruple; of Muske three Graines: Make there of a Pomander, with Roſe Water, with the infuſion of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacanth. Or take Red Roſe Leaues, the Flowers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lillyes, and Violets, of each one Ounce; of the three Saunders, Coriander Seeds, Citron Pilles, of each halfe an Ounce; of Camphire one Dramme: Let them all be Powders, and with Water of Roſes, and Tragacanth make a Pomander.</p>
               <p>In the Winter it muſt be made thus: Take of Storax, Benzoin, of each one Dramme and a halfe; of Muske halfe a Scruple; of Cloues, Lauander, and Cyperus, of each two Drammes; of the Root of Orris, <hi>i.</hi> Flower de Luce, and Calamus Aromaticus, of each two Drammes and a halfe; of Amber Greece three Drammes; of Gum Tragacanth diſſolued in Roſe Water and Aqua Vitae, as much as ſhall ſuffice: Make thereof a Pomander.</p>

               <p>Take of the Roots of Orris two Drammes; of Cype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Calamus Aromaticus, Red Roſes, of each halfe an Ounce; of Cloues halfe a Dramme; of Storax one Dramme; of Muske eight Graines: Mixe them, and make a Powder for a Bagge.

of each one Ounce; of Cyperus one Dramme; of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Aromaticus one Ounce; of Marierome halfe an Ounce; of Cloues three Drammes; of Lauender halfe a Dramme; of Coriander Seeds two Drammes; of good Muske halfe a Scruple; of Ladanum and Benzoin, of each a Dramme; of Nutmegs, and Cinnamon, of each two Drammes: Make thereof a fine Powder, and ſow it in a Bagge.</p>
               <p>It will be verie conuenient alſo to apply to the Region of the Heart, a Bagge filled with Yellow Saunders, Mace, Cloues, Cinnamon, Saffron, and Treacle, ſhaken together, and incorporated, and ſprinckled ouer with ſtrong Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Roſe Water in Summer, and with ſtrong Wine and Muskedine in the Winter.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſweet aromaticke things that are ſo full of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſmelling ſweetly and ſtrongly, haue admirable virtues to ſtrengthen the principall parts of the Body, and to ſtirre vp the expulſiue facultie to expell the Poyſon.</p>
               <p>Contrarie-wiſe, thoſe that are ſtinking and vnſauerie procure a deſire to vomit, and diſſolution of the Powers, by which it is manifeſt how fooliſh and abſurd their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion is, that councell ſuch as are in a peſtilent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aire, to receaue and take in the ſtinking and vnſauorie vapors of Sinkes and Priuies, and that eſpecially in the morning.</p>
               <p>But it will not ſuffice to carrie thoſe Preſeruatiues alone without the vſe of any other thing, but will be alſo verie profitable, to waſh all the whole Body in Vineger of the decoction of Iuniper and Bay Berryes, the Roots of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Marigolds, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iohns Wort, and ſuch like, with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Mithridate alſo diſſolued in it. For Vineger is an enemie to all Poyſons in generall, whether they be hot or cold: For it reſiſteth and hindreth putrefaction, becauſe it is cold and dry: Therefore in this, inanimate Bodyes, as Fleſh, Hearbes, Fruits, and many other ſuch like things may be kept a long time without putrefaction. Neither is it to be feared, that it ſhould obſtruct the Pores, by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3293:16"/>
reaſon of its coldneſſe, if the Body be bathed in it: For it is of ſubtile parts, and the Spices boyled in it haue vertue to open.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer accounteth it hurtfull to waſh his whole Body there-with, let him waſh but onely his Arme-holes, the Region of his Heart, his Temples, Groine parts of Generation, as hauing great and maruelous ſympathy with the principall and noble parts.</p>

Wherefore the chiefeſt and trueſt ſignes of this Diſeaſe, are to be taken from the Heart, being the Manſion of Life, which chiefly, and firſt of all is wont to be aſſaulted by the force of the Poyſon. Therefore they that are infected with the Peſtilence, are vexed with often ſwoundings, and fainting; their Pulſe is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3293:16"/>
feebler and ſlower then others, but ſome-times more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but that is ſpecially in the night ſeaſon; they feele prickings ouer all their Body, as if it were the pricking of Needles; but their Noſe-thrils doe itch eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by occaſion of the maligne vapours ryſing vpwards from the lower and inner, into the vpper parts, their Breaſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, their Heart beateth, with paine vnder the left Dug, difficultie of taking breath, Ptiſſicke, Cough, paine of the Heart, &amp; ſuch an elation or puffing vp of the Hypocondria or ſides of the Belly diſtended with the aboundance of vapours rayſed by the force of the feueriſh heat, that the Patient will in a manner ſeeme to haue the Tympanie. They are moleſted with a deſire to vomit, and oftentimes with much and painfull vomiting, wherein greene and blacke matter is ſeene, and alwayes of diuers colours, anſwering in proportion to the excrements of the lower parts, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke being drawne into a conſent with the Heart, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vicinitie and communion of the Veſſels; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Blood alone, and that pure, is excluded and caſt vp in vomiting; and it is not onely caſt vp by vomiting out of the Stomacke, but alſo verie often out of the Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils, Fundament, and in Women out of the Wombe; the inward parts are often burned, and the outward parts are ſtiffe with cold, the whole heat of the Patient being drawne violently inward, after the manner of a Cupping-Glaſſe, by the ſtrong burning of the inner parts; then the Eye-lids wax blew, as it were through ſome contuſion, all the whole Face hath a horrid aſpect, and as it were the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Lead, the Eyes are burning red, and, as it were, ſwolne or puffed vp with Blood, or any other humour, ſhed teares; and to conclude, the whole habite of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſome-what changed and turned yellow.</p>
               <p>Many haue a burning Feauer, which doth ſhew it ſelfe by the Pacients vlcerated Iawes, vnquenchable thirſt, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and blackneſſe of the Tongue, and it cauſeth ſuch a Phrenſie by inflaming the Braine, that the Pacients running naked out of their Beads, ſeeke to throw themſelues out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3293:17"/>
of Windowes into the Pits and Riuers that are at hand. In ſome the Ioynts of their Body are ſo weakned, that they cannot goe nor ſtand, from the beginning they are as it were buryed in a long ſwound and deepe ſleepe, by reaſon that the Feauer ſendeth vp to the Brayne the groſſe vapors from the crude and cold humors, as it were from greene Wood newly kindled to make a Fire.</p>
               <p>Such ſleeping doth hold them eſpecially while the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sore or Carbuncle is drawne together and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to come to ſuppuration. Often-times when they are awaked out of ſleepe, there doe ſpots and markes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare diſperſed ouer the Skin, with a ſtinking ſweat. But if thoſe vapours be ſharpe that are ſtirred vp vnto the Head, in ſtead of ſleepe they cauſe great waking, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes there is much diuerſitie of accidents in the Vrine of thoſe that are infected with the Plague, by reaſon of the diuers temperature and condition of Bodyes: neither is the vrine at all times, and in all Men of the ſame conſiſtence and colour: For ſome-times they are like vnto the vrine of thoſe that are ſound and in health, that is to ſay, laudable in colour and ſubſtance, becauſe that when the Heart is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the venomous Aire, that entereth in vnto it, the Spirits are more greatly grieued and moleſted then the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: but thoſe, <hi>i.</hi> the Spirits, are infected and corrupted when theſe doe begin to corrupt.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen you thorowly know the nature of the Diſeaſe, and accidents thereof, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, function, and excellencie of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and grieued parts, you may well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the future motions and euents of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: Although that this may be ſpoken in generall, that there is no certaine prediction in peſtilent Diſeaſes, either to health or death, for they haue verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant motions, ſometimes ſwift and quicke, ſometimes ſlow, and ſometimes choaking or ſuffocating in a moment while one breathes in the venomous Aire, as he is going about any of his neceſſarie affaires, hauing Puſtles ryſing in the Skin with ſharpe paine, and as though the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were pricked all ouer with Needles, or the ſtings of Bees. Which I haue ſeene with my Eyes in the Plague that was at Lyons when <hi>Charles</hi> the French King lay there. It many times commeth to paſſe that the accidents that were very vehement and raging a little before, are ſodainly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3293:18"/>
aſſwaged, and the Pacients doe thinke themſelues better, or almoſt perfectly ſound. Which hapned to <hi>Mary</hi> one of the Queene-Mother her Mayds in that notable peſtilent conſtitution of the Aire that yere when <hi>Charles</hi> the French Kinglay at the Caſtle of Roſſilion: For when ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, a great Tumour or <hi>Bubo</hi> aroſe in her Groyne, and ſodainly it went in againe, ſo that the third day of her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhe ſaid ſhe was without any griefe or diſeaſe at all, but that ſhe was ſome-what troubled with a difficultie of making Water, and I thinke it was, becauſe the Bladder was inflamed by the reflux of the matter; but ſhe was ſound in Mind and Body, and walked vp and downe the Chamber on the ſame day that ſhe dyed. The ſtrangeneſſe of which thing made the King ſo fearfull, that he haſted to depart thence.</p>
               <p>Although this Diſeaſe doth ſpare no Man, of what age, temperature, complexion, dyet, and condition ſoeuer, yet it aſſaulteth young Men that are Cholericke and Sanguine, more often then old Men that are cold and dry, in whom the moyſture that is the nouriſher of putrefaction by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their age is conſumed, and the wayes, paſſages, and pores of the Skin whereby the venomous Aire ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and pierce in, are more ſtrait and narrow. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, becauſe old men doe alwayes ſtay at home, but young men for their neceſſarie buſineſſe, and alſo for their delight and pleaſure, are alwayes abroad on the day time in the Aire, wherehence the pollution of the Peſtilence commeth more often.</p>
               <p>That Peſtilence that commeth by the corruption of the humours, is not ſo contagious as that which commeth by the default of the Aire. But thoſe that are Flegmaticke and Melancholy are moſt commonly greeued with that kind of Peſtilence, becauſe in them the humours are more clammy and groſſe, and their Bodyes more cold and leſſe perſpirable, for which cauſes the humours ſooner and more ſpeedily putrefie.</p>
               <p>Men that are of an ill iuyce are alſo moſt apt to this kind
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3293:19"/>
of Peſtilence, for in the naughtie qualitie of the iuyce there is a great preparation of the humours vnto putrefaction: You may know it by this, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Peſtilence raigneth, there are no other Diſeaſes among the common People, which haue their originall of any ill iuyce but they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into the Plague. Therefore when they begin to appeare and wander vp and downe, it is a token that the Peſtilence will ſhortly ceaſe, or is almoſt at an end.</p>
               <p>But here alſo I would haue you to underſtand thoſe to be of an ill iuice, which haue no Pores in their Skin, by which, as it were by Riuers, the euill iuyce which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Nature, may be euacuated and purged. And I haue noted and obſerued, that thoſe are leſſe in danger of the Peſtilence which haue cancerous Vlcers, and ſtinking Sores in their Noſes, and ſuch as are infected with the French Poxe, haue by reaſon thereof, Tumours and rotten Vlcers, or haue the Kings Euill running vpon them, the Leproſie, or the Scabbe: And to conclude, all thoſe that haue Fiſtulous and running Vlcers in their Bodyes.</p>
               <p>I thinke thoſe that haue Quartaine Feauers are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter priuiledged for the ſame, becauſe that by the Fit cauſing ſweat, that commeth euerie fourth day, they auoyd much of the ill iuyce that was ingendred.</p>
               <p>This is more like to be true, then to thinke that the Poyſon that commeth from without, may be driuen away by that which lurketh within.</p>
               <p>Contrarie-wiſe, Women that are great with Child, as I haue noted, becauſe they haue much ill iuyce, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited from their accuſtomed euacuations, are verie apt to take this Diſeaſe, and doe ſeldome recouer after they are infected.</p>
               <p>Blacke or blew Impoſtumes, and Spots and Puſtules of the ſame colour diſperſed ouer the Skin, argue that the Diſeaſe is altogether vncurable and mortall.</p>
               <p>When the Swelling or Sore goeth or commeth before the Feauer, it is a good ſigne, for it declareth that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie is verie weake and feeble, and that Nature hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3293:19"/>
ouercome it, which of it ſelfe is able to driue ſo great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof from the inner parts. But if the Sore or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour come after the Feauer, it is a mortall &amp; deadly ſigne, for it is certaine that that commeth of the venomous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not tranſlated, but diſperſed, not by the victorie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but thorough the multitude of the matter, with the weight whereof Nature is ouercome.</p>
               <p>When the Moone decreaſeth, thoſe that are infected with the Peſtilence are in great doubt and danger of death, becauſe then the humours that were collected and gathered together before the full of the Moone, through delay and aboundance, do ſwell the more, and the Faculties by which the Body is gouerned, become more weake and feeble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the imbecilitie of the natiue heat, which before was nouriſhed and augmented by the light, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the heat of the full Moone: For as it is noted by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the wainings of the Moone are more cold and weake: and thence it is that Women haue their menſtruall Fluxes chiefely or moſt commonly at that time.</p>
               <p>In a groſſe and cloudy Aire the peſtilent Infection is leſſe vehement and contagious then in a thin and ſubtle Aire; whether that thinneſſe of the Aire proceed from the heat of the Sunne, or from the North Wind and cold. Therefore at Paris where naturally, and alſo through the aboundance of filth that is about the Citie, the Aire is darke and groſſe, the peſtilent Infection is leſſe fierce and contagious then it is in Prouince, for the ſubtletie of the Aire ſtimulates or helps forward the Plague.</p>
               <p>But this Diſeaſe is mortall and pernitious whereſoeuer it be, becauſe it ſuddainly aſſaulteth the Heart, which is the Manſion, or as it were the Fortreſſe or Caſtle of Life: but commonly not before the ſignes and tokens of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare on the Body: and yet you ſhall ſcarce find any Man that thinketh of calling the Phyſitian to helpe to preſerue him from ſo great danger before the ſignes thereof be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be ſeene and felt: but then the Heart is aſſaulted. And when the Heart is ſo aſſaulted, what hope of life is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3293:20"/>
there, or health to be looked for? Therefore becauſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines come oft-times too late, and this Malady is as it were a ſuddaine and a winged Meſſenger of our death, it commeth to paſſe that ſo many die thereof. And moreouer becauſe at the firſt ſuſpition of this ſo dire and cruell a Diſeaſe, the imagination and mind (whoſe force in the diuerſly ſtirring vp of the humours is great and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible) is ſo troubled with feare of imminent death, and deſpaire of health, that together with the perturbed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, all the ſtrength and power of Nature falles and ſinkes downe.</p>
               <p>This you may perceiue and know, by reaſon that the Keepers of ſuch as are ſicke, and the Bearers which are not fearefull, but verie confident, although they doe all the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt offices which may be for the ſicke, are commonly not infected, and ſeldome dye thereof if infected.</p>

               <head type="sub">Into what place the Patient ought to betake himſelfe ſo ſoone as he finds himſelfe infected.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſaid that the perpetuall and firſt originall of the Peſtilence commeth of the Aire, therefore ſo ſoone as one is blaſted with the peſtiferous Aire, after he hath taken ſome preſeruatiue againſt the malignitie thereof, he muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe into ſome wholeſome Aire, that is cleane and pure from any venomous Infection or Contagion for there is great hope of health by the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Aire, for we doe moſt frequently and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly draw in the Aire of all things, ſo that we cannot want it for a minute of time: therefore of the Aire that is drawne in, dependeth the correction, amendment, or increaſe of the Poyſon or malignitie that is receiued, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3293:20"/>
the Aire is pure, ſincere, or corrupted. There be ſome that doe thinke it good to ſhut the Patient in a cloaſe Chamber, ſhutting the Windowes to prohibite the entrance of the Aire as much as they are able: But I thinke it more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that thoſe Windowes ſhould be open from whence that Wind bloweth that is directly contrarie vnto that which brought in the venomous Aire: For although there be no other cauſe, yet if the Aire be not moued, or agitated, but ſhut vp in a cloaſe place, it will ſoone be corrupted. Therefore in a cloaſe and quiet place that is not ſubiect to the entrance of the Aire, I would wiſh the Patient to make Wind, or to procure Aire with a thicke and great Cloath dipped or macerated in Water and Vineger mixt together, and tyed to a long Staffe, that by toſſing it vp and downe the cloaſe Chamber, the Wind or Aire thereof may coole and recreate the Patient. The Patient muſt euerie day be carryed into a freſh Chamber, and the Beds and the Linnen Cloathes muſt be changed: There muſt alwayes be a cleere and bright Fire in the Patients Chamber, and eſpecially in the night, whereby the Aire may be made more pure, cleane, and voyd of nightly vapours, and of the filthy and peſtilent breath proceeding from the Patient, or his Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the meane time, leaſt (if it be in hot weather) the Patient ſhould be weakned or made more faint by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the heat of the Fire doth diſperſe and waſt his Spirits, the Floore or Ground of the Chamber muſt be ſprinkled or watered with Vineger and Water, or ſtrowed with the branches of Vines made moyſt in cold Water, with the Leaues and Flowers of Water Lillyes, or Poplar, or ſuch like. In the feruent heat of Summer he muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſtrong Fumigations that do ſmell too ſtrongly, becauſe that by aſſaulting the Head, they increaſe the paine. If the Patient could goe to that coſt, it were good to hang all the Chamber where he lyeth, and alſo the Bed, with thicke or coarſe Linnen Cloathes moyſted in Vineger and Water of Roſes. Thoſe Linnen Cloathes ought not to be verie white, but ſome-thing browne, becauſe much and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3293:21"/>
great whiteneſſe doth diſperſe the ſight, and by waſting the Spirits doth increaſe the paine of the Head: for which cauſe alſo the Chamber ought not to be verie lightſome.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe on the night ſeaſon there ought to be Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Perfumes made, which by their moderate light, may moderately call forth the Spirits.</p>
               <p>Sweet Fiers may be made of little peeces of the Wood of Iuniper, Broome, Aſh, Tamarisk, of the Rind of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lemmons, Cloues, Benzoin, Gumme Arabicke, Orris Roots, Myrrhe groſſely beaten together, and layd on the burning Coales put into a Chaſing Diſh. Truly the breath or ſmoake of the Wood or Berries of Iuniper, is thought to driue Serpents a great way from the place where it is burnt. The vertue of the Aſh Tree againſt venome is ſo great, as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifieth, that a Serpent will not come vnder the ſhaddow thereof, no not in the morning nor euening, when the ſhaddow of any thing is moſt great and long, but ſhe will run from it. I my ſelfe haue proued that if a circle or compaſſe be made with the Boughes of an Aſh Tree, and a Fier made in the middeſt thereof, and a Serpent put within the compaſſe of the Boughes, that the Serpent will rather run into the Fier then thorow the Aſhes Boughes.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another meanes to correct the Aire. You may ſprinkle Vineger of the decoction of Rue, Sage, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Bay Berries, Iuniper Berries, Cyperus Nuts, and ſuch like, on Stones or Brickes made red hot, and put in a Pot or Pan, that all the whole Chamber where the Patient lyeth may be perfumed with the vapour thereof.</p>
               <p>Alſo Fumigations may be made of ſome matter that is more groſſe and clammy, that by the force of the Fire the ſume may continue the longer, as are Ladanum, Myrrhe, Maſticke, Roſine, Turpentine, Storax, Olibanum, Benzoin, Bay Berries, Iuniper Berries, Cloues, Sage, Roſemary, and Marioram ſtamped together, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are rich and wealthy may haue Candles and Fumes made of Wax, or Tallow mixed with ſome ſweet things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:3293:21"/>
A Spong macerated in Vinegar of Roſes and Water of the ſame, and a little of the decoction of Cloues, and of Camphire added thereto, ought alwayes to be ready at the Patients hand, that by often ſmelling vnto it, the Animall Spirits may be recreated and ſtrengthened.</p>
               <p>The Water following is very effectuall for this matter. Take of Orris fourė Ounces; of Zedoarie, Spikenard, of each ſixe Drammes; of Storax, Benzoin, Cynamon, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Cloues, of each one Ounce and a halfe; of old Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle halfe an Ounce: Bruiſe them into a groſſe Powder, and macerate them for the ſpace of twelue houres in 4 pound of white and ſtrong Wine, then diſtill them in a Limbecke of Glaſſe on hoat Aſhes, and in the diſtilled Liquor wet a Spong, and then let it be tyed in a Linnen Cloath, or cloſed in a Box, and ſo often put vnto the Noſe-thrils. Or take of the Vineger and Water of Roſes, of each foure Ounces; of Camphire ſix Graines; of Treacle halfe a Dramme: let them be diſſolued together, and put into a Viall of Glaſſe, which the Patient may often put vnto his Noſe.</p>
               <p>This Nodula following is more meet for this matter. Take of Roſe Leaues two Pugils; of Orris halfe an Ounce; of Calamus Aromaticus, Cynnamon, Cloues, of each two Drammes; of Storax and Benzoin, of each one Dramme and a halfe; of Cyperus halfe a Dramme: beat them into a groſſe Powder, make thereof a Nodula betweene two peeces of Cambricke or Lawne of the bigneſſe of an Hand Ball, then let it be moyſtned in 8 Ounces of Roſe Water, and two Ounces of Roſe Vineger, and let the Patient ſmell vnto it often. Theſe things muſt be varied according to the time: For in the Summer you muſt vſe neither Muske nor Ciuet, nor ſuch like hot things: and moreouer women that are ſubiect to fits of the Mother, &amp; thoſe that haue Feauers or the Head ach ought not to vſe thoſe things that are ſo ſtrong ſmelling &amp; hot, but you muſt make choiſe of things more gentle: Therefore things that are made with a little Camphire and Cloues bruiſed and macerated together in Roſe Water and Vineger of Roſes ſhall be ſufficient.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE order of Dyet in a Peſtilent diſeaſe ought to be cooling and drying: not ſlender, but ſome-what full. Becauſe by this kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe there commeth waſting of the Spirits, and exolution of the Faculties, which infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth often ſwounding, therefore that loſſe muſt be repaired as ſoone as may be with more quantitie of Meats that are of eaſie concoction and digeſtion. Therefore I neuer ſaw any being infected with the Peſtilence that kept a ſlender dyet that recouered his health but dyed, and few that had a good ſtomacke and fed well dyed.</p>
               <p>Sweet, groſſe, moyſt, and clammy Meats, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and exquiſitely of ſubtile parts, are to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for the ſweet doe eaſily take Fier, and are ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; the moyſt will putrefie; the groſſe and clammy obſtruct, and therefore ingender putrefaction; thoſe meats that are of ſubtile parts, ouer-much attenuate the humors and inflame them, and doe ſtirre vp hot and ſharpe vapors into the Brayne, whereof commeth the Feauer. Therefore we muſt eſchew Garlike, Onions, Muſtard, Salted and ſpiced Meats, and all kinds of Puls muſt alſo be auoyded, becauſe they ingender groſſe winds, which are the authors of obſtruction: but the decoction of them is not alwayes to be refuſed, becauſe it is a prouoker of Vrine. Therefore let this be their order of Dyet: Let their Bread be of Wheat or Barly, well wrought, well leauened and ſalted neither too new nor too ſtale: Let them be fed with ſuch Meat as may be eaſily concocted and digeſted, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender much laudable iuyce, and verie little excrementall, as are the Fleſh of Weather Lambes, Calues, Kidds, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerets,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3293:22"/>
Pullets, Partriches, Pigeons, Thruſhes, Larkes, Quailes, Blacke Birds, Turtle Doues, Moore Hennes, Pheſants, and ſuch like, auoyding Water Foules. Let the Fleſh be moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Veriuyce of vn-ripe Grapes, Vineger, or the iuyce of Lemmons, Oranges, Cytrons, tart Pomegranats, Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, Gooſeberryes, or red Currance, or of Garden and wild Sorrell: for all theſe ſowre things are verie whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in this kind of Diſeaſe, for they doe ſtirre vp the appetite, reſiſt the venomous qualitie and putrefaction of the humours, reſtraine the heat of the Feauer, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the corruption of the meats in the ſtomacke. Although that thoſe that haue a more weake ſtomacke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with a more exact ſence, &amp; are ſubiect to the Cough and Diſeaſes of the Lungs, muſt not vſe theſe vnleſſe they be mixed with Sugar and Cynnamon.</p>
               <p>If the Patient at any time be fed with ſodden Meats, let the Broathes be made with Lettuce, Purſlaine, Succorie, Borage, Sorrell, Hoppes, Bugloſſe, Creſſes, Burnet, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golds, Cheruill, the cooling Seeds, Barley and Oates clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with a little Saffron, for Saffron doth engender many Spirits, and reſiſteth Poyſon. To theſe opening Roots may be added for to auoyd obſtruction; yet much Broath muſt be refuſed by reaſon of moyſture. The Fruit of Capers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten in the beginning of the Meale prouoke the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and prohibite obſtructions, but they ought not to be ſeaſoned with ouer-much Oyle &amp; Salt, they may alſo with good ſucceſſe be put in Broathes.</p>
               <p>Fiſhes are altogether to be auoyded, becauſe they doe ſoone corrupt in the Stomacke: but if the Patient be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with them, thoſe that liue in ſtony places muſt be choſen, that is to ſay, thoſe that doe liue in pure and ſandy Water, and about Rocks, and Stones, as are Trowts, Pikes, Pearches, Gudgions, and Crauiſes boiled in Milke, Wilks, and ſuch like. And concerning Sea-Fiſh, he may be fed with Giltheads, Gurnarts, with all the kinds of Cod-fiſh, Whitings not ſeaſoned with Salt, and Turbuts.</p>
               <p>Fagges potched and eaten with the iuyce of Sorrell, are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3293:23"/>
very good. Likewiſe Barley Water ſeaſoned with the Graynes of a tart Pomegranate, and if the Feauer be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the Seeds of white Poppey. Such Barley Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is eaſie to be concocted and digeſted, it cleanſes greatly, and moyſtens and mollifies the Belly.

But in ſtead of Barley Water they may vſe Pappe, and Bread crummed in the decoction of a Capon.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond courſe let him haue Rayſons of the Sun, newly ſodden in Roſe Water with Sugar, ſoure Damaske Prunes, tart Cherryes, Pippins, and Katherine Peares.</p>
               <p>And in the latter end of the Meale, Quinces roſted in Embers, Marmelate of Quinces, &amp; Conſerues of Bugloſſe or of Roſes, and ſuch like may be taken: Or elſe this Powder following.</p>

               <p>If the Patient be ſome-what weake, he muſt be fed with Gelly made of the Fleſh of a Capon, and Veale ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den together in the Water of Sorrell, Carduus Benedictus, with a little quantitie of Roſe Vineger, Cynnamon, Sugar, and other ſuch like, as the preſent neceſſitie ſhall ſeeme to require.</p>

For ſo the fleſhes will be boiled in their owne iuice without any hurt of the fier; then let the iuice bee preſſed out therehence with a preſſe: giue the patient for euery doſe one ounce of the iuice with ſome cordiall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſome <hi>Triſantalum,</hi> and <hi>Diamargaritum frigidum.</hi> The preſerues of ſweete fruits are to bee auoided, becauſe that ſweete things turne into cholor; but the confections of tart Prunes, Cherries, and ſuch like may be fitly vſed. But becauſe there is no kinde of ſickeneſſe that ſo weakens the ſtrength as the Plague; it is alwaies neceſſarie, but yet ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and often, to feede the patient, ſtill hauing reſpect vnto his cuſtome, age, the region, and the time: for through emptineſſe there is great danger, leſt that the venomous matter that is driuen out to the ſuperficiall parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſhould be called backe vnto the inward parts, by an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie ſtomacke, and the ſtomacke it ſelfe ſhould bee filled with choloricke, hot, thinne, and ſharpe excrementall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, whereof commeth biting of the ſtomacke, and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in the guttes.</p>

               <p>Take of fair water three quarts, wherin boile foure ounces of hony vntill the third part bee conſumed, ſcumming it continually; then ſtraine it and put it into a clean veſſell, and adde thereto foure ounces of vineger, and as much cynamon as will ſuffice to giue it a taſte. Or elſe a ſugered water as followeth. Take two quarts of fair water, of hard ſugar ſixe ounces, of cynamon two ounces, ſtraine it through a woollen bagge or cloth without anie boiling: and when the patient will vſe it, put thereto a little of the iuice of Citrons. The ſyrupe of the iuce of Citrons excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth amongſt all others that are vſed againſt the Peſtilence.</p>
               <p>The vſe of the Iulep following is alſo verie wholeſome. Take of the iuice of Sorrell well clarified halfe a pinte, of the iuice of Lettuce ſo clarified foure ounces, of the beſt hard Sugar one pound, boile them together vnto a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them be ſtrained and clarified, adding a little before the end a little vineger, let it be vſed betweene meales, with boyled water, or with equall portions of the water of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, Lettuce, Scabious, and Bugloſſe: or take of this former deſcribed Iulep ſtrained and clarified foure ounces, let it be mixed with one pound of the forenamed cordiall waters, and boile them together a little. And when they are taken from the fire, put thereto of yellow Sanders one dram, of beaten Cinamon halfe a dram, ſtraine it through a cloth: when it is cold, let it bee giuen vnto the patient to drinke with the iuice of Citrons. Thoſe that haue accuſtomed to drinke Sider, Perrie, Beere, or Ale, ought to vſe that drinke ſtill, ſo that it be clear, tranſparent, and thinne, and made of thoſe fruits that are ſomewhat tarte; for troubled and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3293:24"/>
dreggiſh drinke doth not onely engender groſſe humors, but alſo crudities, windineſſe, and obſtructions of the firſt region of the bodie, whereof comes a feauer. Oxycrate being giuen in manner following, doth aſſwage the heate of the feauer, and repreſſe the putrefaction of the humors, and the fierceneſſe of the venome, and alſo expelleth the water through the veines, if ſo be that the patients are not troubled with ſpitting of bloud, cough, yexing, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether weake of ſtomacke: for ſuch muſt auoid all tart things. Take of faire water one quart; of white or red Vineger three ounces; of fine Suger foure ounces; of Sirup of Roſes two ounces: boile them alittle, and then giue the patient thereof to drinke. Or, Take of the iuice of Lemons and Citrons, of each halfe an ounce; of iuice of ſoure Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats two ounces; of the water of Sorrell and Roſes, of each one ounce; of fair water boiled, as much as ſhall ſuffice: make therof a Iulep, and vſe it between meales. Or take of Sirup of Lemons and of red Currance, of each one ounce, of the water of Lillies foure ounces; of faire water boiled halfe a pinte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make therof a Iulep. Or, Take of the ſyrups of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lillies, and Vineger, of each halfe an ounce, diſſolve it in fiue ounces of the water of ſorrell; of faire water one pinte: make thereof a Iulep. But if the patient bee young and haue a ſtrong and good ſtomacke, and choloricke by natnre, I thinke it not vnmeete for him to drinke a full and large draught of fountaine water cold; for that is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to reſtraine and quench the heate of the feauer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe they that drinke cold water often, and a verie ſmall quantitie at a time, as the Smith doth ſprinkle water on the fire at his forge, doe increſe the heate and burning, and thereby make it endure the longer. Therefore by the iudgement of <hi>Celſus,</hi> when the diſeaſe is in the chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and the patient hath endured thirſt for the ſpace of three or foure dayes, cold water muſt be giuen vnto him in great quantitie, ſo that hee may drinke paſt his ſatietie, that when his belly and ſtomacke are filled beyond meaſure, and ſufficiently cooled, he may vomit. Some doe not drinke
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3293:25"/>
ſo much thereof as may cauſe them to vomite, but do drinke euen vnto ſatietie, and ſo vſe it for a cooling medicine; but when either of theſe is done, the patient muſt be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with many clothes, and ſo placed that he may ſleepe, and for the moſt part, after long thirſt and watching, and after long fulneſſe, and long and great heate ſound ſleepe commeth, by which great ſweat is ſent out, and that is a preſent helpe. But thirſt muſt ſometimes bee quenched with little peeces of Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, with the leaues of Lettuce, Sorrell, and purſlane made moiſt or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in cold water, or with a little ſquare peece of a Citron, Lemon, or Orange macerated in Roſe water, and ſprinkled with ſugar, and ſo held in the mouth, and then changed. But if the patient be aged, his ſtrength weake, phlegmaticke by nature, and giuen to wine, when the ſtate of the feauer is ſomewhat paſt, and the chiefe heate beginning to aſſwage, he may drinke wine verie much delayed at his meate, for to reſtore his ſtrength and to ſupply the want of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Spirits. The patient ought not by anie meanes to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer great thirſt, but muſt mitigate it by drinking, or elſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it by waſhing his mouth with Oxicrate, and ſuch like, and hee may therein alſo waſh his hands and his face, for that doth recreate the ſtrength. If the Fluxe or Laske troubel him, he may verie well vſe to drinke ſteeled water, and alſo boiled milke, wherein many ſtones comming red hot out of the fire haue beene manie times quenched. For the drineſſe and roughneſſe of the mouth it is verie good to haue a cooling, moiſtening and lenifying lotion of the mucilaginous water of the infuſion of the ſeedes of Quinces, <hi>Pſilium, id eſt,</hi> Flea-wurt, adding thereto a little Camphyre, with the water of Plantaine and Roſes, then cleanſe and wipe out the filth, and then moiſten the mouth, by holding therein a little oyle of ſweete Almonds mixed with a little ſirup of Violets.

               <head type="sub">Of Antidotes to be vſed in the Plague.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we muſt entreate of the proper cure of this diſeaſe, which muſt bee vſed as ſoone as may bee poſſible, becauſe this kinde of poiſon in ſwiftneſſe exceedes the celeritie of the medicine. Therefore it is better to erre in this, that you ſhould thinke euerie diſeaſe to be peſtilent in a peſtilent ſeaſon, and to cure it as the Peſtilence: becauſe that ſo long as the ayre is polluted with the ſeedes of the Peſtilence, the humors in the bodie are ſoone infected with the vicinitie of ſuch an ayre, ſo that then there happeneth no diſeaſe void of the Peſtilence, that is to ſay, which is not peſtilent from the beginning by his owne nature, or which is not made peſtilent. Manie begin the cure with bloud-letting, ſome with purging, and ſome with Antidotes. We taking a conſideration of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that part that is aſſaulted, firſt of all begin the cure with an Antidote, beeauſe that by its ſpecificke proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it defends the heart from poiſon, as much as it is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therewith. Although there are alſo other Antidotes which preſerue and keep the heart and the patient from the danger of Poiſon and the Peſtilence, not onely becauſe they doe infringe the power of the poiſon in their whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but alſo becauſe they driue it and expell it out of all the bodie by ſweate, vomiting, ſcouring, and ſuch other kindes of euacuations. The Antidote muſt be giuen in ſuch a quantitie as may bee ſufficient to ouercome the poiſon; but becauſe it is not good to vſe it in greater quantitie than neederh, leſt it ſhould ouerthrow our nature, for whoſe preſeruation only it is vſed, therefore that which cannot bee taken together and at once, muſt bee taken at ſeuerall times, that ſome portion thereof may daily be vſed ſo long,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3293:26"/>
vntill all the accidents, effects, and impreſſions of the poiſon be paſt, and that there bee nothing to be feared. Some of thoſe Antidotes conſiſt of portions of venomous things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempered together, and mixed in an apt proportion with other medicines, whoſe power is contrarie to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom: as Treacle, which hath for an ingredient the fleſh of Vipers, that it being thereto mixed may ſerue as guide to bring all the Antidote vnto the place where the venenate malignitie hath made the chiefe impreſſion; becauſe by the ſimilitude of nature and ſympathie, one poiſon is ſodainly ſnatched and carried vnto another. There are other abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute poiſonous, which neuertheleſſe are Antidotes one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: as a Scorpion himſelfe cureth the pricke of a Scorpion. But Treacle and Mithridate excell all other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes: for by ſtrenthening the nobleſt part, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of life, they repaire and recreate the waſted Spirits, and ouercome the poyſon, not onely being taken inwardly, but alſo applied outwardly to the region of the heart, Botches and Carbuncles: for by an hidden propertie they draw the poiſons vnto them, as Amber doth Chaffe, and digeſt it when it is drawne, and ſpoile and robbe it of all its deadly force; as it is declared at large by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his booke <hi>de Theriaca ad Piſonem,</hi> by moſt true reaſons, and experiments. But you will ſay, that theſe things are hote, and that the Plague is often accompanied with a burning Feauer. But therereto I anſwer, there is not ſo great danger in the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as in the Peſtilence, although in the giuing of Treacle I would not altogether ſeeme to neglect the Feauer, but thinke it good to miniſter or apply it mixed with cordiall cooling medicines, as with the Trochiſces of Camphire, Sirup of Lemmons, of water Lillies, the water of Sorrell, and ſuch like. And for the ſame cauſe wee ought not to chooſe old Treacle, but that which is of a middle age, as of one or two yeares old: to thoſe that are ſtrong, you may giue halfe a dramme, and to thoſe that are more weake a dramme. The patient ought to walke preſently after that he hath taken Treacle, Mithridate, or anie other Antidote;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3293:26"/>
but yet as moderately as he can: not like vnto many, which when they perceiue themſelues to be infected, do not ceaſe to courſe and runne vp and downe, vntill they haue no ſtrength to ſuſtaine their bodies, for ſo they doe diſſolue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that it cannot ſuffice to ouercome the contagion. After moderate walking, the patient muſt be put warme to bedde, and couered with manie clothes, and warme brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, or tiles applied to the ſoles of his feete; or in ſtead thereof you may vſe ſwines bladders filled with hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and apply them to the grindes and arme-holes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke ſweate: for ſweating in this diſeaſe is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedie, both for to euacuate the humors in the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and alſo to driue forth the malignitie in the Peſtilence, although euerie ſweate brings not forth the fruit of health. For <hi>George Agricola</hi> ſaith, that he ſaw a woman at <hi>Miſnia</hi> in <hi>Germanie</hi> that did ſweat ſo for the ſpace of three dayes, that the bloud came forth at her head and breaſt, and yet neuertheleſſe ſhe died.</p>
               <p>This potion following will prouoke ſweate. Take the roots of China ſhaued in thinne peeces one ounce and halfe; of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> two ounces; of the barke of Tamariske one ounce; of Angelica rootes two drams; of the ſhauings of Harts-horne one ounce; of Iuniper berries three drams; put them into a viall of glaſſe that will containe ſixe quarts; put therto foure quarts of ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning or riuer water that is pure and clear, macerate them for the ſpace of one whole night on the hot aſhes: and in the morning boile them all in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> vntill the halfe be conſumed, which will be done in the ſpace of ſixe houres; then let them be ſtrained through a bagge, and then ſtrained againe, but let that be with ſixe ounces of ſugar of Roſes, and a little Treacle; let the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent take eight ounces or fewer of that liquor, and it will prouoke ſweat. The pouder following is alſo verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Take of the leaues of <hi>Dictamnus,</hi> the rootes of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentill, Betoni, of each halfe an ounce; of bole Armenicke prepared one ounce; of <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> three drams; of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes and Mirrhe of each halfe a dram; of Saffron one dram;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3293:27"/>
of Maſticke two drammes: pouder them all according to Arte, and giue one dram thereof diſſolued in Roſe-water, or the water of wilde ſorrell, and let the patient walke ſo ſoone as he hath taken that pouder; then let him be laid in his bed to ſweate as I haue ſhewed before. The water fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is greatly commended againſt poyſon. Take the roots of Gentian and Cyperus, of each three drams; of <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> Burnet, of each one handfull; of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell ſeedes, and Diuels-bit, of each two pugils; of Ivie and Iuniper berries, of each halfe an ounce; of the flowers of Bugloſſe, Violets, and red Roſes, of each two pugils, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſomewhat groſſely; then ſoake or ſteepe them for a night in white wine and Roſe water; then adde thereto of Bole Armenicke one ounce; of Treacle halfe an ounce, diſtill them all in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and keepe the diſtilled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in a viall of glaſſe well couered or cloſe ſtopped for your vſe: let the patient take ſixe ounces thereof with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and a little Cinamon and Saffron: then let him walke, and then ſweate, as is aforeſaid: the Treacle and cordiall water formerly preſcribed are verie profitable for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Alſo the water following is greatly commended. Take of Sorrell ſixe handfuls: of Rue one handfull: drie them, and macerate them in Vineger for the ſpace of foure and twentie houres, adding thereto foure ounces of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: make thereof a diſtillation in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and let the diſtilled water be kept for your vſe; and ſo ſoone as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient doth thinke himſelfe to bee infected, let him take foure ounces of that liquor, then let him walk and ſweat. He muſt leaue ſweating when he beginneth to waxe faint and weake, or when the humor that runs down his bodie begins to waxe cold, then his bodie muſt be wiped with warme clothes, and dried. The patient ought not to ſweate with a full ſtomacke, for ſo the heate is called away from perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the office of concoction: alſo he muſt not ſleepe when he is in his ſweate, leſt the malignitie, goe inwardly with the heate and ſpirits vnto the principall parts; but if the patient be much enclined to ſleepe, he muſt be kept from it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3293:27"/>
with hard rubbing, and bands tyed about the extreame parts of his bodie, and with much noiſe of thoſe that are about him, and let his friends comfort him with the good hope that they haue of his recouerie; but if allthis will not keepe him from ſleepee, diſſolue <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> in tart Vineger, and <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and let it be iniected into his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels: and let him be kept continually waking the firſt day, and on the ſecond and third, euen vnto the fourth; that is to ſay, vnto the perfect expulſion of the venom; &amp; let him not ſleep aboue three or foure houres on a day and night. In the meane time let the Phyſition that ſhall bee preſent conſider all things by his ſtrength: for it is to be feared, that great watchings will diſſolue the ſtrength, and make the patient weake: you muſt not let him eate within three houres after his ſweating; in the meane ſeaſon, as his ſtrength ſhall require, let him take the rinde of a preſerued Citron, conſerue of Roſes, bread toaſted and ſteeped in wine, the meate of a preſerued Myrabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, or ſome ſuch like thing.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O ſoone as the heart is ſtrengthened and corroberated with cordials &amp; Antidotes, we muſt come vnto phlebotomie and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. As concerning bloud-letting in this caſe, there is a great controuerſie among Phyſitions. Thoſe that wiſh it to be vſed, ſay or affirme that the peſtilent Feauer doth infixe it ſelfe in the bloud, and therein alſo the peſtilent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie taketh its ſeate; and therefore it will ſoone infect the other humors, vnleſſe that the bloud be euacuated, and the infection that remaineth in the bloud be thereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3293:28"/>
away. Contrariwiſe thoſe that do allow phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in this caſe, alledge that it often commeth to paſſe that the bloud is void of malignitie when the other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are infected with the venemous contagion. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man require my iudgement in this doubtfull queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſay, that the Peſtilence ſometimes doth depend on the default of the ayre: This default being drawn through the paſſages of the bodie, doth at length pierce vnto the entrals, as wee may vnderſtand by the abſceſſes which breake out one while behinde the eares, ſometimes in the arme-holes, and ſometimes in the groines, as the braine, heart, or liuer are infected. And hereof alſo come Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, and other collections of matter and eruptions, which are ſeene in all parts of the bodie, by reaſon that nature vſing the ſtrength of the expulſiue facultie, doth driue forth whatſoeuer is noiſome or hurtfull. Therefore if the Phyſition will follow this motion of nature, he muſt neither purge, nor let bloud, leſt that by a contrarie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, by drawing in from without, the motion of nature which proceeds outwardly from within, ſhould be troubled. So wee often ſee in thoſe who are purged or let bloud for ſuch Buboes as come through vnlawfull copulation, that the matter is thereby made contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and by drawing it inwardly it ſpeedily cauſeth the French Poxes. Wherefore when Buboes, Carbuncles, and other peſtilent eruptions appeare, which come through the default of the ayre, wee ought to abſtaine from purging and phlebotomie; but it is ſufficient to forearme the heart inwardly and outwardly with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes that are endewed with a proper vertue of reſiſting the poiſon. For it is not to bee doubted, but that when nature is debilitated with both kindes of euacuation, and when the ſpirits together with the bloud are exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, the venemous ayre will ſoone pierce, and be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the emptie bodie, where it exerciſeth its tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to the vtter deſtruction thereof.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord God 1565. in which yeare
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3293:28"/>
there was great mortalitie through out all France, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo nof the Peſtilence, and peſtilent diſeaſes, I earneſtly and diligently enquired of all the Phyſitions, and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians of all the Cities (through whom King <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth paſſed in his progreſſe vnto Bayon) what ſucceſſe their patients had after they were letten bloud &amp; purged, wherunto they all anſwerd alike, that they had diligently obſerued, that all that were infected with the Peſtilence, and were letten bleede ſome good quantitie of bloud, or had their bodies ſomewhat ſtrongly purged, thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards waxed weaker and weaker, and ſo at length died; but others which were not let bloud, nor purged, but took cordial Antidotes inwardly and applied them outwardly, for the moſt part eſcaped and recouered their health: for that kinde of Peſtilence tooke its originall of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue and ſolitarie default of the ayre, and not of the corruption of the humors. The like euent was noted in the hoarſeneſſe that wee ſpake of before: that is to ſay, that the patients waxed worſe and worſe by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and phlebotomie; but yet I doe not diſallow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe remedies, if there bee great fulneſſe in the bodie, eſpecially in the beginning, and if the matter haue a cruell violence, whereof may be feared the breaking in vnto ſome noble part. For we know that it is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that what diſeaſe ſoeuer is cauſed by repletion, muſt bee cured by euacuation: and that in diſeaſes that are verie ſharpe, if the matter doe ſwell, it ought to be remedied the ſame day, for delay in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes is dangerous; but ſuch diſeaſes are not cauſed or inflicted vpon mans bodie by reaſon or occaſion of the Peſtilence, but of the diſeaſed bodies and diſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues commixed together with the Peſtilence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then peraduenture it is lawfull to purge ſtrongly, and to let a good quantitie of bloud, leſt that the peſtilentve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome ſhould take hold of the matter that is prepared, and ſo infect it with a contagion, whereby the peſtilence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth new and farre greater ſtrength; eſpecially as <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:3293:29"/>
admoniſheth vs, where he ſaith; that, By how much the ſooner thoſe ſodaine inuaſions do happen, by ſo much the ſooner remedies muſt bee vſed, yea or rather raſhly applied; therefore if the veines ſwell, the face waxe fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie red, if the arteries of the temples beate ſtrongly, if the patient can verie hardly breath by reaſon of a weight in his ſtomacke, if his ſpittle be bloudie, then ought hee to be let bloud without delay, for the cauſes before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. It ſeemes beſt to open the liuer veine on the left arme, whereby the heart and the ſpleene may be better diſcharged of their abundant matter; yet bloud letting is not good at all times, for it is not expedient when the bodie beginneth to waxe ſtiffe by reaſon of the comming of the Feuer; for then by drawing backe the heate and ſpirits inwardly, the outward parts beeing deſtitute of bloud waxe ſtiffe and cold; therefore bloud cannot bee letten then without great loſſe of the ſtrength, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the humors. And it is to bee noted, that when thoſe plethoricke cauſes are preſent, there is one Indication of bloud-letting in a ſimple peſtilent Feauer, and another in that which hath a Bubo, <hi>id eſt,</hi> a Botch or a Carbuncle ioined therewith. For in one or both of theſe being ioined with a vehement and ſtrong burning Feuer, bloud muſt bee letten by opening the veine that is neereſt vnto the tumor or ſwelling againſt nature, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ſtraightneſſe of the fibres, that this being open the bloud might be drawne more directly from the part affected; for all and euerie retraction of putrified bloud vnto the noble parts is to bee auoided, becauſe it is noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and hurtfull to nature, and to the patient. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for examples ſake, admit the patient bee plethoricke by repletion which is called <hi>Ad vaſa, id est,</hi> vnto the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and <hi>Ad vires, id est,</hi> vnto the ſtrength: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he hath a tumor that is peſtilent in the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto his head or necke, the bloud muſt be let out of the cephalicke or median veine, or out of one of their branches diſperſed in the arme on the greened ſide. But
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3293:29"/>
if through occaſion of fatt, or any other ſuch like cauſe thoſe veines doe not appeare in the arme, there bee ſome that giue counſell in ſuch a caſe to open the veine that is betweene the forefinger and the thombe, the hand being put into warme water, whereby that veine may ſwell and be filled with bloud, gathered thither by meanes of the heate. If the tumor bee vnder the arme-hole or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe places, the liuer veine, or the median muſt be opened which runneth alongſt the hand: if it bee in the groine, the veine of the hamme, or <hi>Saphena,</hi> or any other veine aboue the foote that apreareth well, but alwaies on the greeued fide. And phlebotomie muſt bee performed before the third day: for this diſeaſe is of the kinde or nature of ſharpe diſeaſes; becauſe that within foure and twentie houres it runneth paſt helpe. In letting of bloud you muſt haue conſideration of the ſtrength. You may perceiue that the patient is readie to ſwound when that his forehead waxeth moiſt, with a ſmall ſweate ſodainely ariſing, by the aking or paine at the ſtomacke, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to vomite, and deſire to go to ſtoole, gaping, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the lippes, and ſodaine alteration of the face vnto paleneſſe: and laſtly moſt certainely by a ſmall and ſlow pulſe: and then you muſt lay your finger on the veine, and ſtop it vntill the patient come to himſelfe againe, either by nature; or elſe reſtored by Arte, that is to ſay, by giuing vnto him bread dipped in wine, or anie other ſuch like thing: then if you haue not taken bloud enough, you muſt let it goe againe and bleede ſo much as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the diſeaſe, or the ſtrength of the patient will permit or require: which being done, ſome one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes that are preſcribed before will be verie profitable to be drunk, which may repaire the ſtrength and infrigne the force of the malignitie.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you call to minde the proper indications, purging ſhall ſeeme neceſſarie in this kinde of diſeaſe, and that muſt be preſcribed as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe and neceſſitie requireth; rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the diſeaſe is ſodaine, and doth require medicines that may with all ſpeede driue out of the bodie the hurtfull humor wherein the noiſome qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie doth lurke and is hidden; which medicines are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe by reaſon of the diuerſity of the kinde of the humor, and the condition, or temperature of the patient. For this purpoſe ſixe graines of Scammonie beaten into pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or elſe tenne graines are commonly miniſtred to the patient with one dramme of Treacle. Alſo pils may bee made in this forme: Take of Treacle and Mithridate, of each one dramme; of <hi>Sulphur vinum</hi> finely poudered halfe a dram; of <hi>Diagridium</hi> foure graines: make thereof Pils. Or, Take three drams of Alloes; of Myrhe and Saffron, of each one dramme; of white Hellebore and Aſarabac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, of each foure ſcruples: make thereof a maſle with old Treacle, and let the patient take foure ſcruples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for a doſe, three houres before meate. <hi>Ruffus</hi> his Pils may be profitably giuen to thoſe that are weake. The ancient Phyſitions haue greatly commended Agarick for this diſeaſe, becauſe it doth draw the noiſome humors out of all the members: and the vertues thereof are like vnto thoſe of Treacle; for it is thought to ſtrengthen the heart and to draw out the malignitie by purging. To thoſe that are ſtrong the weight of two drammes may be giuen, and to thoſe that are more weake halfe a dramme. It is better to giue the infuſion in a decoction, than in ſubſtance; for beeing elected and prepared truely into
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3293:30"/>
Trochiſes, it may bee called a moſt diuine kinde of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. Antimonium is highly praiſed by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many; but becauſe I know the vſe thereof is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the counſell and decree of the Schoole of Phyſitions at Paris, I will here ceaſe to ſpeake of it. Thoſe medicines that cauſe ſweates are thought to excell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when the Peſtilence commeth of the venemous ayre: among whom the efficacie of that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hath beene proued, to the great good of manie in that Peſtilence which was lately throughout all Germanie, as <hi>Matthias Rodler,</hi> Chauncellor to Duke <hi>George</hi> the Count Palatine, ſignified vnto mee by letters. They doe take a bundle of Mugwort, and of the aſhes thereof after it is burnt they make a lye thereof with foure pints of water; then they doe ſet it ouer the fier and boile it in a veſſell of earth well leaded vntill the liquor be conſumed, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy dregges falling vnto the bottome like vnto ſalt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they make Trochiſes of the weight of a crowne of gold: then they diſſolue one or two of thoſe Trochiſes, according to the ſtrength of the patient, in good Muska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, and giue it the patient to drinke, and let him walke after that he hath drunk it for the ſpace of halfe an houre; then lay him in his bedde, and there ſweate him two or three houres, and then hee will vomite, and his belly will be looſed as if he had taken Antimonie; and ſo they were all for the moſt part cured, eſpecially all thoſe that tooke that remedie betimes, and before the diſeaſe went vnto their heart, as I my ſelfe haue proued in ſome that were ſicke at Paris, with moſt happie ſucceſſe: Truely Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort is highly commended by the ancient Phyſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken and applied inwardly or outwardly againſt the bitings of venemous creatures, ſo that it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that it hath great vertue againſt the Peſtilence. I haue heard it moſt certainly reported by <hi>Gilbertus Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus</hi> Phyſition of <hi>Mompilier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that eight ounces of the pickle of Anchoues drunke at one draught is a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and approued remedie againſt the Peſtilence, as hee
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3293:31"/>
and many other haue often found by experience. For the Plague is no other thing but a verie great putrefaction, for the correction and amendment whereof, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more apt or fit than this pickle or ſubſtance of the Anchoues, being melted by the ſun &amp; force of the ſalt that is ſtrawed thereon. There be ſome which infuſe one dramme of Walewort ſeede in white wine, and affirme that it drunken wil performe the like effect as Antimony. Others diſſolue a little weight of the ſeede of Rue beeing bruiſed in Muskadine, with the quantitie of a Beane of Treacle, and ſo drink it. Others beate or bruiſe an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the leaues or toppes of Broome in halfe a pinte of white wine, and ſo giue it to the patient to drink to cauſe him to vomite, looſe his belly, and make him to ſweate. Truely, thoſe that are wounded or bitte with venemous beaſts, if they binde broome aboue the wound it will prohibit or hinder the venome from diſperſing it ſelfe, or going any farther: therefore a drinke made thereof will prohibite the venome from going anie neerer the heart. Some take of the roote of Elecampane, Gentian, Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, Kermesberries, and broome; of the pouder of Iuorie and Harts-horne, of each halfe a dramme, they do bruiſe and beat all theſe, and infuſe them for the ſpace of foure and twentie hours in white Wine and <hi>Aquavita</hi> on the warme embers, and then ſtraine it, and giue the patient three or foure ounces thereof to drinke; this prouokes ſweate, and infrignes the power of the poiſon, and the potion following hath the ſame vertue.</p>
               <p>Take good Muſtard halfe an ounce; of Treacle or Mithridate the weight of a Beane, diſſolue them in white Wine and a little <hi>Aqua vita,</hi> and let the patient drinke it and ſweate thereon with walking. You may alſo roſte a great Onion made hollow, and filled with halfe a dram of Treacle and Vineger vnder the embers; and then ſtraine it, and mixe the iuice that is preſſed out of it with the water of Sorrell, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> or anie other cordiall thing, and with ſtrong wine, and giue the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3293:31"/>
to drinke thereof to prouoke ſweate, and to repell the malignitie. Or elſe take as much Garlicke as the quantitie of a bigge Nut; of Rue and Celandine, of each twentie leaues, bruiſe them all in white Wine and a little <hi>Aqua vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> then ſtraine it, and giue the patient thereof to drinke. There be ſome that doe drinke the iuice that is preſſed out of Celandine and Mallowes, with three ounces of Vineger, and halfe an ounce of the oyle of Walenuts, and then by much walking doe vnburthen their ſtomacke and belly vpwards and downewards, and ſo are helped. When the venemous ayre hath alreadie crept into and infected the humors, one dramme of the dried leaues of the Bay tree macerated for the ſpace of two daies in Vineger and drunk, is thought to bee a moſt ſoueraigne medicine to prouoke ſweate, looſeneſſe of the belly, and vomiting. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Morbo Gallico</hi> writeth, that the powder of Mercury miniſtred vnto the patient with the iuice of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus,</hi> or with the electuarie <hi>de Gemmis,</hi> will driue away the Peſtilence before it be confirmed in the bodie, by prouoking vomite, looſeneſſe of the belly, and ſweate: one dramme of Calchanthum or white Copperoſe diſſolued in Roſe-water, performeth the like effect in the ſame diſeaſe. Some do giue the patient a little quantitie of the oile of Scorpions with white wine to expel the poiſon by vomite, and therewithall they doe annoint the region of the heart, the breſt, and the wraſts of the hands. I thinke theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meet to be vſed often in bodies that are ſtrong and well exerciſed, becauſe weaker medicines doe euacuate little or nothing at all, but onely moue the humors, whereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a Feauer. When a ſufficient quantie of the malignitie is euacuated, then you muſt miniſter things that may ſtrengthen the belly and ſtomacke, and withhold the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or working of the humors: and ſuch is confection of Alkermes.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of maute Symptomes which happen together with the Plague: and firſt of the paine of the head.</head>
               <p>IF the malignitie be carried into the braine, and nature be not able to expell it, it inflames not onely it, but alſo the membranes that do couer it: which inflamation doth one while hurt, trouble, or aboliſh the imagination, another while the iudgement, and ſometimes the memorie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſituation of the inflamation, whether it bee in the former, hinder, or middle part of the head; but hereof commeth alwayes a Phrenſie, with fierie redneſſe of the eyes and face, and heauineſſe and burning of the whole head. If this will not be amended with Cliſters, and with opening the Cephalicke veine in the arme, the arteries of the temples muſt be opened, taking ſo much bloud out of them, as the greatneſſe of the Symptomes and the ſtrength of the patient ſhall require and permit. Truely the inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is made in opening of an arterie will cloſe and ioine together as readily, and with as little difficultie, as the inciſion of a veine. And of ſuch an inciſion of an arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie commeth preſent helpe, by reaſon that the tenſiue and ſharpe vapours do plentifully breath out together with the arterious bloud. It were alſo verie good to prouoke a fluxe of bloud at the noſe, if nature be apt to exonerate her ſelfe that way. For, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, when the head is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or generally aketh; if matter, water, or bloud flow cut at the noſtrels, mouth, or eares, it preſently cures the diſeaſe. Such bleeding is to be prouoked by ſtrong blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſtriuing to cleanſe the noſe, by ſcratching or pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inner ſides of the noſtrels, by pricking with an horſe haire, and long holding downe of the head. The Lord of Fontaines, a Knight of the Order, when wee were at Bayon, had a bleeding at the noſe, which came naturally
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3293:32"/>
for the ſpace of two daies, and thereby hee was freed of a peſtilent Feuer which he had before, a great ſweate riſing therewithall, and ſhortly after his Carbuncles came to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, and by Gods grace he recouered his health being vnder my cure. If the bloud doe flow out and cannot bee ſtopped when it ought, the hands, armes, and legges muſt be tied with bands, and ſponges wet in Oxycrate muſt be put vnder the arme-holes, cupping-glaſſes muſt be applied vnto the dugges, the region of the liuer and ſpleene; and you muſt put into the noſtrels the doune of the Willow tree, or anie other aſtringent medicine, incorporated with the haires pluckt from the flanke, belly, or throat of a Hare, bole Armenicke, <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> the iuice of Plantain and Knotgraſſe mixed together; and furthermore the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt be placed or laied in a coole place. But if the pain be nothing mitigated, notwithſtanding all theſe fluxes of bloud, wee muſt come to medicines that procure ſleepe, whoſe formes are theſe:</p>
               <p>Take of greene Lettuce one handfull, flowers of water Lillies and Violets, of each two pugils; one head of white Poppy bruiſed; of the foure cold ſeedes, of each two drams; of Liquoris and Raiſons, of each one dramme: make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a decoction, and in the ſtraining diſſolue one ounce and an halfe of <hi>Diacodion:</hi> make thereof a large potion, to bee giuen when they goe to reſt. Alſo a Barly-creame may bee prepared in the water of water Lillies and Sorrell, of each two ounces, adding thereto ſixe or eight graines of <hi>Opium:</hi> of the foure cold ſeedes, and of white Poppie ſeedes, of each halfe an ounce, and let the ſame bee boiled in broths with Lettuce and Purſlane; alſo the Pils <hi>de Cynogloſſo, ideſt,</hi> Hounds tongue may be giuen. Cliſters that prouoke ſleepe muſt be vſed, which may be thus prepared:</p>
               <p>Take of Barly-water halfe a pinte; oile of Violets and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Lillies, of each two ounces; of the water of Plantaine and Purſelaine, or rather of their iuices, three ounces; of Camphire ſeuen graines, and the whites of three egges: make thereof a Cliſter. The head muſt be fomented with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3293:33"/>
Roſe-vineger, the haire being firſt ſhauen away, leauing a double cloth wet therein on the ſame, and often renewed. Sheepes lungs taken warme out of the bodies, may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the head, as long as they are warme. Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes with ſcarrification and without ſcarrification, may be applied vnto the necke and ſhoulder-blades. The armes and legges muſt bee ſtrongly bound, being firſt well rubbed to diuert the ſharpe vapours and humors from the head. Frontals may alſo bee made on this manner. Take of the oyle of Roſes and water-Lillies, of each two ounces; of the oile of Poppey halfe an ounce; of Opium one dramme; of Roſe-vineger one ounce, of Camphire halfe a dram, mixe them together. Alſo Nodules may bee made of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Poppies, Henbane, water-Lillies, Mandrakes beaten in Roſe-water with a little Vineger, and a little Camphire, and let them be often applied to the noſtrels: for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Cataplaſmes alſo may bee laid to the forehead. As, Take of the mucilage of the ſeedes of <hi>Pſilium, id eſt,</hi> Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, and Quince ſeedes extracted in Roſe-water, three ounces; of Barly meale foure ounces; of the pouder of Roſe leaues, the flowers of water-Lillies and Violets, of each halfe an ounce; of the ſeedes of Poppies and Purflaine, of each two ounces; of the water and vineger of Roſes, of each three ounces: make thereof a Cataplaſine, and apply it warme vnto the head. Or, Take of the iuice of Lettuce, water-Lillies, Henbaine, Purſelaine, of each halfe a pinte; of Roſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>leaues in pouder, the ſeedes of Poppie, of each halfe an ounce; oyle of Roſes three ounces; of Vineger two ounces; of Barly meale as much as ſhall ſuffice: make thereof a Cataplaſme in the forme of a liquid Pultis. When the heate of the head is mitigated by theſe medicines, &amp; the inflammation of the braine aſſwaged, we muſt come vnto digeſting and reſoluing fomentations, which may diſperſe the matter of the vapours. But commonly in paine of the head, they doe vſe to binde the forehead and hinder part of the head verie ſtrongly, which in this caſe muſt bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided.</p>

               <p>IN Peſtilent feauers, the skinne is marked and variegated in diuerſe places with ſpotts, like vnto the bitings of Fleas or Gnats, which are not alwaies ſimple, but many times ariſe in forme like vnto a graine of millet. The more ſpots appeare, the better it is for the patient: they are of diuerſe colours according to the virulency of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and condition of the matter, as red, yellow, browne, violet, or purpule, blew &amp; blacke. And becauſe for the moſt part they are of a purple colour, therefore wee callthem Purples. Others call them <hi>Lenticulae,</hi> becauſe they haue the colour and forme of lentills. They are alſo called <hi>Papiliones (i)</hi> Butterflies, becauſe they doe ſuddainly ſeaze or fall vpon diuerſe regions of the body, like vnto winged Butterflies, ſometimes the face, ſometimes the armes and leggs, and ſometimes all the whole body; oftentimes they doe not onely affect the vpper part of the skinne, but goe deeper into the fleſh, ſpecially when they proceed of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is groſſe and aduſt. They doe ſometimes appeare great and broad, affecting the whole arme, legge or face like vnto an <hi>Eryſipelas:</hi> to conclude, they are diuerſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of the humour that offends in quality or quantity. If they are of a purple or blacke colour, with often ſounding, and ſinke in ſodainly without any manifeſt cauſe, they foreſhew death. The cauſe of the breaking out of thoſe ſpotts, is the working, or heate of the bloud, by reaſon of the cruelty of the venom receiued, or admitted. They often ariſe at the beginning of a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent feauer: many times before the breaking out of the Sore, or Botch, or Carbuncle, and many times after: but then they ſhew ſo greata corruption of the humors in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3293:34"/>
body, that neither the Sores, nor Carbuncles will ſuffice to receaue them, and therefore they appeare as fore-runners of death. Sometimes they breake out alone, without a Botch or Carbuncle: which if they be redde and haue no euill Symptomes ioyned with them, they are not wont to proue deadly: they appeare for the moſt part on the third or fourth day of the diſſeaſe, and ſometimes later, and ſometimes they appeare not before the patient bee dead, becauſe the working, or heate of the humors, being the ofspring of putrefaction is not as yet reſtrayned and ceaſed. Wherefore then principally the putrid heate, which is greateſt a little before the death of the patient, driues the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementall humors, which are the matter of the ſpotts, vnto the skin; or elſe becauſe nature in the laſt conflict hath contended with ſome greater endeuour then before (which is common to all things, that are ready to dye.) a little before the inſtant time of death, the Peſtilent humor being preſently driuen vnto the skinne; and nature thus weakened by this extreame conflict, falleth downe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and is quite ouerthrowne by the remnant of the matter.</p>

the aboundance of the venome flowing backe: or elſe by turning into the belly it inferres a mortall bloody flixe: which diſcommodities that they may be auoyded, I haue thought good to ſet downe this remedy, whoſe Efficacy I haue knowne and proued many times and on diuerſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when by reaſon of the weaknes of the expulſiue facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the thicknes of the skinne, the matter of the ſpotts cannot breake forth, but is conſtrayned to ſurke vnder the skinne, lifting it vp into bunches and knobbes. I was brought vnto the inuention of this remedy by compariſon of the like. For when I vnderſtood that the eſſence of the French Poxs (and likewiſe of the Peſtilence) conſiſted in a certaine hidden virulency and venemous quality, I ſoone deſcended vnto that opinion, that euen as by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting of the body with the vnguent compounded of Quickſiluer, the groſſe &amp; clammie humors which are fixed in the bones, and vnmoueable are diſſolued, relaxed, and drawen from the center into the ſuperficiall parts of the body, by ſtrengthening and ſtirring vp the expulſiue faculty, and euacuated by ſweating and fluxing at the mouth; That ſo it ſhould come to paſſe in Peſtilent feauers, that nature being ſtrengthened with the ſame kind of vnction, might vnloade her ſelfe of ſome portion of the venemous and Peſtilent humor by opening the pores and paſſages and letting it breake forth into ſpotts and puſtles and into all kinde of eruptions. Therefore I haue annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many in whom nature ſeemed to make paſſage for the venemous matter very ſlowly, firſt looſing their belly with a Cliſter and then giuing them Treacle water to drinke, which might defend the vitall faculty of the heart, but yet not diſtende the ſtomacke, as though they had had the French Poxe, and I obtained my expected purpoſe; in ſtead of the Treacle water, you may vſe the decoction of <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> which doth heate, dry, prouoke ſweat and repell putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, adding thereto alſo vineger, that by the ſubtletie thereof it may pearce the better, and withſtand the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

               <p>A Peſtilent <hi>Bubo</hi> is a tumor at the beginning long and moueable, and in the ſtate and full perfection copped and with a ſharpe head, vnmoueable and fixed deepely in the glandules, or kernels, by which the braine exonerates it ſelfe of the venemous and peſtiferous matter into the kernells that are behinde the eares, and in the necke: the heart into thoſe that are in the arme-hooles: and the liuer into thoſe that are in the groine; that is, when all the matter is groſſe and clammy, ſo that it cannot bee drawen out by ſpotts and puſtles breaking out on the skin; and ſo the matter of a Carbuncle is ſharpe and ſo feruent that it maketh an <hi>Eſchar</hi> on the place where it is fixed. In the beginning while the <hi>Bubo</hi> is breeding it maketh the patient to feele as it were a coard or rope ſtretched in the place, or a hardened nerue with pricking payne: and ſhortly after the matter is raiſed vp as it were into a knob, and by little and little it groweth bigger and is enflamed, theſe accidents before mentioned accompanying it. If the tumor be red and encreaſe by little and little, it is a good and ſalutary ſigne: but if it be liuide or blacke, and come very ſlowly vnto its iuſt bigneſs, it is a deadly ſigne: It is alſo a deadly ſigne if it encreaſe ſodainly and come vnto his iuſt bigneſs as it were with a ſwift violence, &amp; as in a moment haue all the Symptomes in the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as pain, ſwelling and burning. Buboes or Sores appeare ſometimes of a naturall colour like vnto the skinne, and in all other things like vnto an oedematous tumor, which notwithſtanding will ſodainly bring the patient to deſtruction, like thoſe that are liuide and blacke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not good to truſt too much to thoſe kindes of tumors.</p>

               <p>SO ſoone as the Bubo appeares, apply a Cupping-glaſſe with a great flame vnto it; vnleſſe it bee that kinde of Bubo which will ſodainly haue all the accidents of burning and ſwelling in the higheſt nature; but firſt the skinne muſt be annointed with oyle of Lillies, that ſo it beeing made more looſe the Cupping-glaſſe may draw the ſtronger and more powerfully: it ought to ſticke to the part for the ſpace of a quarter of an houre, and to bee renewed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied againe euerie three quarters of an houre, for ſo at the length the venome ſhall bee the better drawne forth from anie noble part that is weake, and the worke of ſuppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reſolution, whichſoeuer nature hath aſſaied, will the better and ſooner be abſolued and perfected: which may be alſo done by the application of the following ointment.</p>
               <p>Take of <hi>Vnguentum Dialthaea</hi> one ounce and a halfe; oile of Scorpions halfe an ounce; of Mithridate diſſolued in <hi>Aquavitae</hi> halfe a dramme: this liniment will verie well relaxe and looſen the skinne, open the pores thereof, and ſpend forth portion of that matter which the Cupping-glaſſe hath drawne thither: in ſtead thereof mollifying fomentations may bee made, and other drawing and ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating medicines, which ſhall bee deſcribed hereafter. A Veſicatorie applied in a meete place below the Bubo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits verie much, but not aboue; as for example. If the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo be in the throate, the Veſicatorie muſt be applied vnto the ſhoulder blade on the ſame ſide: if it bee in the arme-holes, it muſt be applied in the middeſt of the arme, or of the ſhoulder bone on the inner ſide: if in the groine, in the middeſt of the thigh on the inner ſide, that by the double paſſage that is open for to draw out the matter, the part wherein the venome is gathered together may bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exonerated. Spurge, Crow-foot, Arſmart, Beare-foote,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3293:36"/>
Brionie, the middle barke of Trauellers-ioy, the rindes of mullet, <hi>Flammula</hi> or vpright Virgines-bower, are fit for raiſing bliſters. If you cannot come by thoſe ſimple me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, you may apply this that followeth, which may be prepared at all times.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Cantharides,</hi> Pepper, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> Pellitory of Spaine, of each halfe a dramme; of ſoure Leauen two drams; of Muſtard one dramme, and a little Vineger; the Vineger is added thereto to withhold or reſtraine the vehemencie of the <hi>Cantharides;</hi> but in want of this medicine it ſhall ſuffice to droppe ſcalding oyle or water, or a burning candle, or to lay a burning cole on the place: for ſo you may raiſe bliſters, which muſt preſently bee cut away, and you muſt ſee that you keepe the vlcers open and flowing as long as you can by applying the leaues of red Coleworts, Beetes, or Iuie dipped in warme water, and anointed with oyle or freſh butter. Some apply Cauteries, but Veſicatories worke with more ſpeede: for before the Eſchar of the Cauteries will fall away the patient may die: therefore the vlcers that are made with veſicatories will ſuffice to euacuate the peſtilent venome; becauſe that doth worke rather by its qualitie than its quantitie. Let the abſceſſe bee fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it is ſhewed before: and then let the medicine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which hath vertue to draw, bee applied, Fill a great onion, being hollowed, with Treacle and the leaues of Rue; then roſt it vnder the hote embers, beate it with a little Leauen and a little Swines greaſe, and ſo apply it warme vnto the abſceſſe or ſore; let it be changed euery ſixe hours. Or, Take the rootes of Marſh-mallowes and Lillies, of each halfe a pound; of Line, Foenigreeke, and Muſtard ſeedes, of each halfe an ounce; of Treacle one dram; tenne figges, and as much hogges greaſe as ſhall ſuffice: make thereof a Cataplaſme according to Arte. Or, Take of Onions and Garlicke roſted in the embers, of each three ounces; bruiſe them with one ounce of ſoure Leauen, adding thereto <hi>Vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Baſilicon</hi> one ounce; Treacle one dramme; Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date halfe a dramme; of old hogges greaſe one ounce; of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3293:37"/>
Cantharides in powder one ſcruple; of Pigeons doung two drams; beate them and mixe them together into the forme of a Cataplafme. Hereunto old Rennet is verie profitable; for it is hot and therefore atractiue beeing mixed with old Leauen &amp; <hi>Baſilicon:</hi> you ought to vſe theſe vntil the abſceſſe be growne vnto its full ripeneſſe and bigneſſe; but if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the beginning there be great inflammation, with ſharpe paine, as it often happeneth, eſpecially when the abſceſſes be of the kinde of Carbuncles, wee muſt abſtaine from thoſe remedies that are hot and attractiue, and alſo from theſe that are verie emplaſticke and clammie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe altogether cloſe the pores of the skinne, or becauſe they doe reſolue the thinner part of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected matter, which if it might remaine would bring the other ſooner to ſuppuration: or elſe becauſe they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance draw more quantitie of the hot matter than the part can beare, whereof commeth rather corruption than maturation: and laſt of all becauſe they encreaſe the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and paine, which inferreth danger of a Conuulſion or mortall Gangrene. Therefore in ſuch a caſe it is beſt to vſe cold and temperate locall medicines; as the leaues of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane and Sorrell roſted vnder the coles, <hi>Galens</hi> pultis, and ſuch like. There are manie that for feare of death haue with their owne hands pulled away the <hi>Bubo</hi> with a paire of Smiths pincers: others haue digged the fleſh round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and ſo gotten it wholly out. And to conclude, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue become ſo madde, that they haue thruſt an hot iron into it with their owne hand, that the venome might haue a paſſage forth: of all which I doe not allow one; for ſuch abſceſſes doe not come from without, as the bitings of virulent beaſts, but from within, and moreouer becauſe paine is by theſe meanes encreaſed, and the humor is made more maligne and fierce. Therefore I thinke it ſufficient to vſe medicines that doe relaxe, open the pores of the skinne, and digeſt portion of the venome by tranſpiration, as are theſe that follow. Take the rootes of Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and Lillies, of each ſixe ounces; of Chamomill and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3293:37"/>
Melilote flowers, of each halfe an handfull; of Linne ſeedes halfe an ounce; of the leaues of Rue halfe an handfull; boile them and ſtraine them, dip ſpunges in the ſtraining, and there with let the rumor bee fomented a long time. Or, Take the crumme of hot bread, and ſprinkle it with Treacle-water, or with <hi>Aqud vitae,</hi> and Cowes milke or Goates milke, and the yelkes of three egges, put them all on ſtupes or flaxe, and apply them warme vnto the place. Or, Take of ſoure Rie leauen foure ounces; of <hi>Baſilicon</hi> two ounces, three yelkes of egges, oile of Lillies two ounces, Treacle one dramme; let it bee receiued on ſtupes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in like manner. Or, Take of <hi>Diachylon</hi> and <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> of each two ounces, oile of Lillies one ounce and halfe; let them be melted and mixed together, and let it be applied as is aboueſaid. When you ſee, feele, and know, according to reaſon, that the <hi>Bubo</hi> is come to perfect ſuppuration, it muſt be opened with an inciſion knife, or an actuall or potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cauterie, but it is beſt to bee done with a potentiall Cauterie, vnleſſe that happely there be great inflammation, becauſe it doth draw the venome from beneath vnto the ſuperficiall parts, and maketh a larger orifice for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is contained therein: neither muſt it bee looked for, that nature ſhould open it of her ſelfe, for then it were danger that leſt while nature doth worke ſlowly a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vapour ſhould be ſtirred vp, which ſtriking the heart by the arteries, the braine by the nerues, and the liuer by the veines, cauſeth a new encreaſe of the venemous infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For feare whereof there bee ſome that will not expect the perfect maturation and ſuppuration, but as it were in the midſt of the cruditie and maturitie wil make an orifice for it to paſſe forth at: yet if it bee done before the tumor bee at his perfect maturitie, paine, a feauer, and all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are ſtirred vp and enraged, whereof commeth a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne vlcer that often degenerates into a Gangrene. For the moſt part about the tenth or eleuenth day the worke of ſuppuration ſeemeth perfected and finiſhed; but it may bee ſooner or later by reaſon of the application of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3293:38"/>
the condition of the matter and ſtate of the part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the matter commeth forth, you muſt yet vſe ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and mollifying medicines to maturate the remaines thereof, in the meane while clenſing the vicer by putting mundificatiues into it, as wee ſhall declare in the cure of Carbuncles. But if the tumor ſeeme to ſinke in or hide it ſelfe againe, it muſt be reuoked and procured to come forth again, by applying of Cupping-glaſſes with ſcarrification, &amp; with ſharpe medicines, yea and with Cauteries both actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and potentiall. When the Cauteries are applied it ſhall bee verie good to apply a veſicatorie a little below it, that there may bee ſome paſſage open for the venome while the Eſchar is in falling away. For ſo they that are troubled with the french Poxe, ſo long as they haue open and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vlcers, ſo long are they void of anie paine that is worth the ſpeaking of; which vlcers being cloſed and cicatriced, they doc preſently complaine of great paine. If you ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that the <hi>Bubo</hi> is more maligne by reaſon that it is of a greene, or black, and inflamed colour, as are thoſe that come of a melancholy humor by aduſtion, turned into a groſſe and rebellious melancholy humor, ſo that by the more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious influxe thereof into the part, there is danger of a Gangrene and mortification; then the places about the abſceſſe muſt bee armed with repercuſſiues, but not the abſceſſe it ſelfe: and this may be the forme of the repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiues: Take of the iuice of houſeleeke, Purſelaine, Sorrell, Nightſhade, of each two ounces; of Vineger one ounce; the whites of three egges; of oyle of Roſes and water-Lillies, of each two ounces and a halfe; ſtirre them together, and apply it about the <hi>Bubo,</hi> and renew it often: or boile a Pomegranat in Vineger, beate it with <hi>Vnguentum Roſatum,</hi> or <hi>Populeen</hi> newely made, and applied as is aforeſaid. If theſe things doe not ſtop the influxe of other humors, the abſceſſe it ſelfe and the places round about it muſt be ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified round about, if the part will permit it; that the part exonerated of portion of the venome may not ſtand in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the extinction of the proper and naturall heate, by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3293:38"/>
the greater quantitie and malignitie of the humors that flow vnto it. In ſcarrifying you muſt haue care of the great veſſels for feare of an irrepugnable fluxe of bloud, which in this caſe is very hard to be ſtaied or reſiſted; both becauſe the part it ſelfe is greatly inflamed, and the humor verie fierce; for the expulſion whereof, nature, carefull for the preſeruation of the part and all the bodie beſides, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to labour and worke. But yet you muſt ſuffer ſo much of the bloud and humor to flow out as the Patient is able to abide without the loſſe of his ſtrength. Moreouer you may ſpend forth the ſuperfluous portion of the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with relaxing, mollifying, and reſoluing fomentations: as, Take the roots of Marſh Mallowes, Lillies and Elecam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane, of each one pound, of Linſeeds and Faenigreek, of each one ounce, of Fennell-ſeeds and Annifeeds, of each halfe an ounce, of the leaues of Rue, Sage, Roſemary, of each one handfull, of Chamomill and Melilote flowers, of each three handfulls; boyle them altogether, and make thereof a decoction for a fomentation; vſe it with a ſponge according to Art. Alſo after the aforeſaid ſcarrification, we may put Hens, or Turkies that lay eggs (which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue their fundaments more wide and open, and for the ſame purpoſe put a little ſalt into their fundaments) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſharpe toppe of the <hi>Bubo,</hi> that by ſhutting their bills at ſeuerall times they may draw &amp; ſucke the venom into their bodies, farre more ſtrongly and better then cupping glaſſes, becauſe they are endewed with a naturall property againſt poyſon, for they eate and concoct Toades, Efts, and ſuch like virulent beaſts: when one hen is killed with the poyſon that ſhe hath drawne into her body you muſt apply another, and then the third, fourth, fift and ſixt within the ſpace of halfe an hower. There be ſome that will rather cut them, or elſe whelps in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and apply them warme vnto the place, that by the heate of the creature that is yet ſcarce dead, portion of the venom may be diſſipated and exhaled. But if neuer theleſſe there be any feare of a Gangren at hand, you muſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3293:39"/>
cut the fleſh with a deeper ſcarrification, not onely anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the greater veſſells, but alſo the nerues for feare of conuulſion: and after the ſcarrification and a ſufficient flux of blood, you muſt waſh it with <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> Treacle and Mithridate diſſolued in ſea-water, <hi>Aquavita</hi> and Vineger. For ſuch a lotion hath vertue to ſtay putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, repell the venom, and prohibite the bloud from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: but if the Gangren cannot be auoyded ſo, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries may be applyed to the part: eſpecially actuall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe more effectually repell the force of the poyſon and ſtrengthen the part. Preſently after the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the hot iron, the eſchar muſt bee cut away euen vnto the quicke fleſh, that the venemous vapours, and the humors may haue a free paſſage forth, for it is not to be looked for that they will come forth of themſelues. With theſe iniunctions they are wont to haſten the falling away of the Eſchar. Take of the mucilage of Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and Linſeedes, of each 2 ounces, freſh Butter or Hogs-greaſe one ounce, the yelks of three eggs, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them together and make thereof an ointment: Butter, Swines-greaſe, oyle of roſes, with the yelks of eggs, performe the ſelfe ſame thing. When the Eſchar is fallen away, we muſt vſe digeſtiues. As, Take of the iuice of Plantane water, Betonie, and Smallage, of each three ounces, Honey of Roſes foure ounces, Venice Turpentine fiue ounces, Barly flower three drames, Aloes two drams, oile of Roſes foure ounces, Treacle halfe a dram, make a mundificatiue according to Arte. Or, Take Venice Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine foure ounces, Syrup of dryed Roſes and Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of each one ounce, of the powder of Aloes, Maſtick, Myrrhe, Barly flower, of each one dram, of Mithridate halfe an ounce, incorporate them together. This vnguent that followeth is very meete for putrified and corroding vlcers, Take red Orpiment one ounce, of vnquencht Lime, burnt Alome, Pomegrante pills, of each ſix drams, of <hi>Olibanus,</hi> Galls, of each two drams, of Waxe and Oile as much as ſhall ſuffice, make thereof an vnguent. This
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3293:39"/>
doth mundifie ſtrongly, conſume putrefied fleſh, and dry vp virulent humidities that engender Gangrens. But there is not a more excellent vnguent then <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> encreaſed in ſtrength, for beſides many other vertues that it hath, it doth conſume and waſt the proud fleſh, for there is neyther oyle nor waxe that goeth into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereof, with which things the vertue of ſharpe medicines conuenient for ſuch vlcers is delayed, and as it were dulled and hindered from their perfect operation ſo long as the vlcer is kept open. There are many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſeaſed with this diſſeaſe, who haue had much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and venemous filth come out at their abſceſſes, ſo that it ſeemeth ſufficient, and they haue beene thought well recouered, yet haue died ſodainly. In the meane while when theſe things are in doing cordiall medicines are not to be omitted to ſtrengthen the heart. And pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations muſt be renewed at certaine ſeaſons, that nature may be euery way vnloaded of the burthen of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenate humors.</p>

burn ing and intolerable, eſpecially a little before night, and while the meate is in concocting, more than when it is perfectly concocted. In the middeſt thereof appeareth a bladder puffed vp and filled with ſanious matter. If you cut this bladder you ſhall finde the fleſh vnder it parched, burned, and blacke, as if there had beene a burning cole layed there, whereby it ſeemeth that it tooke the name of Carbuncle; but the fleſh that is about the place is like a Raine-bow, of diuers colours, as redde, darke, greene, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, liuide, and blacke; but yet alwaies with a ſhining blackneſſe, like vnto ſtone pitch, or like vnto the true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone which they call a Carbuncle, whereof ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſay it took the name. Some call it a Naile, becauſe it infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth like paine as a naile driuen into the fleſh. There are manie Carbuncles which take their beginning with a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie vlcer without a puſtle, like to the burning of an hote iron: and theſe are of a black colour, they encreaſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the condition of the matter whereof they are made.

               <p>SOme hauing the Peſtilence haue but one Carbuncle, and ſome more in diuers parts of their bodie. And in many it happeneth that they haue the <hi>Bubo</hi> &amp; Carbuncle before they haue any Feauer; which giueth better hope of health, if there bee no other maligne accident therewith: for it is a ſigne that nature is the victor, and hath gotten the vpper hand, which excluded the peſtilent venome before it could come to aſſault the heart. But if a Carbuncle and <hi>Bubo</hi> come after the Feauer, it is mortall; for it is a token that the heart is affected, moued, and incenſed with the furious rage of the venome; whereof preſently commeth a feaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh heate or burning, and corruption of the humors, ſent as it were from the centre vnto the ſuperficies of the bodie. It is a good ſigne when the patients minde is not troubled from the beginning vntill the ſeuenth day; but when the <hi>Bubo</hi> or Carbuncle finketh downe againe ſhortly after that it is riſen, it is a mortall ſigne, eſpecially if ill accidents fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. If after they are brought to ſuppuration they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently waxe dry without any reaſon thereof, it is an ill ſigne: Thoſe Carbuncles that are generated of bloud haue a greater Eſchar than thoſe that are made of cholor, becauſe that bloud is of a more groſſe conſiſtence, and therefore oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupieth a greater roome in the fleſh: contrariwiſe a cholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke humor is more ſmall in quantity and thy nne, and it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth little roome in the vpper part of the fleſh only, as you may ſee in an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> And I haue ſeene Carbuncles whoſe Eichars were as broad and as large as halfe the backe: alſo I haue ſeene others, which going vp by the ſhoulders to the throate, did ſo eate away the fleſh that was vnder them, that the rough artery or winde-pipe might be ſeene bare, when the Eſchar was fallen away: I had once a Carbuncle which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3293:41"/>
was in the middeſt of my belly, ſo that when the Eſchar was fallen away, I might very plainly ſee the <hi>Peritonaum</hi> or Rim: and the cicatrice that remaineth is as broad as my hand: but they doe not ſpread themſelues ſo farre without the great danger or death of the patient. There are alſo ſome Carbuncles which beginning at the parts vnder the chyn, diſperſe themſelues by little &amp; little vnto the pattell bones, and ſo ſtrangle the patient. So in many, the <hi>Buboes</hi> in the groine ariſe aboue a great part of the muſcles of the <hi>Epiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrium.</hi> Truly of thoſe abſceſſes that are ſo large and great in quantity, and ſo terrible to be ſeene, there is great danger of death to the patient, or at leaſt to the greeued part. For after the conſolidation the part remaineth as if it were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, which aboliſheth the action of the part, as I haue ſeene in many. Oftentimes alſo the corruption of the matter is ſo great, that the fleſh leaueth the bones bare: but Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles often leaue the ioynts and ligaments quite reſolued through the occaſion of the moiſture that is ſoaked and ſunke in vnto them; for they often caſt out putrefied and virulent ſanious matter: whereby eating and creeping vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are bred, many bliſters and puſtles ariſing vp in the parts round about it; which ſhortly breaking into one, make a great vlcer. Theſe doe come very ſeldome and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto ſuppuration, or at leaſt to caſt out laudible matter, eſpecially if they haue their originall of choler, becauſe the matter is ſooner burned with heate, than ſuppurated. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, if they can bee brought to ſuppuration by no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, if the tumor ſtill remaine blacke, if when they are opened nothing at all, or elſe a very little ſharpe moiſture doth come forth, they are altogether mortall: and there is ſcarce one of a thouſand who hath theſe accidents that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth their health: diſperſed ſmall bliſters comming of vapours ſtirred vp by the matter that is vnder the skinne, and are there ſtaied and kept from paſſage forth, doe not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fore-ſhew death in Carbuncles. But if the part bee ſwollen or puffed vp, if it bee of a greene or blacke colour, and if it feele neither pricking nor burning, it is a ſigne of a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3293:41"/>
mortall Gangren. <hi>Buboes</hi> or Carbuncles ſeldome or neuer come without a feuer: but the feuer is more vehement when they are in the emunctories, or neruous parts, than when they are in the fleſhy parts, yet it is leſſe, and all Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are leſſe and more tolerable in a man that is ſtrong and of a good temperature: Carbuncles doe not only affect the outward but alſo the inward parts, and oftentimes both together. If the heart bee vexed in ſuch ſort with a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle that nothing thereof appeareth forth on the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall parts, all hope of life is paſt, and thoſe dye ſodainly, eating, drinking, or walking, and not thinking any thing of death. If the Carbuncle bee in the middriffe or lungs they are ſoone ſuffocated: If it bee in the braine the patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth franticke, and ſo dyeth. If it bee in the parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the paſſage of the vrine, they dye of the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their water, as it happened in the Queene mothers waiting maide at the Caſtle of Roſſilion, of whom I ſpake before. If it bee in the ſtomacke it inferreth the accidents that are ſhewed in this hiſtory following. While I was Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Hoſpitall of Paris, a young and ſtrong Monke of the order of S. Victor being ouerſeer of the women that kept the ſicke people of that place, fell into a continuall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer very ſodainly with his tongue blacke, dry, rough, (by reaſon of the putrefied and corrupted humors, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours riſing from the whole body vnto that place) and hanging out like vnto an houndes, with vnquenchable thirſt, oftenſounding and deſire to vomit. Hee had conuulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ouer all his body through the vehemency and maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the diſſeaſe, and ſo hee dyed the third day, wherefore thoſe that kept the ſicke people in the Hoſpitall thought that hee had beene poyſoned, for the certaine knowledge whereof, the gouernours of the Hoſpitall commanded his body to bee opened.</p>
               <p>I therefore calling to mee a Phyſition and Surgion, wee found in the bottome of his ſtomack a print or impreſſion, as if it had been made with an hote Iron or potentiall Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, with an Eſchar or cruſt as broad as ones naile, all the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3293:42"/>
reſt of his ſtomacke was greatly contracted and ſhrunke vp together, and as it were hornie; which wee conſidering, and eſpecially the Eſchar which was deepe in the ſubſtance of the ſtomacke, we all ſaid with one voice that he was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Sublimate or Arſnicke. But behold while I was ſowing vp his belly I perceiued manie blacke ſpots diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diuerfly throughout the skinne: then I asked my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie what they thought of thoſe ſpots; truely (ſaid I) it ſeemeth vnto mee that they are like vnto the purple ſpots or markes that are in the Peſtilence. The Phyſition and the Chirurgion denied it, and ſaid that they were the bitings of fleas. But I perſwaded them to conſider the number of them ouer all the whole bodie, and alſo their great depth and depreſſion into the fleſh; for when wee had thruſt nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles deep into the fleſh in the middeſt of them, and ſo cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fleſh about the needle, we found the fleſh about the needle to be blacke: moreouer his noſtrels, nailes, and eares were liuide, and all the conſtitution of his bodie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie and farre vnlike to the bodies of thoſe that died of other ſickeneſſes or diſeaſes. Alſo it was credibly reported vnto vs by thoſe that kept him, that his face was alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a little before hee died that his familier friends could hardly know him. We, ſo perſwaded by theſe proofes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked our former opinion and ſentence, and made a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate to bee ſent vnto the Gouernours and Maſters of the Hoſpitall, ſetting our hands and ſeales vnto it, to certifie them that he died of a peſtiſtent Carbuncle.</p>

               <p>BY the forenamed ſignes of a peſtilent Carbuncle, and eſpecialy by the bitterneſſe of the paine, malignitie of the venemous matter, and by the burning feauer that is therewithall annexed I thinke it manifeſt, that very hote, emplaſtick, and drawing medicines ſhould not be applied
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3293:42"/>
to this kind of tumor; becauſe they prohibite or hinder the exhalation, or waſting forth of the venenate malignitie; becauſe that by ſtopping the pores of the skinne, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and cauſe a greater heate in the part than there was before. Therefore it is better to vſe reſoluing medicines, which may aſſwage heate, and reſolue the pores of the skinne. Therefore firſt the place muſt be fomented with water and oyle mixed together, wherein a little Treacle hath beene diſſolued, leauing thereon ſtupes wet therein: you may alſo vſe the decoction of Mallowes, the rootes of Lillies, Linſeedes, Figges, with oile of <hi>Hypericon</hi> for to make the skinnethinne, and to draw forth the matter; and the day following you muſt apply the Cataplaſme following. Take the leaues of Sorrell and Henbane, roſt them vnder the hote aſhes; afterwards beate them with foure yelkes of egges, two drammes of Treacle, oyle of Lillies three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Barly meale as much as ſhall ſuffice; make thereof a Cataplaſme in the forme of a liquid pultis; this aſſwages heate &amp; furthers ſuppuration. Or, Take the roots of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallowes &amp; Lillies, of each foure ounces, Linſeeds halfe an ounce, boile them, beat them, and then ſtrain them through a ſearſe, adding thereto of freſh butter one ounce and an halfe, of Mithridate one dramme, of Barly-meale as much as ſhall ſuffice; make thereof a Cataplaſme according to Arte: thoſe Cataplaſmes that follow are moſt effectuall to draw the venemous matter forth, and to make a perfect ſuppuration, eſpecially when the fluxe of the matter is not ſo great but that the part may beare it. Take the rootes of white Lillies, Onions, Leauen, of each halfe an ounce; Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeedes, Pigeons dung, Sope, of each one dram; ſixe Snailes in their ſhels; of fine Sugar, Treacle, and Mithridate, of each halfe a dramme, beate them altogether, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate them with the yelkes of egges, make thereof a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſme, and apply it warme. Or, Take the yelkes of ſixe egges; of ſalte poudered one ounce; of oyle of Lillies and Treacle, of each halfe a dramme; Barly-meale as much as ſhall ſuffice; make thereof a Cataplaſme. Take of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3293:43"/>
                  <hi>Diachylon</hi> foure ounces; of <hi>Vnguentum Baſilicon</hi> two ounces, oyle of Violets halfe an ounce; make thereof a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. Manie ancient Profeſſors greatly commend Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious ground or braied betweene two ſtones, and mixed with old Hogges-greaſe, the yelkes of egges and a little ſalt; for it will cauſe ſuppuration in Carbuncles: alſo an egge it ſelfe beeing mixed with Barly-meale, and oyle of Violets doth mitigate paine and ſuppurate. A Raddiſh roote cut in ſlices, and ſo the ſlices laied one after one vnto a Carbuncle or peſtilent tumor, doth mightily draw out the poiſon. The iuice of Colts foote doth extinguiſh the heate of Carbuncles: the herbe called Diuels-bit, being bruiſed, worketh the like effect: I haue often vſed the medicine following vnto the heate of Carbuncles with verie good ſucceſſe; it doth alſo aſſwage paine and cauſe ſuppuration. Take of the ſoot ſcraped from a chimney foure ounces, of common ſalte two ounces, beate them into ſmall powder, adding thereto the yelkes of two egges, and ſtirre them well together vntill it come to haue the conſiſtence of a pultis, and let it bee applied warme vnto the Carbuncle. In the beginning the point or head of the Carbuncle muſt be burned, if it be blacke, by dropping thereinto ſcalding hot oyle, or <hi>Aquafortis:</hi> for by ſuch a burning the venome is ſuffocated as touched by lightening, and the paine is much leſſened, as I haue proued oftentimes: neither is it to be feared leſt that this burning ſhould be too painfull, for it toucheth nothing but the point of the carbuncle, which by reaſon of the eſchar that is there, is voide of ſenſe. After this burning, you muſt goe forward with the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed medicines, vntill the eſchar ſeemeth to ſeparate it ſelfe from the fleſh round about it, which is a token of the patients recouery, for it ſignifieth that nature is ſtrong and able to reſiſt the poiſon. After the fall of the Eſchar you muſt vſe gentle mundificatiues, as thoſe which wee haue preſcribed in a peſtilent <hi>Bubo,</hi> not omitting ſometimes the vſe of ſuppuratiue and mollifying medicines, that while the groſſe matter is cleanſed, that which is as yet rude may
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3293:43"/>
be brought to ſuppuration; for then the indication is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the one to ſuppurate that which remaineth as yet crude and raw in the part, and the other to cleanſe that which remaineth concocted and perfectly digeſted in the vicer.</p>

               <head type="sub">How to cure Infants and Children taken with the Plague.</head>
               <p>IF that it happen that ſucking or weaned children be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the peſtilence, they muſt bee cured after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother order then is yet deſcribed. The Nurſe of the ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing childe muſt gouerne her ſelfe ſo in dyet and the vſe of medicines as ſhee were infected with the peſtilence her ſelfe: Her dyet conſiſteth in the vſe of the ſix things not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. Therefore let it bee moderate, for the fruit or profit of that moderation in dyet cannot chuſe but come vnto the nurſes milke, and ſo vnto the infant who liueth onely by the milke. And the infant it ſelfe muſt keepe the ſame dyet as neere as he can in ſleepe, waking, and expulſion, or auoiding of ſuperfluous humors and excrements of the body. Let the nurſe bee fed with thoſe things that doe mitigate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the feueriſh heate: as cooling brothes, cooling herbs, and meats of a moderate temperature: ſhee muſt wholly abſtaine from wine, and annoint her nipples, as often as ſhee giueth the infant ſucke, with water, or iuice of ſorrell tempered with ſugar of roſes. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants heart muſt be fortified againſt the violence of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing venom, by giuing it one ſcruple of treacle in the nurſes milke, the broth of a pullet or ſome other cordiall water. It is alſo very neceſſary to annoint the region of the heart, the emunctories and both the wreſts with the ſame medicine: neither were it vnprofitable to ſmell often vnto Treacle diſſolued in roſe water, vineger of roſes and a little <hi>Aquavita,</hi> that ſo nature may bee ſtrengthened againſt the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3293:44"/>
malignity of the venom. When the children are weaned and ſomewhat well growne, they may take medicines by the mouth, for when they are able to concoct and turne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud meates that are more groſſe and firme than milke, they may eaſily actiuate a gentle medicine. Therefore a po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion muſt bee prepared for them of twelue graines of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle diſſolued with a little of the ſyrupe of ſuccory in ſome cordiall water, or the broth of a capon: vnleſſe that any had rather giue it with conſerue of roſes in forme of a bole: but treacle muſt bee giuen to children in very ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for if it be taken in any large quantity there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leſt that by inflamming the humors it inferre a feuer. Furthermore broth may bee prepared to bee taken often, made of a capon ſeaſoned with ſorrell, lettuce, purſlane, and cooling ſeedes, adding thereto bole armenicke and <hi>terrae ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata,</hi> of each one ounce, being tyed in a ragge and ſometimes preſſed out from the decoction. For bole armenicke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee by its maruellous facultie of drying, or by ſome hidden property, hath this vertue, that being drunken (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Galen witneſſeth) it cureth thoſe that are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the peſtilence, if ſo bee that they may bee cured by phyſicke: ſo that thoſe that cannot bee cured with bole armenicke, cannot be preſerued by any other medicines. But becauſe the bodies of children are warme, moiſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous, they are eaſily deliuered of ſome portion of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenate matter through the pores of the skinne by prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſweat, with a decoction of parſly ſeedes, prunes, figs, and the rootes of ſorrell, with a little of the powder of harts horne, or Iuory. But that the ſweat may bee more aboundant and copious, apply ſponges dipped and preſſed out in the decoction of ſage, roſemary, lauender, bayes, chamomyle, melilote and mallowes; or elſe ſwines bladders halfe filled with the ſame decoction, to the arme-holes, and to the groines. In the time that they ſweate let their faces bee fanned to coole them. Alſo let a nodule of Treacle diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in vineger and water of Roſes bee applied to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels, but alwaies vſe a moderation in ſweating, becauſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3293:44"/>
that children are of a ſubſtance that is eaſie to bee diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reſolued: ſo that oftentimes although they do not ſweate, yet they feele the commodities of ſweating, the matter of the venome beeing diſſipated by the force of the heate through the pores of the skinne, But in the ſweating while the face is fanned, and ſweete and cordiall things applied to the noſtrels, nature muſt be recreated and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, which otherwiſe would bee debilitated through ſweating, that it may bee better able to expell the venome. After that the ſweat is wiped away it is verie profitable to take a potion of conſerue of Roſes, with the pouder of an Harts horne or of Iuorie diſſolued in the waters of Bugloſſe and Sorrell, the better to coole and defend the heart. If there appeare anie tumor vnder the arme-holes or in the groine, let it be brought to maturation with a mollifying, relaxing, drawing, and then with a ſuppuratiue fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Cataplaſme; alwaies vſing and handling it as gently as you may, conſidering the tender age of the infant. If you haue neede to purge the patient, the purgation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be preſcribed with great profite. Take of Rubarbe in pouder one dramme, infuſe it in the watet of <hi>Carduus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> with one ſcruple of Cinamon, in the ſtraining diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue two drams of <hi>Diaratholicon,</hi> of ſyrup of Roſes laxatiue three drams; make thereof a ſmall potion. This is the cure of the Peſtilence and of the peſtilent Feuer, as farre as I could learne from the moſt learned Phyſitions, and haue obſerued my ſelfe by manifold experience by the grace and permiſſion of God: of whom alone, as the author of all good things that mortall men enioy, the true and certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatiues againſt the Peſtilence are to bee deſired and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for.</p>
