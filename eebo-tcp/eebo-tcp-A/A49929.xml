            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THis day we shew you the most Bloody rage</l>
            <l>That ever did Religious Fiends engage,</l>
            <l>A Reconcilement, with a Wedding-Feast,</l>
            <l>While Murther was the Treat for every Guest,</l>
            <l>Which well may prove to Ages yet to come,</l>
            <l>The Faith of <hi>France,</hi> the Charity of <hi>Rome,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>France</hi> by the most detestable Perjury,</l>
            <l>Enslav'd its Subjects who by Laws were free.</l>
            <l>No Sacrament can this Great Hero bind,</l>
            <l>Oaths are weak Shackles for his mighty Mind,</l>
            <l>And worse than Heathens does he persecute.</l>
            <l>His Priests want Sense and Learning to dispute;</l>
            <l>But weak Divines by strong Dragoons confute:</l>
            <l>And who-e're doubts of any Priestly Maggot,</l>
            <l>The Heretick Dog must be convinc'd by Faggot.</l>

            <l>What Slave so abject as to be content?</l>
            <l>Now, idle Malecontent, what is't you'd have?</l>
            <l>Would you be an Idolater or Slave?</l>
            <l>What d'you murmur for, because you're free,</l>
            <l>Aud this bless'd Isle enjoys its Liberty?</l>
            <l>Cross but the Narrow Seas, and you will find</l>
            <l>Slavery and Superstition to your mind.</l>
            <l>Take with you all your Friends that grumble too,</l>
            <l>The Land will happily be rid of You;</l>
            <l>Then all as one with our Great Prince combin'd,</l>
            <l>And his Allies by Sacred Vnion joyn'd:</l>

            <l>Swarming all Term-time thro' the <hi>Strand</hi> like Bees,</l>
            <l>They buz at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and lye for Fees.</l>
            <l>The Godly too their ways of getting have;</l>
            <l>But none so much as your Phanatick Knave:</l>
            <l>Wisely the wealthiest Livings they refuse,</l>
            <l>Who by the fattest Bishopricks wou'd lose;</l>
            <l>Who with short Hair, large Ears, and small blue Band,</l>
            <l>True Rogues, their own, not God's Elect, command.</l>
            <l>Let Pigs then be prophane; but Broth's allow'd,</l>
            <l>Possets and Christian Caudles may be good,</l>
            <l>Meet helps to re-inforce a Brother's Blood:</l>
            <l>Therefore each Female Saint be does advise,</l>
            <l>With groans, and hums, and ha's, and gogling Eyes,</l>
            <l>To rub him down, and make the Spirit rise.</l>
            <l>While with his Zeal transported from the Ground</l>
            <l>He mounts, and sanctifies the Sisters round.</l>
            <l>On Poets only no kind Star e'er smil'd;</l>
            <l>Curst Fate has damn'd 'em every Mothers Child:</l>
            <l>Therefore he warns his Brothers of the Stage,</l>
            <l>To write no more to an ungrateful Age.</l>
            <l>Think what penurious Masters you have serv'd;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tasso</hi> ran mad, and noble <hi>Spencer</hi> starv'd:</l>
            <l>Turn then, who ere thou art that canst write well,</l>
            <l>Thy Ink to Gaul, and in Lampoons excel.</l>
            <l>Forswear all honestly, traduce the Great,</l>
            <l>Grow impudent, and rail against the State;</l>
            <l>Rursting with spleen, abroad thy Pasquils send,</l>
            <l>And chuse some Libel-spreader for thy friend</l>
            <l>The Wit and Want of <hi>Timon</hi> point thy Mind,</l>
            <l>And for thy Satyr-subject chuse Mankind.</l>

            <head>Epilogue.</head>
            <l>THrice happy they that never writ before;</l>
            <l>How pleas'd and bold they quit the safer shoar:</l>
            <l>Like some new Captain of the City Bands,</l>
            <l>That with big looks in <hi>Finsbury</hi> Commands,</l>
            <l>Swell'd with huge Ale, he cries, Beat, beat a Drum,</l>
            <l>Pox o' the <hi>French</hi> King, uds-bud let him come:</l>
            <l>Give me ten thousand red Coats, and alloo,</l>
            <l>We'll firk his <hi>Crequi</hi> and his <hi>Conde</hi> too,</l>
            <l>Thus the young Scribblers, Mankinds sense disdain;</l>
            <l>For ignorance is sure to make 'em vain,</l>
            <l>But far from Vanity, or dang'rous Pride,</l>
            <l>Our cautious Poet courts you to his side:</l>
            <l>For why should you be scorn'd, to whom are due,</l>
            <l>All the good Days that ever Authors knew.</l>
            <l>If ever gay, 'tis you that make 'em fine;</l>
            <l>The Pit and Boxes make the Poet dine,</l>
            <l>And he scarce drinks but of the Criticks Wine.</l>
            <l>Old Writers should not for vain-glory strive,</l>
            <l>But, like old Mistresses, think how to thrive,</l>
            <l>Be fond of ev'ry thing their Keepers say,</l>
            <l>At least till they can live without a Play.</l>
            <l>Like one that knows the Trade, and has been bit,</l>
            <l>She doats and fawns upon her wealthy Cit,</l>
            <l>And swears she loves him meerly for his Wit.</l>
            <l>Another, more untaught than a <hi>Walloon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Antick and ugly, like an old Baboon,</l>
            <l>She swears is an accomplisht <hi>Beau-garson,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Turns with all winds, and sails with all desires;</l>
            <l>All Hearts in City, Town, and Court, she fires,</l>
            <l>Young callow Lords, lean Knights, and driv'ling Squires.</l>
            <l>She in resistless flattery finds her ends,</l>
            <l>Gives thanks for Fools, and makes ye all her Friends;</l>
            <l>So should wise Poets sooth an awkard Age,</l>
            <l>For they are Prostitutes upon the Stage:</l>
            <l>To stand on points were foolish and ill-bred,</l>
            <l>As for a Lady to be nice in Bed:</l>
            <l>Your Wills alone must their performance measure,</l>
            <l>And you may turn 'em every way for Pleasure.</l>
