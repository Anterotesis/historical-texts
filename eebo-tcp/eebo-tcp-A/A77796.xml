            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Copie of a Letter ſent from Mr VVILLIAM BVLWARKE, a Grand Recuſant in his Maieſties Arms, to a friend of his, one Mr. <hi>Iohn Greenall</hi> in Drury Lane. Which letter on the 16. of this Moneth of November was intercepted, and in which is manifeſtly expreſſed the horrible deſignes of the Papiſts and Cavaliers for the ſurprizing of the Citie of London, and the deſtruction of the Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I had well hoped, there ſhould not have been any need of ſending any more letters to our friends in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but in the ſtead of your enjoying me by paper, that wee ſhould have enjoyed one another in perſon, where our loves ſhould have feared neither interception nor ſuſpition; how ſoever I have ventured this laſt by the ſafeſt hand I could, and I hope it will arrive as ſafe as it is meant. What ſucceſſe our deſignes had on laſt Saturday, being the 12. of November, you well underſtand: all the hopes and promiſes from you, and the failings of them, we know not which way to impute either to your feare, or to the miſreport of what had happened in our Army. This for a certaine, that the Catholique cauſe could never find a better opportunity to advance it ſelfe, had you but the ſpirits to conceive it. The beſt Regiment that the Parliament had, and ſtouteſt, was that day ſorely diſtreſſed, they had fire and water enough; and from the fury of one element, they plunged themſelves into the mercy of the other. The other Regiments that came in to their reſcue, were quickly weary of their taske. In the mean time the City was in a tumult, their Generals diſtracted, their Forces ſcattered, neither could there have been a greater advantage, had we then but hands &amp; hearts to follow it. This bearer can truly poſſeſſe you how ſenſible we are what a loſſe by your neglect, the Catholique cauſe then received. Let us underſtand by this bearer, the reaſon of it: and becauſe his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is but weake, let us partake it in ſome letter. We are ſorry to underſtand of the Captivity of our friend who was taken at Mile-End, &amp; do much lame at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi> &amp; if no further good can be done with you, adviſe him to haſte to the army. Our army is not ſo weak either in number or in courage, as it is reported in the City, and ſome three hundred of the Parliaments Forces are reported this day to be united to ours. It is commonly reported, that all the vaults and cloſe wayes under ground, from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> unto Weſtminſter, are diſcovered unto the inhabitants, who have made it knowne unto the Parliament. I pray be carefull to ſend direct word of it: for upon that (as you ſufficiently know) the chiefeſt of our deſignes depend. Let me not faile to heare of you by the returne of honeſt <hi>Thomas:</hi> for though we are ſo neer unto intelligence, yet we heare nothing certaine, ſome affirming one thing, ſome another; and oftentimes we have more newes from a <hi>Round-head</hi> then a Catholique. I have no good newes from Yorke, if you heare any, <hi>I</hi> pray impart it. We are now at Kingſtone, where we beleeve we ſhall reſide a while. Some of our Cavaliers did weare the Earle of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex his colours, and by that meanes we found an eaſier admittance into the towne. Remember to fend me true word what is become of our friends in Summerſetſhire. We hope within theſe few dayes to kiſſe the hand of the good Queen againe, whoſe preſence will be a great encouragement to the whole Army; but eſpecially to him who is</p>

If you knew in earneſt, how thin our numbers are here, how much wee are of late diſcountananced and cryed downe, there would remaine no further ground for your wonder of our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. For my part, the Catholique and our cauſe are growne ſo odiou unto the Cirie, with the moſt narrow eye they are ſo much ſought after, and ſentenced, that we ſcarce dare hold any commerce in private, our numbers are every day grown leſſe and leſſe, and I am almoſt afraid to ſee my own face in the glaſſe. What could be expected where there is ſo little to be done; and where, if that little was done, it would put the whole cauſe into a greater diſtreſſe and ieopardy then as yet it is. The Forces of the Parliament were that night moſt carefull that no opportunity ſhould be neglected, the fields and the City were filled withar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men; and there wanted, I beleeve, no reſolution to their numbers: even their women (forſooth) were ſo full of courage, that in that tumult and alarme, they would ſeeme to put new courage into the men, and were as buſie in arming their friends, as they were of late in aſſiſting their workes againſt us. To confirme your beliefe in this truth, the other night there was a falſe an alarme rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>I</hi> beleeve on purpoſe in the City, and it is a wonder to conſider, what multitudes in every ſtreet were immediatly gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whereby their reſolution, by thoſe who raiſed the coyle, might eaſily be obſerved. The day following, our friends houſe on Clarkenwell Green, who belonged ſometimes to the Spaniſh Embaſſador, was plundred by their Souldiers. You would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee how all his moveables were torne from him, and made a prey to the violence and greedineſſe of the Souldiers. <hi>I</hi> much lament the taking of our brave friend at Mile-End, and juſtly partake in his ſufferings with you. <hi>I</hi> heare nothing of the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any vaults, and <hi>I</hi> much wonder that you would intruſt ſo great a ſecrer unto paper, and from ſuch a bearer, who although hee told me his name was <hi>Thomas,</hi> yet is not that <hi>Thomas I</hi> expected from you. Our affaires at Yorke doe move but ſlowly forward, neither doe I beleeve are there thoſe Heroicke ſpirits which was conceived there had been.
