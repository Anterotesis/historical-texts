         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN having conſidered that this preſent War ſo well begun, and carried on by Their Majeſties and others the Supream Magiſtrates and Rulers of this Kingdom; ſo highly tending to the General Good and Preſervation of the whole Nation, which, if well managed in all its Parts, could not fail of a happy Iſſue; but ſuch is Our Misfortune, That too many there be Intruſted in the Management thereof, who, too Regardleſs of the Publick Good, do in their ſeveral Stations proceed in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſo great Affair, with ſo much Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency as may be juſtly feared, will in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, retard and circumvent the Deſign of this ſo Pious and well-grounded Undertaking; I mean the War. The chief Subſiſtence next under God, and Their Majeſties, is Money, which, being hard to

Raiſe, in Regard of the General Poverty of the Nation occaſioned thereby, together with the Want of Trade, ought to be managed with all frugal Care and good Husbandry; for Want of which, the Treaſure of the Nation is much exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and great Part of that which ought to be imployed to encourage Vertue and Induſtry, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Idleneſs and Extravagancy, as is fully demonſtrated in the following Propoſals: For, if thoſe Perſons Intruſted in the Management of the ſame, eſpecially thoſe in the Lower Sphere, would, in their ſeveral Stations, Diſcharge their Truſt with that Care and Fidelity as they ought, the Burthen of the War would be far more eaſy, and all thoſe ſeeming Clouds of Sorrow and Deſpair that do Annoy would ſoon vaniſh, and all its Attendants of Complaints and Poverty muſt then give Way to Courage and Magnanimity, which is the only means to vanquiſh and overcome Our Inſulting Foes, and thereby advance the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to this End, being moved by a zealous Deſign of ſerving and preſerving as much as in me lyeth Their Majeſties and the Publick, rather than any Private Intereſt, or Vain Deſire of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or Preferment, I humbly take Leave to lay before your Honours theſe my following Propoſals, as they were preſented to the Right Honourable

For who can obſerve the great Undertakings of Their Majeſties for the general Preſervation of this Nation, and ſtand idle and mute at ſuch time as the Publick Affairs require the Aſſiſtance of all its Members? As for my part, I do affirm that it is my Duty to appear in this general Cauſe, conſidering thoſe Honourable Aſſemblies, the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament, whoſe great Care it is to raiſe Money to carry on the ſame.

But ſo it is, let the whole Charge of performing that Work be what it will, it may be preſumed, the full Half Part thereof, is waſted and conſumed; all which, may ſeem very hard and grievous, that the Induſtrious Part ſhould be Rent and Rack'd, to maintain others at ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Charge, in Idleneſs and Extravagancy: For by Impreſting and Forcing ſo many Men into thoſe Yards, Workmens Wages abroad is raiſed to an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Rate, and the Price of Building ſo highly advanced thereupon in theſe Parts, that the greateſt Part of Building is of late carried from hence into the Country, and is ready to take Wing for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations; all which is occaſioned by means of the <hi>Preſs</hi> for thoſe Yards, which may be more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Oppreſſion:</hi> For that Work may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently carried on, to the great Advantage of all, with a likely Poſſibility of ſaving 2 or 300000<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> as is more fully demonſtrated in the following Propoſals.

I. <hi>That</hi> for the common Good and Benefit of Their Majeſties, and the whole Kingdom, it is moſt humbly propoſed, That if <hi>Shipwrights</hi> Wages in Their Majeſties Yards were Advanced, and good Payment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98678:8"/>
Monthly made, for Working Weather only (as in Merchants Yards) the Work may be performed with leſs than half the Number of Men; who, for fear of being Diſcharged, would Labour hard. Or the greateſt part of the ſaid Workmanſhip may, as in other Yards, be let out by the Task, or Great, to able Work-men; whereby having Reſpect to Work, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the Number of Officers, whoſe Pay is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as well in wet as dry Weather, as alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Waſte made in Timber and Plank by many idle Perſons imployed therein, the ſaid Work may be ſubſtantially performed with leſs than half the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, and more than half the Charge of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip thereby ſaved, without prejudice to the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who with their Aſſiſtance may have the Power of Ordering and Directing as heretofore.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That</hi> in impreſting of <hi>Shipwrights</hi> for the ſaid Yards Their Majeſties are at great Charges, and the Perſons impreſt think themſelves injured, to be compelled to ſerve therein for two Shillings and one penny <hi>per</hi> Day, and that running in Arrears, when in other Yards there is allowed near twice the Wages, and ready Money; which is a great Diſcouragement to induſtrious perſons, who are willing to take pains; which brings a Diſlike and Unwillingneſs of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who go into ſuch Yards as if they were going to Priſon; which by a Regulation as aforeſaid would be eſteemed as a Palace: So that many imployed and impreſt therein do, for ſuch Reaſons, become very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98678:9"/>
negligent in the performing their Duties, and ſpend great part of their time in Idleneſs: Together with Apprentices, whoſe Wages being fixt, and no regard had to Deſerts, their Maſters are indifferent whether they work, or not. And many ſuch take no Care or pains more than to anſwer to the Call, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Bundle of Chips, oft-times of more Value than their Wages; whereby Their Majeſties are highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and many ſuch Apprentices by ill Management, after Seven Years Servitude, are altogether ignorant and uſeleſs. All which ſeems very Unreaſonable, That thoſe Yards which ought to be the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Induſtry and Frugality, ſhould be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Idleneſs and Extravagancy, at ſuch times as perſons of ſo uſeful a Trade, and Money the Life of all, is ſo much wanting to the Publick.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>In</hi> the general Repairing of Their Majeſties Great Ships, wherein Cuſtom is obſerved more than the common Intereſt of the publick, after a vaſt Charge therein ſpent, to take ſuch Ship or Work to pieces, the Timber and Plank ſo taken out ſeldom comes to any Account; and the Ship to be ſo Rebuilt, or the Value thereof, is in it ſelf wholly loſt, yet another between Old and New is brought forth, though untimely, out of the pretended Ruins of the Old, at a far greater Charge than ſuch New Ship might have been wholly Erected and new Built from the Keel. So that therein accrues a double Loſs to Their Majeſties; for ſuch Old Ships might be of great Value and Uſe, if but ſold to break up; and the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Plank now deſtroyed would for many good Uſes ſupply the place of New, and be a means to make it more cheap and plenty; and the Work-men whilſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98678:9"/>
taking to pieces the Old would half build ſuch a New. So that in the Repairs of ſome one Ship Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties may ſave Two, Three, Four, and ſometimes Eight or Ten Thouſand Pound, or more; beſides the Advantage of having the Uſe of ſuch New Ship in half the Time.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>It</hi> is alſo to be obſerved, If it happen that any Ship of Their Majeſties do by any means miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry or periſh at Sea, the Loſs thereof is very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; but in the Building of Two, according to the Cuſtom uſed in Their Majeſties Yards, there is One loſt of the ſame Burthen, or the Value thereof, for want of good Management; yet ſuch Loſs is neither minded, nor regarded. Whereas, if Wages be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and paid, according to each Man's Deſerts, they would put themſelves forward in Hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as in Merchant's Yards; and by that means, if well managed, Thirty or Forty Men may do as much Work as a Hundred Men now do: So that in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip may be ſaved Two or Three Thouſand Pound, or more, in Two Ships; which, by ſuch means, may be Built ſooner than One, beſides the Waſt of Timber and Plank, made by ſome near equal with their Wages.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>If</hi> it ſhould be objected, That ſuch Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be of great Difficulty and Prejudice to Their Majeſties, or any Perſon concerned or imployed under them: The <hi>PROPOSER</hi> humbly offers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Regulation effectually in any one of Their Majeſties Yards in the Space of one Week; and in Nine, or Twelve Months, to prove the Advantage thereof, to the great profit of Their Majeſties, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98678:10"/>
Benefit of Their Subjects. It being not his Deſign to propoſe any thing herein that may be Injurious to any, but of great Advantage to all. Firſt, in reſpect to Their Majeſties; in whoſe Yards there is allowed Two Shillings and One Penny <hi>per</hi> Day to Workmen, and to Apprentices Thirteen or Fourteen Pence <hi>per</hi> Day, for the firſt Year; increaſing yearly a Penny <hi>per</hi> Day: Which Wages accounted but ſmall is large in reſpect, if the Uncertainty of Weather be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which never proves to the Diſadvantage of thoſe therein imployed; whilſt others in Merchants Yards, having Three or Four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Day, are put by their Work for every Flurt of Rain, or Snow, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intemperate Weather; who often, by ſuch means, do not work more than Four Weeks in Six. So that by Computation each Man's Wages in both Yards are near equivalent, but the Labour of Work-men is far different; inſomuch that Thirty or Forty Men in the Merchants Yards and imployed in Their Majeſties Work, do ſubſtantially perform more Work than a Hundred Men in Their Majeſties Yards, and in leſs Time.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>It</hi> may be further objected, That this may prove prejudicial to the Officers of Their Majeſties Yards. It is anſwered, That many of them have but Two Shillings and One Penny <hi>per</hi> Day, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no proſpect of Advantage (let their Deſerts be never ſo great) they ſtill follow the common Road of Cuſtom: Yet, in Caſe of Regulation, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would for ſuitable Incouragement deport themſelves in their ſeveral Stations with more Order, Courage and Induſtry, in the well Management of the ſeveral Work-men under their Charge, more eſpecially
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98678:10"/>
their Apprentices, who in hopes of Gain may be made capable of deſerving more in One Year than ſome may now in Seven: By which means Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties might ſave much Money, the Nation be more plenty of able Work-men, their Maſters incouraged to train up Youth, and ſuch hereafter be capable of getting a decent Maintenance for themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. It may likewiſe be ſuppoſed that at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as well in War as Peace, the ſame Number of Men in Office may be ſufficient to perform the greateſt part of the Work.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <note place="margin">If ſuch Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were to be made, it would be of ſuch Advantage that many who now (in recard of Poverty) are exempted may be capable of paying ſuitable Taxes on all Occaſions.</note> VII. <hi>That</hi> the Work-men imployed in Their Majeſties Yards are, for want of ready Money, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take up all their Neceſſaries they want upon Credit; and the perſons with whom they deal are, for that Reaſon obliged to do the like. So that it is moſt certain, that Work-men, eſpecially Strangers, impreſt therein, are obliged to pay double Extortion, and with Curbs and Abuſes accept of any thing; who otherwiſe, with ready Money, might buy what, and where they pleaſe, and be treated with Civility and Reſpect as others are. So that by ſuch a happy change many would be preſerved from Ruin.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>That</hi> if ſuch Regulation be made in Their Majeſties Yards, the one half or more of the Work-men imployed therein may be diſcharged, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be leſs than Four or Five Hundred Men; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſtribute themſelves into other Yards, will cauſe the extravagant rate of Wages to abate and fall to the old rate of two Shillings, or two Shillings and Six-pence <hi>per</hi> Day; whereby the Charge of Building Shipping may be as cheap in time of War as in times of Peace;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98678:11"/>
which will much contribute to the Benefit of Their Majeſties, and the whole Nation.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>So</hi> that if a general Regulation were to be made, and well managed with Frugality and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; it may be preſumed, that the one half Charge of the whole now expended therein may be ſaved, to the great Benefit of the Nation without prejudice to any, which could not amount to leſs than 100000<hi>l. per Annum</hi> or more, and one third part of what may be ſo ſpared may be ſufficient to pay the Work-men and Officers employed therein.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>If</hi> there be any ſuperannuated Ancient Men in the ſaid Yards, which by Falls and Bruiſes, may be in a great meaſure diſabled and unfit to ſeek imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abroad, it may be better, and will be leſs Charge to maintain them out than in the Yards.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. <hi>That</hi> impreſting of <hi>Shipwrights</hi> being very Chargable to Their Majeſties, and prejudicial to the Subjects, more eſpecially the Maſter <hi>Shipwrights,</hi> who are great Sufferers in their Apprentices; whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of good Eſteem do frequently give large Sums of Money to bring up their Children to ſo good and uſeful a Trade, who are by the preſs hurried and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away before they underſtand any part thereof; whereby ſuch parents are injured, their Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ignorant for want of Experience and Inſtruction, and the Maſters being limited to a Number, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed three or four, are become deſtitute of Servants to carry on their Trade; and often damnified by the Loſs of an Apprentice Forty, Fifty, or an Hundred pound thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Your <hi>Honours</hi> were then Pleaſed to Direct, That I ſhould give an Account to this Board in Writing, how and where Money ſhould be Raiſed to carry on the ſame, purſuant thereunto. I moſt humbly offer my Sentiments as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That</hi> the Raiſing of Money muſt be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, by Parliament, and not by any ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eſpecially of my Capacity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That</hi> Half the Money ſo Raiſed and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for ſuch Purpoſes, had been, if well managed, ſufficient to have defrayed the whole Charge, without running on Arrears, and the other Half might have been uſefull to other Purpoſes: And this ought to have been the particular Care of all Officers, to whom the Management thereof hath been Committed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98678:12"/>
Thus having deſcribed the Fountain from whence the Moneys muſt ariſe, as alſo a Sufficiency of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying (if well ordered) the whole Charge, with leſs than Half the Sum. I humbly proceed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>If</hi> the Number of Work-men in Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Yards at preſent, be 3000, and the yearly Charge of maintaining them therein be 93600<hi>l.</hi> then the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Charge will be 23400<hi>l.</hi> and that generally paid Quarterly. It is further propoſed, That the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Number Imployed therein, may be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which cannot be leſs than 60 out of every 100, ſo that the 3000 as aforeſaid, may be reduced to 1200; which if well managed, will be ſufficient to carry on the whole Work; and by ſuch means the Charges will be leſſened to 39440<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> 9860<hi>l.</hi> Quarterly, and Monthly, 3286<hi>l.</hi> Here it may be ſuppoſed that where there is a Probability of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 23400<hi>l. per</hi> Quarter, there may be a Poſſibility of paying 3286<hi>l. per</hi> Month. The Charges and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſo Stated, I moſt humbly proceed to give my Judgment for ſaving and providing Money to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the Charge Monthly, <hi>viz.</hi> If the preſent Charge as aforeſaid, be 93600<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> it is ſuppoſed that Money may be produced as formerly for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Payment, which may amount to 23400<hi>l. per</hi> Quarter: Let the Number of Work-men be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as aforeſaid, the Monthly Charge may be 3286<hi>l.</hi> then ſuppoſing ſuch Regulations were agreed, and to begin this Day, One Month being expired, let Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be provided to defray the Charge. The Queſtion is, how and where? Here lies the Difficulty. To which I anſwer, If it cannot be provided otherwiſe, let it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98678:13"/>
be borrowed at 10<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> for the Firſt Month, and ſo likewiſe for the Second againſt the Third Month. It may be ſuppoſed that the Quarterly Sum may be provided as formerly, which is ſuppoſed to be 23400<hi>l.</hi> out of which is to be paid the Two bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Sums, with Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 3286<hi>l.</hi> with Two Months Intereſt, and 3286<hi>l.</hi> with One Months In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and 3286<hi>l.</hi> the Charge of the Third Month without Intereſt. Theſe together, will amount to 9890<hi>l.</hi> or thereabouts, which being deducted out of the aforeſaid Sum of 23400<hi>l.</hi> ſuppoſedly provided for the Firſt Quarterly Payment, the Remainder will be 13510<hi>l.</hi> which if preſerved in Bank for the purpoſe aforeſaid, may defray the Charge of the next Four Months, and to ſpare, in which Four Months may be ſaved ſufficient to defray the Charge of the next Six Months, and ſo proportionably for a longer time: So by this Rule may be ſaved in Wages, 54090<hi>l.</hi> in One Year, beſides the Waſte that is made in thoſe Yards, which cannot be leſs than Twice the Value, which by Computation, will amount to in the whole, 162120<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> beſides the great Trouble and Charge expended in Preſſing for ſuch Yards. If it ſhould be further Objected, That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney cannot, or may not be provided out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury at the end of the ſaid Three Months, it may then be further provided as aforeſaid, at Intereſt for Three, Four, or Five Months or more, untill a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Stock may by ſuch means be ſaved for the carrying on the ſame; which I humbly conceive may with little Trouble, be gained in the Firſt Three Months: This with Submiſſion, I hope, may be a ſatisfactory Anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed. And by this means alſo may be ſpared out of thoſe Yards,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98678:13"/>
1800 Men, who may be of great Uſe in carrying on the General Trade of the whole Nation. I have been the larger in clearing this Point, as knowing it to be the Baſis on which the whole Work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: So by this it doth plainly appear, That the providing of 6 or 7000<hi>l.</hi> to defray the Charge of the Firſt Two Months, the whole Work may be ſufficiently performed by ſuch means, as may be ſaved to the great Advantage of Their Majeſties, 100000<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> or more.</p>
            <p>Which being Read, was Allowed and Approved, ſave only in this, that I ſhould give Security for the Performance thereof; to which I humbly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That I did not deſire to handle the Publick Treaſure, my Propoſals having paſſed the general Conſent of their <hi>Honours,</hi> together with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of many the moſt Eminent and Credible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſeveral in Places of the greateſt Truſt; and being in it ſelf no way doubtfull, might have been ſufficient to have made the ſame Practicable: But their <hi>Honours</hi> were farther pleaſed to inſiſt on this Point, which I did humbly take as a final Anſwer. To which I add, That Truth and right Reaſon, with ſuch Harmonious Conſent as aforeſaid, may be ſufficient Security for the Management of this ſo great Affair. And farther, That the ſame ought to be put in Practice, partly to avoid thoſe great Injuries occaſioned by the <hi>Preſs;</hi> and chiefly for the general Preſervation of Their Majeſties and Publick, in ſaving ſuch Conſiderable Sums of Money, ſo much wanting for other Purpoſes.</p>

               <p n="10">X. <hi>That</hi> if a Ship ſhould happen to prove ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſided, it will be far better, and leſs Charge, to proportion the ſailing Materials to ſuch Ships, than

            <head>POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>IF it ſhould be Objected, That in times of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Their Majeſties Affairs may be prolonged in Prejudice to Their Great and Honourable Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, it is Anſwered, That ſince it is ſo plainly demonſtrated and generally believed, That 30 or 40 Men can, and may perform as much as 100 now do, no Detriment can enſue thereby. But to prevent all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doubts that may ariſe, it muſt be allowed, That Their Majeſties upon all Occaſions, may have the ſame Liberty, without the leaſt Reſtraint or Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to cauſe Men to be Impreſt as formerly. But to avoid the ſame, it is humbly preſumed, That thoſe Yards may in ſuch times of Exigence, be better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in One Day by Letters directed to the <hi>Maſter-Wardens</hi> of each Company of <hi>Ship-wrights,</hi> than in One Month; and 100 ſuch Perſons Imployed on the Terms aforeſaid, may perform as much as 300 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd unwillingly to ſerve therein by the Preſs, and all the Charge thereof avoided. Again, It ſeems very hard in the Judgment of all good Men, that Moneys raiſed with ſo much Care and Trouble, and intended for the Incouragement of Induſtrious and Deſerving People, ſhould be ſo vainly deſtroyed in Idleneſs and Extravagancy, at ſuch time as it is ſo much wanting to the Publick.</p>
            <p>Again, If Charity ſhould ſo far abound, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Superfluity of Idleneſs, it may be preſumed, that for the Publick Good of Their Majeſties and the Nation, it will be far leſs Charge to allow many Imployed therein 20<hi>s. per</hi> Week to maintain them out,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98678:16"/>
rather than 10<hi>s. per</hi> Week to have them in ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, as being a Pattern of ſuch evil Examples to others.</p>
            <p>In all that hath been Propoſed herein, it was not deſigned as Reflection on any. For what is practiſed therein now, is not to be looked on as a New Method, but rather as an Ancient Cuſtom of long ſtanding, which by ſuch Cuſtom and evil Example hath been received from One Age to another; and ſo not any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be much blamed, although it is apparent that by long Uſe, it is every Year grown worſe and worſe.</p>
            <p>But however, Let the Meaſures or Methods be what they will, if it doth appear by what hath been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that better may be now taken, and ſuch as may be of ſo great Uſe and Advantage, it cannot be thought unreaſonable to lay ſuch Old Methods aſide, to make way for New, (eſpecially ſuch as may be ſo Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and Profitable) no more than for a Prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, who foreſeeing a Storm, doth make for a good Harbor, to avoid Ship-wrack.</p>
            <p>Although it is commonly objected that Propoſals of this Kind (let them be never ſo profitable) do ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom proſper, except brought forth and managed by Perſons of Honour and Grandeur. To which it is humbly Anſwered, That the Matter it ſelf being Juſt and Honourable, and of ſo great Uſe and Benefit to Their Majeſties and the whole Nation, it ought not to be ſlighted for the Author's ſake; eſpecially when conſidered how far Loyalty and Duty, accompany'd with a firm and conſtant Mind, hath often produced in all Ages, great Advantages to the Publick.</p>
            <p>Thus having for the general Good, expoſed my ſelf to the publick Cenſure in a Matter of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in ſo mean and plain a Dreſs; which may be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98678:16"/>
juſtly attributed to the want of Education rather than want of Judgment. However, for what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten I deſire no Praiſe but Patience, being altogether unworthy to be accounted a Work-man in this kind, knowing it is impoſſible for me as well as others, to pleaſe all. And although there be many carping Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, who in Envy to the Cauſe more than the Author, may be ready to cavell with me for the ſame, I ſhall little regard the evil Cenſure of thoſe, who I never did intend to make my Judges, but ſhall in all things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Judgment of the more Prudent and well Affected to the Government.</p>
            <p>All which I ſhall conclude in the Words of the Reverend Doctor <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his Sermon Preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> the 31 <hi>ſt.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. His Concluſion was, <hi>That there be no breaking in, nor going out; nor no complaining in the ſtreets.</hi> Then with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Happy is the People that is in ſuch a caſe; yea, and happy is the People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
