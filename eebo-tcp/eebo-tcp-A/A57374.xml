            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Discourse of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and fundamentall cause of Naturall, Customary, Arbitrary, Voluntary, and necessary war, with the misery of invasive warre. That Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Prelates, have alwayes been subject to Temporall Princes, and that the Pope had never any lawfull power in <hi>England,</hi> either in Civill, or Ecclesiasticall, businesse, after such time, as <hi>Brittaine</hi> was won from the Roman Empire.</head>
            <p>THe ordinary Theme and Argument of History is War, which may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the exercise of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under Soveraigne Command, against withstanders force, Authority and


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60814:3"/>
resistance, being the essentiall parts thereof, violence limited by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is sufficiently distinguisht from Robbery and the like outrages: yet consisting in relation towards others, It necessarily requires a supposition of resistance, whereby the force of War becomes different from the violence inflicted upon Slaves, or yeilding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors; as for Armes, Discipline, and whatsoever else belongeth to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of War prosperous, they are only considerable in degree of perfection, since naked savages fighting disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with stones, by appointment of their Commanders, may truly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely be said to War.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, it is true, that as the Beasts are armed with fierce teeth, pawes, horns, and other bodily instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of much advantage against un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaponed men, so hath reason taught man to strengthen his hand with such offensive Armes, as no creature


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60814:3"/>
else can well avoid or possibly resist. And it might seeme happy, if the sword, the Arrow, the Gun, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terrible Engines of death, could be wholly imployed in the exercise of that Lordly rule, which the Lord of all hath given to mankind over the rest of living things. But since in humane reason there hath no meanes been found of holding all mankind at peace within it self: It is needfull that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wit and subtilty of man, we oppose not only the bruit force of our bodyes, (wherein many Beasts exceed us,) but helping our strength with art and wisdome, strive to excell our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in those points wherein man is excellent over other Creatures.</p>
            <p>The necessity of War, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong humane Actions is the most lawlesse, hath some kind of affinity, and neere resemblances with the necessity of Law. For there were no use at all, either of War or of Law;


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60814:4"/>
If every man had prudence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how much of right were due both to and from himselfe, and were withall so punctually just, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he knew requisite, and to rest contented with his owne. But seeing that no conveyance of Land can be made so strong, by any skill of Lawyers, with multiplicity of clauses, and provisoes, That it may be secure from contentious <hi>Avarice,</hi> and the malice of false seeming Justice: It is not to bee wondered, that the great Charter,<note place="margin">Gen. Cap. 1. ver. 28.</note> whereby God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed the whole earth upon <hi>Adam,</hi> And confirmed it unto the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> being as breife in word, as large in effect, hath bred much quarrell of interpretation.</p>
            <p>Surely howsoever the Letter of that Donation, may be unregarded by the most of men, yet the sense thereof is so imprinted in their hearts, And so passionatly imbraced by their greedy


<pb facs="tcp:60814:4"/>
desires, As if every one laid claime for himself unto that, which was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon all.</p>
            <p>This appeared in the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who falling upon <hi>Italy</hi> under their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Brennus,</hi> told the Roman Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours plainly that prevalent arms were as good as any title, and that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men might account to be their owne as much as they could get; That they wanting Land therewith to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine their people, And the <hi>Tuscanes,</hi> having more then enough, It was their meaning to take what they needed by strong hand, if it were not yeilded qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly. Now if it be well affirmed by Lawyers, that there is no taking of possession more just, then <hi>In vacuum venire,</hi> to enter upon Land unhabited, As our Countrymen have lately done in the Summer Islands: Then may it be inferred, that this demand of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> held more of reason then could be discerned at the first view.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60814:5"/>For if the title of occupiers be good in a Land unpeopled, why should it be bad accounted in a Country Peopled over thinly? should one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or one thousand hold possession of all the Southerne, undiscovered continent, because they had seated themselves in <hi>Nova Guiana,</hi> or about the <hi>Straits</hi> of <hi>Magalane</hi>? why might not the like be done in <hi>Africk,</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> or in <hi>Asia</hi>? If this were most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to imagine, Let then any mans wisdome determine by lessening the Territory, and increasing the number of Inhabitants, what proportion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the peopling of a Region in such manner, That the Land shall be neither too narrow for those whom it feedeth, nor capable of a greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; Untill this can be concluded and agreed upon, one maine and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall cause of the most grievous Warre that can be imagined, is not like to be taken from the Earth. It


<pb facs="tcp:60814:5"/>
were perhaps enough in reason to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour with victualls and other helps, a vast multitude compelled by necessity to seeke a new seate, or to direct them unto a Country able to receive them: But what shall perswade a mighty Nation to travaile so farre by Land, or Sea, over Mountaines, Deserts, And great Rivers, with their Wives and Children, when they are, or thinke themselves powerfull enough to serve themselves neerer hand, and inforce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the Labour of such a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? I have briefely shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an other worke,<note place="margin">Generall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story Lib. 2. Cap. 2. 28. S. 4. T. 3.</note> that the miseries accompaning this kind of War, are most extreame. For as much as the <hi>Invaders</hi> cannot otherwise be satisfied then by rooting out or expelling the Nation upon which they fall.</p>
            <p>And although the uncertainty of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, by which all worldly things are held, minister very unpleasant medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;


<pb facs="tcp:60814:6"/>
yet is it most certaine that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 1200. yeares last past, all or the most of <hi>Kingdomes</hi> to us knowne, have throughly felt the calamities of such forcible trasplantations, being either over whelmed by new Collonies that fell upon them, or driven, as one wave is driven by an other, to seeke new seates, having lost their owne.</p>
            <p>Our Westerne parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have cause to rejoyce, and give praise to <hi>God,</hi> for that we have been free about 600 years, from such Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, As were those of the <hi>Gothes, Humes,</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> yea from such as were those of our owne Ancestors, the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we have together with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, lost the very memory of such wretchednesse, as our Fore-fathers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by those Wars, of all other the most cruell. Yet are there few <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> in all <hi>Asia</hi> that have not been ruined by such overflowing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes


<pb facs="tcp:60814:6"/>
within the same space of these last six hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>It were an endlesse labour to tell how the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> falling like <hi>Locusts</hi> upon that quarter of the world, having spoiled every where, and in most places Eaten up all, as it were by the roots, Consuming together with the Princes formerly Reigning and a world of people, the very names, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and memory of former times. Suffice it that when any Country is overlaid by the multitude which live upon it, there is a naturall necessity compelling it to disburthen it self and lay the Load upon others, by right or wrong. For (to omit the danger of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence often visitting those which live in a throng) there is no misery that urgeth men so violently unto des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate courses, and contempt of death, as the Torments or Threats of famine: whereof the Warre that is grounded upon this generall remedilesse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,


<pb facs="tcp:60814:7"/>
may be tearmed the generall, the Remedilesse, or the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary War.<note place="margin">First Warre.</note> Against which that our Country is better provided (as may be shewed hereafter) Then any civill Nation to us knowne, we ought to hold it a great blessing of God, And carefully retaine the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which he hath given us now.</p>
            <p>Besides this remedilesse or necessary Warre,<note place="margin">Second Warre.</note> which is frequent, There is a Warre voluntary, and Customeable, unto which the offering party is not compelled. And this Customary Warre, which troubleth all the world, giveth little respite or breathing time of peace, doth usually borrow pretence from the necessary to make it self appeare more honest. For Covetous Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thinking all too little which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently it hath, supposeth it self to stand in need of all which it hath not.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if two bordering Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces


<pb facs="tcp:60814:7"/>
have their Territory meeting on an open Champaigne, the more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will continually seeke occasion, to extend his limits unto the further border thereof.</p>
            <p>If they be divided by Mountaines they will fight for the mastery of the passages of the Tops, And finally for the Towns that stand upon the roots.</p>
            <p>If Rivers run between them, they contend for the Bridges, And thinke themselves not well assured untill they have fortified the further banck.</p>
            <p>Yea the Sea it selfe must be very broad, barren of fish, and void of little Islands interjacent, else will it yeild plentifull argument of quarrell to the Kingdomes which it severeth.</p>
            <p>All this proceeds from desire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and such desire from feare of want.</p>
            <p>Hereunto may be added, That in these Arbitrary Wars, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be found, some small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure


<pb facs="tcp:60814:8"/>
of necessity, though it seldome be observed, perhaps, because it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not so far, as to become publique. For where many younger sonnes of younger Brothers, have neither Lands nor means to uphold themselves, and where many men of Trade or usefull possessions, know not how to bestow themselves for lack of Imployments, there can it not be avoided that the whole body of the State (howsoever otherwise healthfully disposed) should suffer anguish by the greivance of those ill affected Members.</p>
            <p>It sufficeth not that the Country hath wherewith to susteine even more then live upon it, if means be wanting, whereby to drive convenient partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the generall store unto a great number of well deservers.</p>
            <p>In such cases there will be complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Commiseration, and finally mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur (as men are apt to lay the blame of those evills whereof they know the


<pb facs="tcp:60814:8"/>
ground upon publike misgovernment) unlesse order be taken for some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse by the sword of Injury, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be done by Forreigners, whereto the discontented sort give commonly a willing eare. And in this case I think it was, that the great Cardinall <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Amiens</hi> who governed <hi>Spaine</hi> in the minority of <hi>Charls</hi> the fift, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tell that 8000. <hi>Spaniards</hi> were lost in the enterprise of <hi>Algier,</hi> under <hi>Don Diego de Vera,</hi> made light of the matter: Affirming, that <hi>Spaine</hi> stood in need of such evacuation, forreigne Warre serving (as King <hi>Fardinard</hi> had been wont to say) like a potion of <hi>Rubarbe,</hi> to wash away Choler from the body of the Realme.</p>
            <p>Certainly among all Kingdomes of the earth, we shall scarce find any that stands in lesse need then <hi>Spaine,</hi> of having the veines opened by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies sword: The many Colonies which it sends abroad so well preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving


<pb facs="tcp:60814:9"/>
it from swelling humors.</p>
            <p>Yet is not that Country thereby dispeopled, but mainteineth still grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it (like a tree, from whose plants to fil a whole <hi>Orchard,</hi>) have bin taken as many, as it can well nourish.</p>
            <p>And to say what I think, if our King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, had prospered in his French Wars and peopled with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the Towns which he won, As he began at <hi>Calice</hi> driving out the <hi>French,</hi> the Kings his Successors, holding the same course would by this time have filled all <hi>France,</hi> with our Nation, without any notable emptying of this Island.</p>
            <p>The like may be affirmed upon like suspition of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of any others, as having been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> in <hi>Barbarie</hi>; What is then become of so huge a multitude as would have over spread a great part of the Continent? surely they dyed not


<pb facs="tcp:60814:9"/>
of old age, nor went out of the world by the ordinary wayes of nature. But famine and contagious diseases, the sword, the halter, and a thousand mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs have Consumed them.</p>
            <p>Yea many of them perhaps were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver borne: for they that want means to nourish Children will abstaine from marriage, or (which is all one) they cast away their bodies upon rich old women: or otherwise make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall or unhealthy Matches for gaine, or because of poverty they thinke it a blessing, which in nature is a curse, to have their wives barren.</p>
            <p>Were it not thus, <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression might easily demonstrate, how fast mankind would increase in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, overpassing as miraculous (though indeed naturall) that example of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were multiplyed in 215. yeares, from seaventie unto 600000. able men. Hence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that the very propagation of our


<pb facs="tcp:60814:10"/>
kind, hath with it a strong insensive, even of those daily Wars, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the earth. And that Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing their drawing the sword by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised pretences of necessity, speake of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more truly then they are aware, there being indeed a great necessity, though not apparent, as not extending to the generality, but resting upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate heads.</p>
            <p>Wherefore other cause of Warre meerly naturall there is none, then want of roome upon the earth, which pinching a whole nation, begets the remedilesse Warre, vexing only some number of particulars, It draws on the Arbitrary: But unto the kindling of Arbitrary Warre, there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motives. The most honest of these is, feare of harme and preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of danger. This is just and taught by nature, which labours more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in removing evill, then in pursuite of what is requisite unto her good.


<pb facs="tcp:60814:10"/>
Neverthelesse, because Warre cannot be without mutuall violence: It is manifest, that allegation of danger and feare serves only to excuse the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering part, the wrong doer being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by his owne will. So the Warre thus caused proceeds from nature, not altogether but in part.</p>
            <p>A second motive is, Revenge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury susteined; This might be avoided if all men could be honest; otherwise not. For Princes must give protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Subjects and adherents, when worthy occasion shall require it, else will they be held unworthy, and unsufficient: then which there can be to them no greater perill.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> in all delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where difficulties and dangers threatned on the one side, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that there should be in him <hi>Parum Praesidii</hi> little safeguard, for his friends, was doubted on the other side, alwayes chose rather to venture upon


<pb facs="tcp:60814:11"/>
extreamities then to have it thought that he was a weake protector. Yea by such maintenance of their dependants, Many Noblemen in all formes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and in every mans memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have kept themselves in greatnesse with little help of any other vertue. Neither have meere Tyrants been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together carelesse to mainetaine free from oppression of strangers, those Subjects of theirs, whom themselves have most basely esteemed and used, as no better then slaves. For there is no master that can expect good service from his bondslaves, if he suffer them to be beaten and daily ill intreated by other men: To remedy this, it were needfull that Justice should every where bee duly ministred aswell to strangers as to <hi>Denizons.</hi> But contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we find, that in many Countreys (as <hi>Muscovie</hi> and the like) the Laws or the Administration of them are so far from giving satisfaction, as they


<pb facs="tcp:60814:11"/>
fill the generall voice with complaint and exclamation.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> said, (whether more pleasantly or truely I know not) that a trick of Law had no lesse pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the wheele of fortune, to lift men up, or cast them downe.</p>
            <p>Certainly with more patience men are wont to endure the losses that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them by meere casualty, then the damages which they susteine by means of injustice, Because these are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with sense of indignity, whereof the other are free: when Robbers break open a mans house and spoile it, they tell the owner plainly that money they want, and money they must have: But when a Judge corrupted by reward, hatred, favour, or any other passion, takes both house and Land from the rightfull owner, And bestowes them upon some friend of his owne, or of his favorite, He saies, that the rules of Justice will have it so, that it is the


<pb facs="tcp:60814:12"/>
voice of the Law, the Ordinance of God himselfe. And what else doth he herein, then by a kind of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution tell his humble suppliants that he holds themselves Idiots or base wretches not able to get releife; must it not astonish and vex withall, any man of a free spirit when he sees none other difference betweene the Judge and the Theefe, then in the manner of performing their exploits? as if the whole being of Justice consisted in point of formality. In such case an honest Subject will either seeke reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by ordinary courses, or awaite his time untill God shall place better men in office, and call the oppressors to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But a stranger wil not so, he hath nothing to do with the affairs of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> neither concerns it him what officer be placed or displaced in <hi>Taradante,</hi> or whether <hi>Mulisidian</hi> himself can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Kingdome, his Ship and goods are unjustly taken from him,


<pb facs="tcp:60814:12"/>
and therefore he will seeke leave to right himselfe if he can, and returne the injury ten fold, upon the whole Nation from which he received it. Truth it is, that men are sooner wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to dance attendance at the Gates of forreigne Lords, then to tarry the good leisure of their own Magistrates; Nor doe they beare so quietly the losse of some parcell confiscated abroad, as the greater detriment which they suffer by some prowling <hi>Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Customer,</hi> or publique minister at their returne.</p>
            <p>Whether this proceed from the Reverence which men yeild unto their proper Governour, I will not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, or whether excesse of trouble in following their causes far from home, or whether from despaire of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, as may be expected in their owne Country, in the hoped reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of disorders, or whether from their more unwillingnesse to disturbe


<pb facs="tcp:60814:13"/>
the Domesticall then the forreigne quiet by loud exclamations, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perhaps their not daring to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against the Injustice of their owne Rulers, though it were shamefull, for feare of faring worse, and of being punished for <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi>: As slanderers of men in authority, wheresoever it comes; As there can be but one Allegeance, so men are apt to serve no more then they needs must. According to that of the Slave in an old Comoedie: <hi>Non sum servus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus,</hi> my Master bought me for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and I am not every mans man.</p>
            <p>And this opinion, there is no Prince unwilling to mainetaine in his owne Subjects. Yea such as are most Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to their owne, Doe never find it safe to be better unto strangers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it were a matter of dangerous Consequence, that the People should thinke all other Nations to be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter case then themselves. The breife


<pb facs="tcp:60814:13"/>
is, Oppression in many places weares the Robes of Justice, which Dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring over the naturalls, may not spare strangers, And strangers will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, but cry out unto their owne Lords for releife by the Sword. Wherefore the Motive of Revenging Injuries is very strong, though it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consist in the will of man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inforcement of nature.</p>
            <p>Yet the more to quicken it, there is usually concurrent therewith, A hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expectation of gaine. For of the amends recovered, Little or nothing returns to those that had suffered the wrong, but commonly all runs into the Princes Coffers. Such examples as was that of our late Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> of most famous memory, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare. Her Majestie when the goods of our English Merchants were attached by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1569.</note> in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> And by King <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> arrested,


<pb facs="tcp:60814:14"/>
Likewise the goods of the <hi>Low dutch</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> that amounted unto a greater value: Neither was she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that her Subjects should right themselves aswell as they could, upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by Sea, But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought King <hi>Philip</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foure or five years,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno.</hi> 1573.</note> to better reason, though not so far as to Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; She satisfied her owne Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to the full, for all their losses out of the <hi>Dutchmens</hi> goods, and gave back to the Duke what was remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. This among many thousand of her Royall Actions, that made her glorious in all Nations, though it caused even strangers in their speech and writing to extoll her Princely Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to the skies: yet served it not as a President for others of lesse vertue to follow.</p>
            <p>It were more costly to take patterne from those Acts, which gave Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall renowne to that great Queen, then


<pb facs="tcp:60814:14"/>
to imitate the thirsty dealing of that <hi>Spanish Duke,</hi> in the self same busines, who kept all to his owne use, or his Masters, Restoring to the poore <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants not one penny. It falls out many times indeed, that a Prince is driven to spend far more of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in punishing by War the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his people, Then the losse of his People did amount unto. In such cases it is reason, that he satisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and let the people (whereto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are apt) rest contented with the sweetnesse of revenge.</p>
            <p>But when victory makes large a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all, it Royally becomes a Prince, to satisfy those for whose sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he undertooke the Warre. For besides the purpose it were now, to teach how victory should be used, or the gaines thereof Communicated to the generall content. This being only brought into shew, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereby gotten, is a stirring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation


<pb facs="tcp:60814:15"/>
to the redresse of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the sword. As for the redresse of Injuries done unto Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it may conveniently (though not alwayes, for it were miserable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to deny leave to Princes of mainetaining their owne honour, be referred unto the third motive of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Warres, which is meere Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p>This is and ever hath been that true cause of more Wars, then have troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the world upon all other occasions whatsoever, though it least partake of nature, or urgent necessity of State. I call not here alone by the name of Ambition, that vaine glorious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which openly professeth to be none other, and vaunts it selfe as an imperiall vertue (for the examples are not many of that kind:) But where occasion of Warre is greedily sought, or being very slight is gladly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for that increase of Dominion


<pb facs="tcp:60814:15"/>
is hoped thereby, we should rather impute the Warre to the scope at which it aimeth: then to any idle cause pretended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> feared lest they of of <hi>Carthage</hi> by winning <hi>Messana</hi> should soone get the mastery over all <hi>Sicilie,</hi> And have a faire entrance at pleasure into <hi>Italy</hi>: Which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent they made a Warre upon the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>; this feare I call Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Had they not trusted in their own Armes, hoping thereby to enlarge their empire, but being weaker, and more afraid indeed, they would have feared lesse.</p>
            <p>For Colour of this Warre they tooke the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> A Crewe of Theeves, and cut throats into their protection; Whom being their asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats they must needs defend. But had not their Ambition been mightier then their Justice, they would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to punish these <hi>Mamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:60814:16"/>
and not to protect them. Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the like examples: <hi>Know ye not</hi> (said <hi>Ahab</hi>) <hi>that Ramoth Gilead is ours</hi>? He knew this before, and was quiet enough, till opinion of his forces, made him looke into his right. And of this nature (though some worse then other in degree) are claims of old forgotten tribute or of some acknowledgements due perhaps to the Ancestors of a vanquished <hi>King,</hi> And long after challenged by the Heirs of the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> broken titles to <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> or Provinces, Mainetenance of friends, and Partizans, pretenced wrongs, and indeed, whatsoever it pleased him to alleadge that thinketh his owne sword sharpest: But of old time (perhaps before <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> was borne) Women have been the common Argument of these Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. As of late Ages in our parts of the world, since the names of <hi>Guelf,</hi> and <hi>Ghibeline,</hi> were heard, The right


<pb facs="tcp:60814:16"/>
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that is the Popes Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news and Authority.</p>
            <p>This last and other of the same kind I know not, how patiently they will endure to be ranged among Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons quarrels: For the Warre that hath such foundation, will not only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, free from worldly Ambition, Just, and honourable, But holy, and meritorious: having thereto belonging Pardon of Sins, Release from Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, And the promises of the life to come, As may be seen in the <hi>Popes Crociata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, that the <hi>Saracenes,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme no lesse of the Warres, which either they make against <hi>Christians,</hi> or which arise between themselves from difference of Sect. And if every man had his due, I thinke the honour of devising first this Doctrine: That <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> ought to be inforced upon men by the sword, would be found apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the false <hi>Prophet,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:60814:17"/>
sure, it is, that he and the <hi>Caliphes</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him obteined thereby in a short space a mighty Empire, which was in faire way to have inlarged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they fell out among themselves. Not for the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> But for <hi>Dominion</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these did the <hi>Popes,</hi> when their authority grew powerfull in the <hi>West</hi> incite the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Italie.</hi> Their chiefe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise was the Recovery of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In which worthy, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely difficult action, it is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Remember, what abundance of noble <hi>Blood</hi> hath been shed, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small benefit unto the Christian State.</p>
            <p>The Recovery of <hi>Spaine</hi> (whereof the better part was then in Bondage of the <hi>Saracens,</hi>) had been a worke more availeable to the men of <hi>Europe,</hi> more easily mainetained with supply, more aptly serving to advance any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing


<pb facs="tcp:60814:17"/>
enterprise upon <hi>Kingdomes</hi> further removed, more free from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and Requiring lesse expence of Blood. But the honourable piety of the undertakers could not be terrified by the face of danger, nor diverted from this to a more commodious busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by any motives of profit or faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for the Pulpits did sound in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parish <hi>Church</hi> with the praises of that voyage, as if it were a matter, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise far lesse highly pleasing unto <hi>God,</hi> to beare Armes for defence of his truth against prosecutors, or for the Deliverance of poore <hi>Christians</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with slavery, then to fight for that selfe same Land, wherein our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> was borne and Dyed: By such perswasions a marvellous number were excited to the Conquest of <hi>Palestina</hi> which with singular vertue they performed (though not without exceeding great losse of men) and held that <hi>Kingdome</hi> some few generations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60814:18"/>But the Climate of <hi>Syria,</hi> the far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the strength of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> And the neer Neighbourhood of those that were most puissant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> caused that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous enterprise, after a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of terrible War, to be quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned.</p>
            <p>The care of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, it was many times thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to represse the growing power of the <hi>Turke</hi> by the joint forces of all <hi>Christian Kings</hi> and Common-wealths, And hereto the <hi>Popes</hi> have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed much perswasion and often pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished their <hi>Crociata</hi> with pardon of sins to all that would adventure in a worke so Religious. Yet have they effected little or nothing, and lesse perhaps are ever like to doe. For it hath been their Custome so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to misuse the fervent zeale of men to Religious Armes by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Monies, that have been Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed


<pb facs="tcp:60814:18"/>
for such Wars, to their owne services, and by stirring up <hi>Christians</hi> one against an other, yea against their owne naturall <hi>Princes,</hi> under the like pretences of serving <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> that finally men waxed weary of their turbulent spirits, And would not believe that <hi>God</hi> was carefull to mainetaine the <hi>Pope</hi> in his quarrells, or that Remission of sins past, was to be obteined by Committing more and more grievous, at the instigation of his suspected holinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Questionlesse</hi> there was great reason, why all discreet <hi>Princes</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of yeilding hasty beliefe to the Robes of Sanctimonie.</p>
            <p>It was the Rule of our Blessed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, By their works you shall know them,</hi> what the works of those that occupied the <hi>Papacie,</hi> have been since the dayes of <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemaine</hi> who first enabled them with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall donation, The <hi>Italian</hi> writers


<pb facs="tcp:60814:19"/>
have testified at large. Yet were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to Cite <hi>Machiavell,</hi> who hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded their doings, and is therefore the more hatefull, or <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> whose works they have gelded, as not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to heare all that he hath written, though he spake enough in that which remains. What History shall we Read (excepting the <hi>Annales</hi> of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar Baronius,</hi> And some books of <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi> or <hi>Fryarly Parasites</hi>) which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning their Annales doe not leave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their ungodly dealing in all quarters.</p>
            <p>How few <hi>Kingdomes</hi> are there (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) wherein by dispensing with others, transferring the right of <hi>Crowns,</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Subjects from alleageance, and cursing or threatning to curse as long as their curses were regarded, they have not wrought unprobable mischiefs?</p>
            <p>The shamelesse denyall hereof by some of their friends, And the more shamelesse justification by their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,


<pb facs="tcp:60814:19"/>
makes it needfull to exemplifie, which I had rather forbeare, as not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to deale in such contentious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, were it not follie to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in uttering what is knowne to all the world. Pitty it is, that by such demeanour they have caused the <hi>Church</hi> (as <hi>Hierome Savanarola,</hi> and before him <hi>Robert Grosthead</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> prophecied) to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the sword. But God would have it so. How farre the <hi>Popes</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing therefore did sanctifie the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it rests in every mans discretion to Judge.</p>
            <p>As for the honourable <hi>Christians</hi> which undertooke that conquest to justifie their Warre, they had not only the redresse of injuries and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their oppressed Brethren, But the repelling of danger from their owne Land, threatned by those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleivers when they invaded.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Popes</hi> extortions (which were


<pb facs="tcp:60814:20"/>
not more forcible then those of <hi>Peters</hi> the <hi>Hermits</hi>) added spirit unto the action: yet altered they not the grounds of the Warre, nor made it the more holy. Let the Indulgences of <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> the tenth, beare witnesse of this, who out of politick feare of the <hi>Turkes</hi> violence urged a Religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution towards a Warre to be made upon them. The necessity of that which hee propounded was greater doubtlesse then any that had perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Conquest of <hi>Palestina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But too foule and manifest was the unholinesse of obtruding upon men Remission of sins for money, That the Sums which <hi>Pope Leo</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by raised and converted to his owne uses, have made his Successers loosers by the bargaine even to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, formerly well knowne by the name of <hi>Aeneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> was discernedly reckoned among the few good <hi>Popes</hi> of latter ages,


<pb facs="tcp:60814:20"/>
who neverthelesse in a Warre of the same Religious nature, discovered the like (though not the same) imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>His purpose was to set upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> the great, who had newly won the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and by carrying the Warre over into <hi>Greece,</hi> to prevent the danger, threatning <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this action highly Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, he intended to hazard his owne person, that so the more easily hee might win adventurers, who else were like to be lesse forward, as not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with such Romish tricks; Yet was not his owne devotion, so zealous in pursuit of this holy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but that he could stay a while, and convert his forces, against <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testi</hi> Lord of <hi>Rimini,</hi> letting, <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> waite his Leisure, who had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy set the Warre on foote in <hi>Greece.</hi> For (said he) we first subdue the little

               <hi>Turke,</hi> before we medle with the great, He spake reason if we regard policy. But attending one to Religion find we not, that he held the Chastisement of one which molested the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> a like pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> as would have been the holy <hi>Warre,</hi> against the Common Enemy of our Christian Faith? So thought all the rest of those <hi>Bishops.</hi> And so much more (upon their severall occasions) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves to thinke it, by how much they were commonly worse men then this <hi>Aeneas Silvius.</hi> And good reason was there that they should be of such beliefe, or Endeavour to make the Christian world believe none otherwise. For the naturall Constitution of their estate (I meane since the age of <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> or the times not long forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath urged them all hereto; though peradventure some few <hi>Popes</hi> may have been overlewd, by their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

natures, and thereby have swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the rule of policy. To speake in generall, whosoever hath dominion absolute, over some, and authority lesse absolute over many more, will seeke to draw those that are not wholly his owne into intire subjection.</p>
            <p>It fares with politick bodies as with the physicall; each would convert all into their owne proper substance, and cast forth as Excrement what will not so be changed.</p>
            <p>We need not Cite <hi>Philip</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor <hi>Philip</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Perseus,</hi> Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> for examples. Of which the former brought the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> the latter would have brought the <hi>Acheans</hi> and many estates in <hi>Greece</hi> from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of followers and dependants unto meer vassallage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spaine</hi> is yet fresh in mind, who attempted the self same upon the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>

               <hi>Exceptions</hi> may be framed here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one, of the honest, quiet, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous disposition of some Princes, yet that all, or the most are thus incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both reason and experience teach: yea even our Cities and Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here in <hi>England,</hi> such as need the protection of great Men, Complaine otherwhiles of their patrons over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much diligence, either in searching into their private estates, or behaving themselves master-like in point of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, But never hath authority better means to enlarge it self, then when it is founded upon devotion. And yet never doth authority of this kind, worke to raise it self unto meere dominion, untill it fall into the hands of those whose piety is more in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, then indeed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Leviticall Priests,</hi> in the old Law never arrogated unto themselves, any Temporall or Coactive power Nor advanced their Miters against the


<pb facs="tcp:60814:22"/>
               <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> They well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood what authority God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them and rested there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall content. Some wrangling hereabout hath been of late; The <hi>Popes</hi> flatterers labouring to prove, That the high <hi>Priests</hi> of old were not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subject unto the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and men of better spirit and learning having shewed the contrary.</p>
            <p>But whatsoever befell in those dayes, when there was no King in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>srael,</hi> that is, before the Reigne of <hi>Saul,</hi> or after the Captivity of <hi>Babel,</hi> sure it is that the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were alwaies obedient unto the sons of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> And acknowledged them their Lords. As for the race of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> that held both the <hi>Kingdome</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> at once, It falls not within this Consideration; the first thereof (of whom I read) that used the advantage of honour given to him in matter of Religion towards the

getting of Temporal possession, was (if not <hi>Mahomet</hi> himselfe) <hi>Abubaechar</hi> the Successor unto <hi>Mahomet,</hi> This man having obteined by help of his friends, the miserable happinesse of being chosen heire unto that foole Impostor in his dignity of a Prophet, made it one of his first works to dispoile poor <hi>Aliffe</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and heire of his great riches, taking al from him by this pretence, That unto whom belonged the Succession in wisdome, unto him also belonged the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in wealth. And this grew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be a famous question among the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Law. But howsoever it were then decided, we see now the <hi>Muphti</hi> or high Prelate, who is the only Oracle among the <hi>Turkes</hi> in Spirituall matters, lives and holds all that he hath at the discretion of the great <hi>Sultan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neverthelesse it should seeme that the doctrine of <hi>Abubachar,</hi> hath not


<pb facs="tcp:60814:23"/>
lost all force, for the examples are many in all <hi>Saracen</hi> Lands, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets or deceivers which got that name, that never rested untill they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Kings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seriph</hi> in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> was one of the last: who having once acquired the opinion of an holy Man, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward found means to become a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and Lord of a small Territory; And finally increased his followers, and withall his bounds so fast and so far, as having made himself <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Morocca,</hi> he had the grace to tell the King of <hi>Fessy,</hi> (lately his Soveraigne) that both <hi>Fesse</hi> and all <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in those parts were belonging to his own holinesse; and this he made good by winning all sooner after.</p>
            <p>Whether the claime which the Popes laid to a Supremacie over all <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and estates, had not affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the principle of <hi>Abubachar,</hi> Let other men Judge that their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses


<pb facs="tcp:60814:24"/>
to mainetaine it, have been sutable to those of <hi>Seriffo,</hi> all Historians doe testifie.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the second, procured the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and some other places in <hi>Italie</hi> to Rebell against the <hi>Emperour Leo,</hi> the third, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour used he, then that himself had Excommunicated <hi>Leo,</hi> as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>Prince,</hi> for breaking downe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, that were worshipped in <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> when for this treason <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Exarch,</hi> Leiutenant unto the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> besieged <hi>Rome</hi> with the assistance of <hi>Lueitpraud</hi> King of the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> by what other art did the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the siege, then by perswading the <hi>Lumbard</hi> with a <hi>Tale</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> that had consecrated the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> with their pretious blood. Thus was devotion made the Cloake for treason? And thus did the <hi>Popes</hi> first slip their necks out of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> coller. Within very few years


<pb facs="tcp:60814:24"/>
after this, by the like Religious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text were those Princes of <hi>France, Charls Martell, Pepine,</hi> and <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> won to assist the <hi>Papacie,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> yea, to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the most of those Lands which the <hi>Pope</hi> now holds in <hi>Italie,</hi> And not restore them to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, from whom the <hi>Lumbards</hi> had gotten them. And thereunto <hi>Pepine,</hi> was perswaded for his <hi>Souls</hi> health.</p>
            <p>Yet had <hi>Pope Zachary</hi> through the opinion that went of his <hi>holinesse,</hi> done a notable good office for <hi>Pepine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he Released the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of their Oath to King <hi>Chilperick,</hi> And was the cause that <hi>Pepine</hi> was chosen in his stead, by saying, That rather he should be King who did the Kings duty, then he that did it not.</p>
            <p>In like manner did <hi>Pope Leo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense the benefits of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> by setting him up as <hi>Emperour</hi> in the <hi>West</hi> against those of <hi>Constantinople:</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:60814:25"/>
But in these mutuall offices, the <hi>Popes</hi> did only help with gracefull words to adorne that might which <hi>Pepine</hi> and <hi>Charlemaine</hi> had before acquired. <hi>Whereas</hi> these Kings used force of arms to erect the papacy in Principallity; That was held yet in vassallage unto themselves. Now this could not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the ambition of that See, which gloried falsly to be the only See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique.</p>
            <p>For as the Reputation of the <hi>Romane</hi> Prelats grew up in those blind ages under the <hi>Westerne</hi> Emperours, much faster then true <hi>piety</hi> could raise it, in former times when better Learning had flourished; So grew up in them withall a desire, of amplifying their power, that they might be as great in temporall forces as mens opinion have formed them in spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Immediately therefore upon the death of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> they began to neglect the <hi>Emperours</hi> consent in their


<pb facs="tcp:60814:25"/>
Elections. And finding in them that afterwards reigned of the house of <hi>France,</hi> either too much patience or too much weakenesse, they were bold, within seaventy years to decree, That in the Creation of <hi>Popes,</hi> the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> should have nothing at all to doe. Having obteined this, It followed that they should make themselves <hi>Lord</hi> over the whole Clergie in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>But the worke was great, and could not be accomplished in hast, for they were much disturbed at home by the People of <hi>Rome</hi>; who seeing about Fifty Popes or rather (as mainetainers of the <hi>Papacie,</hi> would now have them called) Monsters to succeed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and attaine by the faction of Cut-throats, and Strumpets, St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, despised that hypocrisy, which the world abroad did Reverence as holinesse.</p>
            <p>Likewise the <hi>Empire</hi> falling from


<pb facs="tcp:60814:26"/>
the line of <hi>Charles,</hi> to the mighty house of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> was so strongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the first Princes of that race, as it greatly curbed the ambition of those aspiring Prelats.</p>
            <p>Yet no impediment could alwaies be of force to withstand the violence of seeming sanctity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Polonians, Hungarians,</hi> and some other farre removed Nations, had yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselves in subjection more then meerely spirituall, even to those Popes whom <hi>Italie</hi> knew to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable men.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Romane</hi> Citizens they were chastised by the sword, and taught to acknowledge the <hi>Pope</hi> their Lord, though they knew not by what right. Long it was indeed ere they could with much adoe be throughly tamed, Because they knowing the Lewdnesse of their Prelate and his Court, their devotion, unto him (the trade by which now they live) was very small.


<pb facs="tcp:60814:26"/>
Because also they were the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall forces, against which no Prince doth happily contend. But fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Popes Armes prevailed, or when his owne were too weake, the <hi>Emperours</hi> and other friends were hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Contrariwise against <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> and other Princes, the sword of the people even of their owne Subjects hath been used by teaching all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in our Westerne world a false Lesson. That it is lawfull and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to rebell against Kings excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and deposed by the Pope. This curse was first laid upon the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, Henry</hi> the fourth by <hi>Pope Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the seaventh. It is true (as I said before) that <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had felt the same though not in the same sort. For <hi>Leo</hi> being excommunicated was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deposed; only he suffered a revolt of some <hi>Italian</hi> Subjects. And one may say, That the <hi>Germane Empire</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:60814:27"/>
deserved this plague, Since the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof had given countenance to the Popes Rebelling against their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns the <hi>Emperours</hi> of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> Howsoever it were when <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> had accursed and cast downe from his throne <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, there were none so hardy as to defend their Injured Lord, against the Counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed name of St. <hi>Peter</hi>; Wherefore he was faine to humble himselfe before <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> upon whom he waited three daies beare footed in the <hi>Winter</hi> ere he could be admitted into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Neither yet could he otherwise get absolution, then by submitting his estate unto the <hi>Popes</hi> good pleasure, what was his fault? He had refused to yeild up to the <hi>Pope,</hi> the investiture of Bishops, and Collation of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall dignities within his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a right that had alwayes belonged to Princes untill that day.</p>
            <p>It were superfluous to tell how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously


<pb facs="tcp:60814:27"/>
he was afflicted all his life after; Notwithstanding this submission. In breife the unappeasable rage of <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> and his Successors, never left persecuting him, by raising one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion after an other; yea his owne Children against him, till dispoyled of his <hi>Crowne,</hi> he was faine to beg food of the Bishop of <hi>Spyers,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to earne it in a <hi>Church</hi> of his own building, by doing there a Clarks du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for he could serve the <hi>Quire,</hi> And not obteining this, he pined away and dyed.</p>
            <p>That Bishop of <hi>Spyers</hi> dealt herein perhaps rather fearfully, then cruelly, For he had to terrifie him, the example of <hi>Vteilo Archhishop</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> chiefe Prelate among the <hi>Germans.</hi> Who was condemned of heresie, for having denyed that the <hi>Emperour</hi> might be deprived of his <hi>Crowne</hi> by the Popes authority.</p>
            <p>If Princes therefore be carefull to


<pb facs="tcp:60814:28"/>
exclude the doctrine of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> out of their dominions, who can blame them of rigour?</p>
            <p>This example of <hi>Henry</hi> though it would not be forgotten, might have been omitted, had it not been secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with many of the same nature.</p>
            <p>But this was neither one Popes fault, nor one Princes destiny; He must write a story of the Empire, that means to tell of all their dealings in this kind, As how they wrought upon <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, whom they had set up against his Father, what horrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Blood they caused, by their often thundering upon <hi>Fredericke,</hi> And how they rested not untill they had made the <hi>Empire</hi> stand headlesse about seaventeene years.</p>
            <p>These things moved <hi>Rodolph</hi> Earl of <hi>Habspurgh</hi> who was chosen Emperour after that long vacation to refuse the Ceremony of being <hi>Crowned</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> though he were thereto urged by the


<pb facs="tcp:60814:28"/>
Electors. For (said he) our <hi>Caesars,</hi> have gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> As the foolish Beasts in <hi>AEsops Fables</hi> went, to the <hi>Lyons</hi> Den leaving very goodly footsteps of their journey thitherward, but not the like of their returne.</p>
            <p>The same opinion have most of the succeeding Emperours held, all of them, or almost all neglecting that <hi>Coronation.</hi> Good cause why; Since the Popes (besides many Extortions which they practised about that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony) Arrogated thence unto themselves, that the <hi>Empire</hi> was held of them in Homage, And dealt they not after the same fashion with other Kingdomes?</p>
            <p>What right had St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and of <hi>Naples</hi>? The <hi>Romane</hi> Princes wonne those Lands from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who had formerly taken them from the Empire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>; The same <hi>Romanes</hi> had also been mighty defenders of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy


<pb facs="tcp:60814:29"/>
in many dangers, yet when time served, the Pope tooke upon him, as Lord <hi>Paramount</hi> of those Countryes, to drive out one King, and set up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, with a Bloody confusion of all <hi>Italie</hi>; retaining the Soveraignty to himself.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France,</hi> he had the daring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce himselfe superiour unto the King in all matters both Spirituall and Temporall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> he forced to hold of his <hi>Miter</hi> by imposing a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in way of penance. For that the <hi>Polish</hi> King had caused one St. <hi>Stanislaus</hi> to be slaine.</p>
            <p>For the death of St. <hi>Thomas Beckett</hi> and (more strangely) for a Refusall of an <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> whom his <hi>Holinesse</hi> had appointed, he impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the like penance upon <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also when our King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> made Warre upon the Scots, word came from <hi>Rome</hi> that he should


<pb facs="tcp:60814:29"/>
surcease: for that the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> belonged unto the Popes Chappell.</p>
            <p>A great oversight it was of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that he did not accurse <hi>Nero,</hi> and all heathen <hi>Princes,</hi> whereby the Popes Chappell might have gotten all that the <hi>Devill</hi> offered, and our <hi>Saviour</hi> refused. Yet what need was there of such a banne: Since <hi>Fryar Vincent</hi> of <hi>Valnarda</hi> could tell <hi>Atatalipa</hi> King of <hi>Peru</hi>: That all the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> of the Earth were the <hi>Popes,</hi> who had bestowed more then halfe thereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi> will have it so, it must be so; otherwise I should have interpreted that place in <hi>Genesis, Increase and multiply and fill the Earth,</hi> As spoken to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Children, not as directed only to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Phatto,</hi> the supposed Fathers of the old <hi>Iberians, Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> of whom the Spanish blood is compounded. But of such impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent


<pb facs="tcp:60814:30"/>
presumption in disposing of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes farre remote, And whereto the sword must acquire a better title, the mischiefe is not presently discerned.</p>
            <p>It were well if his <hi>Holinesse</hi> had not loved to set the world in an uproare by nourishing of War, among those that respected him as a Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>His dispensing with oaths taken for agreement between one King and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or between Kings and Subjects, doe speake no better of him. For by what right was it, That <hi>Fardinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> won the <hi>Kingdome of Navar</hi>? why did not the Confederacie, that was between <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> hinder that King from warring upon <hi>Venice</hi>? why did not the like between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> hinder our King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth for warring upon the same King <hi>Lewis</hi>?</p>
            <p>Was it not the Pope who did set


<pb facs="tcp:60814:30"/>
on the French, to the end that himself might get <hi>Ravenna</hi> from the <hi>Venetians</hi>? Why was it not the same <hi>Pope,</hi> who afterwards (upon desire to drive the French out of <hi>Italie</hi>) excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lewis,</hi> and his adherents? By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which Excommunication <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> seized upon <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And served not the same Warrant to set our <hi>Henry</hi> upon the back of <hi>France</hi>? But this was not our Kings fault more then all the peoples. We might with shame confesse it, (if other Countries had not been as blindly superstitious as our Fathers) That a Barque of Apples blessed by the Pope, and sent hither for presents unto those that would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the War upon <hi>France,</hi> made all our English hasty to take Armes, in such sort as the <hi>Italians</hi> wondred, and laughed to see our men, no lesse greedy of those Apples (then <hi>Eve,</hi> was of the forbidden fruit) for which they were


<pb facs="tcp:60814:31"/>
to hazard their lives in an unjust War. Few ages have wanted such and more grievous examples of the <hi>Popes</hi> tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous disposition, but these were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the last that fell out before his unholinesse was detected. Now for his dispensing betweene Kings and their Subjects, we need not seeke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances far from home.</p>
            <p>He absolved our King <hi>Iohn</hi> of an oath, given to his Barons and people. The Barons and people he afterwards discharged of their alleageance to King <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> had appeased this Land (how wisely I say not) by taking such an oath, as his Father had done; swearing as he was a Knight, A <hi>Christian,</hi> and a <hi>King.</hi> But in a Sermon at <hi>Paules,</hi> People were taught how little was to be reposed on such assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the Popes dispensation being there openly read, which pronounced that Oath voyde. Good cause why.


<pb facs="tcp:60814:31"/>
For that King had the patience to live, like neither Knight, nor King, But as the Popes Tenant, and Rent-gatherer of <hi>England.</hi> But when the same King adventured to murmure, the Pope could threaten to teach him his duty with a vengeance. And make him know, what it was to winch and play the <hi>Fredericke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see what hath been his Custome to oppresse Kings by their people, And the people by their Kings, yet this was for serving his owne turne.</p>
            <p>Wherein had our King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>sixt</hi> offended him (which King Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> would after for a little money have made a Saint) Neverthelesse, the Popes absolving of <hi>Rich</hi>: Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> from that honest oath, which he had given by mediation of all the Land to that good King occasioned both the Dukes and the Kings ruine. And therewithal those long and cruell


<pb facs="tcp:60814:32"/>
Wars betweene the Houses of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> and brought all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into an horrible Combustion. What he meant by this, I know not, unlesse to verifie the Proverbe; <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Romae venalia,</hi> I will not urge the dispensation, whereby the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased King <hi>Philip,</hi> the second of <hi>Spaine,</hi> from the solemne Oath by which he was bound to maintaine the priviledges of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> though this Papall indulgence, hath scarce as yet left working, And been the cause of so many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands slaine, for this last forty years in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will I urge the Pope encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and his sons, to the last of them against the <hi>French</hi> Protestants, the cause of the first three Civill Warres, And lastly of the Leavyings of <hi>Byrons,</hi> in which there hath perished no lesse number, then in the Low-Countryes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60814:32"/>For our Country it affords an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of fresh memory, since we should have had as furious Warre, as ever both upon us, and amongst us, in the daies of our late famous Soveraigne Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> if Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Bull, Could have gored, aswell as it could Bellow.</p>
            <p>Therefore it were not amisse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by a <hi>Herald,</hi> the next Pontificall attempt of like nature, rather sending defiance (as to an enemy) then publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing answers as to one that had here to doe, though indeed he had never here to doe (by any lawfull power) either in Civill or Ecclesiasticall businesse, after such time as <hi>Brittaine</hi> was won from the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>For howsoever it were ordered in some of the first holy generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> should be <hi>Patriarch</hi> over these quarters, yea; or it were supposed that the forged <hi>Canons,</hi> by which he now challengeth

more then precedency, and primacie, had also been made indeed: yet could this little help his claime in <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi> that hold not of the Empire. For those right holy Fathers, as in matters of Faith, they did not make truth, But religiously expounded it: so in matters of Ecclesiasticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they did not create pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces for themselves; But ordered the Countries which they then had.</p>
            <p>They were assemblies of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the <hi>Romane</hi> world, and with the <hi>Romane</hi> dominion only they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Requisite it is that the faith which they taught should be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in all Countryes, As it ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be entertained, if the same had been in like sort illustrated, not by them, but by a generall Councill of all Bishops in the great Kingdome of the <hi>Abissines,</hi> which is thought to have been Christian even in those daies.</p>
            <p>But it was not requisite, nor is, that


<pb facs="tcp:60814:33"/>
the Bishops of <hi>Abissines,</hi> or of <hi>India,</hi> should live under direction of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Questionlesse,</hi> those godly Fathers of the <hi>Nicene,</hi> And of the <hi>Calcedonian</hi> Councill so thought. For they tooke not upon them to order the <hi>Church</hi> Government in <hi>India,</hi> where St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had preached, nor to range the Subjects of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> (as we call him) under any of themselves; much lesse to frame an <hi>Hierarchie</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, whereto men of all Nations whatsoever should be subject in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall obedience.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Constantine</hi> or his Successors the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours could have wonne all <hi>Asia</hi>: like it is that in Councils following more <hi>Patriarchs</hi> would have been ordeined for the Ecclesiasticall Government of that large continent, and not all those vast Countryes have beene left unto him of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But since contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

the <hi>Empire</hi> became looser, the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> whose Jurisdiction depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Empire, become loosers also.</p>
            <p>We grant, that even in the times of persecution, before Christian Bishops durst hold open assemblies, there was given especiall honour to the Bishops that were over the chiefe Cities; That unity might the better be preserved and heresie kept out of the <hi>Church</hi>; But this honour was no more, then a precedence, a dignity without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power, extending no further then to matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> And not having to doe, save in the generall way of Christian love with any stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>We therefore, that are no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the <hi>Empire,</hi> ought not to be troubled with the authority (be it what it may be) with any assemblies of godly Fathers (yet all Subjects of that <hi>Empire,</hi> ordeined for their owne
