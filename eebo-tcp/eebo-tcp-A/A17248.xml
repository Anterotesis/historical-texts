            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke of <hi>Job</hi> in respect of the dialect of those times, being of quaint expressions, must needs be explained by other and more familiar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and being also difficult in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence (which is very materiall) many texts or verses besides their proper senses must therefore in their explications carrie their dependant, and coherent meanings in them, else they cannot bee fully ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, nor the discourse by its right joints and ligaments continued, and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but must needs be imperfect, blind, and lame, which I have laboured the cure of, by perspicuity of phrase and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>A Paraphrase (and not a commentarie) is the thing that I endeavour, which is a
<pb facs="tcp:612:4"/>
bare rendering of the sense plaine and easy, the better to enable the Reader to be a commentator to himselfe. And if any place seeme to beare another meaning then I have given it, know, that there goes more to the true stating of a text then an overly view or a present consideration of the sense it seemes to hold forth in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it: some places require much pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and many candles to bee lighted at once in the minde of the expositour to give their true intended meaning, else hee may erre in <hi>benè divisis ad malè conjuncta,</hi> and cause a falling out of the text either with its coherence and scope, or else of one text with another.</p>
            <p>The story is well known to be as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall a pillar to support a Christian in strong trials, by paterne and precept of faith and patience, as any the whole Bible affoords, and so I trust it may prove being well understood and applied to all such as read it with an heart to use it. Besides which there is excellent matter for other graces to worke upon, God being upon
<pb facs="tcp:612:4"/>
the occasion of their dispute admirably set forth with powerfull and spirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy, and man abased in like manner, which to a considerate humble-hearted Reader will administer sweet occasions of reducing his graces sutable to such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by the assistance of the spirit, into fresh acts and lively motions; the way to evidence his truth, and to further their growth.</p>
            <p>And, which I also desire the Reader to take prime notice of, he shal further see for his learning the strong consolation and undaunted courage that singlenesse and sincerity of heart (which in a word is, The animating and giving life to our dead works by doing them in conscience to God through faith and love) brings with it, even to the facing of God in an holy boldnesse (though through temptation <hi>Iob</hi> exceeded) by the faith of his Gospel, when he pleads against us his greatest severity, &amp; highest Majesty, and to the outfacing of all besides God, men or devils.</p>
            <p>Other flowers there are which a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD, for whose pleasure all things<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 11.</note> are, and were created,</hi> having made <hi>Job</hi> fit for use, resolveth to imploy him, and having first tried him in a calme sea of prosperity, and not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to leake, at last launcheth him into the deep, and ingageth him in a long and dangerous voiage of adversity, where hee must undergoe many a fight and storme, to prove God a Master-builder.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, because Satan knew not Gods designe, God himselfe hints it to him by commending <hi>Job,</hi> which his malice not abiding to heare, and desiring to contradict, presently becomes a sutor, to God, to have the winnowing of him, which God for many reasons granteth to him: Partly, in respect to shew him that hee is the onely <hi>discerner of the heart:</hi> Partly, in<note place="margin">heb. 4. 12.</note> respect of the errour of those times wherein it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received, that God afflicted not in soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but onely for, and according to the proportion of sinne: Partly, in respect of <hi>Job,</hi> for his after-honour and preferment: And lastly, in respect of after-times, to leave upon record a paterne of patience, and a seale
<pb facs="tcp:612:6"/>
of Gods power and faithfulnesse in upholding the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and in delivering them out of all their troubles.</p>
            <p>Satan having received his commission to worke he goeth, and dischargeth all his Ordinance at once upon <hi>Job,</hi> thinking through force and policy, to wring some discontented blasphemy from him, and so to disprove God, but <hi>Job</hi> abid the shocke, and uttered not a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming word, till at last his sores began to smart, and therewith also the light of Gods countenance through the thicke cloud of those many afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to shine dim upon his spirit, and then hee opened his mouth, not as Satan hoped, to blaspheme, but to ease his forrwfull soule, with breathing forth a dolefull wish or two; as that either he had never seene life, or might now see death.</p>
            <p>Which impatiency of <hi>Jobs,</hi> his friends standing by, tooke fire at, and thereupon they being ignorantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced of God, that hee afflicted not but in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable punishment to sin committed, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were opinionated of <hi>Job,</hi> that for all his faire shew, he must needs be but a hollowhearted hypocrite; they with vehement importunity, pressed these sore upon him as infallible maximes, thereby to have disarmed him both of his sword of faith, and shield of sincerity, but <hi>Job,</hi> though conscious to his owne infirmities which he ingenuously confesseth, yet was also privie to his owne uprightnesse, which he as manfully maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against all his opposites, and the more they laboured to loose his hold on God, the faster he clung unto him, yea, though God himselfe seemed to take their part, by suffering Satan afresh to face him with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past sinnes accompanied with present terrours, and
<pb facs="tcp:612:6"/>
himselfe too utterly benighted his soule with an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute sun-set of all present sight and sense of immediate favour: yet in this great desertion God gave him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand for his secret support, a little chinke of light whereby he was able to see, and sustainingly to remind himselfe of Gods former favours (though hee felt none present) which made him able to leane upon his God, yea, and which enlightned him clearely to see also his owne sincerity, though it were sore shot at by his friends, which did drive him to appeale from man to God (the onely Judge of secret things) with whom he desired to plead his cause (with some exceedings) in that behalfe, provided he would substitute one that was his equall in his stead.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Elihu</hi> hearing, when his time came to speak accordingly addressed himselfe unto him in Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, wisely, both justifying <hi>Job</hi> against his friends, and cond<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mning their ungrounded opinion in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him an hypocrite, because of his great afflictions; and also justifying God against <hi>Job,</hi> who, through his friends unadvised spurring him on, had overreached. Wherefore <hi>Elihu</hi> sheweth <hi>Iob</hi> his fault which God strucke at by his affliction, to wit, pride, whereof hee convinceth him by his saufie capitulating with God, who both in right of prerogative, over his creature, yea and in justice for his sinne, (though not for his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie) might justifie all he did against him, and was by no means to be disputed withall touching any thing he did, because of his excelling power, unsearehable wisdome, and undeniable justice.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Elihu</hi> having spoken, God himselfe secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him with a large expression of his owne tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
<pb facs="tcp:612:7"/>
greatnesse in wisedome and power beyond <hi>Jobs</hi> capacity, consequently shewing him his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and solly, and his owne unquestionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in all his workes, however they appeare to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reason.</p>
            <p>Which, when <hi>Job</hi> understood from God himselfe, his mouth was stopped, saving in abasing himselfe and confessing of his fault, which was no sooner done, but God shaketh hands with <hi>Job, Brings forth his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse<note place="margin">Psal. 37, 6.</note> as the light, and his judgement as the noone-day,</hi> in the sight of all his accusers; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him to be Mediatour for his friends, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally maketh him a large amends, even double to all hee lost.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a man whose<note place="margin">1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was <hi>Iob,</hi> and that man was perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and one that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and eschewed evill.</note> Story the Lord would have recorded for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and believed for a truth; and therefore for further confirmation, know, that for the Country where he lived, it was the land of Uz, lying upon the borders of the Caldeans, Sabeans and Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites; and for his name, it was <hi>Job,</hi> who was of the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turah.</hi> This man was faithfull, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the promised Messiah, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in heart, devoting himselfe to serve &amp; please the Lord alwaies, in all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:612:8"/>
things, and hee walked accordingly in his life and conversation, for fearing to offend him, he was therefore diligent, with care and circumspection to avoid all sin, and the occasions thereof in the time &amp; place when and where he lived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon which holy Man, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed<note place="margin">2. And there was born unto him seven Sonnes and three Daughters.</note> a liberall portion of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessings; and the better to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the exemplarinesse of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and patience, (when by the hand of God hee was quite strip'd naked of them all) know more particularly what they were. And first, he was the father of many godly children, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber seven sonnes and three daughters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, he abounded in wealth,<note place="margin">3. His substance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was seven thousand Sheepe, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Camells, and five hundred yoke of Oxen, and five hundred she-As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and a very great houshold; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.</note> having no lesse than seven thousand Sheepe, three thousand Camells, five hundred yoke of Oxen, five hundred she-Asses, and answerably enriched with servants, and all other accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; So that indeed there was none in all those Easterne parts where hee lived that went beyond him, or that was equall to him in temporall felicity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And further, to adde to his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,<note place="margin">4. And his Sons went and feasted in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, every one his day, and sent and called for their three sisters, to eat and to drink with them.</note> and to sweeten these blessings to him the more, hee saw the happy fruit of his vertuous care in educating his children by their mutuall love, so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:612:8"/>
unanimously expressed in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly intercourse of friendly feasting and welcomming each one all the rest of his brethren at his owne house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also ever mindfull to invite their three sisters, that so their number and amity might be complete.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And though this thing pleased<note place="margin">5. And it was so, when the daies of their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting were gone about, that <hi>Iob</hi> sent and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, and rose up earely in the morning, and offered burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings according to the number of them all: for <hi>Job</hi> said, It may be that my sonnes have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did <hi>Iob</hi> continually.</note> 
                  <hi>Job,</hi> yet such was his religious care, that when their turnes of feasting were expired, he summoned them all joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and made them solemnely to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and prepare themselves, and then rising up early in the morning, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father, and chiefe of the family, offered for every one of his children a burnt offering for (fearing God, and knowing the corruption of nature, and the temptation of such occasions) hee thought with himselfe; It may be, that my children in these their feastings, have fallen into some sinnes incident to such actions, and through overmuch sensuall liberty, may, perhaps, have forgotten their duty, and overseene themselves towards God, not bearing him that awfulnesse, nor rendring him the thankfulnesse due unto him. And this was <hi>Jobs</hi> constant custome, which hee never failed to perform so oft as their course of feasting gave him oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:612:9"/>6. Now, to come to the Story it<note place="margin">6. Now there was a day, when the sonnes of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.</note> selfe, I must lead you into it by a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed allusion from the Kings and Princes of this world, for the helpe of our humane understandings. There was a time when God summoned his ministring Spirits, the holy Angells to appeare before him, who with a filiall readinesse presenting themselves to give their account, and to receive his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands for the service of his Church, Satan by the will of God came also among them to render his account, and to receive his charge, as also of his own will to espie advantages.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And yet further, to speake after<note place="margin">7. And the Lord said unto Satan: Whence comest thou? Then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan answered the Lord, and said, from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and downe in it.</note> the manner of men, for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing us according to our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; God seeing Satan there among them, enters into speech with him, thereby to administer an occasion to manifest <hi>Jobs</hi> uprightnes, and to bring to passe his purpose concerning him. And in the first place hee askes him whence hee came, and from what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to give us to understand the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells solicitousnesse from his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; who answered, I come from off the earth, from my continuall imploiment of soliciting my cause and kingdome up and down every where among men by watching and taking the fittest op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:612:9"/>
to tempt and intrap them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Why then, saies God, sure thou<note place="margin">8. And the Lord said unto Satan, hast thou considered my servant <hi>Iob,</hi> that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill?</note> canst not choose but have taken speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notice of <hi>Job</hi> the Uzzite, to be my servant in an extraordinary manner, so as there is not the like to him upon the whole earth for a faithfull and upright-hearted man, that truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenceth and feares mee, and is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull to doe nothing that shall offend mee.</p>
               <p n="9">9. 'Tis true, saies Satan, I know him<note place="margin">9. Then Satan answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lord, and said, Doth <hi>Iob</hi> feare God for nought?</note> well, and that he makes a faire shew of honouring and serving thee, and no wonder, seeing he hath thriven so well by thee; but thou art mistaken in his uprightnesse: for it is not with a filiall but a mercenary feare that he regards thee, the better to compasse his owne ends.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For thou knowst, and so doth<note place="margin">10. Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the worke of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</note> he too, full well, how thou hast hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto incompassed him and all that is his, with thy protection, so that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor any could doe him any hurt whereby to try him, and thus thou continuest to doe still, neither is hee ignorant how it is thou that prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest him, and makest him thrive in every thing he doth, and hast so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously enriched him above all that are neere him, and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:612:10"/>
if for such extraordinary favours hee (in this time of his prosperity and and plenty) seeme to doe thee extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary service, and to beare thee great good will.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But as hitherto thou hast im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed<note place="margin">11. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</note> thy power to preserve him and to blesse him with such abundance, so now, doe but shew it in taking away that which thou hast given him, and then hee will quickly appeare another manner of man than thou takest him to be; for, in stead of honouring and reverencing thee in feare, thou shalt finde, that hee'll cast off all respect, and not sticke to blaspheme thee to thy face.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Well (saies God) that thou maist<note place="margin">12. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that hee hath is in thy power, onely upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</note> see that I am the searcher of hearts, and have said nothing of my servant <hi>Iob,</hi> but what I know to be true, take thy course, try him as thou hast desired, thou hast free leave to doe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou wilt with all that is his, onely I will restraine thee from harming his owne person. Whereupon Satan ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to put in execution what God permitted him with the first opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And therefore watched his time<note place="margin">13. And there was a day when his Sons and his Daughters were eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house.</note> when as <hi>Iobs</hi> children, according to their foresaid custome of love-feasts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:612:10"/>
were met together in their eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, upon which opportunity he purposed to plant his maine battery for the gaining of his conquest, and therefore reserved it untill the last, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way thereto, by a methodicall discharge of lesser ordinance.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The first whereof is a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">14. And there came a messenger unto <hi>Iob,</hi> and said, The Oxen were plowing, and the Asses feeding beside them.</note> in all haste, bringing <hi>Job</hi> the sad newes of the losse of all his five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yoke of Oxen at once, with the hopes of all the next yeeres profits of their labours, and also of all his Asses.</p>
               <p n="15">15. By a violent surprisall of the<note place="margin">15. And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away, yea, they have slaine the servants with the edge of the sword, and I only am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped alone to tell thee.</note> Sabeans, who came and carried them quite away; and to make the matter worse to pitifull-hearted <hi>Job,</hi> he tells him they had also slaine all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that were at worke with them, save himselfe, and his escape was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, doubtlesse, only to the end he might bring him those heavie tidings of discomfort.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Secondly, to set home the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row<note place="margin">16. While he was yet speaking, there came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so another, and said, The fire of God is falne from heaven, and hath burnd up the sheepe, and the servants, and consumed them, and I onely am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped alone to tell thee.</note> of this message upon <hi>Iobs</hi> heart, so soone as ever hee had heard it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could bethinke himselfe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in like hast bespeakes him with worse newes, and said, There fell fire from heaven, no doubt, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of God, and hath most strangely and suddenly burnd up and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:612:11"/>
utterly consumed all thy seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sheepe at once, and hath devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also thy very servants that tended them: Onely I am escaped to the end, it seemes, that I should bring thee this evill newes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Lest hee should have any thing<note place="margin">17. While he was yet speaking, there came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so another, and said The Caldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the Camells, and have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away, yea and slaine the servants with the edge of the sword, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.</note> left to sustaine him in hope, and to ease his griefe; Satan dispatcheth a third messenger, contriving him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in the very nicke of opportunity for the enforcing of <hi>Iobs</hi> misery, and provoking him thereby to impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against God, by telling him all in haste; by that time hee had well heard out the other. How that the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans came with no lesse than three bands of men, and fell furiously upon the Camells, and the men that kept them; so that they have driven away the Camells, and killed all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to boote, saving my selfe, who, it seemes, had my life given me by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence, to bring thee the newes.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And just as hee had finished his<note place="margin">18. While he was yet speaking, there came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so another and said, Thy sonnes and thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were eating &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine in their eldest brothers house.</note> tale, comes there yet another messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by whom Satan was confident, (having thus contrived and managed his foregoing temptations) to worke his will upon <hi>Iob.</hi> And hee tells him, That his sonnes and his daughters fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:612:11"/>
nothing, were feasting &amp; making merry, in their eldest brothers house.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And unexpectedly, npon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,<note place="margin">19. And behold, there came a great wind from the wildernes, and smote the foure corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.</note> there blew a mighty wind from<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the wildernesse, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment overthrew all the house upon the yong men thy sons, and they are every one slain, only I have escaped, I know not how, but it seemes miraculously, to bring thee these wofull tydings.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Whereat <hi>Iob,</hi> who had abid and<note place="margin">20. Then <hi>Iob</hi> arose and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</note> sate out all the rest, now arose, and in the griefe, but not impatiency of his heart, he rent his garment, and in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of sorrow, after the custome of those countries hee shaved his head, and after that he prostrated himselfe upon the ground in reverence to the Majesty of God, and in stead of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, humbly worshipped the Lord,</p>
               <p n="21">21. Saying, I brought none of all<note place="margin">21.

               <p n="1">1. Againe, in like manner, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,<note place="margin">1. Againe, there was a day when the sonnes of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so among them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe before the Lord.</note> there was another time, wen as God summoned his ministring Spirits the Angells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, who, (as at the first time) presented themselves to the Lord, and so did Satan also.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of whom the Lord asked the<note place="margin">2. And the Lord said unto Sathan; From whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and downe in it.</note> same question; Whence he came, &amp;c. thereby to give a further occasion, more fully to convince Satan of <hi>Iobs</hi> integrity, and to perfect his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose concerning him. To whom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan returned the same answer; That hee came from going to and fro upon the earth, to find advantages to tempt men.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:612:12"/>3. Why then saies the Lord, thou<note place="margin">3. And the Lord said unto Satan, hast thou considered my servant <hi>Iob,</hi> that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause.</note> canst not but have taken speciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my servant <hi>Iob,</hi> what manner of man he is, who besides all that I told thee of him touching his faith and honesty, which in despite of thee hee hath made good to the utmost, thou seest still to continue in his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartednesse and humble obedience towards me, although thou prevailed with me, thus seemingly to declare my selfe against him (and that in such a manner, as none but such an one as I have told thee hee is, could possibly have borne it as he hath done) by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such heavie afflictions upon him, and that without any provocation, or cause on his part procuring it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis true, saies Satan, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">4. And Satan answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lord, and said, skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will hee give for his life.</note> it but he hath held out well, and I have got no ground of him hitherto, but yet for all that, the reason is not as thou saiest, from his uprightnesse, but from the nature of his sufferings, and his owne selfe-respect; for hitherto thou hast only tried him with forraine afflictions, and hast made him to suffer only in the suffrings of others, but hast not touched him at all in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and thou knowest it is naturall to every man nothing so much to lay to heart, or be moved with relative, as

with personall afflictions, as is seene by common experience; for who will not, if he may be his owne chooser, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer in any other, though never so neere unto him than in himselfe, and thinke it a good bargaine to lose all he has to save his life?</p>
               <p n="5">5 And that thou maist see that this<note place="margin">5. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</note> is true, let mee prevaile with thee once more, to try him a little further with this kind of triall which I have spoken of, lay but thine afflicting hand upon his owne person, by some bodily pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and then tell me whether hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his uprightnesse, nay, then see if my words prove not true, that hee will cast off all respect of thee, and blaspheme thee to thy face.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Well saies God, seeing thou art<note place="margin">6. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, hee is in thine hand, but save his life.</note> not yet convinced, goe on, I grant thee thy desire, doe thy worst to his person also: but as before I restrained thee from harming his body, so doe I now forbid thee to take away his life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Satan glad hee had sped so well,<note place="margin">7. So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote <hi>Iob</hi> with sore boyles from the sole of his foote, unto his crowne.</note> quickly left co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muning with God, and went streightway while the anguish of <hi>Iobs</hi> other afflictions were fresh upon him, to put his commission in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the trying of him by bodily pressures, which hee fulfilled to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, by over-running him in every

part from head to foot with a painfull disease, strangely breaking out all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his body in grievous and noysome boyles.</p>

               <p n="9">9. Satan seeing all these temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">9. Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retaine thine integrity? Curse God, and die.</note> would not make <hi>Job</hi> blaspheme, puts him at last directly upon the very point it selfe, by the desperat counsell and provoking suggestion of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some-friend, his wife, who in stead of administring conjugall helpe to him, by the Divells instigation, she takes the opportunity of this his deep dejection to spur him on to a further evill, under the plausible pretence of remedy, by tempting him no longer to feare and adhere to such a God in dependance and reverence, nor any longer to beare his afflicting hand with patience, that had thus unmercifully and without cause tormented him, but being that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:612:14"/>
he sped no better by his integrity, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to spite God, as God had spited him, by easting off his fruitlesse faith and patience, and turning it into blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; for so should he get more from God by provoking him therewith to destroy him out and out, than hee had done by blessing him, which all this while had gained him no good, but procured God to sustaine him alive under insupportable miseries, and so was like to doe still.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But herein also Satan came short<note place="margin">10 But hee said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh; What? shall wee receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evill?

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:612:14"/>

               <p n="26">26. For thou arrestest me with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold<note place="margin">26.

               <p n="4">4. That so I might (as I long to do)<note place="margin">4. I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> even plead my cause, and maintaine mine innocency before him, for all his afflicting me.</p>

any transcendent maner, nor stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his rigour and power with me, but that hee will gratiously enable mee to speake the truth unto him touching my sincerity, and to maintaine it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I know, however he pleaseth to<note place="margin">7.

Behold, I goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but he is not there; and backward, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive him.</note> this happinesse to finde him out, that I may have speech with him; for he will not in any way, nor by any meanes I can use manifest himselfe so to mee, as to give mee the hearing, I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, though I seeke it every way I can devise; for I put my selfe before him with a confident boldnesse of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to try if that way I can provoke him to it, but he keepes off from me;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:612:83"/>
also I humble my selfe at my distance, to see if that way I can draw him to it, but all is one, I am never the neerer, he is every whit as farre off.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I prayed him for the afflictions<note place="margin">9. On the left hand where hee doth worke, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himselfe on the right hand, that I cannot see him.</note> sake which he layeth upon mee, but I cannot speed, for hee quite contrary is the further off, by how much I desire to draw neere to him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But for all he keepes at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,<note place="margin">10. But hee knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</note> and seemes so strange to mee, and will not grant me this favourto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to plead my cause before him; yet I am sure for all this he knowes me and my waies to be such as I have said, and when hee has held mee a while in the fire of affliction, my uprightnesse shall be made manifest, and shall shine as gold in the eyes of those, that now through prejudice can see nothing but drosse in me.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For I know, and dare main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">11. My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</note> it, that I have beene no such man as you suspect me for, but that I have constantly walked in the waies of the Lord without deviation or turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side from them for any respect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Neither have I ever turned my<note place="margin">12.

               <p n="13">13. But that is all one; for what the<note place="margin">13.

               <p n="14">14. And this is my very case now,<note place="margin">14. For he performeth the thing that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for mee: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such things are with him.</note> for hee doth in this my affliction, but onely shew his just prerogative upon me, to try me, not to punish mee, and many such extraordinary things hee pleaseth to decree and execute in his great power and unsearchable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereof wee can know, nor give no reason.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Therefore though I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,<note place="margin">15. Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him.</note> yet it is this his greatnesse which I am to grapple withall, and doe now susteine, and not my conscientious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that troubles mee, when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his immensity, that is the thing that makes me afraid of him.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For in this respect, God melteth<note place="margin">16. For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</note> and weakeneth my heart and spirit with feare and astonishment, as the wax before the fire; and I confesse the thoughts of his Almightinesse is no little trouble to me.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For because I see he useth it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together<note place="margin">17. Because I was not cut off before the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse neither hath he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the darknesse from my face.</note>

Now the reason why hee was angry with <hi>Job,</hi> was not because hee maintained his owne integrity against
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:612:108"/>
his friends, but because he over-eyed his owne righteousnesse to the lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods, pleading it too farre (not onely against his friends, but) even to God him selfe in the way of expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and therewith questioning his righteousnesse in so dealing with him, in stead of acknowledging it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his waies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the reason why he was also<note place="margin">3. Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned <hi>Iob.</hi>
                  </note> angry with <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not directly taxe <hi>Iob,</hi> nor convincingly prove against him, that which all this while upon a bare surmise they had accused him of, namely, of being an hypocrite and and wicked man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now <hi>Elihu</hi> (though with childe<note place="margin">4. How <hi>Elihu</hi> had wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till <hi>Iob</hi> had spoken, because they were elder than hee.</note> to speake) yet had modestly bridled his desire till <hi>Iob</hi> had fully ended his last and long reply, nor had hee ever offered to interrupt the discourse of <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends in all this time, or put himselfe in amongst them; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Elders, he gave them prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of speech.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But when he had heard out <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. When <hi>Elihu</hi> saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these threemen, then his wrath was kindled.</note> and saw that those three men were gravelled, and that for all that they had said against him, they were now at last (for want of cleare conviction) faine to leave him as they found him,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:612:108"/>
to wit, a righteous man, and innocent of the hypocrisie and crimes they laid to his charge. He hereupon was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to utter his minde.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And thus at last, <hi>Elihu</hi> the sonne<note place="margin">6. And <hi>Elihu</hi> the son of <hi>Barachel</hi> the <hi>Buzite,</hi> answered, and said, I am young, and yee are very old, wherefore I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</note> of the a foresaid <hi>Barachel</hi> the <hi>Buzite</hi> put forth himselfe to speake as followeth: I am conscious to my selfe of my youth, together with the weaknesses accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, and of your precedencie of age, and the advantages which usually attend it, which did awe me from spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all this while, so that I durst not shew mine opinion in so weighty a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, nor before such grave perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, till that I had heard all that you could say.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For though my youthfull desire<note place="margin">7. I said, daies should speake, and multitude of yeeres should teach wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> prompted me to speake, yet I checked it, and refrained my selfe, giving leave (as was fitting) for those who were my ancients to speake first, who I thought in all probability knew therefore best how wisely to instruct the erring.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But though age hath oddes of<note place="margin">8. But there is a spirit in man: and the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Almighty giveth them understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> youth, yet one man as well as another hath a spirit of understanding, (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and judgement) in him, whereby through supply of speciall inspiration from God that can doe all things, hee may be able to know that which want of yeeres denies him.</p>

               <p n="10">10. My spirit therefore being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired<note place="margin">10. Therefore I said, hearken to me, I also will shew mine opinion.</note> of God, and also stirred up by him to speake, and having noted your errours, notwithstanding your ages, I am bold to take leave to challenge your attentions, till I also give my judgement, and take my turne in this cause.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Know you all, that I have not<note place="margin">11. Behold, I waited for your words; I gave eare to your reasons, whilest you searched out what to say.</note> slept the while I have beene silent, but diligently waited for, and attended to all you said; I seriously considered the reasons and arguments which fell from you, which I perceived all this while to be the best you could invent to evince your adversary.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Yea, I purposely hearkened to<note place="margin">12. Yea, I attended unto you: and behold, there was none of you that convinced <hi>Iob,</hi> or that answered his words:</note> you to have had some convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from you of that you accused <hi>Job,</hi> but the truth is, (for so farre I must

take his part) there is not any one of you, that hath convincingly proved that you alleged against him, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that which hee hath said for himselfe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. God hath given him the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">13. Lest yee should say, Wee have found out Wisedome; God thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth him downe; not man.</note> that you might see the weaknesse of your argument, and not continue confident in your erroneous maxime, as if it were an unerring truth. That <hi>Job</hi> must needs be a wicked hypocrite, because God, who is just and all-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cannot doe wrong, nor mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take as man may, does afflict him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now, as hitherto I have given<note place="margin">14. Now, hee hath not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches.</note> 
                  <hi>Job</hi> no cause by siding with you to say any thing against me, so neither will I now doe it; for I utterly dislike your course, and therefore will neither take up your Theme against him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him for an hypocrite, nor use your argument to prove it, because of Gods afflicting him; for I hold it a meere Sophisme.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They that should have spoken<note place="margin">15. They were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, they answered no more; they left off spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> to <hi>Jobs</hi> reply, fell to wondring at him in stead of convincing him with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and better arguments; for indeed, having no more to say, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give over their feeble reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="16">16. So that when I had waited for<note place="margin">16. When I had wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (for they spake not, but stood still and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered no more.)</note>

their answer as at other times, but heard none from them (for they were all silent and made no reply.)</p>
               <p n="17">17. I was resolved hereupon to take<note place="margin">17. I said, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</note> the matter in hand, to answer <hi>Job</hi> my selfe, and to give mine opinion in the businesse.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For I have much to say, and<note place="margin">18. For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</note> many reasons to urge against him in Gods behalfe, and my mind standeth vehemently to utter them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Yea, I cannot hold, I even swell<note place="margin">19. Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent, it is ready to burst like new bottels.</note> with desire to speake my mind, that <hi>Iob</hi> may be humbled, and God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
               <p n="20">20. I must needs therefore speake<note place="margin">20. I will speake, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> to ease my spirit, yea, I both must, and will make answer for God.</p>

               <p n="22">22. For I am not skilled in the way<note place="margin">22.

               <p n="3">3. And beforehand, I assure thee<note place="margin">3.

For hee will not lay upon man more than right; that he should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into judgement with God.</note> to us, God hath justice on his side; for he will punish no men wrongfully, nor by any unjust dealing will he give him just cause to complaine.</p>

               <p n="27">27. And the cause, no doubt, is this,<note place="margin">27. Because they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe from him, and would not consider any of his waies.</note> for that in the pride of their hearts, which great men are subject to, they

And on the contrary, if he in his just displeasure withhold his favour, who then can change his minde and countenance when hee frownes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be against more or lesse, a single man, or a whole commonwealth?</p>

               <p n="4">4. For I assure thee thus much,<note place="margin">4. For truly, my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</note> That what I urge either for God or against thee, shall not be of mine owne coining, that so thou shouldest taxe it of errour or mistake, but such as God who cannot erre in truth and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (by whose spirit and in whose

               <p n="5">5. Consider therefore, how that<note place="margin">5. Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdome.</note> God is mighty, able to know and doe all things aright, and need not through weaknesse or want of power be driven to use any unrighteous and indirect meanes to compasse his ends; for hee hath power enough to effect them in a justifiable way, and on the other hand, as mighty as hee is, he affects not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, nor sets he so light by any man as to afflict him causelessely of meere pleasure, no, but he is of power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things with justice and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And this he does, as we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">6. Hee preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poore.</note> and experimentally see by his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards both sorts of men, bad and good: For first, if men be wicked, and deserve punishment; God, for want of power and understanding, lets them not goe without it, but they feele and find him both wise, able, and just to give them their demerits, and to right the poore mans wrong.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And so in the next place, if men<note place="margin">7. Hee withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne, yea, hee doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</note> be righteous, God is just, not to forget such, nor is hee deficient in power to reward them, but preferreth them to the highest top of honour, yea, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:612:122"/>
upholds them in happinesse that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder, and in despite of all malignant opposers, they are exalted by him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And if it be otherwaies with them,<note place="margin">8. And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> if they be afflicted, and that pressures be upon them, yet it is not for want of power, wisdome and justice in God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But he shewes them cause for it,<note place="margin">9. Then hee sheweth them their worke, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</note> some one sinne or more wherein they have broken their bounds, and beene too blame, for which he justly afflicts them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And as by his rod he teacheth<note place="margin">10. Hee openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth that they returne from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</note> them to know their sin, and his justice, so also by it he warneth them of, and learneth them their duty, which is not to cample, but humbly to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his command of turning from the iniquity for which they suffer.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And then, if they take out this<note place="margin">11. If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their daies in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and their yeeres in pleasures.</note> lesson, and become obedient to him, the fruit of it will be, That they through the mercy of God, shall be eased of their punishment, and shall spend the remainder of their life, as their hearts can wish, in prosperity and pleasure.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But on the contrary, if they<note place="margin">12. But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</note> stubbornely refuse obedience, then Gods anger shall slay them, and they

               <p n="13">13. So that those that are thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,<note place="margin">13.

               <p n="16">16. Even thus would he have done<note place="margin">16.

               <p n="23">23. Thinke but how unwise thou<note place="margin">23.
