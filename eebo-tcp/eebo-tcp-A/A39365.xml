            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ethinks I heare thee ſay, as I have often heard others upon the like occaſion. What need more Books on this Subject? have not ſuch and ſuch Learned men written on it allready? and does this man think himſelfe wiſer, then any of them? To this I Anſwer, that I conceive the Uſe of ſuch Bookes may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be to make us Know what wee ought to Doe, but to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to Doe according to our Knowledg: to beget in the mind of the Reader New <hi>Acts</hi> of Underſtanding ſuch truths, as he has already Received; that if his former <hi>Notions,</hi> (being Weake, and remiſſe, &amp; ſuddenly broken off by <hi>Vaine thoughts</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi>) have never had any Powerfull, and Effectuall Influence upon his <hi>Will</hi> (to ingage him to a ſtedfaſt <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and Conſtancy of Acting according to thoſe Truthes) his latter may. To ſpeake more cloſely: I ſuppoſe thou mayeſt have read ſeverall Treatiſes on this Subject, which I Treat of in theſe following Leaves Penn'd (it may be) by men of more Learning then I ſhall ever attaine unto, though I ſhould Live more <hi>Luſtres,</hi> then yet I have ſeen Years: and yet 'tis very poſsible that thou mayeſt gain more good to thy Soule by theſe Lines of mine, then ever thou did'ſt by theirs. (Suſpend thy Judgment a little: and doe not preſently paſſe thy Cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as Proud, and ſelfe-conceited) Two Reaſons for this my Opinion (others I have which I ſhall not divulge) are theſe. Firſt, 'Tis very poſſible that when thou readeſt this Diſcourſe thy Mind may be more Diſpoſ'd, &amp; Fitted to receive the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein deliver'd, then it was when thou didſt read the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of other men upon the ſame Subject. Secondly, Through the whole Courſe of the Obſervations I have made (according to the time I have had to Exerciſe my Reaſon) of My ſelfe, and others; I have found that <hi>Practicall</hi> Truthes are more, or leſse <hi>taking</hi> according to the Expreſſions wherein they are ſet

They that read ſuch Diſcourſes, as this, looſely, &amp; curſorily, uſually miſſe of the greateſt part of the Practicall Senſe, &amp; meaning of the Words: which does, as it were, <hi>run beſide,</hi> whilſt they endevour toe faſt to <hi>Poure</hi> it into their minds. Such kind of writings, which are intended for the <hi>Cure</hi> of our Sinfull <hi>Habits,</hi> the <hi>Sores,</hi> and <hi>Ulcers</hi> of the Soule, are not onely to be Read over, but to be Fixt in our <hi>Hearts</hi> by Serious Meditation otherwiſe they will become Uſeleſse unto us, and of none effect: As we are wont not onely to <hi>Lay Plaiſters</hi> to our <hi>Bodily Sores,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Bind</hi> them on, otherwiſe they would ſoone <hi>ſlip off</hi> from the <hi>Places Affected.</hi> If thou beeſt one of thoſe Envious, Malitious, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable men, (whereof the World is ſo full) who hate any one that is not of the ſame <hi>Humour</hi> with themſelves; and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alwaies to brand thoſe with the name of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>Vain-Glorious</hi> Perſons, that venture to be thus <hi>Publick:</hi> I aſſure thee, whoſoever thou art, I am confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t through the Grace of God, that I ſhall not be any otherwiſe Troubled with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of thy ill opinion of me (if it come to my knowledg) then only for this, that thy heart, being by <hi>Prejudice</hi> Hardned againſt me, will be the leſse capable (for thy good) to receive any Impreſſion from what I have written.

(I ſay) true Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> cures a Man of all Spirituall Diſtempers, and gives him Eaſe: frees him from all Anguiſh, and Sorrow, and Tribulation of Mind, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes him with a never failing ſtock of Pleaſure, and Contentment. To be more ſtrict and Logicall; I ſhall lay down the ſenſe of my Doctrine in theſe words: True Faith enables a man to draw, true, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Comfort (ſtrong conſolation) from all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Thoughts: whatſoever a Wiſe man, a Faithfull, ſyncere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> thinkes of, he finds in it cauſe to Rejoice. Whitherſoever His Soule hath occaſion to Goe, (if I may ſo expreſſe my ſelfe) ſhe finds the Way beſet, as it were, with <hi>Beds of Roſes,</hi> very Pleaſant, and Delightſome unto Her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of Solomon, <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109238:6"/>
the Truth of my Doctrine, to ſhew you, that Reſt and quiet of Mind, which a Good man, a True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever continually enjoyes, I ſhall premiſe ſome diſcourſe of that Trouble and anguiſh, wherewith the Minds of Wicked, Unregenerate men are ſo grievouſly afflicted. You will have a more exact apprehenſion of the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the GODLY, when you heare of the <hi>Labours</hi> of the WICKED.</p>

            <p>A wicked man can never have any <hi>peace,</hi> any reſt in his Soule. How can he have <hi>Peace,</hi> who is His own <hi>Enemie.</hi> HIEROCLES ſaies truly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>A Good man is only a Friend to Himſelf.</hi> The Mind of a wicked man is his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: His Thoughts <hi>Gnaw</hi> him, as <hi>wormes the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</hi> Which way ſoever He looks upon himſelfe, he Sees nothing but Griefe and Horror. When He looks back upon his Life Paſt, and conſiders what He hath been, his Conſcience preſently Vexes and <hi>Upbraids</hi> him; ſhewing him the Vanity of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he hath enjoy'd, and the wickedneſſe of the Actions he hath committed. When he conſiders the ſtate and condition he is in at preſent, there ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ariſes in him a great deale of anguiſh and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation of ſpirit from an apprehenſion of the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and diſſatisfaction of all his Enjoyments. When he conſiders what he would be, and ſends out his thoughts in the ſearch of the beſt Means to accompliſh his Deſires, he is miſerably diſtracted, and Divided againſt Himſelfe: his <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109238:7"/>
againſt his <hi>Affections,</hi> or his <hi>Affections</hi> one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another: one while his Luſts, his <hi>vile Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> furiouſly impell him to ſuch and ſuch a Courſe, becauſe tis <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> whilſt his Conſcience deters him from it becauſe 'tis <hi>Wicked.</hi> Another while, having broke the <hi>Bonds</hi> of Conſcience, he is againe <hi>Reſtrain'd</hi> by ſome <hi>Paſſion</hi> (or inordinate Affection) contrary to that by which his Soule was firſt <hi>Mov'd.</hi> Thus how oft does it happen, that a man is vehemently Inclin'd by his ſenſuall <hi>Deſires</hi> to do thoſe things, from which the <hi>Fear</hi> of Shame, or of Temporall Puniſhment &amp;c keeps him back? Thus how oft does it happen, that a man's <hi>Ambition</hi> urges him to thoſe Dangers from which his <hi>Cowardiſe</hi> deters him; or his <hi>Pride</hi> and raſh deſire to be accounted Magnificent, or the like, to thoſe Expences from which his <hi>Covetou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſneſſe</hi> powerfully diſſwades him. This or the like <hi>Diſtraction</hi> and Incompoſedneſſe of Mind is the Lot of all the Wicked: whoſe Miſerable Condition we may in ſhort deſcribe thus. The things which They ſo eagerly purſue and follow after, can never afford them any of that Satisfaction and Contentment, which they expect from them: and they miſſe the greateſt part even of that Outward, <hi>Senſible</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which the Nature of their Enjoyments might afford; by reaſon of that Trouble and <hi>Diſsatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> which they bring to ſome of their Affections, whilſt they Gratifie others; or by reaſon of the Troubles they receive from their Diſpleaſed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109238:7"/>
which, if they cannot Reſtraine Them from <hi>Ruſhing</hi> into SIN, Purſue them (as it were) and Overtake them in the Act, and deprive them of the greateſt part of the Pleaſure of it. I'll appeale to the Heart of any man here, that is Conſcious to himſelfe, that he is to be numbred among the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that he lives in any courſe of Known Sin, gives way to his <hi>Luſts</hi> and ſenſuall Inclinations; I'll Appeale, I ſay, to the Heart of any ſuch man, and be Try'd by Him, whether I do not ſpeak Truth: ſurely he knowes it by Woefull Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Whenever thou haſt Offended Thy GOD, to ſatisfie the Importunity of any of thy Impetuous <hi>Luſts,</hi> hath not thy Conſcience <hi>Dampt</hi> thy <hi>Flaming</hi> Spirit, <hi>Cool'd thy Courage,</hi> (as we uſe to ſpeak) tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee, that thou haſt done <hi>Fooliſhly,</hi> telling thee of HELL and DEATH: and ſo Mixing thy <hi>Wine</hi> with <hi>Wormwood,</hi> turning thy Delight into <hi>Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit.</hi>

            <p>Having thus briefly diſcovered unto you the Black and Diſmall Condition of the Soules of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> which <hi>Sit in Darkneſſe, and in the Shadow of Death</hi>: I ſhall now endeavour to diſcover unto you the Pleaſant and Comfortable Eſtate of thoſe that are truly GODLY, who have the <hi>Day-ſtar ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in their Hearts,</hi> who through <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST, walke in the <hi>Light</hi> of GODS Countenance, enjoy his <hi>Favour,</hi> who is KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, <hi>The Father of Mercies,</hi> and GOD <hi>of all Comfort.</hi> That I may give you a more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109238:8"/>
clear and manifeſt Diſcovery of this Happineſſe of a True CHRISTIAN; I ſhall <hi>Point</hi> (as it were) (as thoſe men uſe to do, that Shew you ſome Excellent <hi>Sight,</hi> to make your Notice the more accurate) at the <hi>Principall Parts</hi> of it, Opening, and Demonſtrating unto you this Propoſition or Doctrine: [True Faith enables a man, &amp;c.] in theſe three <hi>Particulars.</hi> Firſt, True Faith in CHRIST inables a man to draw Comfort
<list>
                  <item>1 From the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of what he hath been, of the Condition he hath formerly been in.</item>
                  <item>2. From the <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of that which He is in at preſent.</item>
                  <item>3. From the <hi>Expectation</hi> of what He may be in for the future.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe Three things, What a man <hi>hath</hi> been, What he <hi>is,</hi> and What he expects <hi>to be,</hi> are the <hi>Principall,</hi> and moſt Uſuall Objects of our Thoughts: therefore if I ſhall be able to ſhew you, how a True, <hi>Faithfull</hi> CHRISTIAN may draw Matter of Comfort from all Theſe, I ſuppoſe, you will eaſily apprehend how He may Comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo in the Notice he takes of other things, as of all the Workes of PROVIDENCE, which he Sees in the Affaires of the World, or the like: therefore I ſhall not extend my Diſcourſe to any of them.</p>
            <p>Each of the <hi>Particulars</hi> which I have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto my ſelfe to be inſiſted upon, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and <hi>Ground-worke</hi> of my Diſcourſe, conſiſts of Two Parts, our <hi>Condition</hi> being Two-fold, viz. of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109238:8"/>
the <hi>Inner,</hi> and <hi>Outward Man</hi>: or (as the common words are) <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Temporall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> At preſent I ſhall ſpeak only of the Temper and Diſpoſition of a CHRISTIANS Spirit in reference to his <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Condition,</hi> Paſt, Preſent, and to Come. As for his <hi>Temporall Condition,</hi> or the Eſtate of his <hi>Outward Man,</hi> I ſhall defer my Diſcourſe of That, 'till ſome other Opportunity.</p>
            <p>The Firſt thing that I am to Shew you is, That a True CHRISTIAN, one that hath taken CHRIST's Yoke upon him &amp;c. can take Comfort, <hi>Find Reſt</hi> unto his Soule, in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Life Paſt, whether it have been <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> or <hi>Holy.</hi> But here probably ſome of you may preſently Object within your ſelves againſt what I ſay, thus: How! Can a True CHRISTIAN take Comfort in the Remembrance of his <hi>Sinfull</hi> Eſtate? why? what then is meant by <hi>Poenitence,</hi> or <hi>Godly Sorrow?</hi> is not that the Sorrow which we conceive by the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of our <hi>Sins?</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this Objection, I doubt not, but (by Gods Aſſiſtance) I ſhall give you a full diſcovery of this Truth; That a CHRISTIAN can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Himſelfe (through the Help of GODS Spirit) even in the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of his <hi>Sinfull</hi> Eſtate. We grant, that when He thinks of His <hi>Sinfull</hi> Eſtate, as <hi>Sinfull,</hi> to wit, as it relates to GOD, as that Courſe of Life, wherein He did ſo often Diſhonour the Name of the GOD that <hi>Made</hi> him; of JESUS, that <hi>Redeem'd</hi> him; and <hi>Griev'd</hi> the HOLY SPIRIT
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109238:9"/>
OF GOD, that Now <hi>Sanctifies</hi> Him: I ſay my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when a CHRISTIAN does <hi>This way</hi> look back upon his <hi>Sinfull</hi> Life, He cannot chuſe through Indignation againſt Himſelfe, but <hi>Rent</hi> his <hi>Heart,</hi> vex his Spirit, cheriſh and foment his own Sorrow, ſaying with <hi>David</hi>: <note n="*" place="margin">Pſa: 38.18.</note> 
               <hi>I will be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> But let us Obſerve, that This kind of <hi>Sorrowing</hi> is but as the <hi>taking of Phyſick,</hi> 'tis not any <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> or Settled Diſtemper of the Soul: I ſay, when We are thus <hi>Prickt</hi> with the Sharp <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of our SINS, we are not <hi>Wounded,</hi> but <hi>Let Blood:</hi> and this Spirituall <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> is that, which <hi>Cures</hi> us of our preſent, and <hi>Prevents</hi> future <hi>Maladies.</hi> To ſpeak more plainly; This <hi>Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> (as the <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor: 7.10.</note> Apoſtle ſaies) <hi>worketh Repentance:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

And thus, My Brethren, though the <hi>Sorrow,</hi> which a True <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a <hi>Faithfull</hi> Servant of the Living GOD, conceives by the Remembrance of his <hi>Sinfull</hi> Life Paſt, be in it ſelfe very <hi>Painfull</hi> and Grievous, yet it worketh for him the greateſt Eaſe and Comfort.

Falſe, Fading, <hi>worldly</hi> Comfort, to <hi>Plant</hi> in it <hi>Ioy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable,</hi> &amp; <hi>The Comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To fix this Truth in your minds, to Confirme you in the Apprehenſion of it, I ſhall recite unto you that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Our SAVIOUR:<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are they that Mourn, for they ſhall be Comforted.</hi> All that I have here ſaid may be briefly ſumm'd up thus: the Thoughts, which a GODLY Man has, in the Remembrance of His <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Eſtate</hi> (though they do not <hi>Directly,</hi> yet they doe) <hi>By Conſequent</hi> Continually Afford Him abundance of <hi>Comfort</hi>: to wit (as in effect I ſaid but now) by Fitting, and Preparing His Heart to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Holy Ghoſt, the only True COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORTER. The more a man <hi>Sorrowes after a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort</hi> (as the <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</note> Apoſtles expreſſion is) the more Entertainment He gives to the <hi>Spirit of</hi> GOD, and receives the more <hi>Comfort</hi> from Him: As often this way, as â CHRISTIANS <hi>Spitits faile</hi> him, GOD gives him a <hi>Cordiall,</hi> to <hi>Revive,</hi> and to <hi>Delight</hi> his Soule.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken of the Temper, and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a CHRISTIANS Spirit in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of His <hi>Sinfull</hi> Eſtate; in relation to GOD, that is, as that Courſe of Life, wherin He did ſo often Diſhonour the Name of the GOD that <hi>Made</hi> Him: &amp;c. I ſhall now ſhew you how His Spirit is Affected, what kind of thoughts He hath, in the Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of it, as it relates to Himſelfe, as an Eſtate of <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of which he is <hi>Eaſ'd,</hi> and of <hi>Danger</hi> which he hath <hi>Eſcaped.</hi> Now my Brethren, that a <hi>Sinfull</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109238:10"/>
Eſtate is Troubleſome, and Unquiet, I have ſhewne you from theſe words, <hi>There is no peace, &amp;c.</hi> that 'tis alſo a <hi>Dangerous</hi> Eſtate, SINNERS being every moment in <hi>Danger of</hi> HEL-FIRE I preſume there is none here but will readily grant: And I ſuppoſe This alſo, That men <hi>Reioyce</hi> in the <hi>Remembrance of</hi> the Troubles, and Dangers, they have Paſt, is ſo Obvious to every ones Apprehenſion, that to goe about accurately, and Logically to Prove unto you, that a CHRISTIAN may draw Comfort, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Rejoying continually from the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of His <hi>Sinfull</hi> Condition, as <hi>Troubleſome,</hi> and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi> would be but to Mis-ſpend ſo much time, being a vaine, and meer <hi>formall</hi> Labour. Therefore I ſhall not Shew you this Truth ſoe, as if you had never Seen it before (if I may ſoe ſpeake) but that you might View it againe, &amp; take more exact No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it: I ſhall ſoe ſpeake of it that I ſhall not ſeem, to Bring the Truth to you, but only, to make you Turne the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>your underſtanding</hi> towards It, being <hi>Habitually</hi> in your minds already, though probably, the greateſt part of you did never in any meaſure ſo firmely Apprehend it, ſo thorowly Thinke of it, as you ought to doe. And here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make a farther digreſſion, to ſpeake a word againſt the Folly of ſome men, who Pretending much to Polite Reaſon, and Learning, account it a vaine thing for Scholars to diſcourſe of ſuch Truthes, as are ſo Commonly Confes'd: As if thoſe <hi>waters of Life,</hi> Spirituall, and Practicall Truthes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109238:10"/>
might not lye many yeares together in a <hi>Carnall mans</hi> Head, thorowly <hi>Frozen</hi> as it were, and uſeleſſe, 'till by the Hearing of ſome more Powerfull, <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> Experimentall Expreſſions of the ſame Truth's, his Affections be ſo <hi>Inflamed,</hi> as to <hi>Thaw,</hi> and diſſolve them (if I may ſo ſpeake) that they may <hi>Flow downe</hi> continually upon the Heart, to Purge and Cleanſe it from all <hi>Filthineſſe,</hi> and Pollution; as that River did <hi>AUGEAS</hi> his Stable. I do not ſpeake This for the Alluſion's ſake, as a <hi>ſtrained conceit,</hi> but as That which I thinke Suitable to the Experimentall <hi>Notions</hi> of GODLY Men.</p>
            <p>And now I come to ſpeake of the <hi>Comfort,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath when He reflects upon His <hi>Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Eſtate,</hi> as Troubleſome and Dangerous: and this I ſhall do as briefly and pithily as I can.</p>
            <p>You know it is a common ſaying: <hi>Feſſum Quies plurimùmjuvat.</hi> What a Comfortable thing is it for one that hath Travelled hard to Repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for one that is Weary to Ly downe, and take his <hi>Reſt?</hi> How doth He Rejoyce, and <hi>Hug himſelfe</hi> (as they ſay) in the Apprehenſion of His <hi>preſent</hi> Health, that hath beene Recovered of a Long, and Grievous Sickneſſe? Why, thus it is with a <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Convert,</hi> when He conſiders his Former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: His thoughts Repreſenting unto him the <hi>Spirituall Evils</hi>: which formerly he Laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and oppoſing them to that <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Pleaſant</hi> Condition, which now He is in, make him the more <hi>Senſible</hi> of it, more to Rejoyce in it. The like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109238:11"/>
we may conceive to be in the Heart of a true Believer, when he Looks back upon the Danger of his <hi>Sinfull</hi> Eſtate. When He conſiders that he was once in the <hi>High-way</hi> to <hi>HELL,</hi> that <hi>Broad Way,</hi> &amp;c. that He was once like to Periſh for ever; His Soule doth <hi>Magnifie the LORD,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit doth rejoyce in God</hi> his <hi>Saviour.</hi> How does He delight himſelfe upon This Conſideration, in <hi>Acting</hi> his <hi>FAITH,</hi> in the Contemplation of <hi>The things that are not ſeen</hi>: HELL which he hath <hi>Eſcaped</hi>; and HEAVEN, which ſhortly He ſhall <hi>Inherit?</hi> through the ſtrong Apprehenſions he hath, that His SINS <hi>are Forgiven</hi> him, &amp;c? With what alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and chearfulneſſe doth He <hi>Embrace</hi> the GOD, that <hi>Loved</hi> Him, the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> that <hi>Cured</hi> Him, the LORD that <hi>Saved</hi> Him? Such as theſe are the uſuall thoughts of one that is truly <hi>Converted,</hi> when he calls to mind the <hi>Sinfulneſſe</hi> of his Life Paſt:</p>

Now GOD is my <hi>Portion:</hi> And what can I Deſire more, having Him who is <hi>All in All?</hi> HIM I doe Enjoy in ſome meaſure Here, and ſhall Enjoy HIM Fully &amp; Perfectly hereafter in HEAVEN. Yea methinkes I am in HEAVEN already: I find My ſelfe Above the <hi>World</hi>: I am Free from thoſe <hi>Earthly</hi> Affections, wherein formerly I Ingaged My Soule.

            <p>And now I am come to this Point: That a <hi>CHRISTIAN</hi> exceedingly Rejoyces in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of His Life Paſt, if he have been <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> from the Wombe, if He have been <hi>Godly</hi> all his Dayes.

            <p>Now come we to ſhew you that a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can take <hi>Comfort</hi> in the apprehenſion of his <hi>Preſent</hi> Condition, as to his <hi>Inward man,</hi> whether he be <hi>Weake,</hi> or <hi>ſtrong</hi> in Faith.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109238:13"/>
grieved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when he reflects upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiders that he does conſider his Spirituall <hi>Weakneſse,</hi> and is thereupon <hi>Applying</hi> himſelfe for help unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Grace is Sufficient</hi> for him, who would ſupport him ſtill, and keep him from <hi>Falling</hi> away totally, and finally, though his Faith ſhould be ten thouſand times <hi>Weaker</hi> then it is; in this he takes <hi>Comfort</hi>: And is ready to ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</note> 
               <hi>Moſt gladly will I glory in my Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the Power of</hi> Chriſt <hi>may reſt upon Me.</hi> Thus a <hi>Chriſtian Comforts</hi> himſelfe even in his <hi>Weake</hi> Faith; not that he is <hi>Weake,</hi> but that <hi>Chriſt's ſtrength is made perfect,</hi> that is, manifeſts its ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and perfection, in his <hi>Weakneſſe:</hi> not, that he is of himſelfe ſo ready to <hi>Fall</hi>: but that through his owne <hi>Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Unſteadineſſe,</hi> he diſcernes the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which he <hi>Stands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us conſider a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſtrong in Faith, in whom there is ſcarce any <hi>Luſt,</hi> that can make the leaſt <hi>reſiſtance</hi> againſt the <hi>Soule,</hi> who can ſay with holy <hi>David,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I am now come to the Second Propoſition, that I intended to Handle in This Diſcourſe: A CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAN takes <hi>Comfort</hi> in the Senſe, &amp; <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Preſent</hi> Condition of His <hi>Outward Man,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Proſperity,</hi> or <hi>Adverſity</hi>: By <hi>Proſperity</hi>

            <p>And now I ſhall ſhew you (by <hi>Gods</hi> aſſiſtance) that a true Faithfull <hi>Chriſtian</hi> takes Comfort alſo in his <hi>Adverſity,</hi> when ever it pleaſes <hi>God</hi> to put him into ſuch a Condition.</p>
            <p>That you may have a more cleare, and diſtinct <hi>Notion</hi> of this Truth, I ſhall ſhew you particularly, what Comfort and Satisfaction he takes in <hi>Poverty, Sickneſſe, Diſgrace,</hi> or the loſſe of his Reputation.

            <p>As for the firſt, the main ground, and principle of that <hi>Comfort,</hi> which a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Heart is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, when he reflects upon his <hi>Poverty,</hi> is, the thought of that ſafety which he enjoyes from thoſe Spirituall <hi>Dangers,</hi> and <hi>Perplexities</hi> which Rich men are <hi>entangled</hi> in, by reaſon of thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Opportunities to enjoy the <hi>Pleaſures of Sin,</hi> and allurements thereunto, which the abundance of their Worldly Poſſeſſions continually preſents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

            <p>I come now to ſhew you, that <hi>Sickneſſe</hi> alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords matter of <hi>Comfort</hi> to any true <hi>Believer</hi>: This truth I might eaſily make appeare unto you many wayes: but (becauſe I ſhall haſten to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein I ſhall ſpend more time, then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) I ſhall onely mention one Reaſon of it. <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> you know, naturally puts a man in mind of <hi>Death</hi>; and what can be more <hi>Comfortable</hi> to a Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> then the thoughts of that?

            <p>And thus I have briefly demonſtrated unto you, that a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Faith is able to extract <hi>Comfort</hi> out of thoſe two things which are ſo terrible to the generality of Men: <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Sickneſſe.</hi> I am now to ſhew you how this <hi>Victorious</hi> Grace, by which we <hi>Overcome</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> ſoftens unto us alſo that other <hi>Hard Thing,</hi>

            <p>The heavyeſt <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> or Infamy, which in this life a Child of <hi>GOD</hi> lyes under, is occaſioned by theſe, or the like meanes: A Report that he hath beene guilty of ſome notorious <hi>Baſeneſſe,</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety: or a <hi>Miſconceit</hi> of his good Actions, which

proceeding from ſuch <hi>Principles,</hi> as Carnall men (who are by farre the greateſt part of the World) are in no wiſe able to Apprehend, cannot but be <hi>Miſconſtrued</hi>: Hence it is that they <hi>Nick-Name</hi> all his Vertues: &amp; endeavour to render him moſt Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Contemptible for thoſe Actions, by which he knows himſelfe chiefly to deſerve Love, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from all thoſe that are truly Noble, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-minded: Thus when a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>Humble,</hi> how do the men of the World miſtake him for a <hi>Sneaking,</hi> mean-ſpirited fellow? when <hi>Magnanimous</hi> for <hi>Proud,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-conceited?</hi> If the Infamy a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſuffers be occaſioned by ſuch a <hi>Report,</hi> as I mentioned but now, if it be true, he <hi>Comforts</hi> himſelfe in it upon this account: that it is unto him a continuall <hi>Memento</hi> to Repent, and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane himſelfe</hi> for the Commiſſion of that Sin; and to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in <hi>GOD,</hi> by whoſe <hi>Spirit</hi> he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that his <hi>Sins are forgiven him</hi>: If the <hi>Report</hi> be falſe, the Abuſed <hi>Chriſtian</hi> greatly Rejoyces in the Thoughts of that <hi>Grace</hi> which <hi>Reſtrained</hi> him from that <hi>Action,</hi> of which hee is ſuppoſed to be <hi>Guilty,</hi> into which, if he had been left to himſelfe, he might have Ruſhed, <note n="*" place="margin">

As for this, I ſay, it is ſo farre from troubling thoſe that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed, that they exceedingly <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in it: Remembring thoſe words

               <hi>Bleſsed are yee when men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evill againſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in Heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> I ſhall now conclude this point: that a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> takes Comfort in the Apprehenſion of his Preſent Eſtate, ſhewing you (to confirme you in the Apprehenſion of this moſt Uſefull Truth) the Generall Cauſe, and <hi>Well-head</hi> of all thoſe ſtreames of Conſolation, which continually flow into his Soule, whenſoever he reflects upon the condition he is in: here it is: he is aſſur'd through <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>The Great GOD,</hi> the Author and Diſpoſer of all things, Loves him, and will love him for ever: and hereupon he aſſumes this confidence, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he is in is that which at This Time is <hi>Beſt</hi> for Him.</p>
            <p>As for the laſt Propoſition that I promiſed to demonſtrate unto you, that a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> through <hi>Faith</hi> takes <hi>Comfort</hi> in the Expectation of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he may be in for the Future: I ſhall not need to ſpend many words on it, it appeares ſo plaine in what hath been already delivered: <hi>Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being a kind of <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> (as I ſaid in the beginning of my Diſcourſe.) All that may be ſaid to manifeſt this truth unto you, may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in thoſe few Lines with which I concluded my former Sermon on this Text:</p>
            <p>True <hi>Faith</hi> Roots all <hi>Feare</hi> out of a <hi>Chriſtians</hi>

            <p>I have now Finiſhed the Doctrine I raiſed from this Text. That <hi>Faith</hi> enables a man to draw Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from all the objects of his Thoughts: Having ſhewne you Particularly, how the <hi>Faithfull</hi> take Comfort in all things that concerne themſelves: from whence (as I ſaid in the beginning of my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sermon) you may eaſily apprehend how they may alſo <hi>Comfort</hi> themſelves in the Notice they take of other things, as of all thoſe <hi>Workes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> which they ſee in the Affaires of the World &amp;c. therefore I ſhall not extend my Diſcourſe to any of them, but proceed to application.

            <p>And now I ſhall ſpeake to you, who are Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to your ſelves, that you have not taken Chriſt's Yoke upon you, that you ſtill Do Wickedly, and Talke Vanity. That the things you have, or aime at, are <hi>Vexation of Spirit,</hi> vaine and Diſſatisfactory, to your Immortall ſoules, ſure I am you will hardly deny. Nay (if you have but an Hiſtoricall Beliefe of the word of God, as I preſume you have) you cannot deny it when ever you reflect on your vain Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and Conſider your Deſignes, meane and Low, being ſuch as Theſe; To make your ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to ſome <hi>Merry Companions,</hi> Such it may be as have acquired, ſome civill Accompliſhments,

and <hi>Humane Learning.</hi>) that you may gaine from them, the Name of <hi>Ingenious Men,</hi> &amp;c. or to <hi>Jeare and Grin</hi> at thoſe, whom you Maligne and Envy or to Drink and <hi>Droll</hi> with your <hi>Cronies:</hi> or (and this you think moſt Prudent and Manly) To Get a great Eſtate in the World, that you may Weare Brave Cloathes, and keep Company with the Beſt (as they ſay) (not to name your more Abominable Intentions, which are themſelves Anxiety, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and the Effects of them Horrour, and Anguiſh) I ſay Sirs when you Conſider the things you enjoy, or Aime at (pittifull meane things at beſt) are you not fill'd with <hi>Vexation of Spirit?</hi> do you not <hi>Abhor,</hi> as it were, and <hi>Loath</hi> your ſelves, for the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Filth</hi> of your SINS, which you reſolve ſtill to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in? Baſe and Degenerate Creatures, who being Made after the <hi>Image</hi> of God, have made your ſelves <hi>Earthly,</hi> and <hi>Senſuall</hi>! Well Sirs, you ſee that Sins are Troubles, and Sinners of all men moſt Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: even whilſt They are in their proper Element; (that I may ſo ſpeak) in this preſent World; but what will become of them (Wretches) when this Life is ended? (and ſure I am our Laſt Houre draws on apace) Could I but expreſſe the thouſandth part of thoſe everlaſting Paines, They ſhall then beginne to Feele (in HELL) it would make the moſt <hi>Stif-necked</hi> Sinner in the world, to <hi>Bow,</hi> if he ſhould Hear mee. Ah! Sirs, is This true indeed, that if you take not CHRISTS Yoke upon you, that is, if you do not ſtrongly and ſincerely Reſolve to <hi>Breake off</hi> from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109238:23"/>
every <hi>Known</hi> Sin: you ſhall never finde any Reſt unto your Soules. You ſhall be Everlaſtingly Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Is this true I ſay, and will ye acknowledg it ſo to be, (as you muſt needs doe, If you have ſo much as an Hiſtoricall Beliefe of the Word of GOD, as I ſaid but now,) And yet not Reſolve no more to Allow your ſelves in any Way of Wickedneſſe, &amp;c. no more to <hi>Deride</hi> thoſe, who having their Hearts poſſeſt with the thoughts of Eternity, can in no wiſe ſuit themſelves to your worldly Converſation: But having once found Reſt in CHRIST; will no more returne to that Labour and Toile, which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men, Continually Undergoe in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of that They call <hi>Happineſse?</hi> Now Sirs if you are no whit <hi>moved</hi> at what hath been ſpoke; but Stick cloſe to your Beloved Sinnes: though our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST (who is <hi>Over all, God bleſſed for ever)</hi> ſo lovingly invites you to <hi>Come over</hi> unto him, aſſuring you that <hi>The waies of wiſdome are waies of pleaſantneſſe and all her paths are peace,</hi> aſſuring you that if you take HIS YOKE up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, it will not <hi>Gall</hi> your Necks, and be Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto you, but onely Reſtraine you (that you may <hi>Find reſt to your Soules)</hi> from <hi>Breaking over</hi> His <hi>Incloſures,</hi> the Bounds of True Reaſon, and Holines, To Follow your Luſts, and exorbitant Affections, If you be not Moved at this, but Stand faſt in the <hi>Way of Sinners,</hi> and will for ever remaine <hi>Lovers of pleaſures more then Lovers of GOD,</hi> of GOD, that made you, of GOD, who for your ſakes ſent his BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVED

ſonne into the world, to be <hi>Mocked, Scourged, Crucified</hi>; AH Srs, If you are not Moved at This, nor ever will be, I muſt tell you in the Name of GOD you ſhall never finde Reſt unto your Soules, you ſhall never Taſt one Dram of True Comfort, &amp; Sweetneſſe of <hi>Spirit</hi> all your dayes; And when your <hi>Dayes on the Earth</hi> which (as David ſaith) are <hi>as a Shadow,</hi> ſhall <hi>Vaniſh away,</hi> you ſhall Certainely be Tormented with the Devill and his Angells; Yea, perhaps within a Weeke or two (for how many Young Men have your ſelves knowne in this place, that have beene Healthy, and Dead within the compaſſe of far leſſe Time then that) I ſay Srs, within a Weeke or two, you may be ſeized on, by ſome Diſeaſe or other, the <hi>Small Pox</hi>: or a <hi>Feaver,</hi> or a Surfeite, or the like, and be Cutt off from the <hi>Land of the Living,</hi> and be <hi>turned into Hell,</hi> Conſider this you that forget God: you that talke vanity. But now if any of you finde your ſelves Moved, at what you have Heard; (and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men are you if you doe not,) if you finde your Hard Hearts in the leaſt meaſure <hi>Softened,</hi> I beſeech you Srs, for your Soules ſakes for the GOD OF LOVES ſake, Pray earneſtly that the LORD would Perfect the Good worke He hath Begunne in you, that he would Continually <hi>Warme</hi> and <hi>Soften</hi> you, and <hi>Supple</hi> your hearts with the BLOOD OF IESVS CHRIST, that they may be <hi>Pliable</hi> to his will in All things, (to ſpeake more plainely) that Hee would make you ſo Tenderly and Affectionately to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
