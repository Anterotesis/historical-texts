            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT being the general Temper of Mankind to call any thing by an odious Name which themselves dislike, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Humour of the Times to call eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing Popery which comes cross to their Interest, I cannot expect my present Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, whose Zeal (as will appear by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal of this Treatise) carries him much farther than his Reason, should be exempt from a Failing so Epidemical, and withal so Necessary for his Purpose. For nothing more easily solves all Arguments, or more readily Answers any Book with the Vulgar than this short Method; Inure them to a hideous apprehension of Popery, then call any Production by <hi>that</hi> Name, and all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:52024:3"/>
Confute is needless. With the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> I say; for I shall presume that whoever reads this Treatise will judge it Incredible Dr. <hi>T.</hi> should hereafter attempt to write to such as are truly <hi>Learned,</hi> till he thinks fit to settle and pursue some Conclusive Method of Discoursing; which I am sure he <hi>will</hi> not, because his Cause will not bear it. I am to expect then from the Disingenuity of my Opposers, that this Piece will be branded for <hi>Popery,</hi> thence the publishing it made an <hi>Insolence,</hi> and (to lay on more load) strain'd to an Immodest Abuse of the late Merciful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>
            <p>I am forc'd therefore to stop the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the very Entrance, and to declare to him before-hand, that in perusing this Treatise he shall find that the Points at present maintained by me are onely these, That <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and the <hi>Tenet of a Deity</hi> are <hi>Absolutely Certain.</hi> If this be Popery, all the Sober and Well-meaning Protestants, Presbyterians, and almost all <hi>England,</hi> nay all True Christians are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; for not one of them who uses or
<pb facs="tcp:52024:3"/>
discourses of the word [FAITH] but r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in his natural thoughts (unless bad Speculation have corrupted Nature) this hearty conceit of it, that 'tis <hi>absolutely Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be all a Ly for any thing any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knows</hi>; and abhor the contrary Tenet; that is, they are all on my side. If then Dr. <hi>T.</hi> does not in discoursing here the Grounds of Faith, sustain this contrary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and so violate the Nature of Faith, I have at present no quarrel with him, but he a very grievous one with me for wronging him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I must acknowledge I owe him Satisfaction as publick as the Injury. If he does, all Protestants, Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have the same Quarrel with him I have, and so ought to joyn with <hi>me</hi> against <hi>him</hi>; and he will owe Satisfaction to them all, as well as to Catholicks, for corrupting the Nature of <hi>Faith</hi> (which we all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge necessary to Salvation) into <hi>Opinion,</hi> and so quite enervating its force and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence towards bringing Souls to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as will be shewn hereafter.</p>
            <p>I could alledge, to justifie my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at present, the earnest and daring
<pb facs="tcp:52024:4"/>
provocations of Dr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Friend, publickly in their late Books; also that this Treatise was near Printed ere His Majesties Gracious Declaration was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. But I shall make use of no other Justification but the nature of my Cause, which is the Common Concern of all good Christians, and can never be unseasonable to defend, or be offensive to any who is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily a Friend to Christianity, to see it defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And, if any Clamours be rais'd against me for so doing, 'tis abundantly satisfactory to me that the World before-hand under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands how worthy the Cause is for the maintaining of which I suffer this reproach.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Know not to whom all Attempts to advance Truth in any kind can more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long than to You, to whom Knowledge gives Ability to discern; the profest study of Truth, Candour and Sincerity to own <hi>what</hi> You discern, and both together a perfect Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be Iudges in Affairs of this Nature. The Enemies to Learning are Ignorance, and
<pb facs="tcp:52024:5"/>
Passion; and I take you to be as much above the later, as the World will witness you are free from all suspicion of the former. I have great reason to believe I am not mistaken in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I make of You, and that few Nations can produce an equal number of Men so Acute to discover the Truth, so Wise to judge of it, and (speaking generally) so Unbyass'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. This consideration gives me a high esteem for your Authority, and that Esteem the Confidence to make choice of You for my Umpires. The wise Iustice of this Nation has provided that all differences betwixt contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties be try'd by their <hi>Peers;</hi> and though your dissenting from me, in some particular Points, might possibly cause Iealousie in one who was not well assured of his own Cause or your Integrity; yet the Interests of <hi>Learning</hi> are common to us both, and of the Right or Injury done to That, you are the <hi>Best,</hi> and peradventure <hi>Onely</hi> Iudges, and for that Point I confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeal to You.</p>
            <p>Having made my Address, give me leave in the next place to declare my Case.</p>
            <p>I had observed with much grief the Swarms of new Sects (not to mention the declining of many good Wits towards Atheism) which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="tcp:52024:5"/>
our Country, and looking into the Causes of such sad Effects, it needed no great reach to discover, that the Fancies of men being both by Nature and Circumstances fram'd to great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, it could not be expected but they should take their several Plies, and sway mens Thoughts and Actions accordingly, unless some Principle, Evident, in a manner, to <hi>all,</hi> should oblige the Judgment of the Wiser (at least) to adhere una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously to the <hi>same</hi> Profession of Faith, and satisfie by Motives within their own ken, and even forestall, by the way of Nature, the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular deviations to which weaker Fancies must of necessity be subject. Nor could I, nor indeed can any man think, but that as GOD, the Author of every perfect Gift, settled Faith most firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at first in the hearts of the Primitive Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by Evident Miracles, so he intended, and ordered, as far as was on <hi>His</hi> part, that it should continue all along the <hi>same;</hi> or, that his Church should persevere in Unity of Faith; and, consequently, that he settled <hi>such</hi> a Rule to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the knowledge of it to us, as was of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture able to establish it, and satisfie, according to their several capacities, both the Wise and the Unwise. Whence necessarily follows that all division about Faith is to be refunded into the
<pb facs="tcp:52024:6"/>
faulty unwariness of men who deflect from that Rule, not into want of fore-sight in the All-wise Founder of the Church, in leaving us such a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> as should set us all on wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, instead of keeping us at Unity. These considerations discover'd to me that I could not bestow my pains better on any subject than in making known what was the Right Rule of Faith; and evidencing, to men Capable of Evidence, out of the Nature of the Thing in hand, that It had indeed the qualities proper to a Rule of Faith, that is, Virtue or Power to acquaint us that live now (without the least danger of Errour) what Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles taught at first.</p>
            <p>To this end, I shew'd first in <hi>Sure-footing</hi> that the <hi>Letter of Scripture</hi> had <hi>not</hi> this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and by consequence could not be the Rule intended and left us by Christ. Many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I us'd from p. <hi>1.</hi> to p. <hi>41.</hi> though these two short Discourses are sufficient to evince the point to any who is not before-hand resolv'd he will not be convinc'd. First, that, that can never be a Rule or Way to Faith, which many follow to their power, yet are misled, and this in most Fundamental Points; as we experience in the <hi>Socinians</hi> and others. For <hi>I</hi> see not how it
<pb facs="tcp:52024:6"/>
can consist with Charity, or even with Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to think that none amongst the <hi>Socinians</hi> or other erring Sects endeavour to find out the true sence of Scripture as far as they are able, nor how it can be made out that all, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either wilfully or negligently pervert it; and yet, unless it be shewn rational to believe this it can never be rational to believe that the Letter of Scripture, as useful and as excellent as it is in other respects, is the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> for, if They be not all wanting to themselves and their Rule, 'tis unavoidable that their Rule is wanting to them. Next, They who affirm the Letter is the Rule, must either say that the <hi>bare</hi> Letter as it lies, <hi>antecedently to</hi> and <hi>abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from</hi> all Interpretation whatsoever, is the Rule; and this cannot be with any sence maintained, for so God must be held to have Hands, Feet, Passions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or else, that the Letter alone is not sufficient to give as Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods sence in <hi>Dogmatical Points</hi> of high concern, as the Trinity, Incarnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Assistance of <hi>some</hi> Interpretation; and, to say this, is to say as expresly as can be said, that the Letter of Scripture <hi>alone</hi> is not the Rule of Faith, since it gives not the Certain Sence of Christ without that Interpretation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned:
<pb facs="tcp:52024:7"/>
Nay more, since 'tis the nature of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> to give the <hi>Sence</hi> of words, and the nature of the Rule of Faith to give us the <hi>Sence</hi> of Christ, this Interpretation manifestly is the Rule of Faith, and the Revelation to us who live now, of what is Christs Doctrine. I know it is sometimes said that the Letter may be interpreted by it self, a clear place affording light to one more obscure: but, taking the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Antecedent to <hi>all</hi> Interpretation, as in this case it ought, I can see no reason for this Pretence. For let us take two such places, <hi>e. g. It repented God that he had made man,</hi> and, <hi>God is not as man that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> abstract from all interpretation, and let him tell me that can of the two places taken alone, which is the <hi>clear,</hi> and which is the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi> one. Atheists will be apt to take such pretences to reject the Scripture, and impiously accuse it of Contradiction; but how that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod can assist a sincere man, who hopes by the <hi>meer</hi> Letter to find his Faith, and hinder the Obscure place from darkning the Clear place, as much as the Clear one enlightens the Obscure one, I understand not. In fine, It exposes a man to the Scandal and Temptation of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no Truth in Scripture, but Absolute
<pb facs="tcp:52024:7"/>
assurance of Truth it gives no man. Besides, the former of the Reasons Lately given returns again: For the <hi>Socinians</hi> compare place to place as well as others; other Sects do so too, and yet all err, and some in most fundamental Points. Wherefore it must be either presum'd they <hi>all</hi> err <hi>wilfully,</hi> or the Way cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed a <hi>Right</hi> Way. Farther, it may be ask'd when one pitches upon a determinate sence of any place beyond what the Letter inforces, by what light he guides himself in that determination; and then shewn that that Light, whatever it is, and not the Letter, is indeed the Formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer or Rule of Faith. Much more might be said on this occasion, but my business now is to state my Case, not to plead it.</p>
            <p>The Letter Rule secluded, I advanc'd to prove that <hi>Tradition,</hi> or that Body call'd the <hi>Church,</hi> which Christ by himself and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles constituted, taken as <hi>delivering</hi> her thoughts by a constant Tenor of <hi>living Voice</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> visible to the whole World, is the absolutely-certain way of conveying down the Doctrine taught at first, from Age to Age, nay Year to Year, and so to our time; which is in other Terms to say, that Pastors, and Fathers, and the conversant Faithful, by discoursing,
<pb facs="tcp:52024:8"/>
preaching, teaching, and catechising, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and practising, could from the very first, and so all along, better and more certainly make their thoughts or Christs Doctrine be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by those whom they instruct, than a Book which lies before them, and cannot accommodate it self to the arising Difficulties of the Reader. I am not here to repeat my Reasons, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in my Book which I called <hi>Sure footing in Christianity.</hi> And because I observ'd our improving Age had in this last half Century exceedingly ripen'd, and advanc'd in manly Reason, straining towards Perfect Satisfaction, and unwillingly resting on any thing in which appear'd a possibility to be otherwise; or, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the same in other words, bent their thoughts and hopeful endeavours to perfect Science; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in that Treatise rigorously to pursue the way of Science, both in disproving the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Rule, and proving the Living Rule of Faith: beginning with some plain Attributes belonging to the natures of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and building my whole discourse upon them, with care not to swerve from them in the least. And being conscious to my self that I had, as I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do, closely held to the natures of the Things in hand, I had good reason to hold my first five
<pb facs="tcp:52024:8"/>
Discourses <hi>demonstrative,</hi> which is all I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have done, as appears p. <hi>57,</hi> and <hi>58.</hi> the rest that follow'd being added <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and exprest by me <hi>An endeavour to demonstrate,</hi> as by the Titles of the Sixth and Eighth Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is manifest, though I do not perceive by the opposition of my Answerers why I should not have better thoughts of them than at first I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>This is the matter of Fact concerning that Book, as far as it related to me, and a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why I writ on that Subject, and in that manner: What thoughts I had of its usefulness, and hopes it might prove serviceable towards composing the differences in Religion, of which the World has so long complained, though from the long and deep meditation I must necessarily have made upon those Principles, I may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be judg'd to see farther into them, and know better whether they will carry, than those who look not so well thorow them; yet it being an universal Temptation to flatter our selves with our own Productions, I think best to omit. I am next to declare what reception it found in the World. Men are subject to several Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Learned Men not exempt from the weaknesses of Humanity. Candour and Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
<pb facs="tcp:52024:9"/>
divide Mankind: Some are fixt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Reason, and whenever that appears, whether Conformable or Opposite to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Perswasions, they always follow It, striving to accommodate their Iudgments to Reason, not Reason to their Iudgments, and resolute to be of the party of Reason, of whatever party Reason be. Others are so fixt to their Perswasions that they can hardly be induced to believe what is Contrary to Themselves can be Agreeable to Reason, and will sooner believe Reason not to be Reason, than their own thoughts not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. This crosness of nature is heightned by the unhappy circumstances of our Country, where the mixture of several Opinions, so strangely blended together, breeds a great partiality to those Perswasions which Men have taken up, and renders Reason less welcom and less effectual. My Book it seems, as it needs must, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with some of this Spirit, and immediately a loud noise was made against it, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of it to a Great Magistrate, as of a most pernicious Treatise. He believing his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, testify'd much resentment, and exprest an intention of much severity against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; first Banishment, then Imprisonment in that Banishment, and the liberty of ever wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:52024:9"/>
more to be debarr'd in that Imprisonment, for so far the Instigators prest it. And this was the <hi>First</hi> attempt to answer the Book, and I must confess a very strong one, and which oblig'd me to a very secret retirement. But it happened that a Person of Quality who had read the Book, gave a character of it that it was a serious Piece, that it took the way of sober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and was far from the Information he had received of it, leaving one with him for his own perusal. From which time <hi>I</hi> heard no more of his resentment. I conceive it was not thought honourable to employ Authority against that which bore a semblance of Reason, and permit Power to be abus'd in defence of other mens heats, and possibly the less, where there was found a loyal deferrence to the State, p. <hi>73.</hi> and elsewhere. Whatever the reasons were, the Threats were chang'd into a desire of a solid and home Answer, and this he recommended and prest often and earnestly. Hereupon five choice Persons whom I could name, met con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly on <hi>Mundays</hi> (as I was inform'd) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and consider of it; which being all men of Parts and Business, was found to be the day of greatest leisure.</p>
            <p>Mean time I became acquainted with several
<pb facs="tcp:52024:10"/>
Excellent Wits, to whose Civility I am as much obliged as I was satisfied of their Parts; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with Mr. <hi>Felton</hi> of <hi>Gonvil</hi> and <hi>Caies</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in whom (not to speak of others) I found such a concourse of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Endowments, that I cannot but lament the loss of him as a great loss to Learning and the Nation; his Temper was sweet and friendly, his Discourse calm and unpassionate, his Wit acute and throughly penetrative, his Iudgment, by attending heedfully to Principles, solid and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his Expression clear and natural; and to all this he joyn'd a Sincerity and Candour which none could see without Esteem. From him I receiv'd some Objections to my Book, of a strain far beyond what has since appeared; wherefore finding in him Ability to say all that could be said, and yet so much Candour as not to say what was not to purpose, I earnestly courted him by Letters to undertake the Answer, that the World might have the satisfaction of seeing the Truth impartially try'd, and my self secur'd from the fear of indirect dealing, and all pass without bitterness, and as a Great Man would have it, with the sweetness of Love-Letters. His modesty refus'd at first; yet second thoughts prevail'd with him. But Providence over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd
<pb facs="tcp:52024:10"/>
my Hopes and Expectations of so learned and fair an Adversary, and to the grief of all that knew him, and the value due to learned Worth, particularly mine, took him soon after away; though, if I be rightly informed, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had preach'd at St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s of the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty of Tradition, and ordered his Executors to burn all his Papers; among which I conceive were those against me.</p>
            <p>Being thus defeated of my best hopes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Iunto of Five, <hi>I</hi> began to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if <hi>I</hi> could by any means contribute to their Endeavours, and provide that the World might reap the benefit of a solid Satisfaction from our common labours. Wherefore I writ and printed a little Piece which <hi>I</hi> intitled, <hi>A Letter from the Author of Sure-footing to his Answerer;</hi> not out of vain glory to boast my self Author of that Book, as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> whose zealous Nature and Education, inclining him still to unhandsome misconstructions, puts upon me; but because, not knowing yet the Persons name, <hi>I</hi> could onely call him by <hi>the Answerer of Sure-footing,</hi> and so was to express my self by the opposite Relation <hi>I</hi> had to him as such. This Letter was full of Civility to the Protestant Party, though <hi>I</hi> said no more than <hi>I</hi> truly meant, and unoffensive to
<pb facs="tcp:52024:11"/>
any. The sum of it was to desire that we might not abuse the World and our selves by Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not pertinent, but closely pursue the Point in hand in a method which might be truly Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and Satisfactory; and if he lik'd not the way which <hi>I</hi> had proposed, <hi>I</hi> humbly requested he would assign any other, with which, provided he would shew it was Conclusive, I should be content. <hi>I</hi> heard some Queries were to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently propos'd to me, either in Writing or in Print; but instead, as <hi>I</hi> conceive, thereof, a personal Conference was desired with Dr. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotson,</hi> and another worthy Gentleman; to which <hi>I</hi> consented readily, and when we met, discoursed freely, little suspecting the Return would prove so unsuitable to my open plainness. The next News <hi>I</hi> heard was the Answer it self, which came forth under the name of Dr. <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> who whether he foresaw the unlucky success of a Rigorous Method, or that his <hi>Genius</hi> lay more for smart Irony than blunt Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for whatever reason, He rejects the Method <hi>I</hi> had propos'd, and establishes no other instead of it, not assigning any reason why he did so, but that he had <hi>the same liberty to manage his Answer, which I had assum'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Laws to it;</hi> whereas I had beforehand
<pb facs="tcp:52024:11"/>
               <hi>disclaimed</hi> any authority of <hi>prescribing,</hi> and onely shew'd that Reason and the Satisfaction of the World requir'd it. Much Wit there was in his Book, and much Art, and much good Language, but so little to the purpose, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not but suspect, as he handled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his purpose was not to speak to purpose. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally he neglects the import of my Discourse, and picks out here and there something from its fellows, perverts and makes it fit to be laugh'd at, and then laughs exquisitely at it. As if <hi>any degree of wit will not serve to abuse and find fault, and a little wit furnish a man for Satyr,</hi> as he has since taught the World him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Serm.</hi> p. <hi>123.</hi> 'Tis common with him to deny the Conclusion, and alledge some pretty plausible thing against It, and never take notice of the Premises, or attempt the Proof on which 'tis built; a method against which <hi>Euclid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has said nothing strong enough to be secure. Neer three parts of his Book impose wrong Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets on me, changing constantly my Sence, and sometimes my Words: And, whereas in things subject to Reason no Scholar is bound to defend more than himself maintains, He often puts me to defend the Reasonings of <hi>other men.</hi> As for Omissions and dextrous waving the
<pb facs="tcp:52024:12"/>
Principal Difficulty, they are endless; And these and some other Prevarications of the like strain, are the Ingredients of that highly-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Book. The rest of its commendations are a delicate Style, a fair Print, and good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; whereof as the two last are of credit with the Vulgar, so I wonder to see the number of those who are carried away with the first. Yet it suits well with a prudential pitch, and such who are not much used to the strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; especially being accompanied with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being truly victorious over counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Tenets; for in truth what he sets up most artificially, he pulls down most irrecoverably.</p>
            <p>I was griev'd to see my well-meaning, and the pains I had taken for the benefit of my Country, so crosly checkt, and the more, to perceive by the loud applause given to such a Piece, that the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness whether of humour or faction, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more numerous or more active than the sincerity of those who meant well. I thought fit to give a stop to this wild carreer of Passion and Partiality, and not being then in circumstances to make a full answer, principally for want of health, which was then so bad that I thought I should soon have ended this Dispute with my Life, I cursorily noted some few of its defects
<pb facs="tcp:52024:12"/>
in a little Treatise, which, as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had advis'd me, <hi>I</hi> call'd a <hi>Letter of Thanks.</hi> In that I laid open in some signal passages of universal concern that he quite mistook the question, and so insincerely mis-represented in a manner the Whole, that his much-applauded Endeavours were indeed no better than a <hi>well-worded Prevarication;</hi> and in short, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing in several particulars I made good that charge of divers faults which I have here laid against his Book. And being then in the heat of my first Resentments, and not judging it due to him who had provok'd me without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to conceal or diminish the faults of his Writing, I could not restrain the inclination of my <hi>Genius,</hi> which leads me to shew little respect to Those who shew none for Truth, but call'd his faults by their own <hi>course</hi> though <hi>true</hi> names. But <hi>I</hi> had soon occasion to be sorry my nature was not fram'd to more wariness. For letting my Book alone, an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> was us'd, of a temper much stronger than those which are forg'd in the Schools. <hi>I</hi> know not by what suggestions, but <hi>I</hi> know without other demerit more than I have here express'd, an Order was procur'd by his best Friends to seiz upon my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and my Friends were inform'd by some
<pb facs="tcp:52024:13"/>
Great Men, that if I were apprehended it was not possible to save my life. To inforce this Project, besides divers extravagant Calumnies, Information was given to Magistrates making me Guilty of doing more <hi>Good</hi> than it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most possible any one single man should <hi>commit.</hi> I cannot accuse Dr. <hi>T.</hi> of having a particular hand in this unhandsome malice; onely I can with truth aver, that the laying open in my <hi>Letter of Thanks</hi> his Faults as a Writer, was (as appears by the circumstance) the immediate occasion of it; and that about that time I was told by an honest Protestant who convers'd with all three, that he judg'd in his conscience D.<hi>W.</hi> was civiler than to take such ungentile ways, and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> soberer or warier, but that I should have a care of Dr. <hi>T.</hi> for it was easie to discern by his words that, if it lay in his power to ruine me, he would do it. To the belief of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation his known <hi>Genius</hi> and Humour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes too much; which is (poor man!) to be a great Papist-hater; so that had <hi>Rome</hi> but one Neck, I know no man living more fit to be the Executioner and strike a speeding blow.</p>
            <p>Against this Storm I had no shelter but a lurking hole; into which <hi>I</hi> retir'd the second time, and plac'd stricter Centinels of Care upon
<pb facs="tcp:52024:13"/>
my Security. In this Confinement <hi>I</hi> began to write a very particular Answer to Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Book; intending when the conjuncture was more sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and my ability sufficient, to publish it. But no favourable <hi>Crisis</hi> of this <hi>Morbus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> appear'd. Time had not its usual influence upon Spirits implacably exulcerated, and the motion continued very violent, though the first Impulse were long past. When my Person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not, my Friends were found out, and a Family with which 'twas suspected I conversed, design'd for ruine: So exemplary virtuous and in all respects worthy, that should <hi>I</hi> speak what I know, I might perhaps be thought to flatter. Against these, while the rest of the Nation sat quiet in the undisturbed comfort of the general Mercy, the severity of the Law was prosecuted, and urged almost to the extremity before they could find out the reason of the partiality us'd to them, for they were very far from giving particular offence. At last, upon strict inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they found that all this Anger sprung from my being seen at their House, though that was both a very little space, and long before; and that the same was intended against all who should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me.</p>
            <p>The apprehension of the like inconvenience
<pb facs="tcp:52024:14"/>
drove me from the circumstances in which I was, and which were all my Livelihood, nor could <hi>I</hi> easily find admittance any where. I understood this to signifie <hi>I</hi> was to be aw'd, at least by the apprehension of my Friends danger, if <hi>I</hi> were more careless of my self, from printing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>I</hi> had promised, was preparing, and was expected. However, <hi>I</hi> proceeded in it, though <hi>I</hi> must confess <hi>I</hi> found the Task sufficiently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome. For there being few passages in which my sence was not voluntarily perverted, and not one in which the nature of the thing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate was rightly stated, and solidly prosecuted, my business still was by frequent repetition of my own words to set the discourse right again, which had been so industriously disordered: An employment which how wearisom and distasteful it is, those know who have been condemn'd to the like drudgery. My Papers were grown pretty bulky, when divers of my most Iudicious Friends, solicitous of my Safety, dealt earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me to surcease. They alledged that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate Examiners might easily discover, by what had been done already, how frivolous and insignificant the whole way was which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary took, and that another and more convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Reply might possibly heighten the anger to
<pb facs="tcp:52024:14"/>
fatal extremities. That if <hi>I</hi> were less sensible of my own safety, <hi>I</hi> should yet have regard to my Friends and all Catholicks; that it was to be feared that an exception against a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person, might in that Iuncture be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanc'd to a Crime of the Whole, and the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the humour or interest of that implacable Party, raise the storm of the <hi>Great Diana of the Ephesians,</hi> and give the Gospel-Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters occasion to sound out aloud <hi>Papa ad Portas.</hi> To this was joyned (for why should I be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to acknowledge my Poverty, into which that Persecution had driven me?) that <hi>I</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more then I was able to print. In fine, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reason, and Necessity prevail'd with me, and I forbore to finish what <hi>I</hi> had begun, and to publish what <hi>I</hi> had finish'd. But yet the desire <hi>I</hi> had to be instrumental in settling so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Truth, suggested to me a middle way, which, as I hoped, would be incapable to be wrested into offence, so <hi>I</hi> saw plainly would be much more beneficial to the world, and to the Learned more satisfactory.</p>
            <p>I had observ'd in the Sermon which Dr. <hi>T.</hi> call'd the <hi>Wisdom of being Religious,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession which amounted to this, that the very Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of a <hi>Deity</hi> might possibly be false. I saw
<pb facs="tcp:52024:15"/>
the same sence often imply'd in his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and p. <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8.</hi> plainly own'd. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and knew all men of insight must needs perceive with me, that, as this was the onely material, so 'twas a full Answer to my Book; and rendred the disquisition whether <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> be the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> very superfluous, if it might be maintained It had <hi>no Rule</hi> at all, nor was <hi>capable</hi> of any. For a <hi>Rule</hi> (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>Intellectual</hi> Rule as both of us do) being a means to make us <hi>certainly</hi> know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be a <hi>Truth,</hi> He who says that thing <hi>may possibly be false,</hi> or <hi>not</hi> be a Truth, says it neither <hi>has</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> have any Rule. <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved therefore to write a Treatise in behalf of <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in common, in which <hi>I</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to demonstrate from all Heads I could invent that the Generality of Christians, or those who rely <hi>on the common Motives left by God to the Church</hi> (as <hi>I</hi> exprest my self in my <hi>Introduction</hi>) the assent called <hi>[Faith]</hi> must be <hi>Impossible to be False</hi> or Erroneous. And applying this to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Adherents, who as <hi>I</hi> shew'd from his own words, granted his Assent built on that which he esteems his onely Rule of Faith, <hi>possible to be false,</hi> I concluded them beyond all possibility
<pb facs="tcp:52024:15"/>
of evasion not to have <hi>true Faith,</hi> nor be <hi>truly Faithful.</hi> And this <hi>I</hi> conceive was to <hi>follow on my blow,</hi> as I had promised; it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable how the Controversie could be prest more home, than to conclude my Adversary and his whole Cause from the very <hi>An Est</hi> of Faith, the Subject of our Dispute; nor how his whole Book, which he calls the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> can be more fundamentally overthrown than by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his own words and the Nature of the Thing, that his mis-called Faith has <hi>no</hi> Rule at all, nor <hi>can</hi> have <hi>any.</hi> I conceiv'd too that this was to make good the engagement into which I had enter'd, <hi>to force them either to lay Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which would bear the Test, or let all the world see they had none.</hi> For, in case they did manifest their Faith <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> they must of necessity build it upon such Grounds as would sustain such a Building; if they did <hi>not,</hi> the World must needs judge by their silence that they had <hi>none,</hi> and that they knew and confest they could not evidence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves truly Faithful and right Christians. <hi>I</hi> saw besides that this method permitted me to pursue a rational close way of Discourse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continual interruption which the insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my Adversaries mistakes must needs
<pb facs="tcp:52024:16"/>
occasion; which, as it was more satisfactory to me, and more creditable to my Cause, so I judg'd it more beneficial to the intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for a particular Answer must of necessity be made up for the greatest part of accusations, where the Answerer thinks it his best play to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake</hi> all along, instead of direct confuting: I cannot say I am in the <hi>right,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> must say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that who says otherwise is in the <hi>wrong,</hi> and that he either <hi>misunderstands</hi> or <hi>misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents,</hi> and this either <hi>ignorantly</hi> or <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;</hi> to show which is a task no more pleasant to the Reader than the Writer, People being of opinion, and I think they have great reason, that the time and pains spent in such wranglings might with much more advantage be employ'd in convincing the Truth in question. Lastly, my aim was from the beginning to bring Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies to a Conclusion, in order to which I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a <hi>Conclusive Method;</hi> my Adversary neither accepted of mine, nor proposed any other of his own, as I had desired; And I saw that by proceeding with him in his talking fashion, the Point might come to be lost in a Wilderness of Unconnected Words: Wherefore I judg'd it better to pursue my design more closely, and by the bare stating the Nature of Christian
<pb facs="tcp:52024:16"/>
Faith, to reduce all Disputes to this short Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, Either produce and vouch such Grounds for your Faith as are <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> or 'tis evident you have <hi>none.</hi> It seemed by the Event the way I took was not ill chosen. Dr. <hi>T.</hi> being still able to boast his Book was not particularly answer'd, and so uphold his Credit with those who look not deeply into Things, seem'd by his silence well-appay'd; and I heard of no more extraordinary Anger against me; And for my part I was contented that superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al People should judge as their wit serv'd them; it being abundant satisfaction to my Labours that Intelligent and Insighted Persons might perceive by them how matters stood, and into how narrow a compass Controversie was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And of this I have ample experience from the most Iudicious of our Nation, who unanimously assur'd me that it was impossible to carry things farther, or bring Controversie to a shorter Method, since now the whole Cause depended upon one single Proposition, by the sole examination of which it was to be decided.</p>
            <p>Thus stood the Controversie, and thus for some years it rested. For the future I intended when it might be seasonable to write onely such Grounds as I judged might be a solid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:52024:17"/>
for <hi>Union,</hi> which as I have always look'd upon as the <hi>best</hi> of Works, so I know 'tis Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, till order be first taken to secure the Absolute and Immoveable Certainty of Faith it self, which <hi>I</hi> think is not otherwise to be done, then by shewing <hi>how</hi> and <hi>which way</hi> it comes to be Certain.</p>
            <p>In this Calm I heard several reports that the two Doctors wondred at my silence, which they interpreted weakness, and despair of an Unmain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable Cause; and that I might not pretend want of means for my disability, some of their Friends offered to get any thing printed which should concern either of them. But <hi>I</hi> was not stirred, till a Gentleman of Quality and Worth, who, for his friendship, as <hi>I</hi> conceive, to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> believ'd his Book truly unanswerable, offer'd a Friend of mine to prevail with him to get Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for me to print an Answer, if I would or could make any. So fair an invitation mov'd me to accept of it, and <hi>I</hi> sollicited, with as much earnestness as I could, the performance. But the Gentleman it seems mistook the Doctors Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as much as his Book, for his Credit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd not. All seem'd bush'd and quiet, when Dr. <hi>St.</hi> publishes a private Paper writ two years and an half before, with a Reply swell'd into a
<pb facs="tcp:52024:17"/>
large Book, intitled, <hi>A Discourse concerning the Idolatry,</hi> &amp;c. In the Preface to which, and elsewhere, he insults over my silence, which he calls <hi>leaving my poor Demonstrations alone to defend themselves,</hi> and with keen Ironies upbraids my pretence to <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> which in his language is but <hi>Canting.</hi> Of all things in the world <hi>I</hi> should not have expected such an Objection from a Scholar. For, certainly, whoever writes on a serious subject so as to confess he has <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi> what he maintains, is an impudent Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler; and how to <hi>Conclude</hi> without <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Demonstration,</hi> is a thing not known to any Logick which has hitherto appear'd in the World. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would deserve wonderfully of Learning and the World, if he would please to teach us this admirable new Logick of <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> without <hi>demonstrating,</hi> and <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> without <hi>Principles,</hi> for in the dull way of Learning hitherto in use, 'tis so far from shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Scholar to own he has <hi>demonstrated</hi> what he pretends should be <hi>assented</hi> to, that 'tis unpardonably shameful to pretend another mans assent to that which he does not pretend and judge to have <hi>demonstrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> had not time to settle the thoughts which
<pb facs="tcp:52024:18"/>
these and the like passages stirr'd up, when <hi>I</hi> met with the <hi>Preface to Dr.</hi> T<hi>'s Sermons,</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particularly to me, and meant, as far as I can guess, for an Answer to two or three Books. <hi>I</hi> must confess the bitter smartness <hi>I</hi> found there, and the piquant upbraiding me with deserting the defence of <hi>Sure-footing</hi> (though all men that car'd to consider any thing, saw <hi>I</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy writ two Books in defence of it) stirred me sufficiently; but <hi>I</hi> know not whether all this provoking Raillery would have prevail'd with me to Answer particularly, if I had not thought they would not have urged me so pressingly, if their Friends had not indeed desired <hi>I</hi> should write, and that certainly I should not offend sober Men of what Perswasion soever, by doing onely what themselves so prest. Warier People have indeed suggested to me that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Adversaries are suspicious, and the more because of the <hi>Time</hi> they had both chosen, since they could not but fore-see mine and others Answers would in likelihood come out about the time when the Parliament was designed to sit, which might be look'd upon as a proper season to inflame the minds of such as were apt to believe them, and stir up a new Persecution by making those Answers which themselves had so provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly
<pb facs="tcp:52024:18"/>
and peremptorily prest for, an argument of the <hi>Insolency</hi> of Papists, and the growth of Popery. At least <hi>I</hi> see there can be no greater security for one in my circumstances, than to mean uprightly; and I hope every Body will see by my long silence I have used all the caution <hi>I</hi> can not to give just cause of offence, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that 'tis none to write, vvhen <hi>I</hi> am pressingly and publickly solicited, and this with no other design than to contribute, if I can, to the long desired happiness of bringing Disputes and Disagreements in Religion to a period. If this be <hi>Insolence</hi> or Crime, I think there is no honest man in this Nation or World who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Once more then I take my Pen in hand, with this promise to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Friend, that if it be not stopt again by their indirect proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (as I have reason to judge the Printing of this has been already by the diligent Searching for it) they shall have no reason to complain of any Arrears of mine.</p>
            <p>But what needs any Apologizing at present to prevent a sinister character of my Writing. The Point in hand now is neither the defending any Tenet of Protestant or Presbyterian on Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s side, nor the impugning them, on mine. The main business controverted between him
<pb facs="tcp:52024:19"/>
and me at present, is, whether Faith be <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely-Certain,</hi> or rather (as he calls it) onely <hi>Morally</hi> such. In which Point I doubt not but to have all unprejudic'd conscientious men of both those Parties now nam'd <hi>on my side,</hi> and <hi>against Him.</hi> There is creeping into tho World insensibly, and Scepticism is now hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, a Sect more dangerous than any that has hitherto dissented from the Church in particular points: They go as yet under the name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> because they profess <hi>many</hi> perhaps <hi>most</hi> Points of Christianity, but yet, if we may trust their own Expressions so as thence to frame a Iudgment of them, have notwithstanding no Faith at all, or no hearty firm immoveable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to those Points, or any of them, as Certain Truths, but onely a dwindling Apprehension, or at most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a good lusty <hi>Hope</hi> that by the grace of GOD they <hi>are True,</hi> or at least <hi>may be True.</hi> Now these men, on the one side owning no Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible or Absolutely-Certain Authority, so to preserve the Nature of Faith inviolate, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the weakness of their Speculation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, to protect it from Possibility of being an Errour; on the other side, relying either on some Authority <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> Fallible, that is, which they see may perhaps be <hi>actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52024:19"/>
in all it proposes, or else on their own Speculation and Wit, whether exercis'd in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from things, or in interpreting Scriptures Letter; and withal being men of some parts, and so, seeing it impossible to make out that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those Reasons are Conclusive or Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or that their Interpretation of Scriptures Letter is not possibly a Mistake; hence they are forc'd to confess in equivalent Terms, <hi>all Christian Faith may possibly be a Ly;</hi> though they express it warily and craftily, because they see the nature of <hi>Faith</hi> in the conceit of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality who use that word, and the whole <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of Christianity is opposite to their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that point. Nature therefore stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against them, necessitates them (contrary perhaps to their intention, taking them in other circumstances) to pursue indirect ways; and so at unawares, though certainly not without some mixture of carelesness and precipitant passion, to undermine the solid Foundation of Faith. The means by which they work this mischief, is, First, to laugh at Principles and Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is at <hi>all absolutely-Certain Grounds</hi> and <hi>Conclusions;</hi> which if they can bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to disgrace and contempt (as they hope they may because such reflexions are unusual and unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:52024:20"/>
to the Fancies of the Generality) they see plainly their work is done, and that all <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> which stands against them because they can with no show of Reason pretend to it, must be quite overthrown. The next way they take, is, to abuse with Ironies any man who offers or attempts to settle Faith on immovably Certain Grounds, as <hi>Confident Swaggering men,</hi> or vapouring Dogmatists; as if it were such a piece of <hi>Confidence</hi> to say and go about to maintain, that <hi>Christian Faith cannot possibly be a lying Imposture,</hi> or that <hi>God cannot deceive us in the Grounds he has laid for his Church to embrace Faith.</hi> A third means they use, is, to abuse and baffle the nature of <hi>True Certainty,</hi> by clapping to it the Epithet of <hi>Moral,</hi> and then proposing that to the World, dilating upon it, and fitting it to Faith as well as they are able; which conception being suitable to the Fancies even of the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi> they hope it will take with those who reflect not that the <hi>Basis</hi> of Mankind's Salvation must be incomparably more secure than that which we usually have for the attainment of a Bag of Money, a Place at Court, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and such like trivial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Fourthly, they avoid by all means
<pb facs="tcp:52024:20"/>
looking narrowly into the Natures of <hi>Faith, Truth, Assent, Demonstration, Principles,</hi> or shewing the <hi>necessity of Consequence</hi> for any thing they produce, and above all <hi>settling</hi> themselves, or <hi>yielding</hi> to any <hi>Conclusive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> of Discoursing propos'd by others, or any other things equivalent to these; and in their stead they are given to talk much of <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Fair Proofs, Great Likelihoods, More Credible Opinions, Prudential Reasons,</hi> or such as are <hi>fit to satisfie prudent men in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs,</hi> of <hi>not-doubting, seeing no just cause of doubt,</hi> and such-like bashful and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expressions, which they dress up plausibly, and talk prettily, and doubt not but by this means to find Understandings enow so shallow as to admire their superficial gayness. This is the Character of this dangerous Sect, of which what opinion we are to have, or by what name to to <hi>call</hi> them, this short Discourse will inform us.</p>
            <p>If we know any thing of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or have any notion of what is meant by that word, 'tis questionless <hi>this,</hi> that 'tis <hi>a means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bliss or Heaven by;</hi> nor does any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doubt but that it performs this by raising us to a vigorous <hi>Hope</hi> of it as a thing attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb facs="tcp:52024:21"/>
and to an ardent and over powering <hi>Love</hi> of it, in Christian Language call'd <hi>Charity,</hi> as also that both these excellent Virtues are built upon the <hi>Basis</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> this being as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, the <hi>substance of things to be hoped for, the Argument</hi> (that is, the Conviction) <hi>of things unseen:</hi> Again, common Reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that the <hi>Assent</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> depends on its <hi>Grounds;</hi> and consequently cannot be stronger than <hi>They</hi> are. These things under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, let us consider how Impossible 'tis that any one should have an efficacious <hi>Hope</hi> and a <hi>Love</hi> of Heaven, while he judges himself capable to understand all the Grounds of it as to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet sees they may be all False, and consequently that perhaps there is no such thing as this thing call'd Heaven. Can any one that is not Frantick, connaturally <hi>hope for</hi> and <hi>love effectually</hi> a thing which he sees perhaps <hi>is not,</hi> or has not absolute Certainty of its <hi>Existence</hi>? A Merchant hopes and desires Wealth from the <hi>Indies,</hi> but then he holds it absolutely True, that there is in Nature such a Thing as <hi>Wealth,</hi> and that it is not a <hi>Chimera,</hi> else he were mad ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hope or desire it: and stark mad to love it <hi>above all things,</hi> (as we must do Heaven) even above the dearest Goods he at present sees,
<pb facs="tcp:52024:21"/>
experiences, possesses and actually enjoys. Wherefore, (to omit diverse Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd for this point in <hi>Faith vindicated,</hi> from p. <hi>144.</hi> to p. <hi>164.</hi>) 'tis concluded that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any Grounds for Faith, but what we see are <hi>onely-morally Certain,</hi> that is, <hi>possible to be false,</hi> is unable to breed that disposition in the Soul as fits it for Heaven, and so (as far as is on its part) destroys the nature of <hi>Christianity,</hi> (or the means to carry Souls to Heaven) in those men who see that what they are to love above all things is perhaps a <hi>Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> wherefore, being by this means <hi>destitute</hi> of the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> they are concluded (taking them precisely as holding this Tenet of Faiths possible Falsehood) to be in reality <hi>no Christians,</hi> though they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess <hi>all</hi> the points of Faith that <hi>are.</hi> How Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks that Speculate amiss, become not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this Note, I have shown in <hi>Faith Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> p. <hi>129, 130.</hi> and elsewhere in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Treatise.</p>
            <p>If these men then be not <hi>indeed</hi> or in <hi>True</hi> Speech, <hi>Christians,</hi> what must we call them? <hi>Seekers!</hi> No: For these, though they judge they have <hi>not yet</hi> found out certainly what is <hi>Truth,</hi> yet they hold <hi>'tis to be found,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:52024:22"/>
thence continue to enquire after it: Whereas these men are doubly Irrational; First in rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>satisfied</hi> when as they <hi>see</hi> they <hi>have not yet</hi> found out certainly that what they hold to is Truth; and, which is much worse, equivalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say that it <hi>cannot</hi> be found out to be Truth, by saying <hi>the nature of the thing cannot bear it.</hi> Atheists or Iews they are not, because they <hi>deny not</hi> the Tenet of a Deity, or Christianity, though they do not hold them absolutely Certain. Nor yet are they, taken under this notion, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> For those deny still <hi>some point</hi> of Faith or <hi>other;</hi> whereas these men may <hi>deny none,</hi> but hold <hi>all,</hi> and yet be what they are; their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour consisting in a wrong apprehension concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grounds or Certainty of Faith, which renders <hi>all</hi> the Points of Faith <hi>Ineffectual</hi> for for what they were intended. Whence the malice of this Tenet is something <hi>above</hi> that of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as not destroying some one or a few Points, but quite enervating all Faith. Nor yet are they <hi>meer Scepticks</hi> in Religion, or hovering indifferently between the opposite sides of the Contradiction; but they <hi>bend strongly</hi> towards <hi>thinking</hi> it True. They are therefore certain <hi>Incliners</hi> to Christianity, or <hi>Deemers</hi> that 'tis True; and, not of the <hi>[FAITHFUL]</hi> that is,
<pb facs="tcp:52024:22"/>
               <hi>Holders</hi> of a Deity or Christs-Doctrine, but rather of the <hi>[HOPEFUL.]</hi> For, whereas Faith being a firm Belief or Assent that Christs Doctrine is True, and so settles the existence of of it (and particularly of a Heaven) in our minds antecedently to <hi>Hope</hi> of attaining Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, these men substitute <hi>Hope</hi> to <hi>Faith,</hi> and onely <hi>Hope</hi> those Points <hi>are true,</hi> or in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <hi>may be true:</hi> Whence, though this be a good name (I must not say to <hi>Christen</hi> them, but) to <hi>call</hi> them by, yet perhaps their own dear word <hi>Moral</hi> will best suit with their <hi>Genius;</hi> and so we may call them <hi>Moral Christians;</hi> which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet being opposite to <hi>Absolute,</hi> signifies they are <hi>not absolutely</hi> Christians; and since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is <hi>indeed that</hi> which 'tis not <hi>absolutely,</hi> it's true sence is, that they are indeed <hi>no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi> yet since they like the word <hi>[Moral]</hi> so extremely well when they are to express the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> due to <hi>Faith,</hi> 'tis but fitting they should wear it when we express them as <hi>Faithful.</hi> Though then <hi>[The Hopeful]</hi> seems very well to represent their humour, yet 'tis but fitting they should have the Priviledge of naming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and <hi>Moral Christians</hi> let them be.</p>
            <p>Against these <hi>Moral Christians,</hi> and Them onely, I discourse in this present Treatise. But
<pb facs="tcp:52024:23"/>
what have I to do with the <hi>Persons</hi>? I doubt not, but Gods Goodness (the Method of whose Gracious Providence is to support the Failings of his Creatures as far as the Natures of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Things and the Order of the World will permit) very often supplies the Defects of Mens Speculations with Connatural ways of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, fixing them thus in a strong Adherence to the most Concerning Truths, by ways which even their unreflecting selves are not aware of: Whence, I am the farthest from judging any Mans Person perhaps of any living, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all I can to retain a Charitable Opinion even of Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Personal Intentions in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and excuse him diverse times in this very Treatise where I write against him, as far as Evidence of the contrary will give me leave. 'Tis this wicked <hi>Tenet</hi> then (and It <hi>onely</hi>) which I combat at present, and which I see plainly so unsettles, unhinges, and renders use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and ineffectual all Christianity, that I ought to declare an utter and irreconcileable Enmity against It; and that I shall, through GOD's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, prosecute it home to the very doors of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> (the Bane of all <hi>Humane Science</hi> as well as <hi>Faith</hi>) in whose gloomy Grott, situate in the Confines of dark Ignorance, (Mankind's
<pb facs="tcp:52024:23"/>
Natural Hell) they first saw the <hi>twilight,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed were <hi>born blind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet it cannot be expected that, declaring, as I do, a just Indignation against this wicked Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, I should treat a Writer favourably, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>precisely</hi> as a Maintainer of it; or bear my self respectfully to those insincere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> which he makes use of to abet <hi>It,</hi> and prejudice the Sacred Truth it opposes; whether those ways be <hi>Sophisms</hi> in Reasoning, or else <hi>Scurrility</hi> supplying the place of Reason, the main Engine employ'd in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. I shall then take a <hi>little</hi> of that <hi>much</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he uses, to give them the Entertainment and Return due in Iustice to their Demerits. Yet, that I may avoid all just occasion of offence, I shall endeavour for the most part to use his <hi>own words,</hi> (omitting still the rudest) hoping he will have less Reason to be angry at his own Eccho; since if he had not <hi>Originiz'd</hi> it, it had not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected.</hi> And if he assum'd to himself the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>abound</hi> so with <hi>Irony,</hi> and wholly <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> speaking to my <hi>Reasons,</hi> of which (whatever they be) none can deny but that I use to have good store in my Writings; I hope it will not be indecent if now and then <hi>I</hi> speak to those plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Ironies themselves,</hi> there being nothing else
<pb facs="tcp:52024:24"/>
to refute; otherwise, since according to Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Method of Disputing, these are my <hi>onely</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers, and full of Brag and Triumph, he and his Friends would most certainly have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as they did formerly on the like occasion, that Inability to reply had caus'd my desistance. I come then to examine this spruce <hi>Preface;</hi> in doing which, I must be forc'd to lay open at large his knack of answering Books, that so I may have just Title to make some Requests to You our Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, in behalf of the Rights proper to <hi>Learning:</hi> Declaring before-hand, that where-ever I am large in any Discourse becoming a <hi>Scholar,</hi> 'tis not a <hi>Duty</hi> paid to his <hi>Preface,</hi> which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a show of solid <hi>Scholarship</hi> in it, but a <hi>Respect</hi> due to You, our Learned Iudges, to whom I <hi>Appeal.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§ 1. HIs Preface begins (p. 3.) with two Charges, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>I still persist to maintain after so fair an Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that first and self evident Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are fit to be demonstrated</hi>; to which he addes a Third, that I make <hi>Identical Propositions</hi> to be <hi>First Principles</hi> in the matter under dispute. He argues too against the two former imaginary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions of mine (which in this Preface is a rare thing) thus, p. 37. <hi>There can be nothing to make First Principles more Evident, because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before them to demonstrate them by.</hi> And I acknowledge the reason given to be as victorious as any passage in his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> where he has

            <p n="3">§. 3. But what <hi>I</hi> most complain of, because (which I am loth to say) it argues a perfect wilfulness of Insincerity, is this; that after I had in my <hi>Letter of Thanks</hi> p. 10. offered my Proof that First Principles were Identical Propositions, and could be no other; Also after that p. 24, 25. I had shown that things <hi>practically self-evident</hi> may be <hi>demonstrated,</hi> and produc'd divers instances, as that the vulgar know the Diameter of the Square is a nearer way than to go by the two sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that things seen afar off are not so little as they seem, which yet Mathematicians demonstrate, and none apprehends them to do a needless action: Dr. <hi>T.</hi> not so much as attempts to answer either my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or my Reasons, but perfectly conceals them from his Reader, and bears himself all along tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly, as if I had produc'd none at all, barely says over again his own raw sayings a little more merrily, and there's an end. I beseech you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, would this be held a competent Answer in the University-Schools; First, to admonish the Defendant to relinquish his Conclusion instead of beating him from it by Reason; then to combat the <hi>Conclusion</hi> instead of invalidating the Premises on which 'tis built; next to pick a word or two out of those Conclusions which taken alone alter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52024:28"/>
their whole sence, and then confute onely that new sence his designed alteration had given them; and lastly, when he was told of it, his mistakes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, Reasons and Instances brought to make good the <hi>true</hi> point, to neglect them all, say over again barely what he had said before, break a jest or two upon a ridiculous point meerly invented by himself, and then cry victory! Certainly, though such performances may serve a <hi>Prevaricator</hi> or a <hi>Terrae Filius,</hi> yet some wiser kinde of return ought in reason to be expected from a Scholar and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man.</p>
            <p>As for that point which he most confutes with laughter, viz. That First Principles are Identical Propositions, though something has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in my Letter of Thanks in the place cited, and not yet answered, and so no farther proof is due or needful; yet because the clearing this point fundamentally conduces to settle the way to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, therefore for their sakes who are truly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and aim at solid improvement of their minds by <hi>exact knowledge,</hi> more than at pleasing their ears by <hi>pretty expressions, I</hi> shall treat the point more accurately. The stating the nature of First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples must needs be Speculative, therefore those Readers who pretend not to Science may please to pass over these two Discourses, and go on to what follows: though I shall endeavour as well as the matter will bear, to deliver it so, that a good natural Wit may in great part comprehend it.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> Shewing by Reason that every First Principle is an Identical Proposition.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe great Architect of the Universe knew in Himself, or saw clearly and distinctly in his own Divine Understanding, what he intended to make, and this to the least thing in Nature, as is granted by all who hold such a Soveraign Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Also, there being nothing able to check or cross his omnipotent Efficiency, we cannot doubt but they flow'd from that First Source of all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Being without any Errour, Mistake, or (as we may say) monstrous Abortion, but perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjusted and proportion'd according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of Being, to the <hi>Idea</hi>'s in the Divine Understanding of their Creator. Hence each of them gain an <hi>Establishment</hi> in their Peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or the respective Portions of Being assign'd them, (or rather which they essentially <hi>are</hi>) and a kind of participated Immutability and Eternity by their Conformity, Proportion or Essential Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those Divine Ideas. Wherefore since all our Knowledge is either taken from the Things, or else proportion'd to them; also since there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor can be any consideration in things so primary, so fundamental or immoveably grounded as is this, 'tis manifest that the First, most firm and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52024:29"/>
most deeply grounded Truth which can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or spoken of any thing, is, that 'tis <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht</hi> thus <hi>immutably</hi> in its proper Nature by this Soveraign Relation to what's essentially Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Wherefore, if the First Principles of all, must be the most Primary, most Fundamental, and most immoveably-grounded Truths of all other, 'tis most evidently concluded that the very First Principles can be no other but those Propositions which express the <hi>establishment</hi> of Things in their very natures, or their <hi>being what they are,</hi> which can no <hi>other way</hi> be exprest but by <hi>Identical Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Also, a Definition being granted by all the learned world a chief Instrument to Science; if any thing could maintain a competition with Identical Propositions to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he very first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, certainly <hi>Definitions,</hi> of all other, seem to have the best claim. But what I contend is, that there is some consideration taken from things an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to their Definitions, <hi>viz.</hi> their Capable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Possibility of being defin'd; Common sence teaching us that the <hi>Power</hi> to be such, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally goes before <hi>Actually</hi> being such. To declare this, I desire the nature of a Definition may be look'd into, which is to assign by way of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the certain <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> of such a Nature, that so way may be made to Science: But in case the Thing could bear two disparate Definitions, first a Contradiction would follow, for neither of these two imagin'd Definitions would be in reality any at all, since neither of them would <hi>describe</hi> the <hi>certain limits</hi> of that nature; Next if the Thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52024:29"/>
could bear more Definitions than one, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser about it would be never the nearer to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but in a perfect Confusion; now consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>thus,</hi> now <hi>not thus,</hi> but <hi>otherwise</hi>; so that no Discourse could proceed for want of a steady <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> to ground it, and make its several parts center in one point, or tend to one end. Wherefore the Thing must be antecedently establish'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to bear more Definitions than one, else no right Definition could be made of it, nor any thing be <hi>known</hi> concerning it: Now that which establishes the Thing in an Impossibility to bear but <hi>one</hi> true Definition, is its <hi>Metaphysical Verity</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> or its <hi>being what it is</hi>; which frees its nature from <hi>Chimericalness</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> in its self, whence it becomes intelligible, or capable to be known, exprest, <hi>defin'd,</hi> and discours'd of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Things <hi>being what it is,</hi> is that which not onely Grounds all <hi>Definitions,</hi> but even all <hi>Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of defining; and this it participates (as was said) from its Essential Relation and Dependance on the Immutable Ideas or Forms in his Divine Understanding who is Unchangeable Truth it self. 'Tis concluded therefore that <hi>Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> which express a Things <hi>being what it is,</hi> are antecedent in priority of nature to Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and consequently the very <hi>bottom Principles</hi> of all Science. Nay Definitions themselves, which all the world admits for Principles of our Discourses about the thing defined, are in reality nothing else, setting apart the manner of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but Identical Propositions; for 'tis the self-same
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52024:30"/>
sence to say, <hi>A Man is a Rational Creature,</hi> as to say, <hi>A Man is a Man</hi>; nor were the Definition as it should be, if it were not Identical in sence. So that, if he quarrel with First Principles for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Identical, or for having a Subject and Predicate which are of the same notion, and not for being <hi>worded</hi> alike (the reason of which shall be given anon) he must deny the use of Definitions too, and by so doing oppose all the learned men in the world.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Thus far Metaphysicks. Let us see next what Logick says to the Point. To <hi>Conclude,</hi> is to show evidently that <hi>two notions</hi> we call the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and <hi>Predicate</hi> are identify'd or truly conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in that Proposition we call the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> To do this, we find a <hi>Third</hi> notion call'd a <hi>Middle Term,</hi> to be identify'd with those two in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, whence we infer them to be the same with one another, and consequently assert the Truth of the Conclusion. But, how shall we know that third notion to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uly connected with those two others; that is, how shall we know the <hi>Major and Minor</hi> Propositions to be true? By finding (if they need proof) another <hi>Medium</hi> connected with the two Terms found in each of <hi>Them.</hi> And how far must this go on? Endlesly, or no? If endlesly, then, since every <hi>following</hi> Connexion is proved by some <hi>foregoing</hi> ones, in case we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to see some <hi>First</hi> Connexion (or <hi>First Principle</hi>) we could conclude or evidence nothing. And how must we evidence the Connexion of the Terms (or of the Subject and Predicate) in these
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52024:30"/>
First Principles? By another Antecedent Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of their Terms with a Third? No: for these are suppos'd the <hi>First</hi> Connexions: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since they cannot be evidenc'd by any thing <hi>out of themselves,</hi> and yet must be evident, else no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be evidenc'd by them, it follows that they must be evident <hi>of themselves,</hi> or <hi>self-evident.</hi> And in what consists this <hi>self-evidence?</hi> Manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, that no <hi>Middle Term</hi> can come between the notions of their Subject and Predicate; which devolves finally into this, that the Subject and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate are the self-same notion, or that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is <hi>Identical</hi>: and this not onely <hi>materially,</hi> or found in the same Thing, for so are the Terms of every Remote Conclusion if it be True; but <hi>Formally</hi>; and this either simply in notion onely, as are the Definition and the Thing defin'd; or else most formally and in expression also, as in those I alledg'd.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Again, we experience that the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate notions, if they in the least differ, (such are, Proper Causes and Effects) can be connected with the Subject to which they belong in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of a Syllogism, that is, they can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or admit of Proof: Wherefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since 'tis a contradiction to say that the Prime Verities can admit Proof, their Terms must be <hi>farthest</hi> from having any Middle Term coming between them that is imaginable, that is, must be of the <hi>self-same notion</hi>; and so they must be Identical Propositions. The former of these Discourses was put down by me (<hi>Letter of Thanks</hi> p. 10, 11, 12.) which one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52024:31"/>
would think it became a Logician to speak to. But my Adversary is of another metal, not the very same but near akin to <hi>aes sonans aut cymbalum tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens:</hi> He never meddles willingly with Premisses or Proofs, but denies the Conclusion stoutly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acknowledging what was said in its behalf, and tinkles a little Rhetorick against it; which done, (who would think it?) immediately, as with some Charm, the Terms unconnect of themselves, and miraculously fly asunder; and though before it look'd like good honest Reason, yet by his giving it a <hi>Disguise</hi> instead of a <hi>Confute,</hi> 'tis turn'd perfect Nonsence. But to return to our Argument.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Logick tells us moreover, that (whatever accidental considerations may enhance Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) 'tis agreed by all that a Contradiction is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and intrinsecally the greatest or <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Falshoods</hi>; also that a Contradiction is An <hi>affirming</hi> and <hi>denying</hi> the <hi>same of the same according to all the same respects</hi>; wherefore the <hi>very First Principles</hi> being the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Truths,</hi> ought to be diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally opposite to Those, that is, <hi>an Affirming</hi> (or denying) <hi>the same of the same according to all the same respects,</hi> which is impossible to be exprest but by an Identical Proposition.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Add that, since Contradiction is <hi>Faulty,</hi> and all Fault is a Privation of the opposite Good which it violates, it follows that a Contradiction were innocent did it not violate some opposite Truth: Since then the Light of Nature teaches every Reflecter that 'tis impossible to assign any Truth <hi>Opposite</hi> to a <hi>Contradiction</hi> but an <hi>Identical
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52024:31"/>
Proposition,</hi> it follows that <hi>First Truths</hi> or <hi>First Principles</hi> must be <hi>Identical Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. To explain this better, we shall find by reflexion that two Contradictory Propositions are comprisable into <hi>One</hi> equivalent to both, whose Subject and Predicate contradict one another, as [<hi>Peter here and now runs, Peter here and now runs not</hi>] are necessarily equivalent to this, [<hi>What here and now runs, here and now runs not.</hi>] So likewise [<hi>Scripture's Letter is a Rule, Scripture's Letter is not a Rule</hi>] is equivalent to this [<hi>Something which is a Rule, is not a Rule</hi>] and so of the rest. By which 'tis easie to discern how clear a Truth it is, that Identical Propositions are the proper oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites to Contradictions, or the Truths they direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately violate, and consequently. <hi>First Principles</hi>: Since 'tis impossible mans wit rack'd to its utmost can invent any Opposite to [<hi>What runs, runs not</hi>] but [<hi>What runs, runs</hi>] or to [<hi>What is a Rule, is not a Rule</hi>] but [<hi>What is a Rule, is a Rule.</hi>] Lastly, The nature of Contradiction in common puts a thing to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>not be</hi> at once, and consequently puts this Proposition, [<hi>What is not, is</hi>] to which the onely opposite Truth is, [<hi>What is, is</hi>] which is therefore the First Standard of all Truth, and all other <hi>First Principles,</hi> as [<hi>A Rule is a Rule, A Man a Man,</hi> &amp;c.] are but particulars subsuming under it, and partaking in the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner of its clearest Light.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. Farther, 'tis observable that the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Terms of a Proposition are from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Identity, the less evident they are, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52024:32"/>
more proof they require; as also that they still grow nearer and nearer to evidence, according to the degree of their approach toward the said Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. Wherefore, since all Approach of distant things, if pursu'd, ends in a conjoyning and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the same; 'tis manifest that all distance in notion amongst Terms, ends in their being the <hi>same</hi> in notion, that is, in an Identical Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; as also that such Propositions are for the reason given the most evident that may be; and so in both regards the very First Principles.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. Farther, All Propositions which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>proof,</hi> or all <hi>Conclusions,</hi> must have their Terms <hi>materially</hi> Identical; that is, what corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponds to both their notions must be found in the <hi>same Thing,</hi> else they could not be True, nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be proved: wherefore the Terms in First Principles must be <hi>formally</hi> such, nay the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally that is possible; but nothing is or can be more formally Identical than to have the Predicate and Subject every way the same; such therefore the very First Principles ought necessarily to be.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. There is also in Logick a way of arguing by bringing one to an Absurdity or Contradiction. And this is performed two manner of ways. One, by forcing the Defendant to contradict himself; The other, by obliging him to contradict the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Subject in question. The former of these is available as an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi>; but the latter attempt, if brought to effect, is a perfect Conquest: And why, but because it puts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52024:32"/>
the Defendant to violate the nature of the Thing under debate; that is, to thwart this First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>The same is the same with it self</hi>: for example, to make Quantity <hi>not to be</hi> Quantity, a Rule <hi>not to be</hi> a Rule, Faith <hi>not to be</hi> Faith, as shall be shewn hereafter more clearly, when we come to see the use of the First Principles in particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. Moreover, if it be well examin'd, 'twill be found that all Efficiency and Passiveness, that is, all kind of Operation, is nothing but the <hi>existence</hi> of such a Nature exerting or (as it were) <hi>imprinting</hi> it self upon the <hi>Subject</hi> in which it works its Effect: For example, when a Brass Seal makes an Impression upon soft Wax, no account can be given of this Effect (abstracting from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is caus'd by a Nature superiour to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) but onely this, that the Agent is of such a degree of Density or Hardness, as, if mov'd or apply'd to that matter, is apt to alter the figure of its parts according to its own mould; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of such a yielding nature in comparison of the other, as to receive its Impression; and yet not to that degree Rare, as to lose it again by the Action of the common Causes in Nature, till some more particular Agent comes to efface it. 'Tis manifest then, that all Causality essentially depends on, and is finally resolv'd into this Truth, that Things are <hi>such as they are,</hi> which is <hi>their being</hi> (in part) <hi>what they are.</hi> All knowledge then of Cause and Effect, and consequently all Demonstration is ultimately refunded, that is, primarily built on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52024:33"/>

            <p n="12">§. 12. Lastly, He who is Essential Wisdom and Truth it self, has propos'd to us an Identical Proposition in those words [<hi>I am what I am</hi>] which is the First Increated Truth, as 'tis the first Created one, or the First Principle in discoursing about Creatures as to their Natures or Ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nces, that <hi>Every Thing is what it is</hi>; which is therefore True because <hi>God</hi> is what <hi>He</hi> is, or because <hi>Self-existence is Self-existence,</hi> as was explicated above, §. 1. &amp; 2. which <hi>I</hi> hope Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Goodness will so much prevail above his Ignorance as not to judge <hi>ridiculous,</hi> whatever he thinks of the first Created Truths which immediately depend on the Other.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. But why must First Principles be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily exprest with that most perfectly-formal Identity? Or the Subject and Predicate be put in the self-same words? Is it not enough the <hi>Sence</hi> be the same, as is found in Definitions, but the <hi>Words</hi> must be the same also? Which bears a show of <hi>ridiculousness,</hi> and seems to admit of no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of advance towards new Knowledges? Why cannot then the Definition serve to principle all our Discourses about the Thing defin'd, without recurring to such Propositions as appear little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t and insignificant as to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> answer: The Objection, in great part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what Use can be made of First Principles; which shall be spoken to in the next Discourse. But that Definitions are not the very Prime Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52024:33"/>
of all, appears evidently already; because those Propositions which express the Things Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility to be defin'd, must necessarily antecede the Definition.</p>
            <p>And the same will be farther clear'd by these following Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Definitions are often liable to dispute, but Identical Propositions never. <hi>I</hi> have heard a certain learned and ingenuous person disallow [<hi>A Rational Creature</hi>] to be a right definition of a <hi>Man,</hi> and discourse very soberly how proud a thing Mankind was, to arrogate all the Reason to himself, whereas diverse Birds and Beasts in their several spheres have as much or more Reason than He. And yet <hi>I</hi> dare say the same Gentleman would heartily allow the Truth of this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [<hi>A man is a man.</hi>] Nay, indeed all the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticks in the world admit <hi>Identical Propositions</hi> to be True, yet the same men quarrel every Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extant. Since then 'tis directly against the nature of the very first Principles to be <hi>dlsputable,</hi> 'tis evident that Definitions cannot be the very First Principles of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. First Principles ought to be <hi>Principia Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus</hi> and naturally ingrafted in us, that so they may oblige all under forfeiture of their nature to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce to their verity; whereas Definitions are not such, but acquir'd by Practical self-evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For example; by a long course of observation heedfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly attending to the actions of men as men, and thence (by means of some First Principle evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing so constant a hitting in so many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52024:34"/>
to be beyond Chance or Accident) gathering his primary and proper Operation, we come to know the Definition of Man, none of which needs to know the Truth of this nature-taught Proposition, [<hi>A Man is a Man</hi>] or [<hi>A Rational Creature is a Rational Creature.</hi>] Moreover, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions generally need some skill of Art to make them, and all Art presupposes some First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; whence 'tis impossible Definitions should be the First Principles of all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Experience teaches us that words being lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Equivocation, where there are fewer words there is less room for Equivocating; wherefore since First Principles ought to be the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earest, and consequently the most unequivocal that can be imagin'd, Definitions, which explicate the notion in <hi>more words,</hi> afford more room for Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently are even in this regard, less fit to be First Principles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Lastly, Logical tricks of nicely distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sometimes elude the Truth of a Proposition, at least darken it; from which Inconveniences First Principles ought to be the most Free that may be: Now Definitions yielding more room for Equivoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness, do by consequence give more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of distinguishing: whereas <hi>Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> afford not the least: For example, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, [<hi>A Man is a Rational Creature</hi>] bears this distinction, <hi>A man is rational</hi> in <hi>some</hi> things, as in discoursing those notions that concern <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> but not in others, e. g. those which concern <hi>Being</hi>; or, Rational, that is capable to discourse
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52024:34"/>
right the nature of some <hi>Bodies,</hi> but not of <hi>Spirits:</hi> Is it not evident hence that this Definition of <hi>Man,</hi> is by this means render'd in show ambiguous? And I wish there were not too many in the world who out of their ignorance of the true Method to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, think this distinction both well-grounded and very pertinent. Now this being so, who sees not that the true limits of the definition of Man, become doubtful by such kind of distinctions, and consequently the sence of the Definition it self unknown; whereas nothing of this can possibly happen in that <hi>Identical Proposition [A Man is a Man]</hi> since whatever distinction affects the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate must also affect the Subject, and so the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition remains still <hi>intirely</hi> Identical, and <hi>perfectly</hi> true, and not <hi>in part</hi> onely, as it happens in the other.</p>
            <p>'Tis concluded then from all imaginable consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that can belong to this peculiar matter, that the very First Principles neither are nor can be any thing else but Identical Propositions.</p>
            <p n="14">§ 14. As for their seeming <hi>ridiculous</hi> to some persons, the reason is, because those men of mirth being led much by Fancy, and inur'd all their lives to pretty plausibilities, and seldom or never reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on or discoursing orderly from such Grounds, are hence apt to imagine that First Principles a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Certain great Rarities or Productions of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary height of Wit; when therefore they come to hear <hi>Identical Propositions</hi> alledged for First Principles, seeing their high expectations so strangely disappointed, they hereupon grow
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52024:35"/>
pleasant at the defeat of their Fancy; never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that, because First Principles ground all possible discourse of what nature soever, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are common to all Mankind, even the rudest in the world, and inbred in them, they must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the farthest from being the effect of Wit, and the most plain down right sayings that can be conceiv'd: Whence they are better learn'd from the Vulgar, than they are from great Scholars; and therefore the most learned men that are, if they would go to work solidly, ought, in such things as are the Results of pure Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, attend to such as speak meer nature, rather than to those who mingle and perhaps corrupt it with airy speculations which have not that firm <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> to ground their Discourses. Now 'tis obvious to observe that the nature-instructed Vulgar are apt to deliver themselves in such kind of plain Speeches, in due occasions, and make use of them as Truths which fix their Judgments in an Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terableness. For example, if a man would force one of them to forgo what's very evident, he will stick firmly to the point, and tell you soberly, that <hi>Truth is Truth,</hi> or that <hi>he's sure a Spade is a Spade,</hi> or that <hi>he knows what he knows</hi>; or, if it be in a point belonging to Justice, that, <hi>Right is Right</hi>; and brings in these as Evidences from which he can never be driven: which signifies that such Truths as these are the Principles which naturally determin and fix him in an immovable adherence to the Point, as the ultimate resort and reason of his persuasion; that is, they are to him First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52024:35"/>
'Tis observable also that they are never more serious than when they are put to express themselves in this positive kind of blunt manner; nor would any By-stander (perhaps not Dr. <hi>T.</hi> himself, though he be the merriest man living when any talk is of Principles and Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) fall a laughing at them as ridiculous for their adhering finally to Identical Propositions: Which evidences that he has a conceit that First Principles are some fine elaborate Inventions of Wit, and that they are to tell a man something he knew not before; whereas they are such Truths as no man can possibly be ignorant of; as appears in those in <hi>Euclid,</hi> and other such-like, which seem at first blush full as ridiculous as those he so laughs at.</p>
            <p>Lastly, 'Tis observable that those witty half-Speculaters who scorn to follow Nature in their Grounds, when they come to lay any themselves, propose meer Whimsies for First Principles; of which Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is a pleasant Instance, as shall be seen hereafter.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That First Principles are Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proved by many Instances; and their Right Use shown.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. THus far we have discours'd the nature of First Principles from Logick and Metaphysick, within whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines that Matter was plac'd: Which no Intelligent Reader could expect to be less Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively deliver'd, considering the nature of that Subject: For common Reason tells any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge in such affairs, that if any Sublunary Matter can require high Speculation, certainly a Discourse which states the nature of the Supreme Verities must forcibly exact it. Wherefore to make it more intelligible, <hi>I</hi> shall for my Readers sake do three things: First instance in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Identical Propositions granted by all the World to be First Principles in their respective Sciences. Next, show the Use of these First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which my ignorant Adversary so miserably mistakes: And now and then, by the way, apply them to the present Controversie about Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. As for the First, <hi>I</hi> show'd Dr. <hi>T. (Letter of Thanks,</hi> p. 25.) an Example of one First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple granted to be such by all who treat of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52024:36"/>
of Quantity, though he, out of a constancy to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> humour, never heeds to take notice of it. 'Tis this, <hi>A Whole is more than a Part:</hi> Nor perhaps will so profound a man at superficial Talk deny this to be a First Principle, in regard the Subject and Predicate of that Proposition, by reason of the different manner of expressing (only which he minds not the Sence) seem disparate in their notion, and, so, not Identical or too closely connected, which he hath a most special Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy against in First Principles, as is seen by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning it in mine, and will more amply appear when he comes to put his own. Nay, the great difference in the <hi>sounds</hi> of the Subject and Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate will make it to one who looks not much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to bear the face of a certain kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and disagreement in sence between them, which will, no doubt, please him hugely. Yet <hi>I</hi> must contest that that Proposition is <hi>Self-evident,</hi> and that its Self-evidence consists in this, that its Subject and Predicate (consider'd Logically and not Grammatically) are perfectly Identical, that is, to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> are fully as Ridiculous as <hi>A Rule is a Rule, Faith is Faith</hi>: Which <hi>I</hi> thus shew. The Subject of that Proposition [<hi>A Whole</hi>] is defin'd to be <hi>That which consists of Parts</hi>; or (since a Thing <hi>is</hi> that of which it <hi>consists</hi>) it's equivalent in sence is, in reality, [<hi>A Whole is Parts.</hi>] Now the word [<hi>Parts</hi>] being plural, necessarily and formally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <hi>more than one</hi> Part; wherefore this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition [<hi>A Whole is more than a Part</hi>] is perfectly the self same in sence with this, [<hi>That which is more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52024:37"/>
than one Part, is more than one Part:</hi>] which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Identical.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Moreover, some late Philosophers build their Physicks on this Principle, <hi>Corpus est quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> in which the Subject and Predicate differ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Grammatically, one being Substantively, the other Adjectively exprest; but if we rifle the words to clear the inward sence, (as is the duty of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or Philosophers) we shall find that since all the Essential difference we know between a <hi>Body</hi> and a <hi>Spirit,</hi> is this, that this is <hi>Indivisible,</hi> the other <hi>Divisible</hi>; as also that <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Divisibility</hi> is the same notion, it will appear evidently, that this Proposition [<hi>Body is Quantitative</hi>] is, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cording to them, perfectly equivalent in sence to this, [<hi>What is Divisible is Divisible:</hi>] which is manifestly Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Again, all the Learned World hitherto have held that we have Certain Maxims ingrafted in us by Nature, <hi>I</hi> mean imbuing our Mind by the first impressions on our Understanding, without our contributing to their generation in the least, more than by having an Intelligent Nature passive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving those Impressions; and these they call <hi>Principia Intellectus,</hi> which generally concern the nature of <hi>Being</hi>; that Conception being the most Luminous, and by means of which striking the Eye of our Soul, all our Intellectual Sight is produc'd: as will appear to any one who attentively considers that all our Discourses consist of Judgments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by Propositions, and those essentially depend on the notion of Being; wherefore, unless this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52024:37"/>
be known antecedently, 'tis impossible either to judge, think or discourse. Hence follows that the First of our Knowledges is of the self-discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature or notion of <hi>Being</hi>; and the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge of Being is this, that it formally excludes, or is extreamly opposite to, Not-Being, and therefore inconsistent with it in the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: which we use to express by this Proposition, [<hi>Impossibile est idem esse &amp; non esse] 'Tis impossible the same thing should be and not be.</hi> This therefore hath ever been deservedly held a First Principle in Metaphysicks, establishing all our Discourses that concern the actual Being of Things, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner all Logick. And yet 'tis plain to the meanest Speculater, that this Proposition is the self-same in sence with this, <hi>What is, is:</hi> Which is most formally and supremely <hi>Identical</hi>: The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility mention'd in the former lighting onely on this, that actual <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Not Being</hi> should agree to the same Subject, or which is all one, that the Subject and Predicate in this later Proposition should not be connected.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. But, it may be the Principles of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks will better rellish to our fastidious age, which neglecting to consider what 'tis that makes Geometry a Science, think there is no Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but in Lines and Numbers. To them then let's go; and at first entrance into <hi>Euclid</hi> we are met with these famous and useful Principles. <hi>Those which are Equal to the same, are Equal to one another. If Equals be added to Equals, the Wholes are Equal. If Equals be taken away from Equals, the Remainders
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52024:38"/>
are Equal. Those which are twice as big as the same, are Equal. Those which are Halfs of the same, are Equal.</hi> Besides others of the same strain; and amongst the rest, <hi>A Whole is greater than a Part of it self,</hi> of which we lately discours'd. Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that all these are in effect Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in the common sence of every Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man, amount meerly to as much as this, <hi>Aequale est, aequale sibi, An Equal is equal to it self</hi>: or else suppose it necessarily as the very First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple upon whose most evident Verity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theirs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. For example, this Proposition, [<hi>If Equals be added to Equals, the Wholes are Equal</hi>] is clearly made up of the now mentioned Identical Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thrice (as it were) repeated; and is plainly as much as to say, <hi>The two</hi> suppos'd <hi>Equals</hi> are <hi>Equal</hi> to one another, the two <hi>Equals</hi> added are <hi>Equal</hi> to one another, and so the two <hi>Wholes</hi> made up of both those <hi>Equals,</hi> that is, the <hi>Equal Wholes</hi> are <hi>Equal</hi> to one another. And the same may be said of all the rest of that kind. Which were it not that men expect rigour of discourse in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Geometry, and have entertain'd a conceit that 'tis not to be expected nor had in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would look full as Ridiculous by reason of their seemingly too great Plainness and Evidence, as a <hi>Rule is a Rule,</hi> or <hi>Faith is Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">§. 6 I come now to perform the second thing <hi>I</hi> promis'd, which is to show what use is to be made of First Principles, and how. In which hard point my Friend Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is at his wits end. And first he tells you soberly (Pref. p. 38.) if you will take his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52024:38"/>
word, <hi>that the mischief is, they are good for nothing</hi>; Which were, <hi>I</hi> confess, a <hi>mischief</hi> with a witness; for without these, no man living could either know, judge, or discourse.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. Next, he quotes <hi>Aristotle</hi> against me, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking a Proposition of <hi>the very same stamp</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y First Principles; To which my answer is, (and <hi>I</hi> desire it may serve for his objecting all other mock-Authorities of this nature) that, though <hi>I</hi> value and honour <hi>Aristotle</hi> exceedingly, yet neither he nor any man living taken as a Reasoner, or in things which are the Proper Object of Humane Discourse, has any the least Authority over my Understanding, but by virtue of the Reasons he produces: Let him then make use of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (and the like <hi>I</hi> say of School-Divines) against me as much as he will; since those, if Convictive, may subdue my Understanding to assent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I be Intelligent and Candid; or else expose me to the Disesteem of Learned men, if I be either so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as not to understand their force, or so insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely obstinate as not to admit them though I see they conclude: Otherwise, to neglect to alledge their Reasons, and think to combat and overthrow me by objecting their bare Sayings, is so senceless a conceit as onely could enter into the head of such a puny Logician. In a word, let him either prove this a necessary consequence, Aristotle, School-Divines, or other Discoursers, <hi>say</hi> such a thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> 'tis <hi>True</hi>; or else desist from such an insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant method of confuting. Add, that he puts me, by his indistinct citing the place, to find out one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52024:39"/>
half line perhaps in a large Treatise; otherwise <hi>I</hi> should not doubt to show that Great Man not so opposite to my Doctrine as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> would perswade his Readers.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. After this he assures us that <hi>by ten thousand</hi> of these Identical Propositions, <hi>a man shall not be able to advance one step in knowledge because they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no Conclusion but themselves.</hi> By which he gives us very learnedly to understand that he either never knew or else hath quite forgot that there ought to be two Prem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sses to infer a Conclusion, and three Terms in every legitimate Syllogism, and not one Premiss, and <hi>one</hi> or at most <hi>two</hi> Terms onely. And lest you should think <hi>I</hi> abuse him in putting upon him such an absurdity as never <hi>Junior Sophister</hi> yet was guilty of, he pursues the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of it home, and to <hi>convince</hi> me (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) of <hi>the Foolery of these Principles,</hi> he will needs <hi>try what can be done with them either in a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical or Hypothetical Syllogism</hi>: thus; <hi>A Rule is a Rule, but Tradition is a Rule; Ergo Tradition is a Rule.</hi> Again, <hi>If a Rule be a Rule, then a Rule is a Rule; but a Rule is a Rule, Ergo.</hi> And when he hath done, he asks <hi>if any man be the wiser for all this? I</hi> answer, not a jot; but <hi>I</hi> know a certain person much <hi>foolisher</hi> for it. Yet he says <hi>it may be Mr. S. may make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter work with them, and manage them more dextrously.</hi> And truly <hi>I</hi> hope so too; else he would deserve to be as ridiculous as himself that manag'd them so childishly. In the mean time 'tis observable what a Scholar-like way he takes to confute, and what a high conceit he has of his Jests. Was Drollery
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52024:39"/>
ever till now held a Convictive, or a Jeer a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration? Alas poor Trifler!</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. To make way towards the declaring the proper use of First Painciples, <hi>I</hi> am first to remove Dr. <hi>T.</hi>'s misconceit, and to instruct his ignorance that the very First Principles or Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be the Premisses in any Syllogism. To do which he may please to know, or rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that every Legitimate Syllogism has three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Terms; of which, the Proposition which is to be prov'd, or to be the Conclusion, affords us Two; the Third or Middle Term is to be sought for, and taken from the nature of the Subject in hand, or from what's intrinsecally or (at least) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily connected with it, in case we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Thing <hi>Certain.</hi> This Middle Term (in that Figure which is the onely natural and proper one) joyn'd with the Predicate of that Proposition which was in question, or to be concluded, makes the <hi>Major</hi>; the same with the Subject of the said Proposition, makes the <hi>Minor.</hi> Whence is seen that each Proposition in a legitimate Syllogism has two Terms formally distinct that is two, which are not <hi>formally</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>Identical</hi>: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the very First Principles can never be Premisses in an exact Syllogism, speaking, as he does, of those which are every way Identical.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. To show then their Proper Use, <hi>I</hi> explain my self thus. All solid Discourse concerning any Subject, ought to be grounded upon the nature of the Thing under debate, and to endeavour all what may be to hold firmly to that Nature: which if it

But ere <hi>I</hi> come close to that matter, I must say something to his Impertinent Drolleries, because he thinks them rare things, and (as appears by his carriage all along) places most of his confidence in those Trifles; nay, which in my mind is no very wise Project, he would have his Readers think those Feathers <hi>weighty,</hi> because they are <hi>gay.</hi> Besides, these are my onely Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and so 'tis in a manner my duty not to neglect them.</p>

in my Preface. But this was no such great Threat: I knew them prone enough of their own <hi>Genius</hi> to do voluntarily things of this nature; and now both of them have, like true Friends, conspir'd to do me that favour of their own accord. For Dr. <hi>T. declares</hi> here to no fewer than <hi>all the World,</hi> That he <hi>neither has any Principles, nor will have any,</hi> if there be no other but <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> as, speaking of <hi>First Principles,</hi> I have prov'd there are <hi>not;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> has laid such Principles of late, as would make any Understanding Man that reads them, swear he is as far from having any as his Friend. Excellent ones indeed he puts at first, but the mischief is, they make nothing at all for his purpose: Some fumbling Propositions there are that make for his purpose, but the ill luck is, they are so far from having the least semblance of <hi>Principles,</hi> that no wit of man shall ever make them look like good <hi>Conclusions</hi>: And to put it to the trial, if out of any Principle forelaid there, he can infer that <hi>main</hi> and in a manner <hi>onely</hi> Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Scripture's Letter is the Rule of Faith,</hi> and put it in a Conclusive Syllogism or two, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him upon the sight of it to become of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.

Why, what's the matter? Surely there is something more than ordinary in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that makes a man of mirth, of late so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, on a sudden thus pettish. He says <hi>I durst not cite the words of his Book or Sermon</hi>: How I <hi>Durst not!

And, as for the words of his Sermon, it was no Proper Place to <hi>cite</hi> or <hi>confute</hi> them <hi>there</hi>: It was enough <hi>there</hi> to add, as <hi>I did,</hi> after my Charge, these words, [<hi>as may perhaps more particularly be

As for their <hi>Clearness,</hi> and Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s too, whom <hi>I</hi> rank with them in that Quality, having really a disposition to do him all just honour he makes himself capable to receive; <hi>I</hi> acknowledge 'tis found in them to a fair degree of Excellence. But <hi>I</hi> must distinguish <hi>Clearness</hi> into two sorts: one that <hi>clears</hi> their <hi>own thoughts</hi> by means of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> the other that <hi>clears</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Point</hi> in dispute, which is done by means of <hi>Principles.</hi> The former makes the Reader understand <hi>Them,</hi> the latter makes him understand <hi>Truth.</hi> The one renders it <hi>clear</hi> that they <hi>say thus</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other makes it <hi>clear</hi> that they say <hi>right</hi> when they <hi>say thus.</hi> In the first sort of <hi>Clearness</hi> they have not many Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; In the latter, they are like other Mortals, or rather indeed they are quite destitute of it.

made steady by Grounds and Principles, they ever did, and ever will, and so must all who follow their steps, fall infinitely short.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. As for my <hi>style; I</hi> declare that I regard it no further than it serves to express my thoughts; especially not intending to perswade the Vulgar Rhetorically by advantage of Language, but to prove severely the point to Scholars by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectedness of my Sence. <hi>I</hi> am of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s mind, that, in this circumstance, an Iron-Key is as good as a Golden one, where no more is requisite, but <hi>aperire quod clausum erat,</hi> to open what was before conceal'd or shut. In my younger years and spring time of my life. <hi>I</hi> apply'd my self much to those flourishes of Poetry and Rhetorick; but I am now in my Autumn; and my riper thoughts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themselves to study Knowledge, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fell off, when the Fruit-time was come. <hi>I</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as far as <hi>I</hi> am able, to fill my mind with grounded and sollid Reasons for the point in hand, and then let my <hi>Sence</hi> give me my <hi>Style,</hi> and not frame my <hi>Sence</hi> to my <hi>Words,</hi> or make my Words <hi>supply the want</hi> of Sence, as gay Discoursers use. Besides, no mans Attention is infinite; and so, should I mind my <hi>Style</hi> too much, in all likelihood <hi>I</hi> should mind <hi>Sence</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> a thousand times more value) less; and I take this to be one Reason why Dr. <hi>T.</hi> (for otherwise the man has a very good wit) heeding his Style and Words so extreamly much, scarce attends at all to his Sence; or, (as an Ingenious Person reading this Preface ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest it) <hi>had rather be guilty of ten Errours than one
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52024:50"/>
Incongruity.</hi> Lastly, how does Dr. <hi>T.</hi> know my <hi>Style,</hi> were <hi>I</hi> to make a Sermon? Does not every Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour know that the Style due to a Sermon and a strict Discourse of close Reason, are the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent imaginable? I will not say Dr. <hi>T.</hi> has no good Judgment in Words, for this would make him good for little; but I must say he was very rash in concluding absolutely of my Style from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in <hi>one</hi> kind of matter onely, and this the most Incompetent of any in the world, to show what Language one is Master of.</p>
            <p>Now to his Sermon; and let him remember 'tis himself forces me to lay open the weakness of his Discourses by his frequent and scornful Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Which I was very loth to do in this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, lest it might wrong the Common Cause of Christianity against Atheism. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd that, should Christian Divines acquiesce and seem to consent by their Carriage that they judge such quivering Grounds competent to build their Faith and the Tenet of a Deity upon, it would be a far juster Scandal to Atheists, than 'tis to disclaim from them, and avow in the name of the rest the absolute Certainty of those Maxims which ground our Persuasions as Christians. Add, that it was my Duty to those who yet are firmly persuaded of their Faith, not to permit them to slide into a less hearty Conceit of it than the nature of Faith and the Obligations springing from it, do require at their hands. These Considerations ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying me fully to the World, and Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s daring Provocations particularly to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And can a Motive or Reason possible to be False, ever induce in true Reason such an Obligation, or work rationally such an Effect? How should it be? Since in that case a man must on the one side judge the thing <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> because he is to <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to it as a <hi>Truth</hi>; and yet must at the same t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sees the Motives he has offer'd him raise it no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: that is, he must hold both sides of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which is absolutely impossible. Now <hi>true Evidence</hi> that the thing is so, takes away all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Falsehood, and so obliges to Assent; and if Dr. <hi>T.</hi> produces such proofs as make the point <hi>truly Evident,</hi> an Atheist is unreasonable and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate if he do not <hi>Assent</hi> to it: But, if by those words, <hi>Atheism is unreasonable because it requires more Evidence than the things are capable of,</hi> he means that the Things afford <hi>no true Evidence at all,</hi> and judges Atheists unreasonable for not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting without true Evidence because the Things afford <hi>none,</hi> he in effect tells them they must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their <hi>Manhood</hi> ere they can be <hi>Christians</hi>; than which, nothing can more reflect on the Profession of Christianity, or be more unworthy a Christian Divine to propose.

of such a Soveraign Being is necessarily requir'd: The Question then is, Whether <hi>Aristotle</hi> did or could with any reason say that a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature (that is, a Creature whose nature 'tis to deduce Conclusions by <hi>Discourse</hi> from <hi>Premisses,</hi> or build the certain Truth of <hi>Those,</hi> upon the certain Truth of <hi>These</hi>) could be oblig'd, in true Reason, or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to Right Nature, to <hi>assent,</hi> judge or conclude a Thing <hi>True,</hi> without such Motives or Proofs which did <hi>conclude</hi> it <hi>True</hi>; or that, what <hi>concluded</hi> a Thing <hi>True,</hi> did not also <hi>conclude</hi> it <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be otherwise,</hi> or to be False.

by the best Arguments that the nature and quality of the thing will bear.</hi> This Discourse deserves deep Consideration. And first it would be ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> why Metaphysicks are omitted here, which of all others ought to have been mentioned, and that in the first place, since its proper Subject is those Notions which concern <hi>Being,</hi> and to give <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Create,</hi> is the Proper Effect of Him who is Essential Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whence it seems the Properest Science that is to <hi>demonstrate</hi> a Deity, in case Metaphysical things be demonstrable; and that they are such, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> himself cannot deny; for if (as he says here) <hi>things are</hi> therefore <hi>demonstrable because they are of an abstracted nature,</hi> the Object of Metaphysicks, which is <hi>Being,</hi> is far more <hi>abstracted</hi> from matter and so from <hi>Motion,</hi> and its necessary Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>Vncertainty</hi> or Contingency, than is <hi>Quantity,</hi> the subject of Mathematicks; for this primary Affection of Body is the Ground and Proper Cause of of all Variation and Unsteadiness, since all natural <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Mutation</hi> arises from <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:</hi> Yet, because all Science is taken from the Things as <hi>standing under our notion</hi> or Conception, and not according as they exist in themselves, where thousands of Considerabilities are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly jumbled into one Common Stock of Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or one <hi>Thing</hi>; also because we can abstract by our Consideration the notion or nature of Quantity, nay consider the same Quantity meerly as affecting Body, as it were, <hi>steadily,</hi> or <hi>extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, without considering the same Quantity as the Proper Cause or Source of <hi>Motion</hi>; hence the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52024:53"/>
Mathematicks have Title to be truly and properly a <hi>Science</hi>; for this Abstraction, or manner of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our mind,</hi> frees the notion or nature thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted (that is, the thing, as thus conceiv'd by us) from <hi>Vncertainty,</hi> nay indeed fixes it in a kind of <hi>Immutability</hi>; whereas were it consider'd as found in the World, there would be no firm Ground at all for any Discourse. For example, perhaps by reason of the perpetual turmoil of things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is not to be found in the World any one Body either mathematically Straight, Circular, or Triangular; yet because the nature of Body conceiv'd as in <hi>Rest</hi> bears it, &amp; we can abstract from Motion, and so consider quantitative Things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they can bear in themselves, taken as <hi>not moving,</hi> or <hi>in Rest,</hi> therefore we can make such steady notions, and when we have done dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course them, and ground a long train of new Conclusions (which we call a particular Science) upon such a Nature thus conceiv'd.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. And for that reason I would gladly know why <hi>Ethicks</hi> or <hi>Morality</hi> is not <hi>equally</hi> demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Mathematicks. For we can equally abstract those <hi>Moral</hi> Notions of <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them apart, as we can do those <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ones of <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Numbers.</hi> I know 'tis grown a common humour in the World, taken up I know not <hi>how,</hi> by course, and continu'd none knows <hi>why,</hi> to think otherwise: But I must confess I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could discern any reason for it, and shall be thankful to that man who can show me any that convinces. In the mean time I give mine for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52024:54"/>
Affirmative; which is this, That the same reason holds for Ethicks as for Mathematicks, since all the perquisits for Demonstration are found in the one as in the other. To put it to the Test, let's consider what <hi>Euclid</hi> does when he demonstrates, and by virtue of what: We see he puts his Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and some common Maxims peculiar to that Subject, and then by his Reason connecting the first Deductions with his Principles, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Deductions with the foregoing on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, weaves them into a Science. And is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we can as well know what's meant by those words which express <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices,</hi> and so as well <hi>define</hi> them as we can those other? Also that the Common Maxims of Morality are as self-evident to Humane Nature as any First Principles in the World? I admire then what should hinder Ethicks to be as perfect a Science as the clearest piece of Mathematicks, since we can equally <hi>abstract</hi> the several notions handled in it from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, equally define them, and, consequently, assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Common Maxims equally-evident, with equal clearness discourse them; which is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. If it be said that particular Moral Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are liable to Contingency; 'tis answer'd that this hinders not but the Speculative part of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is a true Science: Even Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, when reduc'd to practice, and put in matter, are subject also to Contingency, as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience daily in Mechanicks: and yet the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative part, which abstracts from matter, is never the less Scientifical.</p>

The greatest difficulty is in that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virtue call'd <hi>Prudence</hi>; and I confess that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the exercise of this Virtue is surrounded with an incomprehensible number of Accidents, and way-laid, as it were, with all the Ambushes and Stratagems of Fortune; and consequently to make its Success Certain, we must be put to fathom the natures of many several things; nay more, their Combinations or Joynt-actings with their several circumstances; and especially of those things which are the Common Causes of the World, as the influences of the Sun, Moon, and other Stars, (if they have any that is considerable) and lastly of the Elements which 'tis impossible for our short-sighted Knowledge to reach; hence Prudence, in its Execution, or put in matter, is liable to more Contingency by far than any piece of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, where we have but one or two single no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or natures to grapple with and weild; Yet notwithstanding all these difficulties, I must still contest that the Maxims of Prudence, upon which its <hi>Dictamens</hi> are chiefly grounded, are self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent practically, and to the Learned Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ought to sow and plant in their proper seasons, that 'tis best for Merchants to <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard</hi> though they be insecure of the Event, and a thousand such-like.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. I expect Dr. <hi>T.</hi> will object the fickle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Will,</hi> which renders all Contingent where this perpetually-changing Planet has any Influence. But yet there's a way, for all that, to fix this volatil Mercurial Power, and make it act with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52024:55"/>
a <hi>constancy</hi> as great as any other thing in <hi>Nature.</hi> To conceive how this may be effected, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the <hi>Will</hi> too has a peculiar <hi>nature</hi> of its own, which it can no more forgo than the most constant Piece found in Nature can do Its: that is, The Will can no more leave off being a Will, than a Rule can not-be a Rule, Faith not-be Faith, or any other of those <hi>ridiculous</hi> Identical Propositions (as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> calls them) not be true. Now the Will being a Power, and Powers taking their several Natures from their Objects, or, as the Schools express it, being <hi>specify'd</hi> by them, and the Object of the Will as distinguish'd from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, being <hi>Good,</hi> and this propos'd to It by that Knowing Power; that is, <hi>Good,</hi> (at least) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi> such; if it can be made evident that such a thing can never <hi>appear</hi> a Good to the Subject thus circumstanc'd, 'tis demonstrable the Will cannot will it, nay as evident as 'tis that <hi>A Will is a Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. To apply this to particulars: In case there be a Trade or Profession of Merchants, and it be evident to all the Followers of that sole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that Themselves, Wives and Children must starve unless they venture to Sea, the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing can never appear to them (thus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd, that is, addicted to that onely way of Livelihood, as is suppos'd) a <hi>Good</hi>; and so 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable that (abstracting from Madness or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Passion, which is not our Case) they can never <hi>will</hi> not-to-venture. Or if a great multitude of men have embrac'd no Profession but that of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52024:55"/>
the Law, and, as we'll suppose, have no other Livelihood but <hi>That,</hi> so that it becomes evident it can never appear a <hi>Good</hi> to them not to take Fees; 'tis as Certain they will not refuse them, as 'tis that a Thing is it Self, or that <hi>a Will is a Will</hi>; because a Will <hi>is</hi> a Power whose Essence 'tis to have such an Object as <hi>is appearingly Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">§. 14. To come closer to our purpose. Suppose Innumerable multitudes of Fathers or Immediate Predecessors in any Age had an inclination to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Children or immediate Successors in the World, and consequently that the Immediate End they propos'd to themselves were to make them <hi>believe</hi> such Points of Faith were <hi>received</hi> by them from Forefathers, which were indeed <hi>newly invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; these men, I say, in case they must see it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to compass that end, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>deceive</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-growing <hi>World</hi> in so <hi>open</hi> a matter of Fact, it follows that (<hi>End, Motive,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> being the self-same thing in our case) it must necessar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52024:56"/>How then? Is not the Will <hi>Free?</hi> I reply, It is not free in this, nor is it at the Will's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to chuse whether it will <hi>be its self</hi> or no: Whenever therefore its <hi>Essence</hi> is engag'd, those Acts are not Free; In all other Cases where its Essence is <hi>not</hi> engag'd, <hi>'tis</hi> Free, provided there be on the Objects side variety enough for <hi>Choice.</hi> Yet in those former Cases those Acts of the Will are <hi>voluntary,</hi> because they are <hi>Hers</hi>; and <hi>more volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> because they are <hi>more</hi> according to what's <hi>Essential</hi> to her, or to her very Nature.</p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. As for <hi>Natural Conclusions being prov'd by a sufficient Induction of Experiments,</hi> I must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely deny any Induction to be sufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get new Science, if it be understood of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alone, without the assistance of Common Maxims in that affair. And I would gladly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd why <hi>Physicks</hi> or <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> should be debarr'd the power of deducing its Conclusions Scientifically, or, why the same reason holds not for its being a Science, as does for the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Morality. We can arrive to know the meanings of those words which express Natural Notions, as <hi>Heat, Cold, Moisture, Driness,</hi> &amp;c. Again, the Common Maxims belonging to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are full as Evident as any in the Mathematicks or Morals; as that a <hi>Dense</hi> or less <hi>Divisible</hi> Body prest against a <hi>more Divisible</hi> (or <hi>Rare</hi>) one will divide it, and such like. We can consider too those Natural Notions abstractedly; and, so, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them, and discourse them evidently, thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted; which is all that is requisite to a Science.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52024:56"/>
It would be well consider'd then why we ought to relinquish that Method, which is, confessedly, the road way to all Science in the Mathematicks, and take up, instead of it, this new and Contingent Way of Induction. The Objections against this Discourse are the same which are made against Morality's being a Science, to which I have lately spoken. But Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is pardonable in this mistake, because he errs with a great multitude, and those too very ingenious persons; who, unfortunately missing the Right Method to Science, and having taken a prejudice against all Beginning <hi>à priori</hi> by way of Principles, conceit <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> onely attainable by amassing together great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of <hi>Experiments.</hi> And as they who pursue that fruitless study of the Philosophers Stone, light upon many pretty things by the way which entertain and please their Fancies, and, by that means, decoy them forwards to spend their Thoughts, their Money and Industry to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: So they who solely affect this Way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, hit upon many pleasant and delightful Productions, useful indeed to some degree for Practical Men or Artificers; but full as barren to create any new Science, as the other to make Gold. Whence, though <hi>I</hi> dare not be so bold as to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest my Advice, yet I crave leave humbly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my Wish, That those Excellent Wits would think fit maturely to consider in the first place whether they be secure of their Method; which will be best determin'd by looking into the nature of Humane Discourse when rightly made; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52024:57"/>
discovering by what means 'tis effected when we conclude evidently some new Truth in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, or any other Science, and then consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether meer Induction have any such virtue. The Zeal I have that the precious Thoughts and diligent Industry of such Ingenious Pursuers of Truth should not miss their End, transports me a little unseasonably, and perhaps needlesly, beyond my present Duty; for which yet I know their Candour such, that <hi>I</hi> shall easily obtain their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p n="16">§. 16. It follows in Dr. <hi>T.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. HE introduces his Discourse thus: <hi>So that this is to be entertain'd as a Firm Principle by all those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Certain of any thing at all, that when any thing is prov'd by as good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as that thing is capable of, and we have as great assurance that it is as we could possibly have supposing it were, we ought not in reason to make any doubt of the Existence of that Thing.</hi> This is Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s FIRM PRINCIPLE, and it should be a kind of FIRST PRINCIPLE too, being so universally necessary that without admitting this, no man can be Certain of any Thing at all, nor any Thing at all be Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any man. You see, Gentlemen, how much depends upon it, and I conceive you will easily conclude it ought to be as Evident and as Firm as any First Principle extant; since according to his way of Discourse, all Truths, even the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Concerns in the world (particularly the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of proving a Deity) must run its Fate, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52024:61"/>
be establish'd or ruin'd by its standing or falling. Now my Judgment of it is this, That 'tis the most ridiculous piece of Folly, and the most pernicious abstract of pithy Nonsence that ever was laid down since Mankind was Mankind, by any sober man, for such a Principle without which no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty at all can be had, no not even that there is a God.</p>
            <p>I charge it therefore with four Faults. First, that 'tis Unprov'd; next 'tis Unevident of it self, and so no Principle; thirdly, that were it evident, 'tis Impertinent to the end 'tis produc'd for; and lastly, it betrays all Religion into the possibility of being a Lye, instead of establishing it.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. And, first, it appears that he intends it as a <hi>Conclusion</hi> by his introducing it with <hi>So that,</hi> &amp;c. after his former Discourse: But as I have already confuted That, so I discern not any title it has to be Sequel from those Premisses, in case they were True. For what a mad consequence is this, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse things bear diverse kinds of Proofs, some weaker, some stronger, therefore when we have the best the Object can afford us, we are to rest satisfi'd the thing <hi>is?</hi> How, I say, does this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, unless he had first ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, that the least of those Proofs was satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; or that there is no Object in the world but is capable of yielding light enough to satisfie; which Position every days experience convinces of Falshood, Indeed, if he meant by these words, that upon our seeing the Thing is capable of no <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Proof,</hi> it is wisdom in us to sit down satisfy'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52024:61"/>
that <hi>no more is to be had,</hi> and so surcease our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quest, I understand him very well; but that I should be satisfy'd the thing <hi>is so,</hi> or acquiesce to its <hi>Truth,</hi> (as he must mean to make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for his purpose) not from the Conclusiveness of the Grounds it stands under, or the prevalence of the Object upon my Understanding subduing it to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but because that Object is capable to bear no more, or to discover it self no better to my sight, is in plain terms to say, that because the Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng at all. His Intent is to evince a Deity, and I declare heartily I have that good opinion of him as to hope that, settled perhaps in that Assent by Practical Self-evidence as are the Vulgar, and not by Skill or Principles as Scholars are, (for his Speculation makes it absolutely Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain) he judges it to be <hi>absolutely Certain</hi>: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he judges his Motives he has to evince it, Conclusive or no; If Conclusive, there needs no running about the Bush to tell us of several kinds of Proofs, or laying such whimsical Principles, fit for nothing but to make the witty Atheist laugh at Christianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it had been enough to stand
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52024:62"/>
to it heartily that the Thing must be so, because the Arguments he brings conclude it to be so. But, in case he fear'd his Motives were not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Conclusive,</hi> or able to evince the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Point, (and that this is his Sentiment appears by his blaming me here, p. 20. for pretending to such to ground Faith) then indeed it was but good Policy, or rather plain Necessity, to lay some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by means of which he might compound the business between the Object and the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the same manner (though this seems but an <hi>odd</hi> method of <hi>proving</hi>) as Friends take up diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between good natur'd Creditors and the Debtor, when he that owes is willi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, if it could be had, is in reality <hi>due</hi> ere it can be satisfy'd of its absolute Certainty; yet, because the Object is able to afford no more, 'tis awarded by their Umpire Dr. <hi>T.</hi> that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Understanding is to be content to rest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay'd, and hold it notwithstanding to be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Certain; which is the same as to say, that though I do not <hi>see</hi> the Thing to be so, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thing it self <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>seen</hi> to be so, I will fancy strongly or judge I <hi>see</hi> it to be so. Let us parallel it by Analogy to our Corporal Sight, and the Discourse stands thus: Though I see not the Wall to be white, because 'tis so far distant, or the Air dusky, yet because I can see it no better, the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52024:62"/>
Wall thus circumstanc'd not being able to inform my Eye clearly; therefore despairing of the Walls affording me any better sight of it self, I will piece out that degree of obscurity in the Object, with a strong bending my Eyes till I fancy verily I see it to be white; or rather, out of a civil compliance with it's defect of visibleness, I will verily judge and conclude it to be indeed of such a colour; and then if any object folly to me for assenting upon infirm Grounds, I will tell him he is ill-natur'd and unmerciful, the poor Wall has done (alas) all it can, and who can in reason desire more?</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. I expect Dr. <hi>T.</hi> will pretend degrees of Intellectual Sight, and that by a less degree of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he sees the Thing to be, though 'tis not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to him by the greatest; but 'tis impossible and even contradictory to Common Sence to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a Reason which fal's short of being (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Maxims of Right Logick) abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Conclusive, should beget <hi>any</hi> true <hi>Evidence</hi> or Intellectual Sight at all: if then he have no Conclusive Reason, he is convinc'd to have <hi>no kind</hi> of Evidence: If he have, let him produce it and stand by it; and not persist thus to wrong the most weighty and most excellent Cause in the World, by advancing such R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or indeed how can this be pretended, since, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, no man can be Certain of any thing at all, nor consequently of the Connexion of that Third Term with two others, unless this Firm Principle be <hi>first</hi> admitted. Is it then by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with one another immediately, or of the same most formal notion? Dr. <hi>T.</hi> disavows it absolutely, for then the Proposition were <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> which he makes a publick Declaration to all the world <hi>he will have nothing to do with.</hi> Is one of the <hi>Terms</hi> the Definition, or a direct part of the Definition of the other, that so (at least) they may deserve to be held to some degree formally Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, though not <hi>most formally?</hi> Himself pretends it not; and did he pretend it, 'twill appear shortly how far they are from such a near Relation and Connexion to one another.

            <p n="5">§. 5. This is farther demonstrated, because its Contradictory is <hi>True.</hi> For 'tis plain to common Sence that many things prov'd by as good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as (in these circumstances) they are capable of, and as well assur'd to us as (in these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) they could possibly be, supposing they were, are yet, for all that, liable to doubt: For some things are so remov'd from our knowledge that we can have but very little Light concerning their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Existence: Must therefore every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in that case, how slight and trivial soever, be necessarily judg'd sufficient to make the Thing be held undoubtedly <hi>True.</hi> Some think they have probable Arguments that there are Men in the Moon, and in the rest of the Stars; must they therefore upon some likely or seeming Reason judge the thing is so, because 'tis not capable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering our Circumstances, even <hi>though it were,</hi> to be known better. There is some Probability the King of <hi>China</hi> is now while I write, consulting about the affairs of his Empire, or else at a Feast, or a Hunting, because Monarchs use such Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Entertainments, and in these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances 'tis all the Light I can have concerning that point: Is it therefore past doubt that <hi>'tis so?</hi> Who sees not that witty men find plausible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And therefore Odd Number is the best, and so fitting to be found in such vast and Noble parts of the Universe as the <hi>Stars.</hi> Were it not a wise bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness now upon so simple a Reason to judge that the Stars are undoubtedly <hi>Odd?</hi> Yet this is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly agreeable to Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s First Principle. This is all the Light the Stars are capable to give us at this distance, and were they <hi>indeed Odd,</hi> yet we could have no knowledge of them by any better Arguments than this; so that we must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with this, or take nothing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore says Dr. <hi>T.</hi> unless you will deny a most <hi>Firm Principle,</hi> and by doing so be rendred incapable of being <hi>Certain of any thing</hi> (too great a penalty one would think for so small a fault!) the Thing must be concluded Certain, and <hi>Odd</hi> they shall be.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Be it spoken then with honour to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> he is the first Author of this All-ascertaining First Principle, which by the way, is a shrewd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument 'tis none, since Nature never instill'd it into all Mankind) and of a new method to arrive at Certainty of all things, so easie, so compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the World never heard the like; all, even the rudest may comprehend it, nay perhaps be as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52024:65"/>
wise as the wisest: For all can understand as much of the Object as in their circumstances they <hi>can do,</hi> and the wisest can do no more; and this rare Method requires no more but that the Object be known as well as 'tis capable to be known in every ones circumstances, and that the Persons do <hi>not doubt</hi> of it; which the rudest will do the least of all other; which done, they are according to him <hi>Certain</hi> of it, and all is well.</p>

But <hi>Suspense,</hi> even for that very Reason, admits of many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which I explain thus. If we consider it abstractedly from its differences, 'tis a meer not yielding to Assent and Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

either of them; wherefore one of its Differences is <hi>inclining towards Assent,</hi> and may perhaps not unfitly be call'd <hi>Intellectual Hope</hi>; because, if the thing be our Concern, 'tis apt to principle that disposition of the Will which we properly call by that name. The other Difference is a <hi>dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and a thousand such-like odd Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But there needs no more to evince that all is to be called <hi>Suspense,</hi> till we arrive at <hi>Assent,</hi> than to reflect that Suspense is <hi>relative</hi> to Assent, as appears by the English phrase [<hi>To suspend ones-As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>] intimating that assoon as Suspense is taken away, immediately Assent follows; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves into this, that all is Suspense till we come to Assent. Indeed, some things so very seldom happen, as, that a House, seemingly firm, should fall, and such like rare Casualties, that unatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men are apt to assent absolutely upon such a very high Probability, and even in the wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and inconsiderate Livers, I doubt not but they often Assent absolutely the world's their own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond reason, that is, out of meer passion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, till some imminent danger give a check

to their blind Security; but the Reward of their Unreasonableness and Rashness in assenting abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without just ground, is this, that they have even from hence some less degree of Concern to amend their lives; and, if they be overtaken with any sudden disaster, less (if any) resignation to Gods holy disposition than they would have had, had they kept awake that degree of Suspense in their minds which Right Reason (the nature God had given them) requir'd they should.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. 'Tis time now to apply this discourse to Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Performances. It appears hence that one may have no reason to <hi>doubt</hi> of a thing, and yet withall have no reason in the world to <hi>assent</hi> firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it as a most Certain <hi>Truth,</hi> which onely is to his purpose: And this may be done two ways, either by perfectly suspending and inclining to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side; as we experience our Understanding now bears it self in order to the Stars being Even or Odd: Or by strongly <hi>hoping</hi> or <hi>inclining to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> the Thing is <hi>True</hi>; as when we expect a Friend such a time at <hi>London</hi> who never us'd to break his word; which expectation, though one may have very great ground to <hi>hope</hi> will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, yet it were a mad thing to assent to it as firmly as I do to my Faith, or that there is a GOD. But what <hi>I</hi> most admire is, that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> can think an Actual <hi>not doubting,</hi> or <hi>seeing no just cause to doubt,</hi> is a competent assurance of the Grounds for Christian Faith, as he all over inculcates. For not to repeat over again what hath been lately prov'd, that a bare <hi>not doubting</hi> is not sufficient

to make a man a Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rue, and <hi>see no just cause to doubt it</hi>; whence by this kind of arguing, if it be sufficient for Christian Faith to have such Grounds as exclude Doubt in its Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Turcism, Judaism, and perhaps Paganism too, may claim to be true Religions by the same Title; and, if the Certainty or Security of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion be no more but a freedom from doubt, all those wicked Sects have good reason to be held <hi>Certain</hi> too; and so <hi>both</hi> sides of the Contradiction may become Certain, by which stratagem Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is as compleatly revenged of his Enemies, <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> as his own heart could wish, and rewards his dear Friends and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Abetters, direct Contradictions, very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; advancing them to be First Principles, and even as Certain as Faith it self. Secondly, Passion and Vice can breed in a man a full persuasion that an Errour is True, and such an apprehension as shall take away all Actual Doubt; nay the more Passion a man is in, and the more obstinate he is in that passion, the less still he doubts: so that by Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Logick no man can tell whether Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity be indeed <hi>Rationally-wise or passionately-foolish,</hi> in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52024:68"/>
and so a most excellent way to be void of Actual Doubt, nay of all men in the world those who are perfectly ignorant see the least cause of doubting, being least able to raise any; wherefore, if being <hi>free from seeing any just cause of doubt,</hi> be the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Effect of Christian Grounds, let all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be but grosly ignorant, and they shall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately without more ado become as <hi>Free</hi> from Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Doubt as may be; and by that means be the best Christians in the world; and, consequently, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> be fundamentally establish'd by Dr. <hi>T. the Mother of all True Devotion.</hi> Fourthly, Though out of a stupid carelesness men use to take many things for granted upon slight Grounds while 'tis cheap to admit them, and no danger accrues upon the owning them; yet experience teaches us, that when any great Inconvenience presses, as the loss of Friends, Livelihood, or Life, Reason our true Nature, teaches men to study their careless thoughts over again; by which means they begin now to <hi>Doubt</hi> of that which before they took for granted, if they have not Certain Motives to establish them in the Truth of what they profess, and to ascertain to them some equivalent Good at least to what they are in danger to forego. In which case <hi>I</hi> fear it will yield small strength to a man put in such a strong Temptation, to find up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on review of his Grounds, that they were onely able to make him <hi>let them pass</hi> for good ones, while the Concern was remoter and less, but that notwithstanding all these, he sees they may perhaps be False, and himself a great Fool for

holding them True without Reasons convincing them to be so; and consequently foolish (perhaps wicked to boot) for suffering so deeply to attest them. If Dr. <hi>T.</hi> reply, That such men dying for what they conceiv'd Truth, <hi>meant well,</hi> and consequently acted virtuously; I must ask him how he <hi>knows</hi> that, or can make <hi>them</hi> know it, unless he propose Motives to conclude those Tenets <hi>True</hi>: For as <hi>Errour</hi> is the Parent and Origin of all <hi>Vice,</hi> so is <hi>Truth</hi> of all <hi>Virtue</hi>; nor is Virtue any thing but a Disposition of the Will to follow Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Truth. Whence, if we cannot be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52024:69"/>
of the whole World round about them, that is, as much as the nature of the thing could give them, though it were; for had there been indeed such Gods and Goddesses, yet, being in Heaven, they could have no more light concerning them than by Authority of others (relating also, as doubtlesly they did, many wonderful things concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be done by their means) and on the other side they had all the Authority extant at that time for them; and what doubts soever a few Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Learned men rais'd concerning them, yet the Generality, who were unacquainted with their thoughts, had no occasion to raise any at all: These advantages <hi>I</hi> say, the Heathens had, parallel within a very little, if not altogether, to Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Grounds and Principles; that is, able to produce an equal Effect, <hi>viz. Not-doubting</hi>: Yet because all hapt to be a Lye that they proceeded on, all their Religion for all this was wicked; and the the most zealous Devotion to Dame <hi>Juno</hi> and the rest, nay dying for their sakes, was notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their good meaning in common, Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Certainty and Firm Principle, a diabolical and mischievous Action, not a jot better, as to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of gaining Heaven, than the making their Children pass through the Fire to <hi>Moloch</hi>; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and destroying the Soul that perform'd it, nay dy'd for it; by <hi>addicting</hi> it to what was <hi>not</hi> its <hi>true last End</hi> or Eternal Good; and all this because there wanted <hi>Truth</hi> at the bottom to render those Actions and Sufferings <hi>Virtuous</hi>: Wherefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Dr. <hi>T.</hi> produces some immoveable Grounds to

            <p n="9">§. 9. Again, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> discourses all along as if all were well when one <hi>is</hi> free from all doubt; but I would desire his Friends seriously to ask him one question, which is, whether, though his Grounds exclude all doubt from his mind <hi>at present,</hi> yet he sees any certain Reason why he may not perhaps come to doubt of <hi>all</hi> his Faith, and even of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head too <hi>to morrow?</hi> If he says, <hi>He sees not but he may,</hi> he must say withal, that he <hi>sees it not</hi> (and consequently holds it not) <hi>to be True</hi>; for if he once <hi>saw</hi> it to be <hi>Truth,</hi> he could not hold it <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> ever to <hi>be doubted of</hi> with reason. If he affirms that he sees he can never come with reason to <hi>doubt</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52024:70"/>
of it, then he sees his Grounds for holding it <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be shown False,</hi> else it might both be <hi>doubted</hi> and (what is more) <hi>deny'd,</hi> and if he hold his Grounds cannot possibly be made out to be False, then he must say they are <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> and if they be Humane Authority, <hi>Infallible</hi>; which yet he stifly denies. But the plain Truth is, he holds not (by virtue of any Grounds he lays) his Faith to be <hi>True,</hi> but onely a plausible Likelihood; else Common Sence would force him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and stand to it, that the Grounds on which he builds his Assent are <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> and not to palliate his Uncertainty of it with such raw Principles and petty Crafts to avoid an honest down-right procedure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is to say plainly, <hi>My Grounds cannot fail of Concluding the Thing absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True, I will justifie them to be such, and here they are</hi>: But he is so far from this, that the best word he affords them who do this right to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, is to call them <hi>vapouring and swaggering men,</hi> with all the disgraceful <hi>Ironies</hi> he can put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

Next, he vouches not any Reason he brings to be absolutely Conclusive, and consequently owns not any Point of Faith, no not the Existence of a Deity, to be absolutely Certain; which not to <hi>assert,</hi> but (as has been shown from his Firm Principle) equivalently to <hi>deny,</hi> even then when he is maintaining it, is an Intolerable Prejudice to that Weighty and Excellent Cause he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and, so, is engag'd to defend. 3.

for to doubt a thing is <hi>to incline to think it False</hi>; and so, <hi>not to doubt,</hi> is barely <hi>not to incline to think it False,</hi> which is far short of <hi>holding</hi> it <hi>True,</hi> and consequently from making a man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. Besides, our <hi>not doubting</hi> may be in many regards Faulty, and spring from Surprize, Passion, and Ignorance, as well as from Ignorance (as hath been prov'd) but a good Reason <hi>cannot</hi> be faulty. Wherefore to relinquish the patronage of the Goodness and Validity, that is, absolute Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness of Christian Proofs (of which there are good store) for this point, defending onely their Plausibility, and instead of that victorious way of <hi>convincing</hi> the Understanding into <hi>Assent,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onely a feeble <hi>not doubting,</hi> is in plain terms to betray his Cause, and tacitly (or rather, indeed, too openly) to accuse Christianity of an Infirmity in its Grounds, as being incapable to effect what they ought, a <hi>Firm Assent</hi> to the Points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine as to <hi>absolutely certain</hi> Truths. 4. By making our Certainty of it, or the adequate <hi>effect</hi> of its Motives consist meerly in our <hi>not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it, he makes its Effect, and consequently the Efficacy of those Motives themselves, no better than those which Heathens, Turks and Hereticks have; for these also exclude Actual Doubt from the Minds of the Generality of these respective Sects: If he says Christians have no just reason to doubt, I ask him how he will prove that it must needs exclude all reason of Actual Doubt from the Minds even of the wisest Christians, unless he can prove those Grounds <hi>cannot</hi> possibly be doubted

of <hi>with reason</hi>; for, otherwise, if those men may <hi>possibly</hi> doubt with reason, 'tis ten to one they will do so <hi>actually</hi> at one time or other. He ought then to say those Motives exclude <hi>all possible doubt,</hi> or are <hi>undoubtable</hi> of their own nature, and so take it out of the <hi>Subjects</hi> strength or weakness, and put it upon the <hi>Objects:</hi> But this he is loth to say, dreading the Consequence, which is this, that he who affirms a Thing can never be possibly doubted of in true reason, must affirm withal that he has Motives <hi>concluding</hi> it <hi>absolutely True,</hi> that is, <hi>absolutely Impossible to be False,</hi> and, if it depends on Authority, <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> for it, which his superficial Reason, fully resolved against First Principles or <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> can never reach. It remains then that he must hold to Actual Not-doubting <hi>on the Subjects side</hi>; that is, he must say the Motives are onely such as preserv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Both exclude Actual Doubt in persons, as far as appears to us, equal in prudence as to other things; neither of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude possible Rational Doubt; each one had as much Evidence of their Deities they ador'd as they could have in their circumstances supposing those

Whether there were a <hi>Creation,</hi> or a First <hi>Being</hi> creating the World, whom we call GOD; so that all his Proofs are indifferently to be taken, as aim'd to evince one as well as the other. 2.

For, if it be but <hi>Likely,</hi> though it be <hi>exceedingly</hi> such, yet (as common Experience teaches us) it <hi>may</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be <hi>False</hi>: If the <hi>account</hi> he gives of a Deity creating the World, be onely <hi>no unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> one, this signifies onely that it has <hi>some Reason or other for it</hi>; and every man knows that seldom or never did two Wits discourse contrary Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Lawyers plead for contrary Causes, or Preachers preach for contrary Opinions, but there was some Reasons produc'd by them for either side; and, so, for any thing he has said, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist may come to give <hi>no unreasonable account too</hi> that there is no Deity, though it be something <hi>less rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> than that <hi>for</hi> a Deity.

               <p>That Dr. <hi>T.</hi> makes all the Grounds of Christian Faith <hi>Possible to be False.</hi> Of Infallibility, Demonstration, and Moral Certainty.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. THus much to justifie my first Charge that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> made that Fundamental Tenet of a Deity; and consequently all Religion <hi>Possible to be False.</hi> My second Charge is, that he particularly makes <hi>all Christian Faith possible to be false,</hi> and 'tis found <hi>Faith Vindicated,</hi> p. 171. where I put down his own words which concern that purpose; though he, who, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the Partiality of his Friends, takes the Liberty to say any thing which even Eye-sight may Confute, assures his Reader <hi>pag.</hi> 5. that <hi>I durst not Cite them.</hi> I laid my Charge in this Tenor: <hi>'Tis necessarily consequent from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Paragraphs, that, if I have Discours't right in this small Treatise of mine, and have proved that Faith, and consequently its Grounds, must be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be False, then Mr.</hi> T.'s <hi>Confession,</hi> p. 118. <hi>(to which Mr.</hi> St.'s <hi>Doctrine is Consonant) that</hi> [It is possible to be otherwise (<hi>that is, to be</hi> False) that any Book is so Antient as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52024:78"/>
to be, or that it was Written by him whose Name it bears, or that this is the sence of such and such Passages in it] <hi>is a clear Conviction that neither is the</hi> Book-Rule, <hi>he maintains the True Rule of Faith</hi> (§. 3.) <hi>Nor have he and his Friends</hi> True Faith, (§. 4.) <hi>And consequently there being no other Rule owned (taking away</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit) <hi>but</hi> Tradition, <hi>that</hi> Tradition <hi>is the</hi> only-True Rule of Faith, (§. 6.) <hi>and so the main of</hi> Sure-Footing <hi>stands yet firm.

The Charge is laid, and the Case is put, now let us come to the Trial: Which ere we do, I desire those Readers who have Dr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Preface by them to read his 9<hi>th. page,</hi> or else his whole <hi>page</hi> 118. in his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> lest either of us may injure him by a wrong Apprehension. I discourse thus,</p>
            <p n="2">§<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. First, 'tis Evident that he who makes the Ground and <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith <hi>possible to be False</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes <hi>Faith</hi> it self <hi>such</hi> likewise; since nothing is or can be stronger than the Grounds it stands on.</p>
            <p>Next, the Rule of Faith to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52024:79"/>
               <hi>Scripture's Letter,</hi> and consequently that what he conceives the Sense of the Scripture is God's Sense, or Faith.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that in the place now Cited and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by him, he speaks of the Authority of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and of its <hi>Sence,</hi> as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges here, <hi>page</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>These things thus premised, I put him this <hi>Dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mma.</hi> Either he holds what he conceives to to be the Sence of Scripture (that is his <hi>Faith</hi>) True, or he does not: If he holds it not to be <hi>True,</hi> then 'tis unavoidable he must hold it (at least) <hi>possible to be False,</hi> if not actually such. But if he says he holds it to be <hi>True,</hi> then since after he had spoke of the <hi>security</hi> he had, or had not of the Book and Sense of Scripture, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately subjoyns these very words, <hi>It is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay be otherwise</hi>: He as evidently says that what he conceives the <hi>Book</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Sence</hi> of such or such passages in it (that is his <hi>Faith) is possible to be False,</hi> as 'tis that what's <hi>OTHERWISE THAN TRVE,</hi> is <hi>False.</hi> I do not know how Dr. <hi>T.</hi> could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly speak more plainly what I charge him with, than he has done in those words, unless he should use the word [<hi>False</hi>] which too Candid and Rude expression, would expose him openly to the dislike of all Sober m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and therefore he disguiz'd it in its more moderate Equivalent [<hi>otherwise.</hi>] I say <hi>Equivalent:</hi> And, if it be not, <hi>I</hi> would gladly know of him what the word [<hi>otherwise</hi>] relates to: Human Language for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52024:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that any thing can be said to be <hi>otherwise</hi> unless it be otherwise <hi>than something.</hi> I ask then <hi>otherwise than what</hi> does he mean, when, being in the Circumstance of Discoursing, what security he had of the <hi>Antiquity, Writers,</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi> of Scripture, he told us, <hi>It is possible to may be otherwise?</hi> Is it not as evident as words can express, he must mean, <hi>It is possible</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> of Scripture is not <hi>so anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt</hi> as the Apostles time: It is <hi>possible</hi> it was not <hi>Writ</hi> by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Evangelists: <hi>It is possible</hi> this is not the <hi>Sence</hi> of it in such passages as concern Faith; for to these, and these only our Discourse, and the Nature and Title of his Book determin'd it; which amounts to this, that none has absolute Certainty of either <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>Sence</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> nor consequently of his <hi>Faith,</hi> in case it be solely grounded upon that, as he professes. See Reader, how all Truths even the most Sacred ones go to wrack, when men fram'd only for <hi>fine Talk</hi> undertake to <hi>prove</hi>; and how parallel his defence of the Ground of all Christian Faith is to that he gave us lately of the <hi>Existence</hi> of a Deity: He so prov'd a <hi>God,</hi> that he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it <hi>possible</hi> there might be <hi>none,</hi> and now he so proves Scripture to be a <hi>Rule,</hi> that he grants it possible it may be <hi>no</hi> Rule, since common Sence tells us that can never be an Intellectual Rule which followed may lead into Errour. By which we see Dr. <hi>T.</hi> needed here the <hi>Blessing</hi> (as he calls it) of that <hi>Identical</hi> Proposition [<hi>A Rule's a Rule</hi>] else he would not write a Book to prove
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52024:80"/>
Scripture a <hi>Rule,</hi> and then ever and anon in equivalent Language tell us 'tis <hi>none.</hi> I wish he would now and then reflect upon such Evident Truths; and not out of an openly-declar'd Feud against those First Principles fall thus perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually into manifest Contradictions.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. But how does Dr. <hi>T.</hi> clear himself of this Charge of mine, or how comes he off from his own words? First, he again puts down those very words, which say over and over what I charge upon him; and then asks very confidently where he says any such thing? which is just as wise a craft as Children use when they hoodwink themselves, and then tell the By-standers they shall not see them. Next, he tells us, that <hi>All,</hi> he <hi>sayes,</hi> is, that <hi>we are not Infallible in judging of the Antiquity of a Book, or the sence of it, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we cannot demonstrate these things so, as to to shew the contrary necessarily involves a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but yet,</hi> &amp;c. Is this <hi>all</hi> he sayes? What then is become of those famous words, [<hi>It is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all this may be otherwise;</hi>] which were <hi>onely</hi> objected? But let us examine what he <hi>does</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Whether <hi>he</hi> be Infallibly certain or <hi>no,</hi> it matters <hi>not:</hi> but it should be shewn why, if Scripture be the sole Ground of Faith, some at least in the World who are to Govern and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Church should not be thus certain of both in case we be bound to assent, and (as we questionless are) dy to attest the Points of our Faith to be <hi>absolutely-certain Truths.</hi> Again, if
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52024:80"/>
Dr. <hi>T.</hi> be not <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of these things, then let him say he is <hi>fallibly certain</hi> of it; which done, Nature will shew him how perfect Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence he speaks; whence the same Nature will tell him with a little reflexion, that, since the word <hi>Infallibly</hi> can with good sence be joyn'd with the word <hi>Certain,</hi> either 'tis <hi>adeqaate</hi> to that word, and <hi>extends</hi> its sence as <hi>far</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and then there is <hi>no</hi> Certainty where there is not <hi>Infallibility</hi>; or it does <hi>not</hi> extend <hi>as far</hi> as the word <hi>Certain</hi>; and then we may be <hi>Certain</hi> of some things yet <hi>not-Infallibly</hi> Certain; which, since [<hi>not-Infallibly</hi>] means [<hi>Fallibly</hi>] signifies clearly we may be <hi>fallibly certain</hi> of those things: But common sence teaches us how ridiculous 'tis to say, we are <hi>fallibly certain</hi> of any thing. 'Tis most evident therefore and demonstrable, that there is no Certainty but where there is Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and that we can never be said to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Certain</hi> of any thing, till all circumstances consider'd, we see our selves out of possibility of being deceived, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in that very thing. Whence Dr. <hi>T.</hi> denying <hi>Infallible</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of both Letter and Sence of Scripture, is convinc'd to deny all true Certainty of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so to render all Faith built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it Uncertain, that is, <hi>possible to be false</hi>; and, could he with sense take the other part of the distinction, and say, he is <hi>fallibly certain</hi> of it, yet the guilt of the same Position will still remain with him. This Logical Demonstration I produc'd in <hi>Faith Vindicated, pag.</hi> 37. of which

            <p n="4">§. 4. I shall endeavour to give him another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Necessity of admitting <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52024:81"/>
though I have good reason to fear he will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it again no other Answer but only this, that I am the first man that ever produc'd it. 'Tis this. Taking the word [<hi>False</hi>] or [<hi>Falsus</hi>] subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, or as <hi>in</hi> the Subject, that is, as making the Jugment <hi>False</hi> or <hi>Erroneous</hi>: 'tis a Participle of the Verb [<hi>Fallor</hi>] and signifies <hi>deceived</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to which corresponds as its proper Power [<hi>Fallible</hi>] or, <hi>capable to be deceived:</hi> Now the contrary to [<hi>False</hi>] thus understood, is <hi>True,</hi> taken also subjectively, or as making the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which in it is <hi>True</hi> or Un-erroneous in that its Act. Wherefore the proper Power correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Act must necessarily be that which is oppos'd to <hi>Fallible,</hi> that is [<hi>Infallible.</hi>] Again, taking the word <hi>False</hi> Objectively, or as found in the Proposition which is the Object or Cause of our Judgment as 'tis <hi>false</hi> or actually <hi>deceived:</hi> Its proper Power corresponding to it is [<hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deceive.</hi>] Wherefore, also, taking its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit [<hi>Truth</hi>] Objectively, or for the Object of our Judgment when 'tis <hi>True,</hi> the proper <hi>Power</hi> corresponding to it must be <hi>Incapable to deceive.</hi> 'Tis concluded then from both these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we can neither affirm Points or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positiont of Faith (which are the Objects of such Acts) <hi>True,</hi> but we must affirm withal that they are <hi>Incapable</hi> to make us <hi>judge erroneously</hi> while we <hi>assent</hi> to them; nor that our Judgment or Act of Faith can be <hi>True</hi> or Un-erroneous, but we must be <hi>Infallible</hi> in so judging. Thus far concerning the necessity of admitting <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52024:82"/>
if we once put our Assents or Acts of Faith to be <hi>true Judgments.</hi> From which 'tis a different Question to ask <hi>how</hi> we <hi>become</hi> thus Infallible; onely 'tis Evident, that, in case the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be put, (<hi>viz,</hi> that we must affirm our Acts of Faith <hi>True,) Infallible</hi> we must be, or <hi>Impossible to be in an Errour</hi> when we make those Acts. But now, to this Infallibility in those Acts God's Providence leads men diversly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several degrees of Capacity: Those who are arriv'd to a great pitch of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to it by absolutely-concluding proofs, call'd <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> that is, by penetrating the nature of the Authority on which it is built: and, such men can make out clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their own Thoughts the Certainty of that Authority, by discoursing it to themselves &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they can resolve it into its Grounds, meet with and answer Objections, and in a word, <hi>see</hi> themselves to be Infallibly Certain of it. In these men therefore, though the Truth of their Tenet be indeed taken from the Object (as 'tis always) yet the Clearness, Distinctness, and firm Strength of it springs from the Perfection of their well-cultivated Understanding. Those who are of a weak pitch are led to it by Practical Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the nature of Authority, and of the way in common by which they receive Faith; which dim, rude sight, even in the simplest, serves to carry them on to act according to right nature when they assent; but they cannot discourse their thoughts, nor resolve them into Principles,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52024:82"/>
nor answer Objections, nor see themselves clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be infallibly Certain. Nay more, the greatest part of these, especially if very simple, do by some lucky chance (or rather by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular disposition of Gods good Providence) <hi>light</hi> upon this right way, more than by any strength of their own wit, looking into Grounds; but, being in it once, they find that which satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them according to knowledges familiariz'd to them by converse with the World, and which are of themselves, solid and satisfactory. In a word, it became Gods goodness so to order things, that the Acts of all the Faithful might be as much as was possible in men of every pitch and capacity, <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Virtuous</hi>; whatever Contingency may happen in some particulars; Original Sin, and by it, Passion, Ignorance, or Interest sometimes byassing them and making them act with precipitancy. In which case what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>good</hi> in those Acts of Faith is refunded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, the Author of every good Gift as its Original Cause; what Defective, into the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness and Imperfection of Creatures.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. This Tenet of <hi>Infallibility</hi> which unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Nature teaches even the rudest in things subject to Sense and common Reason, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in things provable by exact Art, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of true Certainty, our Scepticks in Religion, endeavour to render ridiculous and cast a mist about it by the most unreasonable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that ever was invented; which is, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52024:83"/>
that a man cannot be Infallible in one thing but he must be so in all.

to reflect that when I say, The Thing is <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable,</hi> or pretend to <hi>demonstrate,</hi> I do not take the word <hi>Demonstration</hi> with all those many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties and perquisits the Schools require; I as little love niceties as any man living, and can as easily dispense with them so the solid part be well provided for, and the Truth of the Thing establisht, which if it be not done, I make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count nothing is done, in these cases in which As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent &amp; dying to attest things to be Truths are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.

This every Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man sees is his only way to come off; but this he neither has attempted to do, nor ever shall be in the least able to compass, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his costly anger against First Principles, his drollish Abuses against Demonstration, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing the things of Invisibleness instead of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

But I foresee three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable difficulties lie in his way; first, that he sees his Cause cannot bear it, for which he still blames the Nature of the Thing. Next, that the deep Study, or the most Learned Science of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant Expressions so totally possesses his Mind, it will not let <hi>Logick</hi> have any part in his thought: And lastly, if it does, yet he may hap to meet there with some unelegant Terms of Art which will quite fright him from his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and make him forswear the most evident Truths in the world.</p>

The last meaning he gives of the word [<hi>Faith,</hi>] which is the <hi>Means and Motives to Faith,</hi> is nearest to mine: But, because he leaves out the consideration of their <hi>being ordained by God for his Church</hi>

Having view'd my Discourse, I desire the Reader to peruse the Answer here given by my Confuter: He names the word <hi>Argument,</hi> says two pretty words upon it, that 'tis <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>surprizing</hi>; leaves out better half of it, conceals perfectly all that part of it which concludes strongly against his own insufficient Grounds; catches at a word, and would make my Discouse and Argument aim to prove Faith Impossible to be False, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Motives are only <hi>seemingly</hi> such. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every Page in that Book, and its whole Design shews I meant and prov'd them to be actually, really and <hi>indeed</hi> such. Had I a mind to evade such petty Cavils, I could alledg that both may <hi>seem</hi> Impossible to be False; yet one <hi>more</hi> seem so than the other: But the Truth is, advancing to confute him, I argu'd <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that against a <hi>seeming Impossibility to be True,</hi> nothing but Motives <hi>seemingly Impossible to be False,</hi> can with any show of Reason be held convictive; but he had no Motives even <hi>seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impossible to be False,</hi> but confessedly <hi>Possible</hi> to be <hi>such,</hi> therefore they had no imaginable

show of Convictiveness. I grant then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis a <hi>drawn Match</hi> (as he calls it) between <hi>equally-seeming Impossibilities</hi>; and because <hi>'tis so,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>seeming Impossibility to be True,</hi> in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is by much an overmatch to what's <hi>less</hi> than a seeming Impossibility to be False in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> or Grounds; but, both Letter and Sence of Scripture, his Grounds of Faith, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly <hi>possible to be otherwise,</hi> that is, <hi>False,</hi> and so are <hi>less</hi> than <hi>seemingly</hi> (even to himself) <hi>impossible to be False,</hi> therefore his Motives to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are incomparably overmatcht by the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Mysteries to be believed, and so there could be rationally, according to his Grounds, no Faith at all. This is my true <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which perhaps might be <hi>surprizing</hi> to him, which made him thus start aside from putting or answering it, though we may perceive by his carriage he esteems not it, and others such like, very <hi>pleasant.</hi> Indeed he still puts on a <hi>pleasant</hi> Look when he should be Sober, and is ever most Merry when it becomes him to be the most Serious; but this is long since understood to be a necessary Policy, not a Genuine effect of Nature. He tells us that Transubstantiation is <hi>evidently Impossible to be True</hi>: If so, then it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies some Contradiction; which if he shows me in any thing held of Faith by <hi>Catholicks</hi> in that Point, I will become Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s.

The main point then that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ever misses in is this, that he still omits to state what certainty is due to Christian Faith, and its Grounds <hi>per se loquendo,</hi> or according to its own Nature, and the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Acts it must produce, and the difficulties it must struggle through and overcome, even in the <hi>Wisest</hi> and <hi>most Rational</hi> persons, who are to be

And this he is <hi>forc'd</hi> to do, because he sees that, should he treat of it as it ought to be, or according to what it would be by virtue of the Motives laid by the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of every perfect Gift, to bring mankind to Faith, singly and solely consider'd, without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling the Imperfection of Creatures with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise most powerful and wise Efficiency, the Grounds of Christian Faith must be able to subdue to a <hi>hearty Assent</hi> the most Learned and wisest portions of Mankind, which they could never do while they are seen by them to be <hi>Possible to be False.</hi>

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this better, let us reflect that the self-same thing may be corporally seen by several men, and each infallibly know what it is by means of that sight; yet because one of them has <hi>better Eyes</hi> than another, one sees <hi>more clearly</hi> what 'tis, the other <hi>less.</hi> Also, the Blessed Saints and Angels in Heaven differ from one another in glory, or, in greater and lesser degrees of the blissful Vision; that is, one sees the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <hi>better,</hi> another <hi>not so well</hi>; yet the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject being <hi>one Indivisible formality,</hi> one cannot <hi>see more</hi> than another; wherefore their great degree of Glory consists in this, that one <hi>penetrates</hi> it <hi>better,</hi> and (as it were) sinks it deeper in the knowing Power than another does; which springs out of the several dispositions of the Subject, or the antecedent Love of God; which when 'tis greater, it more intimately and closely applies the Divine Object to the fervently<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis the <hi>Thing,</hi> properly speaking, is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted,</hi> or not-doubted of, and not the <hi>Assent:</hi> But that's but a slip of word; I conceive by the word [<hi>yet</hi>] which introduces it, he means an <hi>undoubtful Assent</hi> (onely he fear'd the Inelegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the word) in opposition to the <hi>doubtful Assent</hi> here spoken of; and, because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (speaking properly) the opposit to <hi>Doubt</hi> is <hi>Hope,</hi> an <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtful</hi> Assent means a <hi>Hopeful Assent</hi>; which, since <hi>Doubting</hi> speaks a Disinclining to assent or judge the thing so, and <hi>Hoping</hi> an inclining to it, very fairly gives us a second dish of an <hi>Assent</hi> which is no <hi>Assent</hi>; for <hi>Inclining</hi> only to be, is <hi>not being</hi> such, and so <hi>Inclining to Assent,</hi> how strong soever it be, is in reality <hi>no Assent.</hi> Well; Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s resolution against Identical Propositions was certainly the most fatal bolt that ever was shot, making him discourse like the man that said he had <hi>three Lights</hi> in him, a <hi>great</hi> Light, a <hi>little</hi> Light, and <hi>no Light</hi> at all. Next, I would know what grounds are fully fit to satisfy a prudent man; One man likes some Grounds,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52024:95"/>
others like others: A sleight proof from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture likes some man better than the Practice of the Church, the Consent of Mankind, or the clearest Demonstration; another (I mean the Atheist) likes a plausible Reason that sutes with and takes fancy better than all of them together: A third likes Nonsense prettily exprest better than the clearest Truths unelegantly deliver'd.

Nay more there are questionless amongst Turks, and even Heathens divers men of grert <hi>Natural Prudence</hi> (and we can only mean <hi>such</hi> a Prudence antecedently to the Illumination of Faith) and they too have Grounds <hi>fit fully to satisfie</hi> them, for they doe <hi>actually satisfie</hi> them, so that they see not the <hi>least

Reason to doubt</hi> of what they profess; and, so according to Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s discourse <hi>these</hi> too have <hi>moral Certainty</hi> of what they hold. Wherefore, unless we could <hi>state</hi> what's meant by a <hi>prudent man,</hi> we can never come to <hi>understand</hi> what is meant by Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when Faith is Certain, when not; nay, which is worse, if <hi>moral Certainty</hi> be that which he appoints as sufficient for Faith; and for any thing appears by his words, Turks, Heathens, and all Hereticks have the same (since they have such Grounds as do fully <hi>satisfie prudent men</hi>) it will follow that they may have as good Grounds as Christians have; at least, that no man can tell who have <hi>right</hi> Grounds of Faith, who <hi>not,</hi> since this notion of [<hi>what is fit fully to satisfie a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man</hi>] has no determinate limits to state the nature of this mock-Certainty.

Both alledge Scripture,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52024:96"/>
each sees no Reason to doubt of his own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and both are fully satisfi'd, that is, both have Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> and so <hi>both</hi> must be in the right, if <hi>his Grounds</hi> be in the right; that is, <hi>both</hi> sides of the Contradiction must be <hi>True,</hi> if Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>Faith</hi> be <hi>True,</hi> built on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>moral Certainty</hi>; which would utterly destroy his enemies <hi>Identical Propositions.</hi> I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, at least, why these two equally matcht Moral Certainties shall not make a drawn battel of it, or how it shall be determin'd on whose side the Certain Truth stands. I doubt it will be the hardest task that ever was, for him to make it even <hi>morally Certain</hi> there is a <hi>Trinity,</hi> for this cannot be done but by manifesting the Letter of Scripture, bears no shadow of Reason on the Socinians side; otherwise that seeming Reason may be a just cause for a Protestant to <hi>suspend,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>doubt</hi> of it, and so not be morally-Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

               <p> In what manner Dr. <hi>T.</hi> replies to FAITH VINDICATED.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">§ 1. DR. <hi>T.</hi> has no Fellow, nor his way of Confute any parallel. Not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the peevishness of malice too far, and yet follow home my blow more fully, and yet withal to uphold the Efficacie of Faith grounded on the just Conceit of its Absolute Certainty; I writ a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52024:102"/>
a Book, call'd <hi>Faith Vindicated,</hi> in behalf of Christian Faith in Common, shewing the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty or Security from Error of that kind of Assent, provided it be grounded on those Motives God had left to settle his Church, and, by it, Mankind in Faith, as I declared my self in my <hi>Introduction:</hi> It pretended Demonstration from the beginning to the end, and had not one drollish or unsober expression in it: Take a Map of it in a few words. I conceiv'd my self debtor both <hi>Sapientibus</hi> and <hi>Insipientibus,</hi> and hence the Concern being common to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, amongst the rest to Speculative Divines, I resolv'd to prove it by Arguments sutable to <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Capacity. To the more Intelligent, to the end of the Third Eviction: to the Middle or Prudential sort, to the end of the Fifth· and to them of the lowest Capacity in the last: every one being enabled by Tradition or Education to comprehend what the <hi>common Language and Practice of Christianity</hi> teaches them, as to Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees and Carriages appertaining to Faith. I begun (after I had put two <hi>Postulatum</hi> granted by all Christians) with Logical Arguments; which I pursu'd at large, because as 'tis a common Trick in Sophisters and half Logicians, to abuse that Excellent Art to elude the clearest Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, so it became a more necessary Duty in me to prevent by the closest Proofs, fetch't from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Heads imaginable that belong'd to that skill, any misusages of its Maxims to patronize Falshood. This could be no other than very Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52024:103"/>
and accordingly I declar'd in my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, what my Reader was to expect, in Discourses of that kind; nor will any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with common Sense wonder that I should use Logical Expressions when I make Logical Discourses, or Terms of Art when I speak to Scholars. These things reflected on, let us see now what a dextrous way our Learned Confuter takes to answer that whole Book, (for he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests here an intention to give it no other) and to overthrow so many Demonstrations.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. His first way of Confute is, to pick out a leaf or two of the most Speculative part of that Treatise, only intended for Scholars, and apply it to the Understandings of those who are onely Sermon-pitch: to whom, because such Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are unsutable, and withal too hard for him to answer, hence he very politickly both gratifies the Fancies of those Readers, and avoids him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the difficult task of answering the pressing Reason in it, by playing the Wit, when 'twas dangerous to act the Scholar, and making use of his constant Friend at a dead lift, <hi>Drollery,</hi> in stead of relying on the Patronage of Reason, which (as he experiences) so often betrays and exposes hss weakness. He runs on therefore a whole leaf or two in this jovial Career ere he can recover himself, till even his own Friends who are not aware of the necessity, admire at his endless Raillery; and, true to his Method, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects wholly the Sense, and excepts mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52024:103"/>
five or six hard words; namely, <hi>potentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, actuality, actuation, determinative, supervene,</hi> and <hi>subsume</hi>; which, it seems puzzle him exceedingly; for he professes to think them <hi>Mystical.</hi> He calls the Discourse <hi>jargon, Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and <hi>Nonsense</hi> (which two last words he is ever most free of, when his Reason is most at a loss.) He likens it to the <hi>Coptick</hi> and <hi>Slavonian Language,</hi> talks of Astrology, Palmistry, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, and what not? and with such kind of stuff confutes, it most unmercifully even to utter desolation.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. In return to which kind of carriage, (though it deserves only contempt) let us hear first how Dr. <hi>T.</hi> answers himself; who (<hi>Serm pag.</hi> 120.121.) very zealously reprehends and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es against this absurd Fault in himself, in these words. <hi>Let none</hi> (sayes he) <hi>think the worse of Religion</hi> [or those Reasons which oblige us to profess 'tis absolutely-True] <hi>because some are so bold, to despise and deride. — For, 'tis no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to any person or thing to be laught at, but to deserve to be so. The most grave and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matters in the whole world are liable to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd — Nothing is so excellent, but a man may fasten upon it something or other, belonging to it, whereby to traduce it. A sharp wit may find something in the wisest man, whereby to expose him to the contempt of Injudicious people. The gravest Book that ever was written, may be made ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by applying the sayings of it to a foolish purpose; For a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st may be obtruded upon any thing. And
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52024:104"/>
therefore no man ought to have the less Reverence for the Principles of Religion</hi> [or those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which oblige us to hold and profess Faith absolutely-True] <hi>because idle and prophane WITS</hi> [nonplust Controvertists] <hi>can BREAK IESTS upon them. Nothing is so easie</hi> [Dr. <hi>T.</hi> knows that by long and very useful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence] <hi>as to take PARTICVLAR PHRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES and EXPRESSIONS out of the best Book in the world; and to abuse them by forcing an odd and ridiculous Sense upon them. But no wise man will think a good Book FOOLISH for this Reason; but the MAN that abuses it. Nor will he esteem that to which every thing is liable to be a IVST Exception against any thing. At this rate ase must despise ALL things. But, surely, the better and shorter way is to condemn THOSE who would bring any thing that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy into Contempt.</hi> Also in his foregoing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>pag.</hi> 86, 87. he gives good Doctrine to the same purpose; but never intended to follow it himself. <hi>These things</hi> [whether Faith be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely true or no] are of <hi>Infinit consequence to us, and therefore — 'tis not a matter to be slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and superficially thought upon, much less (AS THE WAY OF ATHEISTICAL MEN IS) to be PLAID and IEST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED withal. If any one shall turn Religion</hi> (or a Discourse aiming to shew it absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) <hi>into Raillery, and think to CONFVTE it by two or three BOLD IESTS, this man doth not render IT, but HIMSELF Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:52024:104"/>
Again, <hi>Though the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> (or the Proofs of Faith's absolute Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) <hi>were never so clear and evident, yet they may be made RIDICVLOVS by VAIN and FROTHY MEN; as the gravest and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest personage in the world may be abus'd by being put into a Fools Coat, and the most Noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Poem may be debas'd and made vile by being turn'd into BVRLES QVE.</hi> Thus Dr, <hi>T.</hi> by Preaching what he never intended to Practice has most amply laid open his own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hits himself still, while he aims at the Atheist: and no wonder, for their Causes (as far as I impugn him here) are not very wide of one another; since nothing approaches neerer to the <hi>denying</hi> all Religion than to hold it all <hi>Vncertain.</hi> At least I would gladly know of him in what his <hi>way of Discourse</hi> here against my Reasons for the Absolute Certainty of Faith differs from that of Atheists against a Deity, and all Religion. The Points to be considered by both of them are of a solid and concerning Nature, and both handle them <hi>drollishly,</hi> and make <hi>Raillery</hi> supply the place of <hi>Reason.</hi> Nor will it avail him to reply that my Proofs were not solid, and so oughr to be confuted with mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; For he ought first shew by reason that they thus highly misdeserve, and then employ his Talent of Irony upon them afterwards; and not make meer Irony supply the place of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Besides, himself acknowledges <hi>pag</hi> 87. that, <hi>If the Principles of Religion were doubtful
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52024:105"/>
and Vncertain, yet this concerns us so neerly that we ought to be serious in the Examination of them.</hi> And, certainly, no judicious or good man will doubt, but that it highly and neerly concerns all good Christians to know, whether their Faith, the Substance of all their Hope, particularly the Existence of a Trinity and Incarnation, the Points I mention'd, be absolutely Certain or not. I leave it to the choice of Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Friends whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will rather approve his <hi>Doctrine</hi> in his <hi>Sermons,</hi> or his unconsonant <hi>Practice</hi> in this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi> If the former, they must condemn him out of his own mouth to be Foolish, Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and an Imitator of <hi>Atheists,</hi> and his way of writing <hi>Insignificant:</hi> But, if they like the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then they must conclude his Sermons as equally blame-worthy for opposing so laudable a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Unfortunate man, who very gravely takes Texts against <hi>Scoffers,</hi> and makes Sermons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and then behaves himself all over so <hi>Scurrilously</hi> and Drollishly in his whole Preface to them, as levels those very Sermons as directly against himself, as could possibly be contriv'd or imagin'd: Which is in effect by his carriage, to tell the Atheist, that that <hi>Scoffing</hi> and <hi>Drollish</hi> way of answering and managing Discourses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, which is so <hi>horrid sin</hi> in them because they are of the <hi>Vngodly</hi> and <hi>Wicked,</hi> is notwithstanding <hi>none</hi> at all but a <hi>very great Virtue</hi> in the <hi>Saints</hi> and the <hi>Godly</hi>; and in a particular manner <hi>Meritorious</hi> so it be practis'd against <hi>those Men of sin, the most abhominable Papists.</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:52024:105"/>§. 4. Besides, as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> well observed when he was in a more sober humour, <hi>Every thing,</hi> even the best, <hi>is liable to be abus'd and made ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous by drollish Jests,</hi> and consequently this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod be so exactly observss when he is to confute me, <hi>will</hi> (as he very well expresses it in his Pref. <hi>pag.</hi> 26) <hi>equally serve to prove or confute any thing.</hi> To shew the all-powerful strength and virtue of it, let us imagine that <hi>Euclid,</hi> had been a Catholick, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> might have preacht <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

First he might pick out some Demonstrations of his in which were five or six words harder than ordinary (at least too hard for the Vulgar, though clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Learned men in that Art) as <hi>Isosce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Parallelograms, Parallelepipe, Cylinder, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, Eicosaedron,</hi> and such like; and when he had transcrib'd them into a Ridiculous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face which he was sure no good Mathematicians would ever care to read, but vulgar Souls would much admire, and out of their hatred to these
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52024:106"/>
               <hi>Popish Conjurers,</hi> cry up: He might proceed to confute him on this manner. <hi>I have here</hi> (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) <hi>presented thee with a discourse, which, if we may believe</hi> Euclid <hi>is mathematically demonstrable. A rare sight indeed! Certainly, the sacred names of Principles and Demonstrations were never so prophan'd by any man before. Might not any one write a Book of such Jargon and call it Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? — If he intended this stuff for satisfaction of the people</hi> (as it seem'd by his writing it in Greek, the vulgar Tongue, he did) <hi>he might as well have writ it in the Coptick or Sclavonian Language. Yet I cannot deny but this is very sutable to the Principles of the Roman Church, For why should not their Science as well as their Service be in an unknown Tongue?— Certainly his Talent does not lie for Science.— Learned men are less apt to admire Nonsense than the common people— Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Harphius, nor Rusbrochius,</hi> (Dr. <hi>Faustus,</hi> Frier <hi>Bungy) nor the profound Mother Juliana</hi> (or Mother <hi>Shipton) ever spoke any thing</hi> (charm) <hi>more sensless and obscure.— He hath a style pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly fitted for Mysticks</hi> (Magick) <hi>For even in this parcel of stuff there are five or six words</hi> (such as Isosceles, Patallelograms, Parall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

take that let him and his Fellow-Conspirators, in malice against Catholicks but resolve to Preach and Write as earnestly that <hi>Mathematicians</hi> are <hi>Conjurers,</hi> as they do that <hi>Catholicks</hi> are <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> (which, of the two, is the far easier to prove,) and the Method he observes in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his, would equally serve to confute <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid</hi> as it does <hi>me.</hi> And the like force it would have against any Logical, Metaphysical, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Medicinal, Rhetorical, Poetical, or even Grammatical Discourse: Each have their Terms of Art proper to themselves, which look odd and uncouth to the Vulgar; and so are equally liable to be abus'd and rendred ridiculous, to men whose practice is to read Sermons.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. But can Dr. <hi>T.</hi> seriously think these words to be indeed so hard as he pretends? The word [<hi>Potential</hi>] was familiar to us both when we were in our Accidence and talkt of the <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mood</hi>; Also [<hi>Actual</hi>] and <hi>determin</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious; I suppose then 'tis their ending in those common Terminations [<hi>ty</hi>] [<hi>tion</hi>] and [<hi>tiue</hi>] which makes <hi>potentiality, actuality, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and <hi>determinative</hi> so insuperably hard. As for <hi>Supervene</hi> and <hi>Subsume,</hi> it may justly be wondred whether the difficulty lies in knowing what's the signification of the Verbs <hi>Venio</hi> and <hi>Sumo</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Prepositions <hi>Super</hi> and <hi>Sub.</hi> But he means they are not <hi>trim</hi> and <hi>Elegant</hi> enough: Alas, good Gentleman! I doubt there are some who complain of the Tenderness of their Ears,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52024:107"/>
when the true Reason is the Softness of their Heads. But enough of this.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Let us now proceed to examine the true force of one of these Demonstrations which he most opposes with Drollery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall see that it was both his concern to answer it, and withal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he should, which joyn'd, no wonder he endeavoured to evade thus, it being the best shift he had.

Also, that amongst Human Notions some are more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential, that is more General than others, and that those General Notions are divided or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht into more particular ones by certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52024:107"/>
case the Subject can be distinguisht as little as the other (which I there prov'd) it must follow that those Propositions which have in them <hi>such</hi> a Predicate must be admitted in their whole La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and simply as the words lie. Seeing then Christians are bound to profess their Faith <hi>True</hi> as to those Points of a <hi>Trinity</hi> (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) or <hi>Incarnation,</hi> or that a Trinity or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation <hi>Exist,</hi> and the Predicate <hi>Existent,</hi> can bear no Distinction dividing its simplest notion, such as are <hi>morally, hopefully, in great Likelihood,</hi> or such dwindling kind of Sceptical or half-Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical expressions, it follows that it must be <hi>affirm'd</hi> and <hi>held</hi> that a <hi>Trinity,</hi> or <hi>Incarnation</hi> absolutely <hi>is,</hi> and, consequently, that 'tis <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible not to be</hi>; whence follows that, it being Blasphemy to say that God has made a rational Nature, or a Nature to assent upon <hi>motives,</hi> and then commanded it to be <hi>not-rational,</hi> that is to assent <hi>beyond the Motive,</hi> whieh is (as to that degree of Assent which is <hi>beyond) without</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, we must conclude that, however Created understandings fall short in penetrating them, or Miscarry in discoursing them, the Grounds of our holding <hi>thus,</hi> as laid by God, must be <hi>absolutely Conclusive,</hi> or <hi>impossible not to conclude</hi> the thing is; and not only <hi>morally</hi> Conclusive, <hi>morally</hi> Certain, <hi>great Likelihoods, Fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitys, freeing only from Actual doubt,</hi> and such like. Wherefore if Dr. <hi>T.</hi> would approve himself worthy to Write or Discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grounds of Faith, he ought to profess
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52024:108"/>
and produce <hi>such,</hi> since nothing else reaches the nature of Faith, or can rationally ground the the Obligation impos'd by God himself, of professing and holding that the Thing absolutely <hi>is:</hi> But he was conscious to himself he had none <hi>such,</hi> or absolutely Conclusive, therefore he was forc't to play the Droll and mock at the close Reasons that would oblige him to it, instead of answering them.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. This is the Argument which our great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, who is still most merry when he should be most serious, likens to Astrology, Palmistry and Chymistry; and sayes that Arguments from these <hi>could not have been more ridiculous than to argue that what is True, is Imprssible to be False from the Nature of</hi> Subject, Predicate, <hi>and</hi> Copula: <hi>For</hi> (sayes he) <hi>be the Propositions True or False; these are of the same Nature in both; that is, they are</hi> Subject, Predicate, and Copula. Which learned Answer is built on two manifest Falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of that whole Discourse. One that I am meerly proving or concluding there, that <hi>what is True is Impossible to be False</hi>; whereas my ultimate Intent in the former Proof (as put down by himself here, <hi>pag.</hi> 24.) is to conclude it <hi>Impossible</hi> that <hi>THESE Points of Faith should be False</hi>; that is, <hi>SVCH points as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press only the</hi> An est <hi>of a thing,</hi> and so have for their Predicate <hi>Existent,</hi> as I exprest my self in that Argument. And my Conclusion of the 2<hi>d.</hi> Proof is this as put down by himself here, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. <hi>'Tis impossible therefore that what is</hi> thus
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52024:108"/>
               <hi>affirm'd to be True</hi> (that is in such words as can bear no pertinent distinction) <hi>should</hi> in any regard <hi>be affirm'd possible to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> False; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of distinguishing the Predicate pertinent, ly, excluding here all possibility of diverse respects.</hi> Is this barely to go about to prove that <hi>what's True is Impossible to be False,</hi> or rather, that no <hi>different regards</hi> or <hi>respects</hi> can in such Faith-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions as these be made use of to elude or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the granting their <hi>Intire Truth.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position [<hi>An Ethiopian is black</hi>] is but <hi>in part</hi> True, because it can bear diverse <hi>respects</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards</hi> to distinguish it pertinently; <hi>viz. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> his <hi>Teeth,</hi> and his <hi>Skin</hi>: But in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions which have [<hi>Existent</hi>] for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, no imaginable <hi>regards</hi> can be found appliable to it, so to distinguish <hi>it</hi> pertinently. The next Falsification of my Intention is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that I argue barely out of the nature of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Copula,</hi> and <hi>Predicate,</hi> whereas by my whole Discourse, 'tis most evident that I argue precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their being <hi>such</hi> Subjects and <hi>Predicates,</hi> that is such as could bear no pertinent Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diminishing the <hi>Integrity</hi> of their <hi>Truth.</hi> In a word, the Question was about the <hi>Truth,</hi> or which is all one <hi>Impossibility of Falshood</hi> in Faith-Propositions, and I was there treating it Logical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I would gladly then have any sober and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent man inform me, why it was not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and pertinent for me to argue out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Propositions</hi> (in which only <hi>Truth</hi> is found) and particularly out of the nature of <hi>such</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,

how strangely the World is mistaken in <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks</hi>; esteeming that highest Science intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably obscure, and impenetrably difficult; whereas its Object being those notions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Being,</hi> all its Obscurity and Hardness to one whom right Logick hath taught accurately to distinguish, and steadily to keep distinct his notions, consist only in this that 'tis <hi>too</hi> Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and Intelligible; in the same manner as the Sun is <hi>hard to be seen</hi> at Noon-day; whence it happens that because we are inur'd by custome to make Definitions or Explications of what we are discoursing about, and here, the Subject not needing nor bearing it, we can make none of [<hi>Being</hi>] which is the Principal Object in that Science, hence, being put out of our road, we are at a puzzle, and seem to have lost our way through too much light.

But that he may not mistake me; I shall not stick to declare whom I exclude from Salvation (at least from the way to it) whom not, and upon what Grounds, speaking of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of Gods Providence, as I declare my self to do throughout this whole Treatise. I make account that <hi>perfect Charity</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of God <hi>above</hi> and in <hi>all</hi> things is the Immediate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Bliss, or <hi>Vnitive</hi> of a Soul to God; Also, that this Virtue cannot with a due hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be <hi>connaturally</hi> or <hi>rationally</hi> wrought in Souls, if the Tenet of a Deity's Existence and of Christian Faith be held <hi>possible to be a Ly.</hi> Hence, I am oblig'd by my Reason to hold that those who judge there are <hi>no</hi> absolueely-Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Reasons for the Existence of a Deity, nor for the Truth of Christian Faith, are (as such) out of the Road of Salvation. On the other side, those who hold the Church, <hi>the Pillar and Ground of the Truths</hi> they profess, <hi>Infallible,</hi> and by Consequence their Faith Impossible to be False, as all Catholikes do, though, as Divines, they fail in making out how, and by what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular means it comes to be Infallible; yet through the virtue of this <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>steady Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to such Principles as are, because they are <hi>Truths,</hi> apt to beget <hi>solid</hi> and well-grounded (that

And, for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I esteem Dr. T's way of discoursing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Deity and Faith in his Sermons most pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and mischievous to Souls, as being apt of its own Nature to incline them (if they have wit to discern its shallowness) first to a kind of Scepticism in Religion, and at next to Careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Irreligion and Atheism; though truly I think 'tis not his Intention to do so, but that his shortness in Understanding the Nature and Grounds of Christianity makes him conceit he does excellently, even to admiration, all the while he commits such well-meaning Follies. Nor do I think the Church of <hi>England</hi> will upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts think fit to Patronize Principles so <hi>destructive</hi> to the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> found in the breast of every Protestant I ever yet met with; who all with one mouth will own that 'tis absolutely <hi>Impossible Christian Faith should be a Lye,</hi> and abhor the contrary Position as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and damnable. How Dr. <hi>T.</hi> may have sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd some of his own Auditors by preaching Controversy to them, which he extremely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I cannot tell; 'tis according as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to believe him more than the Generality of the Christian World, whose Sentiments he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses in his Discourses about the Ground of Faith.</p>

               <p> With what Art Dr. <hi>T.</hi> answers my ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD. A Present made to his Credulous Friends, shewing how solidly he confuted SVRE-FOOTING by readily granting the main of the Book. What is meant by Tradition. That <hi>J.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§ 1. HE makes a pass or two at my <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD,</hi> and that I conceive must serve for an Answer to it: for an Answer, I heard, was threatned would appear very short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but this pleasant Preface was the only thing which appeared; and all that appears like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in it, is that he would make it believ'd he ought not answer at all. And this he does very neatly and like a Master: For, let no man think I have a mean Opinion of Dr. <hi>T.</hi> but every one is not good at all things: some are good at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, some at disproving, some at shifting of the Question without either proving or disproving; every one in his way; and in his way I know no man living a greater Master, nor so great as the Dr. Two things he does, and both of them strange ones: First, he affirms that Discourse is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52024:117"/>
               <hi>founded on the self-evident Infallibility of ora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tradition:</hi> Next, that <hi>He has sufficiently conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that point in the Answer to Surefooting.</hi> The first of them would make the Reader apprehend I there <hi>suppos'd</hi> Oral Tradition <hi>self-evidently In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> and then run on all the way upon that supposition; which if it obtain belief (as from his Credit he hopes it may) since every Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knows all Discourses must be founded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on <hi>first Principles,</hi> or at least on such as are <hi>granted</hi> by those against whom we argue, he sees I must needs be held the most ridiculous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser that ever spoke or writ, to build a whole Treatise upon a Supposition unprov'd, and which begs the whole Question. Now, whatever I concluded in that short Discourse, I deduced step by step, and made the foregoing Proposition draw still after it by undeniable Consequence the following one: He concealing all mention of <hi>Proof,</hi> or <hi>endeavour</hi> of it, calls my Conclusions, <hi>Principles</hi>; and then who would think but that I had laid them to build that Discourse upon them, and deserted my usual way of beginning with the known Natures of the Things in hand, as I there did with those of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and from them proceeded minutely to whatever I concluded. Had his Friend Dr. <hi>St.</hi> taken the same course, his Principles would have evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered their own weakness of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and had excus'd others the unnecessary trouble of answering them. Next, he makes me say, that <hi>the Infallibility</hi> of this Rule <hi>is evident to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52024:118"/>
common Sense</hi>; and says himself, that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Method is the <hi>self-evident infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Oral Tradition:</hi> by which words an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Reader would verily think I suppos'd it <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> to <hi>be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lf-evident to common Sense,</hi> and never troubled my self to prove it; whereas, though I indeed hold 'tis practically self-evident (of which I have elsewhere given account) yet I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if I did not, but proved §<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. out of the Natures of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> whatever it be, must be <hi>Infallible</hi>: § 10. that therefore Scripture's Letter is <hi>not</hi> that Rule, and § 11. that Tradition <hi>is.</hi> The Reader being thus questionless well dispos'd to think it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary he should consider, as he calls it, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any passage of a thing made up of unprov'd Principles, or built on an unprov'd Supposition, he tels him farther, that he has <hi>sufficiently conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that point</hi> in the Answer to <hi>Sure-footing</hi>; whence he is <hi>not concern'd to take notice</hi> of it at present. And so the business is done; for why should he take pains to give answer to that which deserves none; or, if it did, is answered? This Reason though, by the way, is a little open. For, in case I did bring any Arguments in my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to make good that Tradition is an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of Faith, and this after I had seen, and perhaps <hi>sufficiently consider'd</hi> too, what he replies to <hi>Surefooting</hi>; for any thing appears, I may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have <hi>amended</hi> the Reasons given in <hi>Surefoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or produc't better in my <hi>Method</hi>; and so, whatever he has said to <hi>Surefooting,</hi> it might have

This would seem strange, and something difficult, if any thing were so to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> and his singular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of answering Books. <hi>All,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that he pretends to prove in this Discourse is, that, if this Rule hath been followed and kept to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, the Christian Doctrine neither has nor can
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52024:119"/>
have received any change.</hi> 'Tis <hi>all</hi> indeed I <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> and all I <hi>desired</hi> to prove; for, certainly, if it <hi>can</hi> preserve Christian Doctrine unchanged, it has in it <hi>the Nature of a Rule</hi>; and what has in it the <hi>Nature</hi> of a Rule is, I conceive, <hi>a Rule,</hi> whether it have been followed or not, which is a Question I had not then examined, but reserved to my following Discourses. To this then after his <hi>sufficient consideration,</hi> What sayes the Dr.? <hi>All this,</hi> sayes he, <hi>is readily granted him.</hi> For my part, I have no reason to except against that answer; for all my Writing aims at is that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should see the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h and acknowledge it; and since he <hi>readily grants all</hi> I pretend to prove, I were very unreasonable if I should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. Though, if I were dispos'd to be cross, this word <hi>readily</hi> is something liable to exception. After he has employ'd a good part of his Book in preparing to speak to the main Question, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and subdividing, and playing all the tricks which may make it look like an Answer; and when he comes to the Question to <hi>grant</hi> it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could do no other, is indeed to <hi>grant</hi> it, but <hi>not</hi> very <hi>readily.</hi> People will not think he was very <hi>ready</hi> to do that which before he comes to he makes such a pother, and still hangs back, and pretends to hold the contrary, even there where he grants it; as is seen in his Title.

Marry, I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Friends will not so easily be satisfied,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52024:120"/>
&amp; perhaps be apt to think that this is a more speedy way of <hi>answering,</hi> than a good way of <hi>confuting</hi>: for in truth, 'tis an odd way of shewing, <hi>That the Properties of a Rule of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This cross proceeding is a thing which as well as he has deserv'd of Truth and me, I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and I heartily wish for his own and the worlds sake, he would stedily own, at least his own concessions. In the mean time let us see, if the thing be not as plain as plain may be. In stead of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven Properties prov'd in my Discourse to belong to Tradition, he puts two of his own: First, that <hi>it be plain and intelligible,</hi> and this he grants here <hi>pag.</hi> 149. is found in Tradition. His Second is, that we must be sufficiently assured <hi>That the Doctrine delivered down by Oral Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath receiv'd no corruption or change in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance: And here,</hi> he sayes, <hi>is the difficulty.</hi> Where, good Dr? We are inquiring <hi>which</hi> is the <hi>Rule</hi>; must we <hi>before</hi> we can find it, be assured of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> when the Rule is the very thing which gives us this assurance?

               </gap>fficulty, and I think an Insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one: But all proceeds from his j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbling two distinct Questions, and confounding the First, which alone I treat, and he pretends to answer there, namely, which <hi>is the Rule of Faith</hi>; with the other which I treat afterwards, and examine, <hi>Whether it have been alwayes followed?</hi> For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more plain, than that the two ways by which Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Doctrine may have <hi>received corruption or change</hi> are these; either a <hi>defect</hi> of <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>aptitude</hi> in the <hi>Rule</hi> to convey it, or defect of <hi>will</hi> in the <hi>Persons</hi> who were to have been guided by it, and <hi>make use</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> it has. And 'tis no less plain, that in case we be sufficiently assured that Tradition has <hi>power</hi> and <hi>is apt to convey it uncorrupted down</hi>; we are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently assured, that it has all that is requisite to a <hi>Rule.</hi> And since Dr. <hi>T.</hi> grants 'tis <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible,</hi> he must grant the Persons and not the Thing (or Tradition) is to blame if it have not done what 'tis qualified to doe. To have a <hi>will</hi> to follow Tradition is the Property of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> (or good Christians) and not of the Thing they are to follow, or of the <hi>Rule,</hi> which if it be <hi>plain,</hi> they might have followed it if they would. A Sword is a Sword whether men cut with it or
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52024:121"/>
no; and a Pen is a Pen though no man write with it. Distinguishing then the Properties of of a <hi>Rule,</hi> from the properties of the <hi>Persons</hi> who are to use it, 'tis plain that his Second Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>sufficiently certain</hi> agrees no less to Tradition than his First, <hi>sufficiently plain.</hi> For what can <hi>sufficiently certain</hi> signifie more, than that, in case it have been used, <hi>Christian Doctrine neither has nor can have received any change.</hi> Both these he grants, and plainly and <hi>readily,</hi> and these two are all himself requires. Wherefore 'tis as plain as can be, that there is no <hi>difficulty</hi> about the point I there treated, <hi>Whether Tradition have all the properties belonging to a Rule of Faith:</hi> &amp; Dr. <hi>T.</hi> his difficulty is this, <hi>Whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The difficulty is, sayes he, <hi>Whether we have sufficient assurance that the Doctrine delivered down by Oral Tradition hath received no corruption or change in its conveyance.</hi> He puts it then delivered by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that is, he puts this Rule has been follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and before he sayes, that <hi>if this Rule has been follow'd, Christian Doctrine neither has nor can have received any change</hi>; and then makes a <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:52024:121"/>
whether there <hi>have been</hi> a change, where there neither <hi>is</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be any. This I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess is something difficult to apprehend. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is no difficulty at all in conceiving, that if there have been any change in Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, this must have happened, not by defect of the <hi>Rule,</hi> which, if follow'd, he sayes, leaves not so much as a <hi>possibility</hi> of it; but of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> who were deficient in their Duty, and would not follow it. He may perhaps say, that by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down,</hi> he meant no more, but <hi>pretended to be delivered down</hi>; but to omit that by <hi>delivered</hi> to mean <hi>not delivered,</hi> is something uncouth; this is plainly to fasten the difficulty upon the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not the <hi>Rule,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> very politickly bids opens defiance to all the whole Tribe of such ill-condition'd Principles. In the mean time, the beginning and end of that sixth <hi>Section</hi> are very observable. The Title is, <hi>that the properties of a Rule of Faith do</hi> not <hi>belong to Tradition</hi>; and this signifies, that it <hi>is not</hi> the Rule of Faith: coming to make good this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, he <hi>granted</hi> that 'tis <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi>; and <hi>can,</hi> if people stick to it, <hi>preserve Christian Doctrine from change:</hi> and this signifies, that <hi>the properties of a Rule</hi> do <hi>belong to it,</hi> and that it <hi>is</hi> the Rule. For I do not remember he ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended there were two Rules of Faith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since Tradition hath <hi>power</hi> to do what a Rule <hi>should</hi> do, <hi>viz.</hi> preserve Faith uncorrupted

And yet all this while his Title is, that Tradition had not the <hi>properties of a Rule,</hi> or is <hi>no Rule.</hi> But the Conclusion is every jot as remarkable, for he had no sooner <hi>readily granted</hi> all I pretended to prove, but he as readily <hi>diverts</hi> the Reader from reflecting upon it, by these words: <hi>But that this Rule has alwayes been follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay that 'tis impossible there should have been any deviation from it (as he pretends) this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not only as untrue, but as one of the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Propositions that ever pretended to demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evidence.</hi> Would any Reader suspect this serious clutter of words should be both untrue, and nothing to purpose besides? For, it plainly speaks of a Question, which is <hi>not</hi> the Question in <hi>that</hi> place. but reserv'd for <hi>another,</hi> and which he should have let alone till its time come. Yet I was to blame to say, it was <hi>nothing to purpose.</hi> For tis to <hi>great</hi> purpose; and the Transition is so nimble and delicate, that the Reader ceases to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the import of his concession, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to think me a man of <hi>confidence,</hi> and <hi>strange</hi> confidence too, who can hold such palpable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense. But pray where did I ever <hi>pretend 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should have been any deviation from</hi> Tradition? Sure 'twas in my sleep, and the Dr. has taken me napping.

I am so far from having writ or said, or so much as thought that there never was nor could be <hi>any</hi> deviation from it; that on the contrary I have alwayes thought, and have said and writ, that there have been <hi>many</hi> deviations from it, and <hi>as many</hi> as there have been Heresies in God's Church. Nay, (as far as I remember) I have not said so much, as that I had absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated there <hi>had</hi> or <hi>could</hi> be no <hi>total</hi> defection from it.

That those who are actually from their Child-hood <hi>in</hi> the Church, have Faith instill'd into them after a different manner from those who were educated in <hi>another</hi> Profession, and <hi>after</hi> come to embrace the right Faith.

The former therefore have the full weight of the Churches Authority, both as to Naturals and Supernaturals actually apply'd to them and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its effect upon them; Practical self-evidence both of the Credit due to so Grave, Learned, Ample and Sacred an Authority, as also of the Holiness, the Morality or Agreeableness of her Doctrine to <hi>Right</hi> Reason (which they actually experience) rendring in the mean time their Assent <hi>Connatural,</hi> that is, Rational or <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>

The later Fancy nothing Supernatural in her, nor <hi>experience</hi> the Goodness of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but have it represented to them as Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Abhominable: In a word, the Former have both Faith and the Reasons for it, practically instill'd into them in a manner at the same time, and growing together daily to new degrees of Perfection, whereas, the Later must have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>antecedently</hi> to Faith, and apprehending <hi>as yet</hi> nothing <hi>Supernatural</hi> in the Church, must begin with something <hi>Natural,</hi> or meerly <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> which may be the Object of an <hi>unelevated</hi> Reason: and, withal, such as may be of its own nature able to satisfie rationally that haesitation and disquisitive doubt wherewith they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

My Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in that Treatise, (as appears by the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) is intended for those who are yet <hi>to arrive at satisfaction in Religion,</hi> that is, for those who are <hi>not yet</hi> of the Church; and, so. I am to speak to their natural Reason, by proposing something which is an Object proper and proportion'd to it, and as it were, leading them by the hand, step by step to the <hi>Church,</hi> though all the while they walk upon their own Legs, and see with their own Eyes; that is, <hi>proceed</hi> upon <hi>plain</hi> Maxims of <hi>Humane Reason</hi> every step they take. 3. Though I use the Abstract word [<hi>TRADITION</hi>] yet I conceive no wise man will imagine I mean by it some <hi>Idea Platonica,</hi> or separated Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hovering in the Air without any Subject, but that the <hi>Thing</hi> I indeed meant to signifie by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52024:125"/>
it, is the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>DELIVERING</hi> or as <hi>Testifying,</hi> and, (taking it as apply'd to those who are not yet capable to discern any <hi>Supernaturality</hi> in the Church) the <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Authority of the Church, or the Church <hi>Testifying</hi> she receiv'd this Faith uninterruptedly from the beginning. So that <hi>Tradition</hi> differs from <hi>Church,</hi> as a man consider'd precisely as <hi>speaking</hi> and <hi>acting,</hi> differs from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self consider'd and exprest as <hi>such a Person</hi>; which known by <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Carriage,</hi> or by himself <hi>as speaking</hi> and <hi>acting,</hi> other considerations also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him, which before lay hid, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd, or (as the Schools express it) <hi>confounded</hi> in the Subject (or <hi>Suppositum</hi>) become known like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. So the Churches <hi>Humane Testimony</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which (as was shown <hi>Sure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> f.</hi> p. 81, 82, 83.) is the greatest and most powerfully supported, even <hi>naturally,</hi> of any in the World, is a proper and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd object to <hi>their</hi> Reason who yet believe <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>; but, it being known thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Body who proceeds on that Ground, possesses the <hi>first-deliver'd,</hi> that is, <hi>Right Faith,</hi> and so is the <hi>true Church,</hi> immediately all those Prerogatives and Supernatural Endowments apprehended by all who understand the nature of Faith to spring out of it, or attend on it, are known to appertain, and to have <hi>ever</hi> appertain'd to the True Church; and, amongst the rest, <hi>Goodness</hi> or <hi>Sanctity,</hi> the proper Gift of the H. Ghost, with all the Means to it, which with an incomparable Efficacy strengthens the Souls of the Faithful as to the Delivery of Right Faith; whence she is justly held and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52024:126"/>
by the new-converted Faithful to be <hi>assisted by the H. Ghost</hi>; which, till some Motive <hi>meerly Humane</hi> had first introduc'd it into their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, that this was the <hi>True Church,</hi> they could not possibly apprehend.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. In this way then of discoursing, the Church is still the <hi>onely</hi> Ascertainer of Faith, either taken in her whole Latitude, as in those who are <hi>already</hi> Faithful; or consider'd <hi>in part</hi> onely, that is, <hi>as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering</hi> by way of naturally <hi>Testifying,</hi> (which I <hi>here</hi> call <hi>Tradition</hi>) in order to those who are yet to embrace Faith. Whence appears the perfect groundlesness of Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s Objection, and how he wholly misunderstands my Doctrine in this point, when he says the Discourse in my <hi>Method</hi> does <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian the far greatest part of our own Church.</hi> For first, he mistakes the Ground of Believing to those actually <hi>in the Church,</hi> for that which is the Ground for those who are yet <hi>out of the Church,</hi> to find <hi>which is</hi> the Church: Next, since all Believers actually <hi>in</hi> the Church, even to a Man, rely on the Church both naturally and supernaturally assisted, and I am diseoursing onely about the Natural means for those who are <hi>out of the Church</hi> to come to the Knowledge of it, his Discourse amounts to this, that, because those who are yet <hi>coming</hi> to Faith, rely onely on the <hi>Humane</hi> Testimony of the Church, therefore they who are <hi>in</hi> the Church and rely upon the Church both humanely and divinely assisted, are <hi>no Christians.</hi> In a word, this way of Divinity or Resolution of Faith which I take, makes every man, both those in the Church,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52024:126"/>
and those out of it, rely on the Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity or Testimony diversly consider'd in order to their respective capacities, and so still makes the <hi>Church THE PILLAR AND GROVND OF TRVTH,</hi> which all Catholicks in the World (not so much as any <hi>one</hi> School-Divine excepted) hold the securest way that can be imagined; And should any one dislike it, I see not what he can with any show pretend. He must allow some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motive antecedent to Faith, and what is known by means of it; that is, he must grant <hi>some</hi> Motive antecedent to the Knowledge of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Assistance, and where he will find in the whole World any such Motive stronger than is the Humane Authority of the Church as to matters of Faith, I profess I know not, nor I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent can any man living imagine. If this then be, absolutely speaking, the securest way that is, 'tis securer or firmer than is the way of proceeding upon Motives of Credibility, and incomparably more secure than is that of resolving Faith into Motives onely Prudential. Though indeed, things rightly stated and understood, the Motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility are some of them Coincident with Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the rest which can lay just claim to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty depend on it, taken at large, as their Ground, as hath been prov'd in the Corollaries to <hi>Sure-footing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be ask'd, Why, since <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> are one and the same Thing, I did not chuse to say, that <hi>the CHVRCH gives us Knowledge of the first deliver'd Faith</hi> rather than that <hi>TRADITION
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52024:127"/>
does so,</hi> seeing none could have scrupled or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the <hi>former</hi> manner of Expression; whereas this gives occasion of mis-apprehension to some unattentive Readers. I answer, I us'd on that occasion the word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] rather than the word [<hi>Church</hi>] for the same reason the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians use the words <hi>Line</hi> or <hi>Surface,</hi> when they have a mind to express <hi>Body</hi> as <hi>Long</hi> or <hi>Broad</hi>; for these are in reality the same thing with <hi>Body</hi>; but, in regard Body is the Subject of many other Considerations as well as <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>these</hi> speak Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy precisely according to the Considerations of <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Breadth,</hi> to which onely it was Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to speak, hence it was better both for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctness of Expression and Exactness of Science, which is built on the perfect distinction of our Conceptions to use the <hi>Abstract</hi> or Distinguishing words [<hi>Line</hi>] and [<hi>Surface</hi>] rather than the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi> or Confused word [<hi>Body</hi>] which involves much more than the Discourser in that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance intended to consider or speak to. Now this being the very method observed in that Science which bears the name for the greatest Exactness in Discourse, I much fear, the Objecters mistake proceeds from not reflecting that whoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to an Accurate and Connected way of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and rigorously to <hi>conclude</hi> what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, must either follow that best of Methods, or he falls short of his Duty, and wrongs his Cause.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. To clear this a little better, and withal to apply it, I shall make choice of another familiar
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52024:127"/>
Instance. We use to say in Common Speech that the <hi>Countenance</hi> or <hi>Carriage</hi> of a Man makes known his <hi>Genius.</hi> Now all these three, <hi>viz. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, Carriage,</hi> and <hi>Genius,</hi> are in reality most evidently the <hi>same</hi> Thing with the <hi>Man</hi> himself; onely they differ from it in the manner of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the word <hi>Man</hi> nominating the <hi>Whole</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Thing</hi> which is the Subject of all <hi>these</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>other</hi> Considerabilities, confusedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in that word. The other three are more <hi>distinct</hi> indeed in their manner of signifying, but they fall exceedingly short of the others vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and express Man but <hi>in part,</hi> or onely a <hi>few</hi> Respects found in that Subject, whereof some are <hi>less</hi> known, some <hi>more,</hi> and so a <hi>Means</hi> to know <hi>others.</hi> Whence it comes to pass that <hi>Countenance</hi> signifying Man as <hi>Looking,</hi> or according to the outward Appearance of that <hi>part</hi> in him call'd the <hi>Face</hi>; also <hi>Carriage</hi> signifying him as <hi>bearing</hi> or <hi>demeaning</hi> himself; and, lastly, <hi>Genius,</hi> as having such a peculiarity of Humour or Nature in him, hence these words, [<hi>The Speech, Countenance, and Carriage of a Man discover his Genius</hi>] amount to this, the Man <hi>according</hi> to his Speech, Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or Carriage, which are visible and more Intelligible Considerations belonging to him, is a means to notifie himself to us according to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him which is latent and less manifest, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Genius.</hi> This I say is the plain Sense of the other words, onely this <hi>later</hi> manner of speaking is prolix and troublesome, the <hi>other</hi> short and yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressive of the Speakers Intention. Again,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52024:128"/>
the <hi>other</hi> manner of Expression is Proper and Apt, whereas should one put it thus, [<hi>The Man makes known the Man</hi>] besides the confusedness of the expression, since <hi>Man</hi> signifies the whole Intire Thing without distinguishing any particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, it would make the <hi>whole</hi> (or the <hi>self-same</hi> thing) abstracting from all different Respects to be <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after, more</hi> known and <hi>less</hi> known than it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a direct Contradiction.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. Applying then this Discourse. The word <hi>Church</hi> being a Congregation of <hi>Men,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in its way of expressing to the word <hi>Man</hi> in the Example now given, and involves confusedly in its notion innumerable Considerations belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Body; of which <hi>True Faith,</hi> which is, as it were, the <hi>Genius</hi> or Nature of the True Church, is of it self latent, unknown, and far from self-discoverable. Others, such as is the Humane Testimony of the Church, meant in those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances by the word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] in regard it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on Testifying Authority, is <hi>more</hi> known, and being Oral and Practical, fitly corresponds to Speech, Countenance, Carriage, and such-like. It being known then by this means that such a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has in it the <hi>first-deliver'd,</hi> or True Faith, 'tis known immediately that having in it the <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> of a True Church,'tis <hi>indeed</hi> the True Church: Again, it being known likewise and conceived by all who understand what is meant by that word, that True Faith is a firm Adhesion to Christs Doctrine, also it being apprehended by those against whom we dispute (nay demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52024:128"/>
out of the nature of that Doctrine) that 'tis a means to <hi>love God above all things</hi>; hence 'tis justly concluded that there is in the Generality, or in great Multitudes of this Body, a due love of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven call'd Sanctity or Charity, which is the Gift peculiarly attributed to the H. Ghost; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known and experienc'd by those already in the Church that this Love of Heaven or Sanctity gives the Faithful a particular Strength and Power to perform all good Duties, and this of preserving uncorrupted the deliver'd Faith being <hi>one,</hi> and that a most concerning one, hence they come to know that the Church is <hi>assisted by the H. Ghost,</hi> as in all other good Duties, so especially in this, of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continually proposing Right Faith: So that (as Reason requires) by some <hi>Natural</hi> and therefore more easily-known Assistances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, those out of her are brought to the knowledge that she is <hi>Supernaturally assisted.</hi> This is the Method <hi>I</hi> take in resolving Faith: If any man can show me any other that is either more solid, more orderly, more connatural and agreeable to the nature of Faith, or more honourable to Gods Church, I shall as willingly and easily quit it, as <hi>I</hi> now out of long and serious consideration embrace and firmly adhere to it. But it appears plain to me, that whoever contradicts this, especially as to that point which occasion'd this Discourse, must withal contradict a Maxim on which all Science is principally built, namely, that <hi>The Definition is more known than the Notion defin'd</hi>; which I take to be understood not onely of the <hi>Whole</hi> Definition,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52024:129"/>
but of each single part of it; for if any <hi>one</hi> part be more obscure than the thing defin'd, the whole Definition, as having that obscure part in it, must necessarily be more obscure likewise. Wherefore the Definition of a Church being <hi>Coetus Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Congregation of Faithful,</hi> &amp;c. the notion of <hi>Faithful</hi> (and consequently, of <hi>Faith</hi>) must either be <hi>more</hi> Known and Knowable than that of <hi>Church,</hi> and consequently antecedent to it in right method of Discourse, or the Definition would be obscurer than the Thing defin'd, which if it be said, I must confess I know not to what end Definitions are, or why they do not rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Ignorance than to Science. Add, that True Faith being most <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> and <hi>Essential</hi> to a Church, 'tis by consequence a more forcible and demonstrative Argument to convince inevitably that such a Body in which 'tis found is the True Church, than is any Extrinsecal Mark whatsoever. And if it be objected that Extrinsecal Marks are more easily Knowable, I doubt not but in those who are led away by superficial Appearances there is some show of Reason in this Objection, but I utterly deny that if we go to the bottom to settle the Absolute Certainty of any of these Marks, any of them can be known <hi>at all,</hi> much less <hi>more easily known,</hi> if the Certainty of Tradition in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and practical matters of Fact be questionable; and that neither Scripture, Fathers, Councils, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, Monuments, or any thing else of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can pretend to Absolute Certainty, if Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be Uncertain, or can pretend to be known,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52024:129"/>
unless Tradition be <hi>first</hi>- (that is, <hi>more-) known,</hi> as is shown particularly in the Corollaries to <hi>Sure-footing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. Hence is seen that the word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a threefold sence; For the <hi>Way</hi> of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Delivery taken at large; For the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or <hi>Natural</hi> Authority of the Church, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering; And lastly, for its Divinely-assisted or <hi>Supernatural</hi> Authority, call'd properly <hi>Christian.</hi> When 'tis taken in <hi>one</hi> fence, when in <hi>another,</hi> the nature of the matter in hand and the concomitant circumstances will evidently determine. Onely we must note that these three Notions are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equately contradistinct, the later still including the former, as <hi>Length, Breadth,</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> do in <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd Quantity.</hi> For, The <hi>Humane Authority</hi> of the Church includes <hi>Tradition taken at large,</hi> and adds to it the <hi>best Assistances of Nature,</hi> as is shown <hi>Sure-f.</hi> p. 82, 83. The <hi>Supernatural</hi> Authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all found in the other two, and adds to it <hi>the best Assistances of Grace,</hi> as is particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared there from p. 84. to p. 93. So that all the Perfection of Tradition that is imaginable is to be found in that which we call <hi>Christian,</hi> or in the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Authority of Christs Church.</hi>

a different manner than other Divines do, it were not amiss, omitting many pregnant Instances which might be collected out of Dr. <hi>Stratford,</hi> the Learned Author of <hi>Protestancy without Principles,</hi> and many others to the same purpose, to show how far he mistakes in this point, by instancing in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertist of eminent both Fame and Learning as any in his time; one who writ before <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Dialogues appeared, or perhaps were thought of, and so cannot be suspected a Follower of that <hi>New Way,</hi> as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> call it: I mean Mr. <hi>Fisher.</hi> This able Controvertist, in his <hi>Censure of Dr. White</hi>'s <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> p. 83, 84, maintains that <hi>VNWRITTEN</hi> (that is, Oral and Practical) <hi>TRADITION</hi> is the <hi>PRIME GROVND OF FAITH, more Fundamental than Scripture,</hi> and shows how his Adversary Mr. <hi>White</hi> the Minister grants in effect the same.

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:52024:131"/>But to proceed. Hence p. 40. he avers that the <hi>proof of Tradition is so full and sufficient that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth Infidels</hi> (that is, those who have onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason to guide themselves by.) <hi>For though</hi> (saith he) <hi>they be blind not to see the Doctrine of the Apostles to be Divine, yet are they not so void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, impudent and obstinate as to deny the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christian Catholick Tradition to be truly Christian and Apostolical.</hi> And p. 41. <hi>The ONELY MEANS whereby men succeeding the Apostles may know assuredly what Scriptures and Doctrines they deliver'd to the Primitive Catholick Church, is the Catholick Tradition by Worlds of Christian Fathers and Pastors, unto Worlds of Christian Children and Faithful People</hi>: Which words as fully express that <hi>Tradition</hi> is the ONELY or SOLE <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> as can be imagin'd. And whereas some hold that an Inward working of God's Spirit supplies the Conclusiveness of the Motive, this Learned Writer p. 46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the contrary affirms, that <hi>Inward Assurance without any EXTERNAL INFALLIBLE Ground to assure men of TRVTH, is proper unto the Prophets and the first Publishers of Christian Religion.</hi> And, lastly, (to omit others) p. 47. he discourses thus: <hi>If any object that the Senses of men in this Search may be deceiv'd through natural invincible Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of their Organs, and so no Ground of Faith that is altogether Infallible: I answer, that Evidence had by Sense being but the private of one man, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and physically Infallible; but when the same is also Publick and Catholick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, when a whole World of men concur with him, then his Evidence is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52024:132"/>
ALTOGETHER INFALLIBLE.</hi> And now I would gladly know what there is in any of my Books touching the Ground of Faith which is not either the self-same, or else necessarily consequent or at least very consonant to what I have here ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this Judicious Author and Great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of Truth in his Days, whose Coincidency with other Divines into the same manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, argues strongly that it was onely the same unanimous Notion and Conceit of <hi>Faith</hi> and of true Catholick Grounds which could breed this conspiring into the same way of discoursing, and almost the self-same words.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. Hence is seen how justly D.<hi>T.</hi> when he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed something else to say, still taxed me with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in accepting of nothing but <hi>Infallibility built on absolutely-conclusive Motives,</hi> with talking such <hi>Paradoxes</hi> as he <hi>doubts whether ever they enter'd into any other mans mind; that all mankind except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> J.

First, he would justifie himself for saying I went about to <hi>explain</hi> words, because my self said <hi>I would examine well what is meant by them,</hi> which seems equivalent to explaining them, but he conceals <hi>what kind</hi> of <hi>explications</hi> I deny'd my self to mean, and what he unjustly imputed twice in one page, (p. 3.) namely, <hi>Definitions</hi>; he conceals how he would needs make me intend to <hi>define,</hi> and yet most disingenuously put down himself at the same time my very words in which I disclaim'd any pretence to <hi>define,</hi> but onely to <hi>reflect on some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Predicates or Properties</hi> of what was meant by those words, that is, some pertinent and true Sayings concerning <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi>; which though they in part explicate them, which I never deny'd; yet they are far from looking like those <hi>compleat Explications</hi> call'd <hi>Definitions,</hi> or even like those less artificial ones call'd <hi>Descriptions</hi>; or like those Explications industriously <hi>compil'd</hi> (which was the word I us'd) to adequate the intire notion of the word under consideration. For example, <hi>Faith</hi> being there taken for <hi>Believing,</hi> I come to discover it imports some kind of knowledge, and then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from it <hi>as such,</hi> §. 8. Again, I affirm, §. 12. that the notion of the word <hi>Faith, bears that 'tis a Perfection of the Soul, or a Virtue</hi>; and thence dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from it as it imports a Virtue. Also §. 16.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52024:134"/>
I affirm that <hi>Faith mainly conduces to Bliss or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp;c. and thereupon frame such a Discourse as is apt to spring out of such a Consideration. Now all these in part <hi>explicate</hi> the Thing, that is, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close</hi> or say some Truth that belongs to its nature; yet not one of those sayings looks like an <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the word [<hi>FAITH</hi>] for this speaks an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireness</hi> and an <hi>Adequateness</hi> to the notion explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which 'tis evident not one of these particular <hi>Affirmations</hi> or <hi>Sayings</hi> have the least show of. He conceals also what was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this Insincerity far more home upon him now than ever; that, whereas in my <hi>Letter of Thanks</hi> from p. 5. to p 9. I had at large refuted these ridiculous Exceptions of his, he in this very place, where he pretends to speak particularly to my <hi>Letter of Thanks,</hi> never takes notice of any one word <hi>there</hi> alledg'd, but conceals all that had been produc'd to answer those Exceptions, and bears himself as if no such Answers had been given. This I must confess falls much short of either <hi>nibbling</hi> or <hi>gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and I am forc'd to declare that this constant carriage of his, discovering too openly a perfect disregard of Truth, abates in me much of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which otherwise his good Endowments would naturally give me.</p>

But Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is not to understand this till he be willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Distinction between the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Schools,</hi> which he is resolved he never will, lest it spoil his writing Controversie.</p>

He comes next to clear himself of <hi>False Citations:</hi> and to <hi>let the Reader see how little I am to be trusted, he will instance in two or three</hi>; and I heartily desire I may be no otherwise <hi>trusted,</hi> than as it shall appear upon severe examination of what we both alledge, that he is culpable, and my self Innocent. Now in culling out and managing his Instances, we may be sure he favours himself as much as he can handsomely; the two first of them being trifles in comparison of many others omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ond neither of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> charged by me as <hi>false Citations</hi> (whatever he pretends) meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>adding, diminishing,</hi> or <hi>altering</hi> the <hi>words</hi> of the Author. Also the very first of these is the easiest to bear a tolerable explication of any one objected

in the Book. In examining which, I request our respective Friends to be severely impartial and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to what was imputed by me, and what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by him; in doing which, Eye-sight is to be their best Guide. And, If I have to any degree wrong'd him, I shall not think it a jot prejudicial to my credit to declare that upon second thoughts I ought to mitigate or retract my words, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the just degree the Truth of the thing shall require.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. I charg'd him with a <hi>notorious abuse</hi> of the Preface to <hi>Rushworths Dialogues,</hi> in citing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it to say what he makes others say, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them for saying it. To go securely to work, we are to put down first the words of the Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which are these: <hi>This Term</hi> [Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty] <hi>every one explicated not alike, but some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by it such a Certainty as makes the Cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways work the same Effect, though it take not away the absolute possibility of working otherways: others call'd that a Moral Certainty which,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A third Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that word is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Of these three</hi> (says the Prefacer, who having related the opinions of others, now begins to speak his own sense) <hi>the first ought absolutely to be reckoned in the degree of true Certainty, and the Authors consider'd as mistaken in undervaluing it. Am not I sure I shall never repeat in the same order all the words I have spoken this last year?

In his Preface to Mr.</hi> Rushworth <hi>HE SAYS that such a Certainty as makes the Cause always work the same Effect, though it take not away the absolute possibility of working otherwise ought absolutely to be reckoned in the degree of true Certainty, and those Authors are mistaken who undervalue it.</hi> Now, though, one who cites another ought to be allow'd the liberty of taking those words which express his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without putting them always in the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod

and posture in which they are found in the Author, while there is no ambiguity or doubt of the Authors sense in that place; yet where 'tis <hi>at least</hi> doubtful that the sence is otherwise, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to any one who reads that Preface, which, as <hi>I</hi> alledg'd, though Dr. <hi>T.</hi> never takes notice of it, was wholly intended to evince the Absolute Certainty of Faith, 'tis not so fairly and clearly candid to introduce it as a <hi>most express saying</hi> of an Author, and putting it directly upon him as <hi>his Saying,</hi> whereas there at least needs a <hi>Discourse</hi> and the drawing some <hi>Consequences</hi> to prove it his Sense and Doctrine, (as will appear shortly) and on the other side, 'tis opposite to the whole strain and scope of the Treatise in which 'tis found: Thus far then I conceive my self in rigorous Truth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, namely for imputing to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> that he left out the words [<hi>Some understood</hi>] for he <hi>did</hi> so, and by so doing put that saying <hi>directly</hi> upon the Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer himself, and expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="8">§. 8. The chief and main part of the Charge is, That the imputed Tenet is not the sence of the Prefacers words in that place; and since he does not <hi>directly say</hi> it, but 'tis <hi>inferr'd</hi> onely from his approving an <hi>others</hi> Tenet (either in <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part</hi>) the Point is to be decided by such Reflexions as give us best Light of his Sense: In order to which, I alledge, 1. That the whole Scope of that Treatise is aim'd to prove the quite contrary Position; which Consideration being confessedly the best Interpreter of any Author, to neglect
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52024:138"/>
that, and catch at any little semblance in two or three particular words, and then force upon that Author a Tenet perfectly contrary to what his whole Discourse is bent to prove, favours too strong of a Wit resolv'd to cavil. This I objected in my <hi>Letter of Thanks,</hi> and this Dr. <hi>T.</hi> thought it his best play not to take notice of here, for it was unanswerable, and too evidently concluded him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Prefacer. First, then, I desire the Reader to reflect that there is not any show of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the <hi>possibility</hi> there spoken of to the <hi>Divine</hi> Omnipotence, but onely to the natures of <hi>Second Causes</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next, that since every thing <hi>is</hi> what 'tis <hi>made to be,</hi> if those Causes can possibly <hi>work</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the thing may <hi>be</hi> otherwise: These due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions made and settled, to those who have not leasure to read the whole Preface, <hi>I</hi> offer these particularities.

These Citations duely reflected on, it will appear very strange to any ingenuous man, that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> could easily imagine an Author, never noted till now to be given to contradict himself, who so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, in such and so many signal passages, and in the whole Tenour of that Discourse, nay the very immediately foregoing §. manifests him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this <hi>single passage,</hi> taken abstractedly from the rest, and could reach no deeper than the Grammar or superficial placing of words, it bears at first sight a show as if the Prefacer had approv'd that to be a <hi>True Certainty,</hi> not onely <hi>when the Cause always works the same Effect,</hi> (as <hi>I</hi> take him to mean) but also <hi>when it takes not away the possibility of working otherwise,</hi> (in which sence Dr. <hi>T.</hi> understands him.)

Since <hi>Absolute</hi> Certainty is that kind of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which is <hi>oppos'd</hi> to the <hi>Moral</hi> one, the <hi>True Certainty</hi> here mention'd must mean the same with <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> which is also avow'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as it will be to any ordinary Understanding that guides it self by Eye-sight and Common Sense, let us see what disingenuous ways Dr. <hi>T.</hi> uses to escape blame. 1.

Next, instead of that, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes a False Charge, never dream't on by any man but himself; namely, that I deny'd those <hi>Words [who have been brought up in this verbal and apparent respect of Scripture]</hi> to be found in <hi>Rushworth</hi>; whereas there is not a syllable to that purpose in my Book.

lastly, by the <hi>placing</hi> those words, [<hi>he onely exprest</hi>] immediately after his unhandsome Comment, 'tis most manifest they onely excluded any Ground or occasion of so strange a misconstruction, and aim'd not in the least at <hi>denying</hi> any <hi>other words,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>clearing</hi> that this was that Authors <hi>sole Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yet in confidence of these blinding Crafts, and that his unexamining Readers will believe all he says, he sounds the triumph of his own Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in this rude and confident manner, <hi>Certainly one would think that either this man has no Eyes or no Forehead.</hi> I will not say as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> does here in a Sermon preach'd against himself, p. 123. that <hi>a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wit, and a great deal of ill-nature will furnish a man for Satyr</hi>; onely I must say that the tenth part of this Rudeness in another (though justly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd too) would have been call'd <hi>Passion and ill Language.</hi> But I see what's <hi>a most horrid Sin</hi> in the abominable <hi>Papist,</hi> is still <hi>a great Virtue</hi> in the <hi>Saints.</hi> On this occasion since he is so <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,</hi> I must be serious with him, and demand of him publickly in the face of the World Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this Unjust Calumny; and, that <hi>I</hi> may not be too rigorous with him, <hi>I</hi> will yield him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in all the rest, if he clears himself of this one passage in which he counterfeits the greatest Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Victory; Of <hi>this</hi> Fault, <hi>I</hi> say, which he has <hi>newly</hi> committed, even then when he went about to clear himsellf of a <hi>former.</hi>

But in case that <hi>plural</hi> word had <hi>seem'd</hi> to him to <hi>infer</hi> an <hi>Vniversality,</hi> why could he not content himself with giving his reason why it <hi>seem'd</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> thence? Had he done this none could have accus'd him of falsifying: for every one has liberty to offer his conceit, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he judges so, without meriting or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring any harsher note than that of a mis-reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Whereas now, his carriage exposes him justly to these Exceptions. First, That he went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to <hi>infer</hi> or <hi>gather</hi> what he imposes, but (<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> p. 163.) he makes me in express terms and directly say that <hi>greatest hopes and fears are strongly apply'd to the minds of ALL Christians,</hi> whereas in my words put down by himself, <hi>p.</hi> 162. no such thing as [<hi>all</hi>] is found annext to those words. Next, that the word (<hi>all</hi>) which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was put in the same Italick Letter in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tenor with those <hi>other</hi> words which were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> mine; as may be seen in the place now cited. Thirdly, that his whole Attempt in that place, is meerly to confute that word [<hi>All</hi>] which himself had inserted, as may be seen <hi>Letter of thanks p.</hi> 77. where I instanc'd in nine or ten places in which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated that single word of his own adding and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (as I there shew'd from p. 78. to p. 86.) went forwards to make out that pretence by falsifying evidently my sense and sometimes my words too, in three or four places more. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That (<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> p. 165. l. 3.) he tells the Reader I <hi>SAY EXPRESSLY,</hi> those <hi>Causes are put in ALL the Faithful actually causing:</hi> by this means endeavouring to perswade the Reader 'tis
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52024:146"/>
not his own interpretation or deduction from some words of mine, but my own <hi>express words</hi>; which is a <hi>most express falsification.</hi> Lastly, he neglects to take notice of any of those words which <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldly</hi> and <hi>expresly</hi> show'd my Tenet to be quite <hi>contrary</hi> to what he impos'd. This is my total charge against him; of which we hear <hi>very little</hi> or rather nothing in this Preface where he goes about to <hi>clear</hi> it; onely he sayes that those <hi>First Believers</hi> to <hi>whom those Hopes and Fears were strongly apply'd, must</hi> by the tenour of my words mean <hi>all the Faithful disperst over several parts of the world,</hi> and so <hi>all</hi> the Christians <hi>of that Age,</hi> and for the same reason of <hi>the following ones</hi>; which is the very thing I <hi>deny,</hi> and have given late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my reasons why they <hi>could not.</hi> Besides, every Scholar knows that Authors first speak <hi>short</hi> and in <hi>common,</hi> and afterwards, when they come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themselves, <hi>more particularly</hi>; and had he been pleas'd to contain his rare gift of misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting till the very next line to my Principles, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the <hi>tenour</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Discourse, which he pretends to build his mistake upon, he had found the <hi>express contrary</hi> to his Additional [<hi>All</hi>] viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>A Great number or Body of the first Believers and after-Faithful,</hi> the direct) sense of which words is <hi>not all,</hi> but <hi>some onely.</hi>
