            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Was ſorry to ſee Thee appear in
the <hi>Pulpit</hi> (I will not ſay <hi>Cock-pit</hi>)
as an Aſſiſtant to one that would prove
the <hi>Quaker</hi> No <hi>Chriſtian</hi> We ſaw
him foyl'd in his firſt Attempt, to
prove his Way of Writing; For, as Mr.
<hi>Penn</hi> truly ſaid, There is a vaſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a <hi>Dialogue</hi> compoſed
for Information, and one for Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
In the firſt I only write my
own Judgment, in the other an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's.
But moreover, I wonder
thou wouldſt put that Enſnaring Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
to them (which was beſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Silence) viz. <hi>Whether the
Humanity was a part of Chriſt:</hi> For what
if they had turn'd another upon thee
to the ſame Purpoſe, thus, <hi>Whether
that which was crucified, and ſatisfied for
Sin, was a Part of Chriſt, or whole Chriſt?</hi>
Would not the ſame or more Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46470:21"/>
have fallen upon thee, if thou
hadſt directly anſwered? Brother, let
us leave dividing of Chriſt; and put
not ſuch Queries, which bring Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
upon both Parties. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Thy Way to prove them will as
eaſily prove us all No <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> for
I ſuppoſe thou waſt running to this,
<hi>That he that denies a Part of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
the Whole;</hi> but the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny
a part, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Then why may not
another reaſon thus? He that loves
not Chriſt, denys him; he that keeps
not his Commands, loves him not,
and ſo forward to this, That Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity
to every Command of
Chriſt is a Denying of Chriſt, then
muſt the <hi>Presbyter.</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> be
No <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for denying Baptiſm;
and ſome Baptized Churches muſt be
Antichriſtian for denying Laying on
of Hands on all, and others for not
keeping <hi>Saturday</hi>-Sabbath; But God

Thrive. Its ſtrange we cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

which if he can, will wound the Hare
before he courſes her: I was ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

in her Buſineſs, that I fear, ſhe
was hired: Whatever the Deſign was I
