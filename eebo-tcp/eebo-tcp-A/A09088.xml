            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Since the manifestation of that Booke, the first Author thereof, named M. <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> hath enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the same Booke, vvith a second part and nevv Additions, vvherein hee hath concluded and finished his vvhole intent of the Resolution, and that vpon speciall causes, as himselfe sets dovvn in Preface in this maner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beeing admonished by the writings of diuers, that since the publishing of my first Booke, it hath been misliked in two principall points. First, that I speake so much of good works &amp; so little of faith. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that I talked so largely of Gods

iustice, and so briefly of his mercie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, conceiuing by the information of manie, that diuers persons, hauing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in themselues to reade the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of which inconueniencie, I haue framed this second part of that work, &amp; therein inserted diuers chapters and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of matters more plausible, &amp; of themselues more indifferent, wherewith the Reader may solace his minde, at such times as he findeth the same not willing to feele the spur of more earnest motion to perfection.</hi>

most men fall into sin, and are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den also perpetually in the same, to their finall destruction and eternall perdition. So Esay the Prophet, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the carelesse Nobilitie and Gentrie of Iurie, that gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to banquetting and disporte, vvithout consideration of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties tovvards God: repeateth often the threate of <hi>woe</hi> against them, and then putteth dovvne the cause in these vvords:<note place="margin">

            <p>Here are tvvo causes (as you see) and tvvo effects linked together, of these Ievves damnation, the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of the other.

            <p>But for so much as iniquitie hath so aduaunced her selfe at this day in the harts of many,<note place="margin">The cause of thys Chapter.</note> as not onely to contemne and offend their Maker, but also to denie him, for patronage of their euil life, &amp; for extinguishing the worme of their own afflicted &amp; most miserable consciences; I am enforced before all other things, to discouer this fond and foule errour of theirs, and to remoue also this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of desperate iniquitie, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inuincible veritie of these two principles, the one depending of the other in such sort, as the first beeing prooued, the second hath of necessitie to follow.

For at that time,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iosep. de an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqu. lib.</hi> 14.</note> King Herod a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, put out quite the line of Iuda, from the gouernment of Iurie. But for the first part, touching Iudaes scepter, it is wonderfull to consider the circumstances of this prophecie.</p>
                  <p>For first, when it was spoken and vttered by Iacob, there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie of any scepter at all, to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12216:59"/>
among the Iewes, for that the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, or sonnes of Iacob at that day, were poore, and few in number, and neuer like to be a distinct Nation of themselues, or to depart foorth of Egypt againe. And secondly, if any such thing should come to passe, as they might be a people, and haue a scepter of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their own, yet was it not likelie,<note place="margin">Vnlikeli-hoods of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</note> that Iuda and his posteritie should possesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, for that he had three elder Brothers, to wit, Ruben, Simeon, and Leui: who in all likeli-hoode were to go before him. And thirdly, when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses recorded and put in writing thys prophecie, (which was diuers hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeeres after Iacob had spoken it,) it was much lesse likelie, that euer it should be true, for that Moses then present in gouernment, was of the Tribe of Leui,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.</note> and Iosua desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God for his successor,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iosua.</hi> 15.</note> was of the Tribe of Ephraim, and not of Iuda: which maketh greatlie for the certaintie of this recorde. For that it is most apparant, that Moses would neuer haue put such a prophecie in writing, to the disgrace of his owne Tribe, and to the preiudice and offence of Ruben, Simeon, Ephraim,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12216:60"/>
and other Trybes; neyther would they euer haue suffered such a dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but that it vvas euident to them by tradition, that their Grand-sire Iacob had spoken it, albeit then presently there was no great likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that euer after it should come to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And this was for the time of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but yet consider further,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Regu.</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 8.</note> that from Moses to Samuell, (that was last of all the Iudges) there passed foure hundred yeeres more, and yet was there no appearance of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this prophecie in Israel; for that the Tribe of Iuda was not establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in that gouernment.

By the former consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations we haue learned, that as among other creatures, nothing made it selfe: so nothing was made for it selfe, nor to serue it selfe.

                     <note place="margin">That Christ should be both God and man.</note>NOwe followeth there a seconde consideration of the qualitie of Christes person, of no lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then the former, and wherein the latter Iewes doe more dyscent from vs: &amp; that is, of the God-head of the Messias promised.

So is it in the generation of thys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate people, who first agreed with vs in all, or most poynts, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Christ to come, and denyed onely the fulfilling or applycation thereof in Iesus our Sauiour, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12216:105"/>
their vngracious of-spring, being not able to stand in that issue against vs, deuised a newe plea, and be tooke themselues to a far higher degree of impietie, affirming that we attribute many thinges vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that were not fore-tolde of the Messias to come; &amp; among other, that he should be GOD, and the sonne of God, and the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Trinitie. &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:12216:212"/>
true fayth, to consist in the certainty of that eternall lyfe, which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased vnto vs by Christ Iesus, which althogh we enioy not presently, yet by faith we are as fully assured of it, as if we had possession and fruition thereof already.
