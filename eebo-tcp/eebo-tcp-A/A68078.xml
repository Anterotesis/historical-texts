            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOVGH there is nothing in these bookes which haue beene so long vnanswered, but either it is vnworthy any answere, or else hath ben satisfied sufficiently before in many treatises extant in the English toung already: yet because the aduersaries should not altogether please themselues in their fantasie that they be vnanswerable, nor the simpler sort suspect that there is any thing in them that we need to be afraid of, I thought good to take in hand this short manner of confutation. In which I trust the diligent &amp; indifferent reader wil confesse, that I haue omitted much matter whereof I might haue taken aduantage, rather then that I haue left any argument of importance vnsatisfied. Considering therfore what breuitte I haue vsed as was necessarie for me, being but one against so many, I trust the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Readers will looke for no other vertue of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at my handes, but onely the simple shewing of the trueth, and the plaine confutation of the false reasons of the aduersarie. Which that they may the better see, &amp; with more profit perceiue, I exhort all such as haue the Popishe Bookes here confuted, to conferre their argumentes with mine answers. And for them that haue not the bookes at hand, I haue so set downe the titles of their Chapters, and the cheefe pointes of

               </gap> tables, that the perusers may vnderstand, I haue left no matter of any moment vntouched. In rehearsing of their arguments, I haue rather added weight vnto them, then taken any force from them, in my repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or abridgement of them, so neere as I could by any wit I haue, conceiue their order, and resolue their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode. What I haue perfourmed in answering, let the godly and learned Iudge. In the meane time I desire God to graunt that this my labour may be to the glorie of his name, and the profite of his Church, by Iesus Christe our Lord.</p>

And there followeth a reason, <hi>Ne<expan>

And not long after, <hi>Etiamsi, non intelligas illic recondita &amp;c.</hi> yea, although thou vnderstand not the misteries that are therein hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, yet of the very reading of them, great holinesse groweth.

                  <p>The third: <hi>If the scriptures be plaine and easie for euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderstand, it was no great benefit that Christ did open his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles witts, that they might vnderstand the scriptures, nor that he did interpret Moses and the Prophetes, to the disciples that went to Emaus, wherefore we conclude with S. Peter, that as he witnessing the Epistles of S. Paule be hard: so be the rest of the scriptures hard.</hi> O blundering Burgesse! Who did euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the scriptures were easie to be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirit of Christ? Or what asse of Acarnania, wold
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14727:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brave out suche a reason? The Apostles could not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the scriptures sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to teach all the world, without a singular gift of interpretation, therefore no Christian man may learne by reading the scriptures, howe to knowe God to his eternall saluation, without the same extraordinarie gift. But by your leaue maister speaker, (for the office you take vpon you, I know not howe you came vnto it) you misreport S Peter being a Lord of the higher house as you count him, for he saith not that the Epistles of S. Paule be hard, but that among those things which he wrote of the second comming of Christ, some things are hard to be vnderstoode. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither his authoritie, nor your reason, will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conclude your cause.</p>
                  <p>The fourth. <hi>The Chamberlen could not vnderstand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esay without an interpreter, therefore the scriptures are not plaine and easie of all men to be vnderstanded.</hi> A proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. There is some difficultie in some scriptures, therefore they are all hard and can not be vnderstoode. We neither affirme that all things in the scriptures are easie to be vnderstanded; nor that they are easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of all men. But that the children of God by his spirite, are instructed to vnderstand so much in them as is profitable for their saluation, and that nothing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for vs to knowe, is so obscurely set foorth in one scripture, but it is as plainly set down in an other. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we reiect interpreters, bicause we read the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but as Chrysostom teacheth, by reading the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, we are made more apt to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the interpreters. In Euan. Ioan. Hom. 10. The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Philip sent vnto the Chamberlen doth also declare, howe God wil blesse the reading of the scriptures, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is sought in them.</p>
                  <p>The fift. <hi>The Apostles them selues vnderstoode not Christe speaking of his passion and resurrection. Iohn.</hi> 16. <hi>After a while, &amp;c. therfore if the liuely voyce of Christ was dark, much more is the same now written in dead letters, dark &amp; hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed.</hi> The Apostles by speciall dispensation, not yet so wel lightned, that they vnderstood their master, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14727:7"/>
at this time, but at many other times also, bewrayed their naturall ignorance, that the grace of God in their illuminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in due time afterward, might appeare more glorious. But doth it therefore followe, that the sayings of Christe were hard, or their vnderstanding darke? A blinde man can not see the Sunne, is it therefore a good conclusion, that the Sunne is darke, and not easie to be seene? Howbeit, it is well to be marked, that once againe hee putteth difference betweene the liuely voyce of Christ, and his word written in dead letters, making op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position betweene <hi>The liuely voyce in the eare, and the deade: letter in the eye.</hi> As though the vnderstanding of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, consisted either in the eare or in the eye, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the eye hath seene, nor the eare hath heard, neither haue they ascended into the heart of man, such things as God hath prepared for them that loue him. 1. Cor. 2. Es. 64. But God hath reuealed them vnto vs by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which spirit searcheth out al things, euen the depthes or greatest secretes of God. Neuerthelesse, here is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught in <hi>Hieronyme ad Paulinum. Habet nescio quid latentis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergiae viua vox &amp;c. The liuely voyce hath I knowe not what hidden vertue, and being vttered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of the author, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eare of the disciple, soundeth more strongly. Wherfore Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynes when he was banished at Rhodes, and that Oration of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes was read, which he made against him, when all men did woonder at it, and praise it sighing he said: What if ye had heard the beast himself sounding out his owne words</hi>? This writeth Hieronyme to persuade Paulinꝰ, not only to satisfie him self with his writings, but also to trauel that he might so him, &amp; heare him, whom he had known before only by his writing, &amp; that by the example not only of heathen Philosophers, but also of holy men of the Church, as the next wordes following immediatly do plainely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie: <hi>Haec non dico quod sit in me aliquid tale &amp;c.</hi> I say not these things, for that there is in me any such matter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che either thou mayest, or art desierous to learne: but bicause thy feruent heate, and desire of learning, ought to be commended euen without vs. Thy wit is pregnant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14727:8"/>
and commendable without a teacher 3. So farre is it off that Hieronyme meant to compare the word of Christ spoken, with that which is writen, whose force is as great by his spirite in the scriptures, which this dogge calleth the deade letters, as it was in his voyce when it was vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But howe impudently the name of Hieronyme is abused against his plain iudgment, wherby he not only alloweth lay men to read the scripturs, but also confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that they receiue great fruit therby, may appeare by this one place amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many, written in <hi>Esaiam libro.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Frequenter euenit vt homines soeculi.</hi> It commeth to passe verie often, that lay men being ignorant of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sense, are yet fedde with the plaine and simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the scriptures. 33. And in his epistle vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same <q>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie, he affirmeth, that <hi>Ignoratio scripturarum, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratio Christi est.</hi>
                     </q> Ignorance of scriptures, is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christ. Shortnes will not suffer me to point the places only, to the confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the aduersary: if any dout or would see more, let them reade the places at the full.</p>
                  <p>The sixt <hi>All men haue not the gift of knowledge of prophesie, nor of interpretation of tongues, therefore euerie man hath not the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the scripturs, neither be they easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded of euerie man.</hi> First I pray you note, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the scriptures and the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tongs al one, secondly, what force is in this reason, all men haue not extraordinarie gifts of tongs, of healing, of knowledge, of prophesie, of interpretation of tongues &amp;c. Therefore the scriptures are so harde, as they cannot be vnderstood by the ordinarie gifte of prophesie, which is promised to all the seruaunts of God, young &amp; olde, men and women, vpon whom his holy spirit is powred. 10.2. Act. 2. I am ashamed to troble the readers with any more words, in answer vnto such a grosse consequence.</p>
                  <p>The seuenth, <hi>God hath ordeined first Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> secondly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, thirdly teachers, &amp;c. Now if the scriptures be easie for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans vnderstanding, then either these states be superfluous, or else euerie man is a teacher and prophete, but this were a great absurditie, therfore the scriptures are hard &amp; full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi>

Alas poore man, is there no vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the scriptures, but such as may make a man a teacher, &amp; an extraordinarie prophete? are there no degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but either the highest perfection, or the depest ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance? Will this reason follow? Men may profite in knowledge by reading, therefore teaching is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: or this, teaching is necessarie, therfore reading is vnprofitable. What shall I say to these reasons, but that they are giuen ouer into a reprobate minde, which are so furiously bent to withstand the trueth, that they set not foorth so much as any shadowe of reason.</p>

Exod. 25. Acts 7. Heb. 8. But these sayings offendeth M.

As for the moosling of the oxe, that treadeth the corne, is yet more plaine, when the Apostle doth gather a strong argument out of that place, from the lesse to the more, that God which would haue men to consider bruite beastes, with humanitie, would not haue the Ministers of his word neglected at their handes.

But then followeth the sonne of Syrach, <hi>With his vnseemely wordes describing the wickednesse of an harlot Cap.</hi> 62. <hi>Which an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man would be ashamed to speake, and you ashamed to write, if they were not scripture. Like as one that goeth by the way, and is thirstie, so shall she open her mouth, and drinke of euery next water that she may get.

But once againe you sweare, that <hi>This text being spoken in the presence of a good vertuous gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the book turned &amp; the place read, she exclamed &amp; said, that if the scripture had such bawdie wordes, she would no more beleeue the scripture, for it was naught, with mo such like wordes.</hi> To passe ouer the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous nicenes of this your Gentlewoman, and your iudgement of their goodnes and vertue, with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, that troubled her with this place: I pray you maister Heskins, was it the darkenes of the place, that did so much offend her, or else because she thought it to be too plaine a description of suche a matter? You see therefore, or if you do not, all the worlde beside do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that while you seeke to bring the reading of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into contempt and hatred, you forget your selfe so much, that you bring examples of one contrarie for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14727:10"/>
another. Although if I may speake of mine experience, as well as you, I do very well remember, that I hearde a sober and chaste matron, of her owne accorde, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked thereto by any meanes, but the only hearing the same place read, affirme, that it was a modest descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so vile manners as an harlot vseth.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Chapter, you bring in a long tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonie of Origen. 10. lib. Strom. Who to defend his wicked allegorizing vpon the scriptures, goeth about to proue by some examples and sentences, that the litteral sense is not profitable, but rather hurtfull. As the incest of Iuda, &amp; the polygamie of the Patriarks, the dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Noe, and such like, which are not commended in histories, but reproued. The sacrifices of Leuiticus he imagineth should prouoke men to idolatrie, but without all colour of reason. He addeth the iudgement of God against Babylon and her children in the Psalme. 136. and the iustice that Dauid doeth promise to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute against al the wicked of the land. Psalm. 101. to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to cruelty and contention, but all in vaine: like as his purpose (for which he alledgeth them,) was wicked, namely to ouerthrowe the true and naturall sense of the scripture. But yet the same Origen is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against maister Heskins, in that cause for which he is alledged, as appeareth plainely in Leuitici cap. 16. Hom. 9. <hi>An tu putas qui vix diebus fectis ad Ecclesiam venis, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>Thinkest thou whiche scarcely commest to the Church vpon the holy dayes, &amp; giuest no heede to heare the wordes of God, nor takest any paines to fulfill his commandements, that the Lordes lot can come vppon thee? Yet we wish that after you haue heard these things you would take paines not only in the Church to heare the wordes of God, but also at home in your houses to be exercised, and to meditate in the Lawe of the Lorde day and night.

But let vs see his wise reasons, to proue the new Testament to be hard, bicause some places therein be hard to be vnderstanded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Euangelistes Matthewe and Luke seeme to varrie in the Genealogie of Christ, therefore all is not easie.</hi> What then?

                     </gap>hat Christe was the seede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the sonne of Dauid. In the rest, what straunge matter is it, if one pedegree be brought from one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ancester by seuerall discents, lineall, and collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, natural, and legall, by the male and by the female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the second obscure place, Chrysostome is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, who <hi>Numbereth it among the hid thinges, howe Elizabeth being of the tribe of Leuie, may be called the cousen of Marie.</hi> 
                     <q>A perillous doubt, in solution whereof, though a number be ignoraunt, yet I doubt not but they may be saued. And yet by conference of the stories of scripture it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to finde, that men of the tribe of Iuda might marrie of the Priestes daughters, and the Priestes did marrie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the Kings daughters of Iuda. By which mariages cousenage might easily be vnderstoode to growe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two tribes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithstanding the lawe of Num 36.</q> Which did forbid only those marriages, by which the inheritances might be confounded.</p>
                  <p>The third doubtfull place is in Marke. 13. Where it is said, that <hi>Of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14727:11"/>
Angels in heauen, nor the sonne him selfe, but the father.</hi> And Chrysostome is againe alledged, to shewe that this is a doubtful place: and yet a simple Christian that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the two diuers natures in Christ, humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, can easily solute it, and say, that although Christe by his godhead knoweth all things, yet as he was man he knewe not all things.</p>
                  <p>The fourth proofe is taken out of the example of Algasia and Hedibia, two godly women, and studious of the scriptures; whereof the one found twelue, the other eleuen doubtes in the newe Testament, and sent to S. Hieronyme for resolution of them. I maruell M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins hath so small discretion, to alledge these examples, which do quight ouerthrowe his purpose. If not onely men, but women also, may read the scriptures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite so well in the studie of them, that they can finde but eleuen or twelue doubts in the whole newe Testament, for resolution whereof, they did (as became good schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) send so farre for the iudgement of their learned maister. But M. Heskins, not content to shewe that they douted, will also set downe some of their douts, namely this one moued by Algasia. <hi>Why Iohn the Baptist should send his disciples to Christ to aske this question: Art thou he that shalt come, or do we looke for an other? seeing he both knewe, &amp; openly pointed at Christ with his finger before</hi>? Although this good woman doubted of this matter, yet it is easie to answer, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sought the instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his disciples, rather then the confirmation of his owne knowledge. An other was moued by Hedibia, <hi>Howe Christ in Iohn</hi> 20. <hi>forbad Marie to touch him, when Matthew</hi> 28. <hi>affirmeth, that the women held his feete.</hi> It seemeth to M. Heskins that one of these must be vntrue, I dare say it seemed not so to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibia, although she could not perfectly reconcile these places. But seeing that both these reports are true, it is plaine ynough, that he suffered Marie Magdalene to holde his feete so much, as was sufficient to confirme the certeintie of his resurrection, &amp; forbad her not, vntil she shewed her self too much addicted to his bodily prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:14727:12"/>Another doubt is, howe <hi>Marke saith the women came to the sepulchre when the Sunne was rysen, and then saith, Marie Magdalene came early in the morning when it was yet darke.</hi> A woman sitting at her distaffe, woulde easily solue this doubt, and say that it was darke when they set foorth of their dores, but the Sunne was risen by that time they came to the Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>Yet another doubt of Hedibia, <hi>whether Christ breathing on his Apostles gaue them the holie Ghost, when he promised to send him after his ascension.</hi> There is no doubt but he did then in some small measure, but afterwardes sent him with most plentifull vertue and power.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>what needed Austen to haue written a great volume, De consensu Euangelistarum, what needed the comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Hieronyme &amp; Ambrose vpon the Euangelistes, or the Homilies of Chrysostome &amp; Augustine, and the expositions of so manie learned men, &amp;c. if the Scriptures be so plaine &amp; easie</hi>? O foolish conclusion! as though the Scriptures may not planely set foorth vnto vs, all things necessarie for vs to learne, and yet the same things (with all other things conteined in them, be set forth more plainly &amp; largely to the instruction &amp; increase of our faith, hope, comfort, obedience, &amp;c. by Comentaries, Homelies, expositions, yea admonitions, and exhortations.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the same Epistle Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>concerning the reiection of the Iewes &amp; calling of the Gentiles, there are many places that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble M. Heskins, as that out of Esay, for calling of the Gentiles. I am found of them that sought me not, &amp;c. But against Israel, &amp;c. yet afterward he asketh if God haue forsaken his people, &amp; aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth: God forbid, &amp; such like.</hi> The matter is not so hard as it seemeth to him, but who so doth read the text at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely, may see the difference betweene a perticuler reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many, &amp; an vniuersal reiection of all, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral reiection of most, &amp; the finall reiection of al. The former is true, the latter is false.</p>
                  <p>The matter of predestination no man denyeth, but it is a great secreat, yet so much as the spirite of God hath reuealed of it, for our comfort, is not so hard, but it may be easily vnderstood.

                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:14727:13"/>A like difficultie he findeth betweene these places: <hi>God will haue all men to be saued and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>After this he repeateth another doubt of Algasia: <hi>What Paule meaned to wish him selfe accursed from Christ, for the Iewes, which doubt is increased by an obiection of Hieronyme, that he had sayed before: I am sure that neither death nor life, &amp;c. nor any other creature can separate vs from the loue of God. In which saying he seemeth to affirme that he so feruently loued Christ, that nothing could separate him from his loue, in the other he seemeth for the loue he bare to the Iewes, to wish that he were sepaerated from Christ, as though he loued the Iewes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Christ.</hi> A short aunswere is best. Although his desire was exceeding vehement, yet it was more for zeale of Gods honour, then for loue of the Iewes. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he loued Christ feruently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the boast he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of assurance, was not of that loue wherewith he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Christ, but of that loue wherwith Christ loued him. <hi>And yet there is another doubt moued by Algasia vpon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Paule Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>For scarse will any man dye for a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The obscuritie of which place, hath moued two contrarie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, to take their heresies thereof. Marcion, who made two Gods, a iust GOD of the Lawe, for whome fewe dyed, and a good God of the Gospell, Christ, for whome innumerable Martyre haue suffered. Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ius contrarywise calleth Christ the iust God vppon the Psalme</hi> 71. <hi>Lord giue thy iudgements to the King, and thy righteousnesse to the Kings sonne. The good God he called father of heauen, of whome Christ saide, none is good but God.</hi> These doubtes Master Heskins moueth, but he aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth none. The place is not so darke, that eyther such doubt should be made of it, or such farre fetched expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions sought as the heretikes made. For a man may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14727:13"/>
be righteous in some case, for which he is condemned to dye, which is not simply a good man, and for such a one will hardly any man giue his life, although peraduenture for a very good man, some woulde venture to dye: But Christ dyed for vs, being his enemies, iustly condemned, &amp; altogether naught or wicked, which no man would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer do but he. The douts of Algasia are matched with the foure questions of Amandus, of which one was, of that place 1. Cor. 15. <hi>He must reigne till he haue put all things vnder his feete. The last enimie that shalbe subdued is death. For he hath put all things vnder his feete. But when he sayeth, all things are put vnder him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things vnder him. When all things are subdued vnder him, then shall the sonne himselfe also be subiect vnto him that put all things vnder him, that God may be all in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The question is, howe the sonne shalbe subiect to the father when he is equall with him. And this doubt is answered by Hillarius lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de Trin.</hi> M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins doth often declare, that he had rather men should be taught by him to doubt, then to be resolued in doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for he vouchsafeth not so much, as to recyte the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of Hillarius, but onely to cyte the place. But the aunswere is easie by the distinction of the two natures in Christ: for he shall neuer be subiect in his diuinitie, but in his humanitie, wherein he is nowe exalted, &amp; reigneth vntill all his enimies be put vnder his feete.</p>
                  <p>Yet another doubt vpon Coll. 1. Where Paul writeth: <hi>Nowe ioye I in my suffrings for you, and fulfill the rest of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Christ in my fleshe for his bodie which is his Church. Here he seemeth to make the passion of Christ insufficient.</hi> Not a-whit: for as Christ suffered once in his owne person, for their redemption, so he suffereth daily in his members, for their exercise of patience, &amp; confirmation of faith.</p>
                  <p>Then the Epistle to the Hebrues hath two sore senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Heb. 6. &amp; 10. <hi>For it is not possible that they which were once lightened, and haue tasted of the heauenly gift, and were made partakers of the holie Ghoste, and haue tasted of the good worde of God, and of the power of the world to come, if they fall away, should be renewed againe by repentance, seeing they crucifie againe to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14727:14"/>
them selues the Sonne of God and make a mocke of him.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>For if we sinne wilfully after we haue receiued the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinnes, but a fearefull looking for of iudgement, and violent fire which shall deuour the aduersaries.</hi> The difficultie of these places resteth in one point, and in a manner in one worde in eche of the sentences. For the Apostle excludeth not from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance euery one that falleth and sinneth, but him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which sinneth so wilfully, that he falleth cleane away from Christ.

But for as much as these two great doctors, could not agree about the exposition of this place, it doth not so much declare the hardnesse of the Scriptures, as it doth discourage vs, to finde the certeine exposition of them at all times in the iudgement of the doctours: which both in this place and many other, are not onely diuers, but oftentimes contrarie one to another. The conclusion of the Chapter is not all amisse, wherein he dissuadeth not men from reading the scriptures, but from rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of iudgement, and exhorteth the readers of them to humilitie and modestie, that so the spirite of GOD may rest vppon them, which will leade them into all trueth.</p>

                     <hi>The scriptures are darke that they are found out with labour, but not shut that they can not be found out at all, and that the priestes ought to be the keykeepers of the scriptures, not to shut them vp, but to open them, &amp;c.</hi> I would oppose some testimonie of Chrysostome to explane his meaning, not to be to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reading the scriptures, but that M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins doth soone after confesse the same, of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in these wordes: <hi>I am not ignorant (gentle reader) that Chrysostome doth so, that is, that Chrysostome in a number of places most earnestly exhorteth men to the reading of the scriptures, and doth not feare them with the obscuritie, and difficultie thereof.</hi> I aske no more against M. Heskins, but his own confession of Chrysostomes iudgement to be against him, whervnto we must returne anon, after a little consideration of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories iudgement. <hi>Gregorie sheweth, that the obscuritie of the scriptures is for great profite, for exercising the vnderstanding, for auoyding of wearines, idlenes, contempt, and for great delight, when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14727:16"/>
it is found out with labour.</hi> Augustine hath the like sentence, but this maketh much for our cause, that the obscuritie of the scripture, where, it is darke: is very profitable for the diligent reader. To conclude, if all the scripture were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so darke, yet seeing it is necessarie to be knowne of al men, it ought to be read and studied of all, &amp; the more &amp; the oftener, where it is more hard to vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> long &amp; diligent search may find out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which sildome &amp; slight reading would passe ouer. As for the last testimonie of Hieronyme ad Paulinum, concerning the Canonicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, <hi>That they are both short and long so that there be not many which are not blind in them.</hi> Bicause we had the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will referre it to the former answeres. The rest of the rayling stuffe, charging vs with cause of heresies, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and ignorance, in suffering and allowing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to reade the scriptures, affirming them to be easie, when they be hard &amp;c. is more meete for M. Heskins to write, then vs to answere. But to return to the obiection, that he maketh of the iudgement of Chrysostome and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus, whom he confesseth to be against him, let vs see his wittie answeres. To Chrysostome he answereth, <hi>That there were two causes why he would haue the scriptures read, one, that they might the better vnderstand his expositions in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, the other that they might reade them to followe them: to these purposes he graunteth it were tollerable they should be read, but not to frame newe doctrines out of them, nor to cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mne the learned teachers, &amp;c.</hi> And who (I pray you) would haue them read to other purpose? Not Luther, not Iewell, nor any man whom you most spyte at. But see the force of truth, and the malice of an enimie therof. Heskins hauing reasoned in fiue Chapters, against the reading of scriptures, nowe graunteth to it: but yet that which is most conuenient &amp; of al, most necessarie, he vouchsafeth to cal it but tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To Erasmus he replyeth, first, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seeing he confesseth in diuers places the scriptures to be hard to vnderstand, he maruelleth that he would exhort ignorant men to the reading of them. But Erasmus would easily turne backe M. Heskins reason vpon his owne head. Seeing they are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14727:16"/>
hard, they are the more often and diligently to be read &amp; studied. Secondly, he thinketh Alphonsus good ynough to oppose against Erasmus, who affirmeth, <hi>That although it were meete the people should read the scriptures in Chrysostomes time, yet it is not meete nowe, bicause lawes are changed as the times and manners of men are. And it is no more meete that the people should nowe read the scriptures, then that the Vigils should be kept as they were in Hieronymes time, or that Infantes should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Communion as they did in Augustines t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, note also the errour of the Church in S.

But nowe to the meane appointed by God, which you say, <hi>Is, that the lawe should be in the mouth of the Priest, and the people should learne it at his mouth.</hi> A very godly order in deede, but yet such as neither promiseth, that the lawe shal be alwayes in the Priestes heart, nor bindeth the people to learne it only at his mouth. And therefore nothing in the world letteth, but that the godly man should meditate in the lawe of God day &amp; night, Psal. 1. and haue it so familiar vnto him, that he shuld teach his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therin, talke of it at home,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14727:17"/>
&amp; abroad, vprising, and downlying, and write on the postes of his doores, and vpon his gates, that he may learne to do it. Deut. 4. &amp; 11. Wherefore all the places that M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins alledgeth, to shewe that the Priestes should be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the people instructed by them, serue to proue nothing that is in controuersie, but is confessed of al men: except it be to condemne the Clergie of Papistrie, which for the most part are ignoraunt, not onely of Gods lawe, but of all honest knowledge, and vpon very necessitie, open a gate vnto the people, to seeke instruction them selues, where the ordinarie passage is stopped, through the ignorance of the Ministers.</p>
                  <p>The first place by him alledged, is Deu. 17. <hi>That if there rise a matter too hard for the people in iudgement betweene bloud and bloud, &amp;c. they shall come to the Priestes, and stand to their iudgement on paine of death, &amp;c.</hi> Although I might answere, that this ordinaunce appertaineth to iudiciall causes, of which God gaue his lawe also, yet if it be taken general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so long as the Prieste determineth according to the lawe, it is well ynough. But this proueth not, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must haue no vnderstanding, beside the priests mouth. For the decree is onely of matters that are difficult, and such as cannot be decided at home. No more do the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Malachie, <hi>That the lips of the Priest shall keepe the law, and men shall require it at his mouth.</hi> And much lesse the commaundement in Aggee: <hi>Enquire the lawe of the Priestes,</hi> And least of all that Christ commaundeth the Scribes and Pharisees to be heard sitting in the chaire of Moses. These places proue, that it is the Priestes duetie to be learned in the lawe of God, but repel not the general lawe, wherby euery man is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded also to studie in the law of God, yea, though the Priestes neither would nor could teach him. For if the blinde followe the blinde, they both fall into the ditch: which our sauiour Christ willeth all men to take heede of. Hieronyme in the place by you alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (M.

Tim. 3. &amp; Tit. 1. that both by the new Testament and the old it is the priests office to know and teach the lawe of God. As is also that which you adde out of 1. Cor. 12. that God hath appointed some Apostles, some Prophets, some pastors, &amp; teachers, as though these orders might not stand with the peoples reading of the scriptures: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen in the Apostles time, the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Berrhoeans wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, for that thei did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare the Apostles, but also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred their doctrin with the scriptures Actes. 17. Hauing rehearsed your texts, you fal to collecting of three things out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1. That it is the dutie of a Priest to be learned in the law of God, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life also, which euerie man confesseth. 2. That there be doubts and hard matters in the law. And that also shal be confessed. But withall out of the same place it is proued, that there are many plaine and easie pointes in the lawe, because the decree was not for all the lawe, but onely for harde cases of the lawe. Thirdly, that the people must bee taught them and learne of the priestes, and this also shall be granted to the vttermost, so that you will allow the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to learn such things as are easie, not only of the priests, but also of their own reading, study, &amp; conference with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are no priestes. And this is no inuerting of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, M. Heskins, how much soeuer you enuie the peoples instruction. For it is gods commaundement, as I shewed before, that his people shoulde not onely reade the lawe themselues, but teach the same to others, yea parentes are commaunded to teach the lawe of God to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and yet I weene you will not say that all parents be priestes. But the marke you shoote at, is easie to see, the ignorance of the people is more for your worshippe and gaine then their knowledge. The examples you bring, of the people teaching Aaron, of Chore, Dathan, &amp; Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram; rebelling against Moses and Aaron, and of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14727:18"/>
in deposing Samuel and desiring a king, are of no force to dissuade men from reading of the Scriptures, no thoughe they haue learned and true teachers: much lesse, when they are vnder dumbe dogges and heretikes, as all popishe priestes are: nor to abridge the authoritie of lawfull magistrates, in banishing and suppressing all v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped power and false teachers, nor to shake off the yoke of Antichrist to submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto a king. There is too great oddes betweene the Pope and Samuel, betweene Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Aaron &amp; the popish cleargie, that they which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the Pope and his Prelates, should be in the case of Dathan and his complices, or of the people that refused the regiment of Samuel.

Ergo God did not sende all the people, only to the fiue books of Moses to learne, but willed them to learne of their Elders: So now, all men may not be sent to the scriptures to learne, but they must learne of their Fathers, what be the goodly workes of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the Scriptures.</hi> Why M. Heskins, you forget not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lodgike, but common reason? We would not haue men to learne, onely by reading the scriptures, but muche more by hearing their teachers, first their Pastors, and then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14727:18"/>
all other, whom God hath indued with any gift of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And wil you conclude w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shame, that because men were not sent, only to the fiue Bookes of Moses, men may not now be sent at all to the scriptures? And are you so blinde that you cannot see, this text to ouerthrowe the purpose of both your sixth and seuenth Chapters after this manner, by necessary conclusion? Men must learne of their fathers, therefore not only of the Priestes. The rest that followeth for certeine pages, is so tedious a proofe of that which is not at all in controuersie, that it yrketh me to abridge it, but for orders sake. The Apostles learned of Christ in three yeares study, prayer is required to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the scripture by Origens iudgement. The Fathers of the Church learned of their Elders, as Clemens, Marke, Linus, Cletus, of Peter: Titus, Timotheus, Luke, &amp; Dionise, of Paule: and so one of an other. Basil and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie Nazianzen studied thirteene yeres in a monasterie. Hieronyme learned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues, &amp; trusted not his own iudgement, wherefore all rashe readers and arrogant tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers may be abashed, which take vpon them, to teach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be learned, whereas no man, may be his owne teacher in the scriptures. All this, and much more shall be graunted to M. Heskins without any strife at all. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he also granteth, (though it be not very liberally) yet, it must not be refused. <hi>That in S. Hieronymies time many did study the scriptures, which if the people coulde nowe reuerently and meekely vse might be tollerated.</hi> Well then, the allowance of antiquitie is of our side, and the conditional tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of M. Heskins: for I may not say of the Popish Church, knowing what horrible persecution they practise against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue but a book of the scriptures in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tonge, found in their hand or house, although it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued, that they read it. Wherefore, it is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, that hee chargeth the proclamer, with slaundering their Churche, to bring hir in hatred with the lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as though she had nowe forbidden them to read the Scriptures, in their owne tongue: whereas he knoweth no suche prohibition, giuen to the lay people vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14727:19"/>
But the reason is most monsterous. <hi>For if there had bene any such prohibition, there should not haue bene so many lay men, which haue both read and written of the scriptures in their natiue tongues, &amp;c.</hi> As thoughe learned lay men, coulde not haue readd the scriptures but in their mother tongue. <hi>But the church fearing the abuses of the scriptures by the vnlearned lay men, forbad them.</hi> But such lay men as vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Hebrue &amp; Greeke, the Church wil allow them to read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in English. O wise &amp; prouident Church! <hi>Nay mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not at this. For the learned if they be rashe fall into heresies: much more the vnlearned.</hi> And the learned also, yea and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians themselues sometimes take surfeites, therefore it were a sure way for the people neuer to eate meate. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men and wisemen somtime haue their houses burned, therefore it is much more dangerous for poore and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men to haue fire in their houses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The knowledge of Mysteries muste not bee made common to all men for the Iewes would not suffer Genesis, and Cantica to be redde of young men before</hi> 30. <hi>yeares of age. The heathen men also, as the Romanes &amp; Philosophers, kept close their secrets: the one Sibyllaes bookes the other Morall philosophie, &amp; especially Metaphysike.</hi> If I had time I might make sporte with this Metaphysical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In Matth. H.</hi> 44.</note> that Christian men must folow the practise of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. But I must passe ouer to the rest. Chrysostom in the Greeke Church, as wel as Hieronyme in the Latine, wold haue the people to learne by hearing their teachers, and not onely by reading them selues, because the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are darke, and are a storehouse not common for all men, but out of which the stewardes must deliuer to euerie man his portion. Remember all this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that M. Heskins confessed before, that Chrysostome doth often earnestly exhort the lay and vnlearned people to the diligent reading of the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Then followe similitudes <hi>of young children and vnthriftes, the one if they feede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, the meate runneth about their mouth, bosome, and clothes, the other spende their fathers goods in suites, and quarels, and contention with their brethren: So men without witte &amp; grace abuse the scriptures to the hurt of others, &amp; no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14727:19"/>
of themselues.</hi> Except all laye men want witt and grace, these similitudes proue nothing. For many priestes also want wit &amp; grace, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you admit to read the scriptures. After similitudes come examples. <hi>Valdo an vnlearned man caused Bookes of scripture to be translated, and so beganne the sect of Valdenses, or Pauperes de Lugduno. Out of the same founteine of ignorance sprang the heretikes, called Begradi Turrelupini.</hi> Valdo was a godly man, &amp; seeing the ignorance and vngodlines of the Priests, did very wel to procure the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the scripture, and vppon good groundes departed from the Church of Rome vnto the Church of Christ, what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were as stories are vncertein, so I leaue them in doubt.</p>
                  <p>But Luther and Zwinglius are charged to affirme <hi>The scriptures to be easie, and make it free for all men to read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them, and teach that not onely men, but also women may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly preache the worde of God, and that as well a childe and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man absolueth, as a Bishop.</hi> If these were not meere slaunders, he would haue set downe their owne wordes, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of which no doubt, would discharge them of such absurdities as he collecteth. For they would neuer affirme euery place of the scripture to be easie, nor women, but in case where al men, (or the most) faile of knowledge to teach, as the prophetesses of the olde lawe did, nor women and children to absolue as well as a godly bishop by the doctrine of the Gospell, but perhaps better then an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Popish Prelate.</p>
                  <p>Likewise where he chargeth Luther <hi>To boast that he was ignorant in no part of the scripture, and yet bringeth in his owne wordes: wherein he confesseth that he knew not whether he had the right vnderstanding of the Psalmes, and saith also, that it was most impudent rashnesse for any man to professe that he vnderstoode any one booke of scripture in all partes:</hi> I say the conference of these places doeth declare, that no man except he were blinde, madde, or dronke with malice, would beleeue the slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of boasting to be true in manner and forme as Maister Heskins setteth it downe.</p>
                  <p>Hauing vomited his malice against Luther &amp; Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, he inueyeth with mayn sayle of open rayling against
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14727:20"/>
the people of our time, for the rashnesse and disorder of some. As though there were no talke, but rash babbling of predestination, free wil, iustification, yea God to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of sinne, of the number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacraments, &amp; especially the sacrament of the altar, and no where, but in Tauernes, Innes, Alehouses, and Barbarshops, in streetes, highwayes, and fieldes, and in the mouthes of women, boyes, and girles. God be thanked, this slaunder is false. Although there be great rashnesse in some, and vnreligiousnesse in more: yet the true members of Christ, profite much by reading of his word. We confesse with Gregorie Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene, that it is not for euery man rashly to dispute of God, nor yet of diuine matters, but with humilitie and sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which they shal learne no where so well, as in the holy scriptures of God. The other cauil that followeth, of lay men artificers, preaching in open places, &amp; ministring the sacramentes deserueth no answere, for if they be admitted to the office, beeing worthy thereof, there is no doubt, but they may as well now, as in all ages of the Church they haue done, neither are they to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for laymen, though they haue beene artificers. Yet if they presume without calling and admission of the Church, they are no more borne withall among vs, then suche as counterfet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be Priestes among the Papistes. As Englishe Ioan did to clyme to the Papacie, &amp; as of late a lewd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Italie feigned himselfe to be a Cardinall, as Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus in his defence of Herodotus doth witnesse. We condemne according to the scriptures, not only all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion of men without calling, but all ambitious and symoniacall practises, to procure the outward calling. So farre off is it, that we allowe euerie man of his owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, to intrude himselfe, as this man doth most vainely slaunder vs.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14727:20"/>
Iames, Salomon, and Hieronyme, that we should heare &amp; learne of them, whom God hath appointed, pastors and teachers in his Church: he dissuadeth men also, by the authoritie of Paule, and Ecclesiasticus, to appoint vnto them selues Elders, or maisters, to be carried about with new and straunge doctrines: &amp; decreeth, <hi>That they only are lawfull Elders, that haue learned of their fathers. For whiche cause Luther was no good Elder, allowing women to teach openly, contrary to Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. which is an impudent slaunder of Luther, who by no meanes would haue women to teache, except it were extraordinarily, as the prophetesses of the olde time did namely Debora, Holda, &amp; such like. Such stuffe is in the other slaunders, <hi>That contrition maketh a man more sinner,</hi> where Luther meaneth of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which is without faith, &amp; therfore must needs be sinne. <hi>That a righteous man in euery good worke sinneth mortally,</hi> where he meaneth that sinne and imperfection is mixed, euen with the best works, not that good workes are sinne. That is also a detestable lye, that Luther should teach, <hi>Euery Christian man, to be a priest for the common or publique ministery,</hi> wheras he neither thought nor spake otherwise, then the scripture speaketh, which hath made vs Kings &amp; Priests. Apoc. 1. And no lesse is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> slander of Zwinglius, <hi>That he taught, that originall offence is no sinne,</hi> whereas the worlde knoweth, that Zwinglius taught the contrarie, and the Papistes come neerer to that errour, whiche define it to be no sinne in the regenerate: it is as false that he taught, <hi>That Christian mens children neede not to be baptised,</hi> As it is true, that if they dye without baptisme, (without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of their part,) it is no cause of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them. The saying of Christ, except a man be borne againe of water &amp; of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, maketh no more for the baptisme of infantes, then his saying also, except ye eate the fleshe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of man, &amp; drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you, maketh to proue, that infants must receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for neither in the one speaketh he of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of baptisme, nor in the other place, of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But where Luther doth often protest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will not be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14727:21"/>
taught by man, but by God, he doeth as euerie Christian man ought to do, and yet excludeth not the ministerie of men, but the authoritie, doctrines, traditions, and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, which by Luciferian pride take vpon them to teache that they haue not learned of God. But howe shall we vnderstand this saying of Maister Heskins, speaking in despight of Luther: <hi>This is another Paule.</hi> As though only Paul wer called of God without the ministery of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the Apostles were so, or as though it were a reproche to be so called as Paul was: if God do extraordinarily stir vp any man, as he did the Apostles &amp; Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelistes. After his deriding of Paul, Zwinglius is condemned, by that which Maister Heskins hath saide, for writing a booke <hi>De clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate verbi Dei,</hi> How wisely and iustly, let the godly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders iudge. Next followeth generall rayling against Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius, Bullingerus, Caluinus, Bucer, of whom his aduersarie (meaning I thinke the B. of Sarum) learned his heresies: then he returneth to vnlearned artificers, teaching in corners. All which he would haue to be auoyded: I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose because he hath rayled vpon them, and called them heretiques, for other reason he bringeth none. Except this be one, that Hieronyme thinketh it not sufficient, if a man say, he loueth God, and yet breaketh the vnitie of the Church. The Church once named, by and by all is his. As though it were no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie at this day, whether the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Rome be the Church of God or no. And as though all Christendome, had bene at all times, and in all places obedient to the Churche of Rome, before these fewe yeares. And therfore he is bolde to demaunde where it was taught in the Christian worlde, that Christes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie is not in the sacrament, nor to be offered, nor receiued, nor honoured? Nay Maister Heskins, where was this taught in the affirmatiue for fiue or sixe hundreth yeares after Christe? As for your other questions of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the dead, and prayers to the dead, if you bring any reasons for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this your <hi>Omnegatheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> they shal be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered otherwise the readers for me shall resort to other treatises where they be handled of purpose. <hi>But seeing men
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14727:21"/>
must learne the law of their mother, that is the Church, they must follow Hieronyme, which neuer ceased from his youth, to seeke knowledge of learned men, and trauelled to Alexandria to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed of Didym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s. So did Augustine to Millain to learne of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</hi> No wise man will mislike this counsell. But this one thing especially is notable: <hi>That Damasus being bishop of Rome, did send to S. Hieronyme to be answered in certein doubts, and disdained not to learne of him.</hi> I had thought the Pope, had had all knowledge <hi>In scrinio pectoris,</hi> in the closet of his brest, that he had the spirite of trueth, to resolue all doubtes, so that he could not erre, and that Hieronyme hauing him at Rome, needed not to haue sought know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Alexandria. But Damasus, although euen in that time, a ioly stately Prelate, as appeareth by some of his Epistles, (if they be not counterfet) yet shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe farre from that Antichristian pride, which the Popes of Rome, (I cannot say his successors,) did shew afterward, and yet to this day do holde.</p>
                  <p>But to omitte Damasus <hi>Many learned of Saint Augustine, and of other learned men also, which were learned them selues.</hi> They did wel, &amp; many, (God be blessed) follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample at this day, and yet too fewe, for it were to be wished, that such modestie were in all men. The say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Clemens, registred also in the cannon lawe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you alledge it out of a counterfet and barbarous epistle, yet is it very godly, and worthie of the Apostles scholler: <hi>That the scripture must not be drawen into straunge and forreigne senses, according vnto euerie mans phantasie, but the true sense must be taken out of the very Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, agreeable to the iudgement of them, that haue receiued is from the elders,</hi> That is the Apostles.

First he there declareth, that as the mysterie of our redemption was promised, figured, &amp; prophesied in the olde Testament, and accomplished in the New: so was the memorial of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> redemption: which Newe Testament being euerlasting, hath an euerlasting Priest, &amp; an euerlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sacrifice. The euerlasting priest he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth to be our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14727:23"/>
sauiour Christ. <hi>But the euerlasting sacrifice</hi> (he saith) <hi>is the very body &amp; blod of the same, our sauiour Christ. Which as he according to the order of his priesthood, did sacrifice in his last supper, vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine: so did he giue authoritie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to the Apostles &amp; ministers of his Churche to do the same, saying: Hoc facite in mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorationem. This do ye in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of me.</hi> Beside that these thinges of the euerlasting sacrifice, be vttered without all proofe, or shadowe thereof, marke one horrible blasphemie, and an other detestable absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. For in as much as he affirmeth, the euerlasting sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to be Christes body and bloud offered in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and it is manifest by the scripture, that Christe neuer offered but one sacrifice, and that but once: Heb. 9.25.10.14. it is euident, that he vtterly excludeth the sacrifice of his body vpon the Crosse, as not being done, according to the order of his euerlasting priesthoode. For a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious absurditie note this, that he graunteth the euerlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting priesthood to Christ, (Which as the Apostle witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth is without succession) Heb. 7.24. because it is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting in him: and yet he maketh the Apostles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Church, partakers of that Priesthod, to offer that sacrifice, which none could offer, but he himselfe, which is an euerlasting priest, after the order of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, that is, both a King and Priest.</p>
                  <p>He proceedeth and affirmeth, that <hi>Of this new Priesthood and sacrifice, there were figures, and prophesies, which must aswell be performed, as the other were of the instituter of them. The other figures and prophesies ended in Christ touching the fact, but not touching the efficacie and vertue which is eternall. The newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the new priesthood, and the new sacrifice are begon, and confirmed in the bloud of Christ, but must continue alwayes, whereof there be figures in the lawe of nature, and in the lawe of Moses. In the lawe of nature, albeit that Seth, Noe, and other did offer sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnto God: yet were they not figures of this sacrifice now vsed in Christes Church, but rather of Christes sacrifice offered vpon the crosse after the manner of Aaron.</hi> Here marke first, that he maketh Christ to haue two sacrifices, this sacrifice whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is now offered, (I can not tell after what manner,) and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14727:23"/>
that which he offered on the Crosse, after the manner of Aaron.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he maketh Christ a Priest after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Aaron, which the holy Ghost in expresse words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth Heb. 7.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the first that figureth both the priesthood and sacrifice of the new law, is Melchisedech.</hi> So that this priesthood is peculiar only to our sauiour Christe, as both Dauid, Psal. no. and the Apostle to the Hebrues the 7. do proue it: there is no doubt but Melchisedech was a figure of Christ: But what sacrifice hee offered, the scripture maketh no mention, neither is M. Heskins able to shewe. For first, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed the historie of him, which is written in Gen. 14. And Melchisedech king of Salem brought foorth breade &amp; wine: and he was a priest of the most high God, Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he blessed him, saying: blessed is Abraham of God most high, possesser of heauen and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath deliuered thine enimies into thine hande. And Abraham gaue him tithe of all. In which words, there is no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any sacrifice. Afterward he compareth him in all those points, in which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Hebrues doth Heb. 7. Which are these: that he was king of rightuousnesse, and king of peace, without father, without mother, without kinred on earth. Hauing neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life, but is likened to the sonne of God, and continueth a Priest for euer: that he blessed Abraham, and that Abraham payde tythes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. In all which applications, there is not one worde of any sacrifice. Neither in the apostle, nor in M. Heskins: therefore as I sayde in the beginning, M. Heskins hath not satisfied the title of his Chapter. And verily, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in these two pointes, onely considereth the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of Melchisedech, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he blessed Abraham which had the promises, and receiued tythes of him, in whose loynes Leuie the father of Aarons Priesthoode was tythed: who vndoubtedly would not haue omitted the sacrifice of breade and wine, if there had bene any, when he applyed the interpretation of his name, which was a great deale
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14727:24"/>
lesser matter. And surely it seemeth, that Maister Heskins could not handsomely frame an application thereof, else would he not haue admitted so plausible a matter, and so commonly prated of among the Papistes. He sawe first in the text was no mention of oblation, secondly if there had bene oblation of bread and wine, it would not well haue figured that sacrifice, wherein they say, is neither bread nor wine.</p>

But that we should be conuerted into that flesh, not onely by loue, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in deede: it is brought to passe by that meate which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs. For when he would shewe his loue toward vs, he hath mixed himself with vs by his body, and made himself one with vs, that the body might be vnited to the hed</hi> These last words. <hi>For this is the maner of them that loue especially,</hi> in M.

                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ter loue: and that he might shewe his desire that he had to vs, suffering him selfe not onely to be seene of them that desire, but also to be touched and eaten, and their teeth to be fastened in his flesh, and all to be filled with the desire of him. Wherefore let vs rise from that table as Lyons brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fire, terrible to the diuell, and let vs knowe our heade, and what loue he hath shewed vnto vs. Parents haue oftentimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their children to be nourished of other: but I doe feede with mine owne flesh. I giue my selfe vnto them, I fauour all, I giue an exceeding good hope to all of things to come. He that giueth him self so vnto vs in this life, much more in the life to come. I would be your brother, and I tooke flesh and bloud with you for your sakes. and by what thinges I am ioyned to you, the same I haue giuen to you againe.</hi> In this long speach of Chrysostome, what is there that maketh for Maister Heskins bill, that hee hath promoted into the Parleament house? and not rather altogether against it? For first, it can not bee necessarily concluded out of this place, that Chrysostome speaketh of the Lordes supper, but rather of that table, meate, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and eating of Christes flesh, which is spoken of in the sixt of Saint Iohn, where no worde is of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or supper, which at that time was not instituted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if we should neuer so much vnderstand this speach of the sacrament, yet must we graunt it to be figuratiue, or else there wil folow infinite absurdities, beside such as M. Heskins affirmeth. Wherfore I will reason thus: Christ by this saying of Chrysostome, is none otherwise eaten then he is seene: but he is not seene corporally, but spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by faith, therefore he is not eaten corporally but spiritually by faith. And likewise thus: as Christ is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and teeth fastned in his flesh, so is he giuen or eaten, but he is not touched corporally or naturally, nor teeth fastned in his flesh corporally but spiritually, therefore hee is not giuen nor eaten in the sacrament corporally, but spiritually.</p>
                  <p>The maiors of these argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are Chrysostoms words, the minors are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confessions of the Papistes, which affirme
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14727:25"/>
Christes body to be in the sacrament inuisibly, and doe correct the recantation of Berengarius, where he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the body of Christ is torne with the teeth: the conclusions I trust be rightly inferred. But nowe let vs see what handsome stuffe M. Heskins gathereth out of this text of Chrysostome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First that we are ioyned to Christe two wayes, by loue, and by the thing it selfe. Which in other termes, is called spiritually and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> Marke this wise diuision of spiritually and really, as though such things as are ioyned spiritually, might not be ioyned really. But (M. Heskins) a spirite is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a thing, except you will say it is nothing, but to a body, and therefore spiritually and bodily are opposite, not spiritually and really. For we are ioyned to Christe spiritually, and yet really, so that Christ dwelleth in vs by his spirite through faith, but not bodily, so in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we eate the body of Christ really, that is in deede &amp; vnfeignedly, but yet in a spirituall kinde of eating, and not carnally or corporally.</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins proceeding, affirmeth that <hi>We are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually ioyned to Christ by charitie and faith, and therefore incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into his mysticall body, but really or substantially we are ioyned to him, when by eating his very substantiall flesh in the sacrament,</hi> THE SVBSTANCE OF OVR FLESH IS TVRNED INTO THE SVBSTAVNCE OF HIS FLESH, <hi>and thereby so ioyned to him, as we are made one flesh with him &amp;c.</hi> Note here, good reader, for thy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that these wordes printed by M. Heskins in another letter, that they might be seene as a speciall paradoxe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teach thee a newe kinde of transubstantiation. For he is not content, to haue the breade turned into the body of Christe, without all type or figure, really, substantially, corporally, &amp;c. but as really, corporally, and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, he affirmeth that the substance of our flesh, is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the substance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of Christ. O monstruous paradox, as euer any was heard, since the beginning of the world!</p>
                  <p>After this he noteth, that Christes flesh is not digested
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14727:25"/>
in vs, as other meates are, which is needlesse to note, if our fleshe be digested or turned into his: adding this reason, that <hi>As it is a celestiall meate, beeing now a glorified bodie, so it draweth vs vp to it, conuerting and turning vs into it, according to the nature of a celestiall thing.</hi> Howe vayne this reason is, by whiche hee would auoyde the digestion, and proue his new transubstantiation and conuersion, appeareth by this, that the body of Christe in the Sacrament, was as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, while hee liued in his passible bodie on earth, in which he instituted this sacrament, as it is nowe beeing a glorified bodie in heauen. And whereas hee chargeth, I knowe not what Stercoranites of our time, to affirme that the fleshe of Christ, passeth through the bodie as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meates, I thinke verilie, he lyeth most impudently. For I neuer heard, or read of any that so affirmed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, I woulde wishe men to speake reuerently of so high mysteries, yet the importunitie of the Papistes with their matter of transubstantiation enforceth them not to affirme of them selues, but to report, what they reade in the fathers, concerning the breade, beeing the terrestriall or outwarde parte of the Sacrament, that it is digested &amp; passeth through, as all other naturall meates do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Origen writeth <hi>in Math. Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Quod si quicquid ingreditur in os in ventrem abit, &amp; in sesession eijcitur: &amp; ille cibus qui sanctificatur per verbum Deipér<expan>

This douteth not Origen to speake of the materiall parte of the Sacrament, by which it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that he knew no transubstantiation. The cheefe thing that M. Heskins vrgeth vs to marke, is that, <hi>Whereas the Sacramentes woulde haue onely a spirituall receiuing, this holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teacheth that we are framed to Christ not onely spiritually by loue, which may bee without receiuing of meate, but, re ipsa, in deede by receyuing of meate.</hi> But I praye you M. Heskins,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14727:26"/>
where saith Chrisostom that our coniunction vnto Christ is not onely spirituall. In deede he saide, <hi>not onely by loue, but in deede,</hi> but he opposeth not spiritually and really as you doe. And where you vrge that this coniunction is by meate, and this meate is his bodie, and therevppon conclude that it is a corporall coniunction, and Christ is ioyned corporally: I aunswere, that if Chrysostom may expound himselfe, this meate and this body is a spirituall meate, therefore a spirituall coniunction, and Christ is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten spiritually. <hi>De prod. Iud. Nemo sit Iudas in mensa: hoc sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium cibus spiritualis est. Nam sicut corporalis cibus, &amp;c.</hi> Let no man be Iudas in this table: this sacrifice is a spirituall meate. For as corporall meat when it findeth a bellie, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with humors contrarie to it, it hurteth and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more, and helpeth nothing at all: euen so this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate, if it finde any man polluted with wickednes, it destroyeth him the more, not of it owne nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but through the fault of him that receiueth it. Thus far Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, for the meate to bee spirituall. Finally the last obseruation that Christ doth giue vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, is the same fleshe, by which he was ioyned vnto vs, therefore his verie substantiall body and bloude, auayleth him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For wee contende not, of the substance of the thing, that is giuen, but of the manner of the giuing, the thing is the verie body and bloude of Christ, but not after a corporall or naturall manner, but after a spirituall and diuine maner, or as the olde writers haue saide. <hi>Modo ineffabili,</hi> after an vnspeakeable manner, as so many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue speaches that are spoken therof do declare, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to expound literally or gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matically, were little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then extreme madnesse.</p>
                  <p>The other place which you adde out of Ho. 24. in 10.1. Cor. helpe them nothing at all, that Christ hath giuen vs his flesh &amp;c. That this body the wisemen did reuerence in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. You might haue added out of the same place: <hi>Quod est in calice, id est quod a latere fluxit,</hi> that which is in the cuppe is the same that flowed out of his side, and thereof we are partakers. But that all these are figuratiue spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14727:26"/>
it is manifest by this interrogation, that followeth in the same homilie. <q>
                        <hi>Quid enim appello inquit communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem? id ipsum corpus sumus. Quid significat panis? corpus Christi. Quid autem fiunt qui accipiunt corpus Christs: non multa sed vnum corpus.</hi> For what do I cal it (saith he) a participation? We are the selfe same bodie. What signifieth the bread? The bodie of Christ. And what are they made which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bodie of Christ? Not many bodies but one body. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same homilie. <hi>Sed quare, Addit quem frangimus? hoc in Eucharistia videre licet, in cruce autem minimè sed omnino con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra. Os enim eius non conteretur. Sed quod in cruce passus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est, id in oblatione patitur, &amp; propter te frangi permittit.</hi> But why? doth he adde (speaking of the breade) which wee breake, that you may see in the sacrament of thankesgiuing, but not on the crosse, but altogether the contrarie. For there shall no bone of him be broken.</q> But that which he suffered not on the crosse, he suffereth in the oblation, (for so they called the ministring of the communion, because it was a sacrifice of thanksgiuing) and for thee suffereth himself to be broken. In these places Chrysostome affirmeth the Church to be the same bodie, which the breade doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and which the faithfull doe receiue, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, he sheweth manifest difference, betweene the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body of Christ that suffered on the crosse, and the spirituall receiuing of him in the supper, in whiche his bones are broken, which (he saith) was not on the crosse, which must needes bee figuratiue. I passe ouer the large allegorie he continueth in the same homilie, affirming that we must be Eagles to flye vp into heauen, and feed of Chrstes bodie where it is, for where the bodie is, thether the Eagles will be gathered.</p>

For Christe is eaten not onely in the sacrament, but also by faith, which the vse of the sacrament is to confirme, as he himselfe teacheth Ioan. 6. It is true also, that this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is succeeded in the place of that. But that the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lambe, was a figure of our eating of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, no scripture teacheth. For first your compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will not serue M. Heskins, <hi>The lambe was verily eaten, therefore Christ is verily eaten, the lambe was substantially and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eaten, therefore Christ was really and substantially eaten.</hi> For I may reason as well, the lambe was a naturall lambe; therefore Christ was a naturall lambe: or as you doe of the age of the lamb: the lamb was but one yere old, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christe was but one yeare olde: or rather and more properly thus, if you will algates haue it a figure of the sacrament, the lambe was called the passouer, and yet it did but signifie the passouer, so the breade is called the body of Christe, and yet it doth but signifie the body of Christe: or thus, the eating of the lambe was a figure of the eating of Christ, so the eating of the bread is a figure of the eating of Christ. As for the desire that Christe had to eate the passouer, proueth not, that he called his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per so, but the olde passouer, which he so desired to eate, bicause it was the last &amp; should be fulfilled, and then was in fulfilling, in the suffering an oblation of his body. The other text alleadged out of S. Paule, 1. Cor. 5.

which is nowe eaten, be but a peece of bread, a bare signe, a figure, (as the sacramentaries affirme:) then the pascall Lambe is a figure of a peece of bread, which is not better then it.</hi> Of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no small accompt is made, for it is continued in sixe long tedious chapters following. But howe soone will all this smoke be blowen away? yea, euen with one breath. For admitte that the Pascall lambe was a signe of the Lordes Supper, which is not yet prooued by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: yet shall the thing figured be better then the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. For the supper of the Lorde consisteth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Christe, and not of a peece of breade, (a bare signe or figure,) although bread and wine are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which do liuely represent that, which Christe in his supper doeth feede vs withall. And he doeth more then beastly belye them, whome he calleth Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, to affirme that it is but a peece of breade, a bare signe or figure. They affirme that it is bread, but they affirme not, that it is nothing but a peece of bread: they saye it is a signe and a figure, but they saye not, it is a bare signe, and nothing but a figure: except baptisme be a bare signe, and nothing but a figure, because it is a signe and a figure. Therefore, when you come to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion (M. Heskins) you may well conclude, that the Sacrament is not a bare figure: but you falsly cogge in, that by Christes institution, it is consecrated to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for Christ was offered vp but once, and that by him selfe only. Likewise, (verie vnlike a diuine,) you say, the Pascall Lambe was but a bare figure, which is vntrue: for it should not haue beene called the Passouer, except it had truely assured the worthie receiuers of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deliuerance. But where you make it such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie, that one figure shoulde be figure of another: there is no such inconuenience as you immagine, but that one thing may be the signe of another thing, which shall be a figure of the third thing. As in this very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if you will call your wittes together, I am sure you will confesse, that the Pascall Lambe was a figure, of the deliuerance of the Israelites, from the destruction of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14727:28"/>
Aegypt, and the same deliuerance of their bodies was a figure of the spirituall deliuerance of our soules. Because Dionysius (whom you cal the Areopagite) sayth nothing to the matter in controuersie, I will passe him ouer vntil some other time.</p>

For the true vnderstanding of this place, we must note two things: firste, that Marcion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whome he writeth, affirmed that the God of the lawe, was not the God of the Gospel: secondly, that Christ had not a true bodie, but a fantasticall bodie. Against both these errours, he reasoneth in this sentence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first, when he saith, he desired to eate the Pascal lambe of the olde lawe, which was his owne, namely of his owne institution, (for it was absurd that Christ being God, shoulde desire that which was another Gods insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) as the heretike sayde, the lawe and all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof were. And this is directly contrarie to M. Heskins purpose, who ioyning with the heretike, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>that he did desire to eat the Pascall of the lawe, and that it

was not properly his owne,</hi> and for this intent, to make it serue his turne, he translateth falsly <hi>vt suum, as his owne Passouer, &amp; alienum, any strange thing.</hi> Against the seconde, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian reasoneth in the same sentence, which words, because M. Heskins could not abyde, he hath cleane cut off. <q>The wordes are these, <hi>Acceptum panem, &amp; distributum discipulis corpus suum illum fecit, hoc est corpus meum dicendo, id est figura corporis mei.

And it could haue bene no figure, except his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had bene of trueth. But a vaine thing which is a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, cannot receiue a figure. Or else, if therefore he made breade his bodie, because he lacked the trueth of a bodie, therefore he should haue giuen bread for vs. It made wel for the vanitie of Marcion, that bread should haue beene crucified. There can nothing bee more euident, then that Tertullian by this place, ouerthroweth both the transubstantiation and also the carnall presence, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Papistes.</q> This M. Heskins because he coulde not brooke, he brake off the sentence, and commeth out of the matter also, to raile against Cranmer of holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie; first, doubting whether the booke set forth in his name were made by him, as though Cranmer was not wel enough knowen to be as well able to write a booke as Heskins: <hi>then that he affirmeth, the Papistes vnable to shewe one article of faith, so directly contrarie to our senses, that all our senses shall by daily experience affirme a thing to be, and yet our faith shall teach vs the contrarie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maister Heskins like a wilie Pye, obiecteth the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the resurrection, where our senses teacheth vs, that mens bodyes be dead, and faith teacheth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shall rise againe. But the subtile sophister doth not see, I weene a difference betweene it &amp; is in M. Cranmers assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; is

and shalbe in his balde obiection. Faith teacheth, that shalbe, which our sense teacheth nowe not to be. But faith teacheth not that to be white, which our sense tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to be blacke. But he hath another wise instance. <hi>The senses taught, that the wounde which Christe had in his side, after his resurrection was verie sore, but faith taught the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, because his bodie was glorified.</hi> Seeing the wounde was made after his death, reason would iudge, that it was insensible, especially when he was risen againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, by his diuine power. And Thomas was not so rude, that he would haue thrust in his hand, if he thought it shold haue hurt him, and when he did thrust in his hande, he perceiued by his senses, that it did not hurt. But it is pittie to spende any time about so vaine a matter: sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being not the thing, but a certeine affection of the thing, which cannot alwayes be knowen by another mans senses, but by his onely that feeleth it, as in him that hath the Palsey, if his legge were cut off, he feeleth nothing, yet some such wise man as M. Heskins, would thinke it were verie sore. But he woulde-faine excuse the matter, why he cutteth off Tertulian by the waste, promising in another place to do it, and willeth you in the meane time to consider, that Christes bodie is giuen in the sacrament, and further alledgeth out of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian in another place, which is in his booke <hi>De resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione carnis: That the fleshe doth eate the bodie and bloud of Christ, that the soule may be fedd of God.</hi> Where hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth none otherwise, then in the former place, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the sacrament a figure of Christes bodie, and so an ende with Tertullian. Then commeth Isychius disciple of Gregorie Nazianzene, who firste dissuading men from vsing of the Iewes ceremonies, affirmeth that which M. Heskins denyed, that Christe did eat the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Passouer in his last supper. His wordes that are materiall are these: <q>
                        <hi>Christus primùm celebrauit figuratum Pasca. Post canam auem intelligibidem tradit.</hi> Christ did first celebrate the figuratiue Passeouer, but after supper he deliuered the intelligible supper.</q>

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:14727:29"/>Then followe diuers places, to shew that by intelligible, he meaneth figured. But being graunted that the supper was figured, by the pascall Lambe, which is the egge that he is so long in brooding, yet he is neuer the neerer, for the carnall presence and corporall manner of eating, no not with that whiche Isychius saith: <hi>That he tooke the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible bloud first in the mysticall supper,</hi>

                     <hi>and afterward gaue the cuppe to his Apostles, and that he dranke himselfe, and giuing to his Apostles to drinke, then he powred the intelligible bloud vpon the altar, that is to say, his body. Now the body of Christ is the Church and all his people.</hi> He that seeth not, that this Father doeth vse figuratiuely these wordes: bloud, body, altar, powre, drinke, &amp;c. is worthy to weare a cockes combe, &amp; a bell. Yet Maister Heskins noteth in the margent, <hi>Christ dranke his owne bloud, and gaue it to his Apostles.</hi> Which if it be true in the litterall sense, as he meaneth, then it is as true, that he powred his owne bloud vpon his owne body in the literall sense. For the same bloud, which he dranke, and gaue, he powred on his body. But he powred not his natural bloud vpon his body, therefore he neither gaue nor dranke his naturall bloud in the litterall sense. But you will say, his body signifieth his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for whom he powred forth his naturall bloud. Well, beside that you are inforced to acknowledge a figuratiue speeche, you are neuer the neere. For although he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out his bloud for them, yet he powred it not vpon them. And your Authour saith, he dranke none other bloud, but that he powred vpon them. Here is also alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Chrysostomes name, for Christes drinking of his bloud, but his wordes are referred to another place. Then followeth a conclusion: <hi>If Christ drank his owne bloud, he drank it spiritually, or corporally: spiritually he could not: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dranke it corporally.</hi> This is very round dealing M. Heskins. But if he could drinke his bloud, I pray you why could he not drinke it spiritually, as well, &amp; rather, then corporally? For if he dranke his owne bloud, he also did eate his owne body, which if it sound not grossely in your eares, it is, because you haue a grosse vnderstanding.</p>

Neither are the people now bidden to feastes, painefully wrought with expenses and cunning: but the foode of immortalitie is giuen, differing from common meates, reteyning the kind of appearance of corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but prouing by inuisible efficiencie, the presence of Gods power or the diuine vertue to be there.</hi> In this saying, First there is neuer a worde, to proue that the Pascall Lambe was a figure of the Lordes supper, which is the purpose of the Chapter, but onely that the newe institution succeeded
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14727:30"/>
the olde, which is manifest by the history of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Euen as Baptisme succeded circumcision, and yet was not circumcision a figure of Baptisme, Secondly note, that he doeth not affirme, the reall presence of Christes naturall bodie, but the inuisible working of his diuine power. And so his voyce is flatly againg Mais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heskins bill. Nowe let vs consider his fonde col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. <hi>First that Christ gaue inconsumptible meate, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries giue consumptible meate? For they giue but bread.</hi> This is a false slaunder, a thousand times repeated, for they giue not bread only, but euen the same inconsumptible meate, by the inuisible working of his diuine power, which Cyprian affirmeth, that Christe gaue his Disciples. But he vrgeth, <hi>That it was put before them, taken by hande, &amp; laid in sight, which the merite and grace of his passion could not be.</hi> See I pray you how this man agreeth with Cyprian: Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian saith, it was by inuisible working of Gods fauour, he saith it was put before them, (for so he translateth <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit</hi>) taken by hand, and laide in sight.</p>
                  <p>His second collection is, <hi>That it differeth from common meates, reteining the fourme of corporall substaunce, whiche can neither be the breade, which differeth not from common meates, nor the spirituall meate, which they call the merite of his passion, because that reteineth not the fourme of corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A wise reason, disioyning and seuering thinges that should bee taken together. The water in baptisme, differeth from common water, and conteyning the fourme of corporall substance, by inuisible working, proueth the presence of Gods power to be there. So do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bread and wine in the Lordes Supper. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of them selues, they be no more holy then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, yet when they are consecrated for the vse of the sacrament, they differ as muche from common meates, as the bodie and the soule doe, as temporall life, and eternall life: as heauen and earth doe differ, so doeth the water consecrated for baptisme differ from common water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:14727:31"/>His third collection, that it is called <hi>The foode of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, which cannot be bare materiall bread.</hi> A true collection, for the sacrament is not bare material bread, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ, represented by materiall bread, as a materiall lauer is the water of regeneration, but not bare materiall water.</p>
                  <p>For confirmation is brought in <hi>Ignatius ex Ep. ad Ephe. Be ye taught of the comforter obedience to the Bishop, and the priest with vnswaruing or stable minde, breaking the bread which is the medicine of immortalitie, the preseruatiue of not dying, but of liuing by Iesus Christ.</hi> Although no learned man, that is not more wilfull then wise, will graunt this Epistle to be written by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auncient father Ignatius, whose name it beareth: yet doth this saying, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tein nothing but very sound doctrine of the sacrament, which he calleth bread, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But he proceedeth to another speech of Cyprian, which is in deede a more apparant speeche for his purpose, the wordes are these: <hi>Panis iste, quem Dominus Discipulis porri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebat, non eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> diuinitas: ita sacramento visibili ineffabiliter se diuina infudie essentia. This bread which our Lorde did reache vnto his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, beeing chaunged not in shape, but in nature, by omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of the worde is made fleshe. And as in the person of CHRISTE, the humanitie was seene, the diuinitie was hidden, euen so the diuine essence hath powred it selfe vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably into the visible sacrament.</hi> The Papistes esteeme this place to be an inuincible bulwarke of their transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, but alas it is soone ouerthrowne, when the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Cyprian is boulted out, not onely by sentences going before and after this saying, but also by the very
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14727:31"/>
wordes of this same sentence. For he maketh a manifest difference, betweene the visible sacrament and the diuine essence, which is inuisible. Whereas the Papistes by their transubstantiation, haue no visible sacrament, but onely accidents of breade and wine, which they, nor none other can call a visible sacrament. Moreouer, the word <hi>diuine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> answering to the word <hi>flesh,</hi> in the former sentence, plainely expoundeth what he meaneth thereby, namely the diuine power which the flesh of Christ hath, to giue life, and not the diuine nature or substance, as M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins translateth it, and much lesse Christ, God and Man, as he expoundeth it. For if we take the diuine essence, for the diuine substaunce of Christes Godhead, it will bee a grosse absurditie, and a blasphemous heresie, to make any infusion or powring of that into the visible sacrament, which filleth all places. Wherefore of necessitie it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the propertie or efficacie, euen as the worde <hi>nature,</hi> in the former clause doth signifie. For the former shape of the breade is not chaunged, but the nature or propertie is altered, namely to feede the soule and not the body only, as before it was made a sacrament, it serued to do. But M. Hesk. liketh not this glose, but wil haue nature to signifie substance, and not propertie, as it doth very often: as when we say, the nature of hearbs, of stones, of beastes, we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the properties. But whether he will or no, it must be so taken, seing it may be so taken, or else Cyprian should be contrarie to him selfe: who distinguisheth the visible sacrament from the diuine essence, who calleth that <hi>diuine essence</hi> (a word more vsuall for substance) which is but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine efficacie or propertie, who, if he had meant, that the bread had bene turned into the naturall body of Christe, wold neither haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared it with the diuinitie of Christ hid vnder his humanitie, nor haue said, euen so the diuine essens, infundeth it selfe in the sacrament, but euen so the bodie of Christ is hid vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine. But that there should be no doubt of his meaning, thus he writeth in the same sermon, a litle after: <hi>Haec quoties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus, non dentes ad mordendum acuimus, sed fide syncera panem

sanctum franginus &amp; partimur.</hi> As often as we do these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we doe not sharpen our teeth to byte, but with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere faith we breake and diuide this holy breade. What can be more plaine to expresse the meaning of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, then that wee receiue not the body of Christe with our mouth, but with our heart, not with the instrument of our teeth, but with the instrument of our faith. <q>In the same Sermon, hee writeth <hi>Panis est esca, sanguis, vita, caro, substantia, corpus, Ecclesia: Corpus, propter membrorum in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num conuenientium: panis, propter nutrimenti congruentiam: san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis, propter vinificationis efficientiam: caro, propter assumptae humanitatis proprietatem.</hi> The breade is foode, bloud, life, flesh, substaunce, his body, the Church: his body, for the agreement of the members in one: bread, for the aptnes of nourishment: bloud, for the efficiencie of quickening: flesh, for the propertie of his humanitie that he tooke on him.</q> These places do sufficiently expound the meaning of Cyprian, howe the breade is chaunged into flesh, not after any change of substance, but of qualitie and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as in so many figuratiue termes is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manifest.</p>
                  <p>Let vs nowe come to Euthymius aduaunced by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Heskins into the higher house. And he in deede see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to affirme the purpose of this Chapter, that the Paschall lambe was a figure of the sacrament, and yet not very plainely, but rather it was a figure of the true Passeouer, which the sacrament doth represent, but that is no materiall point of our controuersie, whether one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament did figure an other, his wordes are: <hi>Christe in the same table described the figuratiue and shadowing Passeouer, and set before them the true and perfect Passeouer.</hi> Herevpon hee inferreth that <hi>Christe was not truely and perfectly giuen to the Iewes in the Paschall Lambe as we teach, but onely a figure and signe of him, but in the sacrament he is giuen to vs truely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that is by a true and reall presence.</hi> But it is pitie that hee seeth not that his authour compareth the thing signified by our sacrament, with the outward signe of the Iewish sacrament, as also the scripture doth oftentimes, against them that depended vpon the outward ceremonies. Not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14727:32"/>
that a false or vnperfect Christ was figured and receiued of the faithfull by them, but to shewe a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the shadowe and the trueth, the figure and the thing figured, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes so sticked in the figure, that they considered not the thing signified.</p>
                  <p>The other place which was alledged out of Euthymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, bicause hee referreth the handling of it vnto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke, thether also will I referre the aunswere. In the meane time, it is a childish insultation that hee makes against the proclamer, noting that hee hath found <hi>a plaine place for Maister Iewell,</hi> when neither the place is so plaine, nor the Authour within the compasse of his challenge.</p>

                  <p>The eighteenth Chapter treateth of the same matters by S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronyme and Chrysostome.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter Hieronyme is first brought foorth, <hi>In Matth.</hi> 26. in these wordes. <hi>After the figuratiue Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was fulfilled, and he had eaten the flesh of the Lambe with his Apostles, hee taketh breade which comforteth the heart of man, and passeth to the true sacrament of the Passeouer, that as in prefiguration of him, Melchisedech the Priest of the highest GOD had done, offering breade and wine, hee also might represent the trueth of his body and bloud.</hi> Here Hieronyme doeth not affirme the Passeouer to bee a figure of the sacrament, but of Christe the true Passeouer. Calling the supper a true sacrament of that true and prefigured Passeouer. Which wordes would bee noted, that hee calleth the breade a true sacrament, that is a liuely signe of the verie Passeouer Christ, and a representation of the trueth of his body and bloud. But here Maister Heskins, fareth as hee were halfe madde, sending vs to the Vocabula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Calepines, and Dictionaries, for the signification of this worde <hi>repre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ento, That among learned men it is not so streighted, as onely to signifie, to shewe a thing by a figure or signe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therevpon we will not striue, but that it is often
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14727:33"/>
taken to shewe by a figure or signe, hee him selfe can not denie, and that it must be so taken here in this place, appeareth by this reason. The comparison will not else stand betweene Melchisedech and Christe (which all though it bee not grounded on scripture, Hierome often maketh) except Christe offered breade and wine in a figure or representation, as Melchisedech did in a prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration.</p>
                  <p>M. Heskins enforceth the word <hi>Truth, that he should not meane a figure, for then he would haue saide (as he imagineth) that he also must represent his body and bloud, and not that he also might represent the truth of his body.</hi> But if you marke the force of this word, <hi>quoque,</hi> also, you shall see, that Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech did prefigurate the truth of his body likewise. For it importeth an equalitie of both their doings, Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech by breade and wine did represent or prefigurate the truth of his body, and Christ also by breade and wine did represent the truth of his body. For Christ could not doe also, that which an other had not done. Therefore very foolish are M. Heskins oppositions, of typicall passeouer, and true passeouer, and figure and truth, where the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>a consentaneis,</hi> and not <hi>a dissentaneis.</hi> The other fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous interpretation, that he maketh of the bread com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting mans heart, being both out of the minde of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronyme, and out of his purpose, I omit. At length hee commeth to an other place of <hi>Hieronyme ad Heliodorum Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>Absit vt de ijs quicquam sinistrum loquar, qui Apostolico gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dui succedentes: Christi corpus sacro ore conficiunt. God forbid that I shuld speake any euil of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which succeeding the apostolike degree, doe make the body of Christ with their holy mouth.</hi> M. Heskins translateth it, <hi>which do consecrate,</hi> bicause in the word, <hi>make,</hi> which Hieronyme vseth, hee should be enforced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a figuratiue speach. But let him turne ouer all his vocabularies, Calepines, and dictionaries, vnto which he sent vs ere while, and he shall not finde this Verbe <hi>conficio,</hi> signifying to consecrate, but to make, to dispatch, or to kill. Likewise he leaueth out these wordes which folowe immediatly, <hi>Per quos &amp; nos Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14727:33"/>
sumus,</hi> by whome wee also are Christians. It is euident that Hieronyme speaketh hyperbolically of the dignitie of priestes, for as to speake properly, we are not made Christians by them, no more is the bodie of Christ made by them. But where he speaketh properly, he vseth proper tearmes, as <hi>Contra Iouin. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>In typo sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis sui non obtulit aquam, sed vinum.</hi> In the figure of his bloud he offered not water, but wine. Here he calleth the sacrament, the type of his bloude, and saith it is wine. <q>And in the same booke, he saith of Christ, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be written of him, that he hungred and thristed and went often to diner, yet <hi>excepto mysterio, quod in typum suae passionis expressit, &amp; probandi corporis veritate, nec gulae scribitur seruisse, nec ventri.</hi> Excepting the mysterie whiche he expressed in figure of his passion, and in prouing the trueth of his bodie, it is not written that he did serue his throte or bellie. Meaning that it is not saide expressedly what he did eate and drinke, but onely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and after his resurrection to proue the trueth of his body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other collection that hee maketh, that because priestes doe consecrate with their mouthe, therefore the faith of the receiuer, maketh not the presence of Christ in the sacrament, beside that it is not Hieronymes word, yet it proueth nothing, because, as there be causes that worke altogether alone, so there be causes which be helping, and concurre with other, of which sorte is the faith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, necessarilie to conceyue with the ministerie of the Minister, that Christ may bee present. That Christian Priestes should not be contemned if they be good, it is easily graunted, if they be naught, the ministerie is to bee honoured, but not the person.</p>
                  <p>Out of Chrysostom are alledged two long testimonies, the one out of his homilies <hi>de prodit. Iudae. But by that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an other greater benefit was shewed, that that lamb was a signe of the lambe to come, and that bloude shewed the comming of the Lordes bloude, and that sheepe was an example of the spirituall sheepe. That lambe was a shadowe, this lambe the trueth. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14727:34"/>
the sunne of righteousnesse shined, the shadowe was put away by the light. And therefore on the same table both the passeouers were celebrated, both that of the figure and that of the trueth. For as painters are wont to shadowe the table that is to be painted, with certayne lineamentes, and so with varietie of colours to make it perfecte. Euen so Christ did in the table. Hee did both describe the figure of the Passeouer, and shewed the passeouer of trueth: Where wilt thou that wee prepare for thee to eate the passouer? That was the Iewish passouer, but let the passouer giue place to the light, and the image be ouercome of the trueth.</hi> If this place be well considered, it maketh altogether against the Bill of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. For the similitude of the Painters Table, hauing in it shadowes and colors, applyed vnto the pascal lambe and the sacrament, declareth that they both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make a perfect image, to shew and represent the true lambe Christ which was offered for vs, the olde pascall, being the shadowing, &amp; the new sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which he calleth also a passouer, being the varietie of colors, by which the passouer of trueth is discribed and plainely shewed. Therfore M. Heskins collections are vaine, and from the authors meaning. For his purpose is not, to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pascall lamb a figure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but of christ, and both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lamb &amp; the sacrament, figures of Christ: but yet the lambe a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing figure, like the first draught of a painter, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a cleare demonstration like an image in colors.

As childish it is, that <hi>he will oppresse the proclamer to tell him why Hierome and Chrisostom call not the Iewish pascal, light, trueth, &amp; veritie, as they doe our pascall, seeing by it they receiued Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> as well as wee in our sacramente.</hi> A sore matter. The Iewishe pascall represented (if I may vse that tearme vnder cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of M. Heskins dictionarie) the true pascal Christ, as our sacrament doeth, who is the light, trueth, and veritie: the sacramente they call not the pascall lambe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14727:34"/>
light, nor trueth, but by a figure, as they call it manye other thinges. But when they speake properlie they vse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tearmes, so doth Chrysostome. <hi>Homi. Ex. Psal.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 116. <q>

What Papistes holding transubstantiation, would thus write, that breade and wine is shewed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the similitude of the bodie and bloud of Christ?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The seconde testimonie that M. Heskins alleageth out of Chrisostome, is vpon the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>This table is the strength of our soule, the sinewes of our minde, the bonde of our trust, our foundation, hope, healpe, light, our life, if we depart hence defended with this sacrifice, with most greate confidence, wee shall ascende into the holy entrie, as couered with certaine golden gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. But what speake I of thinges to come? For while wee be in this life; this mysterie maketh earth to be heauen vnto vs. Ascende vnto the gates of heauen &amp; marke diligently, or rather not of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but of heauen of heauens, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou shalt behold that we say. For that which is worthy of highest honor, I will shew thee in earth. For as in kings houses, not the walles, not the golden roofe, but the kinges body sitting in the throne is most excellent: so also in heauen the kinges body, which nowe is set foorth to be seene of thee in earthe.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14727:35"/>
I shewe thee neither Angels, nor Archangels, nor the heauens, nor the heauens of heauens, but the Lorde himselfe of all these thinges. Thou perceiuest how that which is greatest and cheifest of all things thou doest not onely see it on earth, but also touche it: and not onely touch it, but eate also: and when thou haste receiued it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnest home, wherefore wipe thy soule from all filthinesse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy minde to the receyuing of these mysteries. For if the Kinges childe being decked with purple and diademe, were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thee to bee carried, wouldest thou not cast all downe to the grounde and receiue him? But nowe when thou receiuest not the childe of a kinge beeing a man, but the onely begotten sonne of God, tell mee I praye thee, doest thou not tremble and caste awaye the loue of all seculer thinges?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This testimonie so necessarily muste bee vnderstood, of a figuratiue and spirituall receyuing of Christe by faith, that nothing in the worlde can bee more plaine. For euen as earth is made heauen vnto vs, so is Christe made present. And euen as wee see, the Lorde vppon earth, so we handle and eate him, and that is onely with the eye, hand and mouth of faith.</p>
                  <p>But let vs see M. Heskins collections. First hee is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to confesse that the sentence beginneth with a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>The table for the meate therevppon:</hi> Secondely, <hi>hauing such honourable tearmes, it can not bee a peece of breade, but Christe himselfe.</hi> This shall bee graunted also. Thirdly, <hi>that Christe is verily on the table,</hi> which he calleth <hi>Altars.</hi> As veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as earth is made heauen. Fourthly, <hi>that it is Christ whiche is worthie of highest honour verily present in the Sacramente.</hi> As verily present as hee is seene: but hee is seene onely by faith, therefore present onely to faith. But this obiection hee taketh vppon him to aunswere: <hi>If we saye the bodie of Christ can not be sene in the sacrament. No more saith he, can the substance of man be seene, but his garmentes or outward formes &amp; accidentes.</hi> This is such a boyish sophisme as I am ashamed to aunswere it. By which I maye as well proue, that Christes body was neuer seene, and therefore not seene in the sacrament, contrarie to that whiche Chrysostome saith. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this obiection he falleth into an other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if christ
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14727:35"/>
in the Sacrament be worthie all honour, then of sacrifice also, and the sacrifice being Christ, Christ shalbe offered to him selfe. This he calleth an ignorant obiection. But there is more knowledge in it, then he hath witt to answere. He alledgeth the words of Augustine. lib. 4. de Trin. cap. 14. <hi>Christ abideth one with him, to whome he offereth: and maketh him selfe one with them, for whom he offereth himself: and is one with them, that offer: &amp; one, with that which is offered.</hi> Here are diuerse kindes of vnitie, and yet not Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto him selfe, vnlesse M. Heskins will be a Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and a Patripassian, to confound the persons of the Godhead, and say, that God the father, yea, the whole Trinitie is likewise transubstantiated in the Sacrament. Though Christe be one with his father, yet did he not offer him selfe to him selfe, but himselfe to his father. As for the other saying of Augustine that he bringeth, it is altogether against him <hi>De ciuitate Dei. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>He is the Priest him selfe, he is the offerer, he is the oblation, whereof he would haue the daily sacrifice of the Church to be a sacrament; seeing that of her bodie he is the head, and of his head, shee is the bodie, as well shee by him, as he by her being accustomed to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</hi> First Christ is the offerer and the oblation, but not he to whome it is made. Secondly, that which he calleth the sacrifice of the Church, is a sacrament, that is a holie memoriall of that propitiatorie sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>fice, which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thirdly, this sacrifice of the Church, is of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che her selfe offered by Christ, and of Christe offered by the Church, which must needes be spirituall, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of Christ and his Church is spirituall, therefore it is not the natural bodie of Christ offered by the priest, but his mystical bodie offered by the Church &amp; by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so a sacrifice of thanksgiuing and not of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation.</p>
                  <p>After these obiections, he returneth to his collections out of the authoritie of Chrysostome. <hi>There neede no such preparation nor trembling, if the Sacrament were but a peece of bread.</hi> He hath neuer done with this slaunder, as though any Christian man did saye, it was but a peece of bread,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14727:36"/>
which Christe vouchsafed to call his bodie. Wee saye truely, it is bread: but wee say not, it is but a peece of bread.</p>

Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins would buylde, that Christ spiritually receiued, is not our Pascall lambe, but that we receiue another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christe, then the faithfull did in the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> The seconde place he citeth out of Augustine, I marueile he could not see it to be as plaine against him as the first. <hi>cont.

Wherefore nowe the Christians do celebrate the memorie of the same sacrifice being accomplished by the holie oblation and by the participation of the bodie and bloud of Christ.</hi> In this sentence is manifestly declared, the same difference we spake of before of the Iewishe sacraments, and of our sacraments, the one being a Prophesie of Christes sacrifice to come, the other, a remembrance of the same beeing past, and fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And whereas M. Heskins vrgeth the worde oblation, to exclude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirituall eating, he doth verie ridiculously, as though there might not be as wel a spiritual oblation, as a spirituall participation, especially when the author

shewing what we do in oblation and participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sayeth, we so celebrate the memorie of Christes sacrifice alredie fulfilled. <q>Therefore, this oblation is another from that: namely, a spirituall oblation and thanksgiuing, for that whose memorie it celebrateth, as Augustine most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth in the same booke, Cap. 21. <hi>Sed quid agam &amp; tantae caecitati istorum Hęreticorum, quando demonstrabo quam vim habeat quod in Psalmis canitur: Sacrificium laudis glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit me &amp; illie via est vbi ostendam salutare meum?

The sacrifice of praise shall glorifie mee, and there is the way where I will shewe my saluation. The fleshe and bloud of this sacrifice before the comming of Christ, was promised by sacrifices of similitudes: in the passion of Christ, by the verie trueth it selfe, it was giuen vp: after the ascension of Christ, it is celebrated by the sacrament of remembrance. Iudge by this place, whether Christes bodie be really offered, or whether it be <hi>a mathematicall sacrifice,</hi> as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth M.

                  <p>Now followeth a long speache of Cyrill, directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst M. Heskins the alledger of it: lib. 4. in Ioan. 6. ca. 14. <hi>Nec putet &amp;c. Neither let the Iewe of the dullnesse of his whiche thinke, that we haue inuented mysteries neuer heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For he shall see, if he will seeke more diligently, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie selfe same thing hath beene done since the times of Moses. For what deliuered their Elders from death, and the destruction of Aegypt, when death raigned vpon the first borne of Aegypt. Is it not euident to all men, that because they being taught by Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, did eat the flesh of the Lambe, and oynted the postes and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14727:37"/>
vpper doore postes, with the bloud of the Lambe, therfore death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them: for destruction, that is death of this fleshe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against mankinde for the transgression of the first man. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sinne, we haue heard: Earth thou art, and into earth thou shalt returne: but for asmuch as Christ by his flesh would ouerthrow that cruell tyrant, therefore that was shadowed by a mystery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the auncient fathers, and they beeing sanctified by the sheepes fleshe and bloud (God so willing) escaped destruction. Therefore ô Iewe, why art thou so troubled, seeing the trueth prefigured long before: Wherefore I say art thou troubled, if Christe saith: except ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you, whereas it behoued thee, beeing instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the lawes of Moses, and well taught by the olde shadowes to beleeue, to be most ready to vnderstand these mysteries? The sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and the figure thou knowest, therefore learne the very trueth of the thing. My fleshe, saith he, is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede.</hi> In these wordes beside that there is nothing to proue the Pascall Lambe, to be a figure of the Lordes Supper: it is directly said, that the selfe same mysterie of eating the fleshe of Christ, hath ben obserued since the time of Moses: and that there is no cause, why the Iewe should be offended at the saying of Christe, if he would vnderstand the trueth, whereof the Pascall lambe was the figure and shadowe. Which trueth was no mysterie newly inuented, but practised euer since Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for not by the fleshe and bloud of the Lambe, but by the flesh and bloud of Christ, the people were deliuered from death. The Lambe was then a sacrament: Christe was then, and euer shall be the trueth: but what neede we more striue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M.

                     </note> that Gregorie was the last of the higher house: &amp; Damascen the first and chiefest of the lower house, he may make him Vantparlar if he will. But neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue any thing materiall for his purpose, that he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them, nor for the generall purpose of his bill. For Gregories wordes are altogether alegoricall, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be taken in the Grammaticall sense, Hom. 22. Pasch: <hi>All which thinges do bring forth to vs great edifying if they be discussed by mystical, or alegoricall interpretation. For what the bloud of the lambe is you haue learned, not now by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but by drinking, which bloud is put vpon both the postes, when it is dronke, not only with the mouth of the body, but also with the mouth of the heart. For he that doeth so receiue the bloud of his redeemer, that he will not as yet followe his passion, hath put the bloud on a post.</hi> Heare what a great thing is there? But that he calleth the sacrament of the bloud, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of the redeemer, speaking alegorically, as he calleth it the bloud of the Lamb, meaning the olde Paschal, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doth signifie the bloud of Christ. Therfore if Mais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heskins will vrge the bloud of the redeemer dronke not only with the mouth of the body, but with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the heart: he may likewise vrge the bloud of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lamb: if this be a figuratiue speech, so is that. But Gregorie proceedeth. <hi>In the night</hi> (saith he) <hi>we eate the lambe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we do now receiue the Lordes body in a sacrament, when as yet we do not see one anothers conscience.</hi> Note here y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doth not say simply, we eate the Lords body, but we eate the Lordes body in a sacrament or mysterie: compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the night of the Iewish eating, with the mysterie of the Lordes body. And in neither of both his sayinges af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the lambe to be a figure of the supper, which is the purpose of the Chapter. As for Damascen, his chiefe words are these, (For it were too long to rehearse all, he being but a knight of the lower house.) <hi>If God the word by willing was made man, &amp;c. can he not make bread his owne body, and wine with water his bloud?

holpen, &amp; strengthened by Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, the rayne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it bringeth forth fruits. God said, this is my body, &amp; this is my bloud, and do ye this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of me: by his almightie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement it is brought to passe vntill he come.</hi> In this testimonie, which M.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, although the time, in which Damascen liued, was very corrupt, yet there is nothing in these wordes, whiche may not wel be referred to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spiritual presence of Christs body, vnto the faith of the worthie receiuer. M.

                     <hi>Ho. de pro. Iud.</hi> be these: <hi>And now the same Christ is present, which did furnish that table, he also consecrateth this. For it is not man that maketh the thinges set foorth to be the body and bloud of Christ, by consecration of the Lordes table, but he that was crucified for vs, euen Christ Wordes are spoken by the mouth of the priest, but they are consecrated by the power and grace of God. This is saith he, my body. By this worde the thinges set foorth are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. And as that voyce that said, grow ye, &amp; multiply ye, was but once spoken, but yet it feeleth alway effect, nature working with it vnto generation: so that voyce was but once spoken, but through all the tables of the Church, vnto this day, and vntill the comming, it giueth strength to the sacrifice.</hi> In these wordes (because M.

                  <p>But this thing in this Chapter must not be omitted, that he saith, that <hi>The sacramentaries cannot bring one father, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the sacrament to be onely a figure. And ioyneth issue with the proclaymer, that if he can bring any scripture, any catholique coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, or any one approued doctor, that by expresse and plaine words, doth denie the reall presence of Christ in the sacrament, then he will giue ouer and subscribe to him.</hi> Still he chargeth them, whom he calleth the sacramentaries, to make the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only a figure or a bare signe, which is false. <q>But for euidence to informe the men, that shall go vpon this is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, I will alledge, first S.

Si ergo haec vasa sanctificata ad priuatos vsus transferre sic peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culosum est, in quibus non est verum Corpus Christi, sed mysterium corporis Christi continetur: quanto magis vasa corporis nostri quae sibi deus ad habitaculum preparauit, non debemus locum dare diabolo agendi in eis quod vult</hi>? For if it be an offence to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate the sanctified vessels into priuate vses, and a daunger, as Balthasar doth teach vs, who drinking in the hallowed cups, was put out both of his kingdome and his life: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be so daungerous to transferre vnto priuate v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, those sanctified vessels in which not the very body of Christ, but the mysterie of the body of Christ is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: howe much more the vessels of our body, which God hath prepared to be a dwelling place for him selfe, ought we not to yeld to the diuil to do in them what hee will.</q>

Wherevpon I would desire the Christian reader to consider, what hard holde the Papistes keepe for the corporall presence, which is no benefite to the faithfull, but according to their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine common to the wicked, and howe proudly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride and contemne the spirituall presence, wherein yet consisteth all the comfort of the godly, which they them selues can not denie.

Wherein the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not worth the strife, so we remember that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old law, were not bare figures, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same in substaunce and vertue that ours are, as we shewed before out of Augustine, and that they were not bare figures of our sacraments, but of the things wherof our sacraments are effectuall signes. Although ours more cleare, as of thinges already exhibited, and theirs were of thinges to come. And therefore the olde writers, Origen, Ambrose, and Oecumenius also affirme, that the Fathers in the sacraments had the shadowe, we the image, and both of vs shall haue the truth in one countrie. Orig. in Ps. 38. Amb. 4. <hi>Offi.</hi> Chap. 48. Oec. in 10. Heb. The like comparison we had before of the shadowe and image out of Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

and Euthymius, that borrowed it of him. But how friuolous the comparisons be, that M. Heskins maketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the shewe breade and the sacrament, to proue the one to be a figure of the other: bicause it was set on the table, neuer fayled, was a bread of remembrance, was our offering, might not be eaten of any defiled person: I will declare by as many differences. The shewe bread was 12. cakes in number, so is not the sacrament: had frankincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses set vpon it and burned, so hath not the sacrament: was remoued euery Sabbath, so is not the sacrament: must of necessitie remaine a whole weeke, so must not the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: might not be eaten of any but only the Priestes, the sacrament must be eaten of al men: might not be eaten of the Priestes, vntill it was a seuen nights olde, so is not the sacrament. Where note I pray you, the synceritie of M. Heskins, that rehearsing the text out of 24. of Leuit. lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out the putting of incence vppon the two rowes, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not applie it to his Masse cakes.</p>
                  <p>But to the place of Hieronyme, <hi>In cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Tit. If Lay men be commaunded to abstaine from the companie of their wiues for prayer, what is to be thought of a Bishop, which daily must offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled sacrifices for his owne and the peoples sinnes? Let vs read the booke of Kings, and we shall finde that Abimelech the Prieste, would not giue Dauid and his seruants of the shewe bread, before he asked whether the seruants were cleane from a woman, not from a straunge woman, but from their wiues: and except he had heard that yesterday and the day before they had abstained from the worke of marriage, he had not graunted them the bread which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had denyed. There is as great difference betweene the shewe breade and the bodye of Christe, as betweene the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe and the bodies, betweene the image and the trueth, betweene the exemplars of thinges to come, and the thinges them selues prefigured by the exemplars. Therefore as meeknesse, patience, sobrietie, moderation, abstinence from lucre, hospitalitie also and benignitie, ought to be chiefly in a Byshop, and amongest all Lay men excelling: so also a peculiar chastitie, and, as I may say, Priestly continence, that hee doe not onely keepe him selfe f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

make the body of Christe may be free from casting of the eye, and wandring of thought.</hi> In these wordes Hieronyme maketh the shewe breade, a shadowe and figure of the body of Christe, but not of the sacrament thereof. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will Maister Heskins collection of the office of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop standing in consecration, offering, and receiuing the body of Christ helpe him. For here is no word of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating, but of making the body of Christe, <hi>Mens Christi corpus confectura,</hi> the minde shall make the body of Christ: which if it be not a figuratiue speach, Hieronyme speaketh both grossely and vntruely, neither of offering the body of Christ, but offering vndefiled sacrifices, which are prayers. Finally if it were plaine, that he called the sacrament by the name of that which it signifieth, yet hee him selfe is the best expounder of him selfe. <q>Where hee sheweth a double taking of the body &amp; bloud of Christe, spirituall and corporall. <hi>In Ep lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.

                  <p>But M. Heskins cannot omit this place, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a gird a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst married Priests, of which number he him selfe was once one, saying, they haue put away the consecration
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14727:41"/>
to keepe their women, but he did put away his wife, that he might returne to consecration: Howbeit to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As it is verie well knowen, Hieronyme was too much addict to the prayse of virginitie, so in this Chapter, hee cannot simplie condemne the mariage of Byshoppes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he wish rather a continence in them that can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine: and openly saith to professed virgines, that either they must marie if they cannot conteine, or els continue if they will not marie. <hi>Ad Demetriadem.</hi>

                  <p>Next to Hieronyme, which is of the higher house, hee is faine to place Damascene of the lower house. Who sayeth that <hi>The shewe bread did figure this breade,</hi> meaning the sacramentall breade, and not as M. Heskins expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it the bodie of Christ in the sacrament. For transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation is not so olde as Damascene, neither was it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in the Greeke Church, neither is it at this daye, neither, doe these wordes helpe him which hee addeth. <hi>Therefore with all feare and pure conscience, and with a sure faith let vs come to him and worship him with all purenesse of minde and bodie. Let vs come to him with burning desire, fashioning our handes in manner of a crosse, let vs receiue this bodie of him that was crucified.</hi> There can no necessarie collection bee made of this place, that Damascene spake of the popishe reall presence. And if it might, yet it is but one doctors opinion of the lower house, whose authoritie we weigh not. But why doe not the Papistes holde their handes a crosse, when they receyue the sacrament? by like all their ceremonies bee not so auncient as Damascene.</p>

Hee saith that the sheepe hath giuen place to breade, as though he knewe not that then also the shewe breade was wont to bee set on the Lords table, and that now also he doeth take part of the bodie of the immaculate lambe. Hee sayth that bloude hath giuen place
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14727:42"/>
to the cuppe not considering that nowe also hee receyueth bloude in the cuppe. Therefore howe much better and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably shoulde hee saye, that the olde thinges are passed, and newe thinges are made in Christe, so that Altar gaue place to Altar, sworde to sworde, fire to fire, breade to breade, sheepe to sheepe, bloude to bloude? For wee see in all these, that the carnall oldnesse giueth place to the spirituall newnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vnderstanding of this place dependeth vppon the knowledge of the errour of Vibicus. And that was this. Hee thought that the outwarde ceremonies of the olde lawe, did signifie the outwarde ceremonies of the newe Testament, that is, that carnall thinges did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede carnall thinges. As the lambe did signifie the bread, the bloude did signifie the wine in the sacrament, and so bread gaue place to the lambe, the cuppe to the bloud. But this Augustine denyeth. For they had bread then, and they haue breade nowe: they had the fleshe of a lambe then, and they haue the fleshe of a lambe nowe: they had bloude then, and they haue bloude nowe: they had carnall thinges then, and wee haue spirituall thinges nowe. This place therefore is directly against M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins bill of the carnall presence, and hath nothinge to prooue that the shewe breade was a figure of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but onely affirmeth that they had breade, as wee haue breade, for they had the shewe breade. But if there had ben transubstantiation, that is, no bread in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee might easily haue confuted Vibicus saying, that breade gaue place to the sheepe. But hee confesseth that wee haue bread, and affirmeth, that they had breade also. And where he sayth, that wee eate parte of the body of the immaculate lambe, hee declareth sufficiently that hee spake of no carnall presence, for then hee woulde not haue deuided the bodie of the lambe into partes, which the Papistes say euerie one receiueth whole. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, where he saith that the carnall oldenesse gaue place to the spirituall newnesse, hee doth moste clearely teach vs, that the outwarde ceremonies of the olde Testament, were figures of the spirituall things signified and giuen
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14727:42"/>
by our sacramentes, and not of the outwarde elementes of our sacraments. By which it is manifest, that spirituall thinges and not carnall thinges are the substance of our sacraments. Nowe to M. Heskins collections. He saith that <hi>the old sacrifices of the lambe were not figures of the sacrament</hi>: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying now in one word, that he laboured to proue before in 7. Chapters: <hi>but of the bloudie sacrifice of Christ offered vppon the crosse after the maner of Aaron.</hi> Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sence of Augustines words, let the readers weigh my collection &amp; his, by Augustines place, and by the rest of the Epistle that is of the same matter. But marke here once againe, that hee maketh the sacrifice of Christs passion, a sacrifice after the maner of Aaron, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly Christ a priest after the maner of Aaron, directly contrarie to the scriptures in expresse words Heb. 7. Secondly he vrgeth that, which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine saith, we nowe receiue bloud in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup, by which he wil exclude the distinction of spirituall receiuing. But all in vaine, except he can conclude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we receiue <hi>partem de ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni immaculati corpore,</hi> part of the vndefiled lambes bodie. For if the one be spirituall, so is the other. I am sure the naturall bodie of Christ is not deuided into parts, but wee do spiritually receiue nourishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t al of one bodie. To be short, if that which Augustine addeth of spirituall newnes succeeding carnall oldnes, were not a sufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of a spirituall receiuing, I woulde bring other places of Augustine to shewe the same most plainly. But the thing being so apparant, I will not mistrust the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of any indifferent reader so much, as to trouble him with more testimonies, which shall better come in, where more shewe is for M. Heskins bill.</p>
                  <p>But we must passe ouer to Isychius, whose wordes are set downe at large in Cap. 24. Leui. <hi>The verie number of the loaues doth call vs to a contemplation of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14727:43"/>
holy place. And also that they are called holie of holies, (vnderstand what is said, for the Lord shall giue thee vnderstanding) remember the mysticall table of which it is commaunded that none should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne except the intelligible Aaron, that is Christe, (For he began it first) excepte also his sonnes, which by him are made Christes, and haue put on him, which yet they are commaunded to eate in a holie place. And hee is that holy of holies, that they may haue a principall and vndespised sanctification. These loaues of two tenthes (for they are of God and man, of the same being, perfect in both) are set sixe ouer against sixe. The mysticall supper is set here, and it is set in the worlde to come. Sixe loaues are one proposition or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth, as the mysterie it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fe is perfecte and maketh them that enioye it perfecte. And in sixe dayes this visible creature was made, and the sixt day man was made, for whome Christe prepared his mysticall table. But yet altogether are rightlie twelue loaues, because the Apostles that were twelue in number first sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the Lordes table.</hi> Here is an allegoricall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the shewe breade to signifie the Lordes supper, but that proueth it not a prefiguration of the sacrament. For there is great difference betweene an allegory, and a figure of a thing to come. But to the poynte of the bill, here is nothing for the carnall presence, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what against it.</p>
                  <p>First where hee saith that the Christians (whom alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically he calleth the sonnes of the intelligible Aaron, <hi>induti sunt eo,</hi> haue put on him, meaning they are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for as manie as are baptised in him haue put him on. But they haue put on him onely spiritually, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are commaunded to eate him onely spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the twelue loaues, whiche signifieth the bodie of Christ, signifieth the twelue Apostles also, which mystically were his bodie, by which you may see, hee speaketh of no carnall presence, Thirdly he calleth it a mysterie and a mysticall supper, which will not stande w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> M. Heskins corporal collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. No more wil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he addeth <hi>That it is a cleane table, first as making cleane, secondly as hauing no lies or infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, such as are in the misteries of the paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14727:43"/>
Where it is to be laughed at, that he will proue a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral presence, because it cleanseth sinnes: for then shal we haue the same presence in baptisme, and the Papistes in holie water, which they affirme to clense sinnes also. But it is, <hi>a per se,</hi> that Isychius addeth. <hi>Moreouer, extolling his glorie, and aduauncing the dignitie of this mysterie into an height, he addeth, it is the holie of holies of the Lordes sacrifices for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall lawe. Therefore prayer is holie, the reading of holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is holie, and the hearing of the interpretation thereof: to be short, all things that are done and sayed in the Church of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawe, are holie. But the holie of holies of the Lordes sacrifice, of all things that are offered and done to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is the table which Christ setteth forth of his owne sacrifice.</hi> Here is a great commendation of that mysticall Table, which Christ hath set forth of the sacrifice of his death, which no man doubteth to be moste holie in the right vse thereof, and in respect of him that feedeth vs with his bodie and bloud at that table. But what is all this to the corporall and carnall presence? But M. Heskins woulde finde a contradiction in the wordes of Oecolampadius, in that he sayeth the bread is sanctified, and yet it hath no holinesse in it, whereas that holie man speaketh plainly and distinctly, that it is sanctified, and doth sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, in the right vse of it, &amp; not in the nature of it self.</p>

                     </note> as whether it ought to bee reserued by the institution of Christe. Neither is the simple reseruation, one of the proclaymers articles (as M. Heskins saith,) but whether it should be hanged vp in a Canopie for an ydol as the Papistes vse it. As for reseruation, how slenderly it is proued by him, we shall see by examination of his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14727:44"/>
witnesses. For as touching his application thereof vnto the reseruation of the shewe breade, because it is but his owne iudgement, I will not vouchsafe to aunswere it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then to denye it, to be of any force to proue his purpose. His first witnesse is Clemens Ep. 2. <hi>The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods secretes are committed to three degrees: to the priest, the Deacon, and the minister, which with feare and trembling ought to keepe the leauings of the peeces of the Lordes bodie, that no rottennes be found in the holie place, lest when the thing is done negligently, great iniurie be done to the portion of the Lordes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> By this place M. Heskins will needes proue reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the carnall presence, but neither of both will fall out of his side, although the authoritie of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is not worth a strawe, beeing a counterfet decretall ascribed to Clemens, neither in true latine, nor good sense.</p>
                  <p>And first for the carnall presence, note how he sayeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remnantes of the peeces and portions of the Lords bodie, and so he doth often in this Epistle, meaning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crommes of the sacramentall bread, which was consecrated to bee the bodie of Christ. For Christes naturall bodie cannot be broken into leauings, fragments, and portions, which be the termes he vseth. Nowe touching the reseruation, he meaneth no keeping but of these crommes, which hee calleth leauings, fragments and portions, and no keeping of them, but from mouldinesse or rottennesse, that is, that they should be spent while they are good, and not kepte while they stinke, as the Papistes doe, not the fragments, but their whole Masse cakes sometimes. For touching the sacrament it selfe, he writeth by and by after: <q>
                        <hi>Tanta in altario holocausta offerantur, quanta populo sufficere debens. Quod si remanserint, in Crastinum non reseruentur, sed cum timore &amp; tremore clericorum diligentia consumantur.</hi> Let so great sacrifices bee offered on the altar, as may suffice all the people. But if any be left, let them not be kept vntill the next day, but with feare and trembling, let them bee spent by the diligence of the Clerkes.</q> This bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most manifest against reseruation, Master Heskins
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14727:44"/>
is not ashamed to racke it to stande with reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And first, he asketh the aduersarie, whether hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that Saint Clement was a foole, to denye that hee sayed before? No verily, but I think him to be no wise man, that either taketh this Epistle to bee written by Clement, the first bishop of Rome, or so vnderstandeth it, that he woulde make him contrarie to him selfe. And I thinke he that did forge this Epistle vnder Saint Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments name, was not onely a doltish foole, but also an impudent falsarie, to make that auncient Clemens to write to the Apostle Saint Iames of such bables as those be, and that followe in the Epistle: which, if they were of weight, yet the Apostle was not to learne them of Clemens, but Clemens of him. But concerning the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that he speaketh of, he writeth yet more plainlye: <q>
                        <hi>Non eijcientes foras è sacrario velamina,</hi> not shaking abroad out of the holy place or vestrie the couering of the Lords table, lest peraduenture the dust of the Lordes bodie shoulde fall a misse from the linnen cloth beeing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed abroade, and this should be sinne to him that doth it. Lo sir, before wee had reliques, fragments, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nowe wee haue the dust of the Lords body.</q> What dust is this, but small crommes? But he goeth on, and that Saint Iames might the better looke to those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he sayeth: <q>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:14727:45"/>You see this man would haue the sacrament spent, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thought that the crommes, both small and great, be not cast away, nor kept vntill they be rotten, nor suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be eaten of Mise, nor defyled with their doung, but he is vtterly against popish reseruation. The next is Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, who in his Epistle, in which he doth sharply rebuke Victor bishop of Rome, for excommunicating the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Asia about the celebration of Easter, sayth: <hi>That they were neuer for that matter driuen from the fellowship of the Church, or comming from those partes, were not receiued: but rather all the elders or Bishops that were before them, did alwayes solemnely send the sacrament of Eucharistie to all the bishops or elders of those Churches that did not so obserue it.</hi> M. Heskins imagineth that the Bishops of Rome, did sende the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into all partes of the worlde, to all bishops &amp; el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of euerie Church: which if he did, hee had neede of many messengers. But the matter is plaine ynough. If any of those bishops or elders came to Rome, they were louingly receiued of Victors predecessours, and at the time of the Communion, the bishop would send the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to them by the deacons, as well as to any of the citizens that were of his owne Church. Here is no sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of reseruation, but M. Heskins absurde imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Tertullian followeth Irenaeus, writing to his wife, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>An arbitrare ô vxor ita gesturam te, vt clam viro sint, qua facis? Non sciet ille quid secreto ante omne cibum gustes? &amp; si sciuerie non partem illum credit esse, qui dicitur. Doest thou thinke (ô wife) so to handle thy selfe, that these things that thou doest shalbe vnknowen to thy husbande? shall not he knowe what before all meates thou doest secretely receiue? and if hee shall knowe it, he beleeueth it not to be that bread, that it is saide to be.</hi> Thus M.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14727:45"/>
playne that he neuer read this place in Tertullian him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but only borrowed it out of some other papist, that alledged it for this purpose, &amp; belike gathered the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer question, not as Tertullians wordes, but out of his meaning, which Maister Heskins not vnderstanding, very ridiculously, hath set down, as the words of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. These be the Popishe doctours, that boast of their great reading, when they reade but patches out of other mens notes, and collections. But to the matter. Although it may seeme, this corruption to haue entred into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican Churches, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people carried home y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread, and did eate it daily before all other meates, yet this is nothing like vnto the Popish reseruation in the pixe, to be adored. And Tertullian in his Booke <hi>De Corona militis,</hi> doeth rehearse this custome among those thinges, that had no ground of scripture for them. The liks is to be saide, to the place of Cyprian, where a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kept it in her chest, as for the miracle, whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued her vnworthinesse, or her reseruation, it is not plaine by the authour. The story of Satyrus out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose proueth not directly reseruation, for it is like, the Christians being in daunger of shipwrack, did minister the communion in the shippe, &amp; not bring it with them from the shore consecrated. And Satyrus being then but a nouice or Catechumein, and not baptised, desired the sacrament of them, meaning to receiue it before his death, if he sawe present daunger of drowning, otherwise to tarry vntill he were admitted to it, by order of the Church. But this proueth nothing at all the Popishe reseruation, although the fact of Satyrus was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imperfection, as greatly as it is commended of Ambrose: and much lesse the Carnal presence, For Satyrus, did not so put his affiaunce in the sacrament, that he thought it to be God, but that he desired it as an helpe of his faith, that he might not depart this life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the communion of the body of Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The place of Chrysostome, is nothing at all for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14727:46"/>
where he saith, that in a tumult the souldiers rushing into the Churches, <hi>The most holy bloud of Christ was shed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their clothes.</hi> For he must reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, it was on Easter day, when all the people did communicate, and such as came were baptised. And where he saith, it was <hi>Ad vesperu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diei,</hi> that they did enter, that is, in the afternoone: he must wit, that Chrysostome after the maner of the scripture, calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning before day light <hi>Vespere Sabbati,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore his collection is vaine. But although it were in the afternoone, what inconuenience is it if we say, they spent al the forenoone in prayer, &amp; fasting, and hearing the worde of God, and ministring baptisme, which then was ministred twise a yeare, at Easter, &amp; at Pentecost: and then in the afternoone towarde euening, went to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? Hierome reporteth of Exuperius, that he caried the Lords body in a wicker basket, and his bloud in a glasse. What reseruation is here? M. Heskins saith, he did beare it about with him, but Hieronyme saith not so, except you meane about the Churche, when he ministred the communion. <hi>But here Maister Iewel hath a double blow.</hi> O cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Maister of defence. <hi>For here is not onely reseruation, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the reseruation I haue saide before, and to the plaine calling of it body and bloud, I say, what other thing is it, then as Maister Iewel himselfe will call it? and worthily: yet no transubstantiation meant by him. But how will Maister Heskins warde these blowes? Exuperius had no hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pixes, nor chalices of Golde and siluer, as the Papistes must haue? And Exuperius ministred to the lay people in both kindes, as the Papistes will not do? What hath M. Heskins gayned by Exuperius? But then Eusebius shall help him, for in his 6. booke, and 36. Chapter, is declared, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a certeine priest, sent to Serapion (beeing at the point of death) a litle portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Eucharistie in the night season: by which it appeareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was reserued. In deed Dionysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us bishop of Alexandria writeth so vnto Fabianus Bishop of Rome. But withall he sheweth, that it was no publique

order of the vniuersall Church, but his own commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto his owne Church, that he might not seeme in any point to resemble the Nouatians, which denied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to them that had fallen in persecution: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith, that although the priest was sicke, and could not come: <q>
                        <hi>Tamen quia pręceptum fuerat a me, vt lapsis in exitu nemo reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliationis solatia denegaret, &amp; maximè ijs, quos priùs id rogasse constaret, parum &amp;c.</hi> Yet because it had beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by me, that no man should denie to them that had fallen, the comfort of reconciliation at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, especially to those who were known to haue desired it before, he gaue a litle of the Eucharistie, &amp;c. Whiche wordes M. Heskins hath cleane left out of the text, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the particular commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Dionyse is expressed:</q> and yet it is not proued that the Priest had the sacrament reserued, but it might well be, that he did then consecrate and send him parte, as he should haue done, if he could haue come to the sicke man himselfe for his owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Last of all he rehearseth the wordes of Cyril <hi>Ad Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrium: I heare that they say, that the mystical blessing, if any rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants thereof remaine vnto the next day following, is vnprofitable to sanctification. But they are madd in so saying, for Christe is not made an other, neither shal his holy body be chaunged, but the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of blessing, and the liuely grace do alwayes remaine in him.</hi> M. Heskins translateth <hi>in illo,</hi> in it, as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue, &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening grace were included in the sacrament, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith to remain in Christ. But touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of this <hi>Cyrillus ad Colosyrium,</hi> I must admonish the Reader, that these wordes are not to be found in all the workes of Cyrillus that are extant, but is only a patch cited by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole epistle is not to be found. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can neither tel whether it were write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ancient Cyrillus of Alexandria, or by some late writer of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name, nor yet what was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; scope of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Epistle. Neuertheles, it semeth to some, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wrote against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Anthropomorphits, which thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of Christ was corrupted, if the remnants of the sacrament were corrupted: but that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus denieth, because Christ is eternall &amp; incorruptible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:14727:47"/>He saith not that the remnantes of the sacrament are so, for that the Papistes confesse to be otherwise, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that they ceasse to be the body &amp; bloud of Christ, when the species or kinds of bread and wine are putrified or rotten. But Cyril saith, that vertue, &amp; grace, do alwayes remaine in him, not in that sacrament reserued, which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth corrupt. Finally, he speaketh but of reseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for one day, to the vse of eating, and not of adoration, therefore he speaketh nothing against the challenge, which was not simply of reseruation, but of reseruing the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be worshipped. But whereas M. Heskins mainteyneth reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by dipping of stoales, and linnen clothes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup, he must reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that Iulius in his decretal epistles, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth that dipping, as diuers counsels also do, which in due place are alledged.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Origen doth vtterly condemne that abuse of reseruation of the sacrament, affirming that it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same case, that the sacrifice of the passeouer, and the sacrifice of praise and thankesgiuing were, of which it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to reserue any part, vntill the next mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which wordes it is manifest, that as he disallowed the reseruation, so was it not in vse in the East Church in his time. And that M. Heskins may be snarled in his owne coarde, he must call to minde, what paines he tooke to proue the Pascall Lambe, to be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this sacrament, and how earnestly he vrgeth, that the trueth must answere the figure, in all things iustly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so much that he alledgeth this text, that not a iote, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke of the law shall passe, vntill all be fulfilled. Nowe of the Pascal lambe, there was an expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no part of it should be reserued vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his owne figures, textes, &amp; manner of reasoning, I conclude, that the sacrament may not be reserued at all.</p>

                     </note> we doe not admit their authoritie. But M. Heskins promising Counsells, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the institution of Iustinian, <hi>That Monasteries of Virgines should haue libertie to choose a Priest which should bring vnto them the holy Communion.</hi> Herevpon he will build reseruation, for they did not celebrate to them (saith he) but they brought it. As though he that bringeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth not preach before them, but bringeth a Sermon in his bosome. But for as much as that decree speaketh not onely of a Priest but also of a Deacon, I can be content to thinke, that he brought the sacrament with him and did not consecrate there, but what maketh this for reseruation to the vse of adoration, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or else for an ordinarie custome of reseruation, if the sacrament were brought from the next Church, (where and when it was celebrated) to the Monasterie, not to be hanged vp in a cannopie, but to be receiued presently? But it is a proper reason that M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins vseth: for may be reserued for a short time, why not for a long time? For answere of this, I will referre him to his owne Popish decrees, that forbid such reseruation, for feare of putrifaction and rottennesse. At last commeth the Counsels of Wormes and Remes, in which times it is certaine that great corruptions preuailed in the church: then followeth the Counsell of Laterane commended for generall held Anno. 1215. speaking of the diligent reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the sacrament: with much adoe about the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Counsels But all not worth a rush. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Counsell of Laterane falsified the text of scripture tract to both in wordes and sense, alledging it thus in their second Canon or Chapter against Ioachim Abbas: <hi>Pater quod dedit mihi maius est omnibus,</hi> that which the father hath giuen me is greater then all. Whereas the trueth of the text is, the father which hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to me, is gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all. A wise and worshipfull Counsel, that can not

                  <p>Last of all commeth the Counsel of Trent in our days, and that, not so vainely alledgeth of <hi>The age of the Nicen Counsell to haue acknowledged reseruation,</hi> as M.

And in the end, he ioyneth an other issue with the proclamer, <hi>That if he can bring any plaine scripture, catholique doctour, or counsel, that by expresse wordes forbiddeth reseruation, he will subscribe.</hi> For scripture y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution, do ye this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, proueth the sacrament to be an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not a name of a thing that may be reserued, for euery action is in mouing.

                     </note> and our very Achilles against all other rites vsed in the sacraments, is, that in the institution thereof there is no mention made of reseruation. But there he belyeth vs. For we say it is directly against the commaundement of the institution, take and eate, and do this in remembrance of me. I would aske this question of him. Was it lawfull for the Apostles to haue reserued it when Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be eaten? If he say no, let him shewe me why it is more lawfull nowe to reserue it then it was then: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14727:48"/>
we haue the same commaundement continued, doe this in remembrance of me, that is, take and eate it?</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, we say it is cleane contrarie to the end and forme of the sacrament, that it should be reserued and caried about to be worshipped. For it is spirituall meate, whose end, vse, and fruit is in eating, not in keeping and carying about, or worshipping. But nowe let vs see Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Heskins profound Diuinitie in solution of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>There be three manner of doings as concerning the scripture. One is, to do so much as the scripture biddeth An other, to do against that the scripture biddeth. The third, to do something besides that the scripture biddeth.</hi> Concerning the first, hee saith, that <hi>As Christ tooke breade and wine, made it his body and bloud, commaunded it to be eaten and dronken in remembrance of him: so he that taketh bread and wine, and doth consecrate it, eat it, and drinke it in remembraunce of his death &amp;c. doth as much as the scripture biddeth him, and is blamelesse in this respect.</hi> This is true, and all this doe we in our Church, therefore are we blamelesse by his owne conclusion. But they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commaunded to eate, and minister to bee eaten, doe not eate it, nor giue it to be eaten, but keepe it, and hang it vp, doe manifestly breake this commaundement: and so doe the Papiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. For they doe against that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture biddeth. And whereas he alledgeth the sixt Counsell of Constantinople, reprouing the Armenians for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string with wine without water, it seemeth that both hee and the Counsell forgot his first rule. For they doing as much as they had either example or commaundement, of Christes institution, by his owne rule were in this respect blamelesse. But he addeth, that they in the Counsell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Masse of Saint Iames and Basil, which is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false, for they alledged but the manner of celebration of the mysticall sacrifice set foorth by them, and no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Masse. Whether Saint Iames did set foorth any such forme of celebration I will not here dispute, but I am sure there were many thinges intituled to the Apostles, euen while they liued, that were but counterfet, and so I thinke was this, for else it had bene Canonicall scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14727:49"/>
and the Churche would not, or should not haue cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged S. Iames his Masse, for Gregories Masse: nor Basil nor Chrysostome, should haue needed to haue made any newe liturgye, if they had bene certaine, that the olde had had the Apostles for their authours and inditers.</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins triumpheth vpon the old vsage of the Primitiue Churche, for mixing water with their wine, which we in our celebration obserue not, neither is it any matter that we striue for, but against the necessitie of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the wine. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cauelleth against M. Iewel, <hi>For pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing a Minister of his Dyocesse, that ministred the Communion with Ale, whereas he him selfe doth worse, like the high Priestes, that made no conscience to condemne Christ, but a great matter i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> was with them to put the price of his betraying in the tresurie &amp;c.</hi> Where note, that ministring with wine onely, which was Christes institution, is called of him <hi>our tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thirde manner of doing he diuideth into two kindes. When the substaunce being kept, some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is altered, or some ceremonie added for decencie. But reseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no meare circumstance of time, place, or persons, nor yet an indifferent ceremonie, but contrarie to the substance of the institution, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Christ. For the sacrament was ordeined, only to be eaten and dronken, wherevnto reseruation is contrarie, so was it commaunded to be receiued, therefore ought not to bee reserued, hanged vp, worshipped, &amp;c. And as M. Heskins will ioyne issue, so wil I demurre in law with him and all his fellowes, that Popish reseruation is contrarie to the end of the institution and commaundement of Christe, and nothing like those matters of circumstance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he compareth it, of morning, euening, fasting, after supper, number of persons, or difference of sexe, or any of those kindes. Therefore (he him selfe saith) <hi>The Protestants argument of negatiue is eluded,</hi> but neuer a wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hieronyme, Chrysostome, and the rest speake not of the manner and forme of celebration: therefore there is no necessarie forme to bee obserued, as commaunded by Christ.

                        </gap>ndreth yeares after Christ did minister the sacramentes purely and without the breach of Christes commaundement.</hi> Hee will grant for the substance, but not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they continued so long without abuse. The assumption of this proposition is, that the Masses vsed in the primitiue Church, varied from Christes institution. As for example, the Masses of S. Iames, Basil, Chrysostome, Ambrose, differed ech from other, and all from Christes institution in forme and manner. It pleaseth him to call the olde liturgies or formes of ministration vsed in diuerse Churches, masses: the diuersitie hee meaneth is in formes of prayers, and circumstances, concerning which Christe gaue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and therfore, they are contrarie to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
                  <p>The seconde reason is of the proclamers owne prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, who in celebration of this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vseth other time, other kinde of breade, other garmentes, other number of communicantes then Christe did. But none of these are the forme or matter of the sacrament, and so they touch not the substance. But eating and drinking is of the substantiall forme of the sacrament, and the end of the consecration of the creatures of breade and wine, to the vse of that holy mysterie, against which, not eating is contradiction, and so reseruation is a plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the commaundemente of Christ.</p>
                  <p>An other reason hee hath of admitting an vnworthie person, as Christ did Iudas, which is for all that a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of question: and yet nothing to the purpose, if hee were admitted. For Christe knewe him by his diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before he chose him to bee an Apostle, but in as much as Iudas was an hypocrite, before he was reueled to the iudgement of man, hee was not to be refused. To be short, the substance of the sacrament is not only the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matter thereof, as M. Heskins dreameth, but also the earthly matter and the fourme also. As for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and accidentes, that touch neither the forme nor matter, they are to bee applyed to edification, order, &amp; decencie. Cyprian and the fathers in his time, and long
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14727:50"/>
time after, what reason did they vse to confute them that ministred with water, mylke, clusters of grapes, dipping of bread, and linnen cloathes in the wine, and such like? Did they not beate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of Christ? For they coulde well inough distinguishe the substance from the accidentes, the matter and forme from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                  <p>After this M. Heskins will open <hi>a sleight of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamer, who confesseth that women in the time of Tertullian and Cyprian did carie home the sacrament to their houses, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a portion therof in the morning, before meat: but he numbreth this custome among abuses, whereas neither Tertullian nor Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an do directly reproue them</hi>: neither do they allow them, by any one worde. But I pray you M. Heskins, if it bee no abuse, that women shoulde carie the sacrament home with them, keepe it in their coffers, and eate it euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning next their heart, why doe not you of the Popishe Church continue such an auncient custome? Why haue you abrogated it? and to dissuade them from it, tell tales in you legends and promptuaries, of some that haue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it home, and founde it turned I cannot tell into what monsters? But peraduenture the vsage of the Church in Iustines time, will prooue it to bee none abuse. For then the sacrament was caried home to them that were absent. And here M. Heskins alleadging Iustines Apollogie, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in whether Apollogie, and setteth downe a forme of wordes, which are not in Iustine, Apoll. 2. where the matter is spoken of, in such forme as he citeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by which once again you may see, that his great reading of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctors was out of other mens notes &amp; collections, &amp; not of his own studie.

But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of trueth is this. There was a custome at Rome, to receiue euery day, which custome Hierome sayth he doth neither allowe, nor reprehende.

is no worde in Saint Hierome?</q> but rather it is to bee thought, that the Priests did come to them, and minister it in their priuate houses, which Hierome also disallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.

Then he affirmeth, that <hi>Christ was not a Priest after the order of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, but after the order of Melchizedech.</hi> Yet in the ende of the Chapter like a blasphemous dogge, hee sayeth, that <hi>Christ executed his priesthood after the order of Aaron vppon the Crosse.</hi> Where beside his blasphemie, note how hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with him selfe. <hi>But Christ</hi> he sayeth, <hi>it called a Priest after the order of Melchizedech for the manner of his sacrifice, which maketh the difference betweene the order of Aaron, and the order of Melchizedech. For Aaron offered in bloud, the other in bread and wine.</hi> The Apostle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues, obseruing many differences, could not finde this. But M. Heskins aunswereth that the cause why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle did leaue out this manner of sacrifice, was, <hi>for that his principall purpose was, to shewe the excellencie of Christ and his priesthood, aboue Aaron, and his priesthood, which could not bee by shewing that he sacrificed breade and wine, for the Iewes sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14727:52"/>
were more glorious then bread and wine.</hi> By this wise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he giueth vs to deeme, that the Apostle of subtiltie suppressed this comparison, because they were weake, as though they knewe not what the sacramentes of the Church were. But if Christe sacrificed his bodie and bloud twise, he could not better haue shewed his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie aboue Aaron, then in declaring, that Christe did not onely offer him self in bloud on the Crosse, but also in bread &amp; wine, after the example of Melchizedech. For if offering of sacrifice were one of the chiefe partes of a Priestes office, and breade and wine had beene the sacrifice of Melchizedech, the Apostle neither would, nor coulde haue dissembled the comparison of his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with the sacrifice of Christe, which would infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue aduaunced his priesthood aboue Aaron. For else the Hebrues, whom M. Heskins imagineth would haue obiected their sacrifices to be more glorious then bread and wine, might more probably haue replyed, that the Apostles compared Melchizedech with Christe in small matters, and omitted the chiefest parte of his office, which was this sacrifice: so that if he were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in the chiefe, it was little to excell in the small matters.</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins taketh vppon him to aunswere our obiection that we make against this sacrifice of breade and wine, which is this: as the Apostle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues speaketh nothing of it, no more doeth Moses in Genesis. For it is sayed there, that Melchizedech bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught foorth breade and wine, but neuer a worde, that he did sacrifice breade and wine. This obiection he wil aunswer, both by scripture and by the eldest learned men of Christes parleament. Concerning the parleament men, as it is true, that many of them did thinke Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech to be a figure of Christ in bringing foorth bread and wine: so when we come to consider their voyces, it shall appeare, that they make little for transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the carnall presence.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs heare the scripture. The scripture to proue
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14727:53"/>
that Melchisedech did sacrifice this bread and wine saith: that <hi>he was a Priest of the most high God, to whome is belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, not to bring foorth, but to offer bread and wine, so that the verie connexion of the Scripture and dependants of the same, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth vs to take this sense, and none other can be admitted.</hi> This is a verie peremptorie sentence, plumped downe of you M. Heskins, not as from your doctours chaire, but euen as from Apolloes three footed stoole. But if it may please you to heare: is it not also scripture, that he was King of Salem? and wil not the verie connexion and dependance of the Scripture leade vs to thinke, that as an example of his royall liberalitie, he brought foorth bread &amp; wine, to refresh the hungrie and wearie souldiers of Abraham, which being such a multitude, could not easily be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for by a priuate man?</p>
                  <p>And where Moses sayeth, he was a priest of the highest God, hee addeth also an example of his priestly holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that he blessed Abraham, &amp; praysed God, and that Abraham gaue him tythes of al. And lest you should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame, as your manner is, that this is a newe exposition, Iosephus in the firste booke &amp; tenth Chapter of his <q>Iewishe antiquities, doth so expounde it: <hi>Hic Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechus milites Abrahami hospitaliter habuit, nihil eis ad victum deesse passus &amp;c.</hi> This Melchisedech gaue verie liberall intertainment to the souldiours of Abraham, &amp; suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to want nothing vnto their liuing.</q> But if M.

First he affirmeth, that Christ made two of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of himselfe, whereas the holy Ghost saith. <q>Heb. 9. not that he should oftentimes offer himselfe, as the high priest, &amp;c. For then he should haue suffered oftentimes since the beginning of the world. And Heb. 10. He offered but one sacrifice for sinnes, and is set downe at the right hand of God for euer, &amp;c. For by one only oblation, he hath made perfect for euer them that are sanctified. And in the same Chapter: where there is forgiuenesse of sinnes, there is no more sacrifice for sinne. Whervpon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that if Christes sacrifice at his supper, tooke away sinnes, he offered no sacrifice vpon the crosse.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, he affirmeth that Christe was a priest after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Aaron, which he denied before, and is in plaine wordes denied by the holy Ghost Heb. 7. which place M. Heskins himselfe setteth downe in this Chapter: if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had beene by the Priesthoode of the Leuites (for

vnder it the law was established to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people) what needed it further, that another priest should arise after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Melchisedech, &amp;c not to be called after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Aaron.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he affirmeth, that the sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse, was after the order of Aaron. Wherevpon it wil follow, that it was not an eternall redemption purchased by it, but transitorie, as the priesthoode of Aaron was. Whereas the holy Ghost saith, that by his owne bloud he entred once into the holy place, and found eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which could neuer be obteined by any sacrifice after the order of Aaron.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he affirmeth, that Christ altogether neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the priesthoode appointed to him of God, except he did offer sacrifice in his supper of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>By which, he denieth, that the once offring vp of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, by his eternall spirite on the crosse, was any parte of his priesthoode appointed him by God, then the which there can be no more diuelish blasphemie.

Heb. 5. Hauing an euerlasting priesthod, by which he is able perfectly to saue them, that come vnto God by him, seeing he euer liueth to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for them. For such an high priest it became vs to haue, which is holy, harmelesse, vndefiled, separated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinners, and made higher then the heauens, which needed not daily, as these high Priestes, to offer vp sacrifice, first for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples: for that he did once when he offred vp himself. Heb. 7. But beside his detestable blasphemies, see his ridiculous vanitie. If the priesthoode of Melchizedech standeth in his offering of bread and wine, then Christ also offered bread and wine,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14727:54"/>
as he saide before, <hi>Christ offered in bread and wine</hi>: as Aaron did in bloud.</q> If bread &amp; wine be Christes offring, or any part of it, then there is bread and wine in the sacrament, &amp; what is becomme of transubstantiation? If there was no bread &amp; wine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of Christe, then where is Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeches priesthoode, by his owne diuinitie? Againe, if he say, there be the shewes, or accidents of bread &amp; wine, then Melchizedeches bread and wine, was a figure of the accidents of bread and Wine, &amp; then the figure was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing figured, contrarie to his worshipfull rule, giuen in the 15. Chapter. If he say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Melchizedeches bread &amp; wine, figured not the Accidents, but the bread &amp; wine before it be consecrated, then he breaketh his rule once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: for Melchizedeches bread, if it were not hallowed, was as good: if it were hallowed, as it was, if it were offred, it was better then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated bread &amp; wine. Finally, if he say, it figured, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated bread &amp; wine, nor the accidents of the same consecrated, but the body and bloud of Christ vnder these accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: beside that he makes it a figure of a figure or signe, which he said could not be, he denieth that Christ did that, wherein he affirmed the priesthoode of Melchizedech to stand: namely, that he offred bread and wine.

                     <hi>&amp; to the sonnes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham that do his workes, the high priest bringeth foorth bread and wine. This</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is my body. They had eaten and dronken of the same bread, according to the visible fourme, but before those wordes, that common meate, was profitable only to nourish the body. But after it was saide by the Lorde, do this in remembrance, This is my flesh, &amp; this is my bloud. As ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is done with these wordes, and with this faith, that substantiall bread, and cuppe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated with a solemne blessing, profiteth vnto the life and health of the whole man, being both a medicine, (Et Holocaustum) and a burnt offering, to heale infirmities, and purge iniquities. There is also declared the difference betweene spirituall meate, and corporall meate: namely, that it was one thing that was first set before them, &amp; another thing, which was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; distributed by their Maister.</hi> First it is graunted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cyprian thought the bread &amp; wine brought foorth by Melchizedech, to be a figure of the sacrament, and that herein also he resembled the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of Christ, which we are neither afraide, nor abash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to denie, because the Apostle (an older doctor then Cyprian, &amp; such an one as in his writings could not erre) could finde no such resemblance betweene Melchizedech and Christ. Concerning the sacrifice of bread and wine, I wil speake hereafter, in answere to the other places of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. But now let vs examine M. Heskins two notes, for the reall presence, as he calleth it. <hi>The first is, that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon meate being consecrated is profitable for the whole man, as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to heale infirmities, and a sacrifice to purge sinnes, but neither our faith in Christ crucified, nor the merites of his passion are the sacrifice, but his very body: therefore this meate is his very body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> of this argument is ambiguous: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be distinguished: for this worde sacrifice, is either taken properly, or vnproperly, and figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: if it be taken figuratiuely for a sacrament, or a memoriall of a sacrifice, as Cyprian meaneth, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14727:55"/>
is true, but if it be taken for a sacrifice in the proper sense, it is false. For Christe offered but one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and that but once, neuer to be repeated, which was on the crosse. Nowe, to proue that Cyprian vsed the word <hi>sacrifice,</hi> vnproperly for this time, I will shewe no more, but his owne word <hi>Holocaustum,</hi> which signifieth a whole burned sacrifice, for M. Heskins will graunt, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ is vnproperly called a burned offering.</p>
                  <p>The second note that he gathereth, is of the <hi>Propertie of this word, Aliud: in the Neuter gender it signifieth an other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance forsooth: as we may say, Alius pater, alius filius, but not aliud pater, aliud filius. And then the rule is extended to vnum, for Christ saith, ego &amp; pater vnum sumus, &amp; hij tres vnum sunt.</hi> This he would beare men in hand, to be the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learned men, and so the bread before consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>aliud,</hi> that is one substance, but after consecration it is <hi>aliud,</hi> that is an other substance, and so the body of Christe. This is an high point in a lowe house, but the young pettites in the Grammer schoole, can teach him that <hi>aliud</hi> in the Neuter gender put absolutely, must bee resolued into <hi>alia res,</hi> an other thing, and so doth Maister Heskins him selfe translate it. And Cyprian sheweth what other thing it is, after consecration, when he saith: here is declared the difference betweene the spirituall meate and the corporall meate, namely that it was one thing when it was first set before them, that is corporall meate, and an other thing which was giuen by their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, namely spirituall meate. The same substance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, it is spirituall meate that before was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall meate: as in baptisme the same substaunce of water remayning, it is a spirituall lauer, that before was a corporall lauer. This is the greate diuinitie of <hi>aliud</hi> and <hi>aliud.</hi> But I maruell that Maister Heskins, which seeth such high mysteries, in <hi>aliud,</hi> can not see that Cyprian saith, they did eate of the same breade before, after the visible forme, which they did afterward eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerted into spirituall meate, so that it was the same breade before and after, although it had nowe a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14727:56"/>
newe vertue giuen it by the wordes of Christ, to nourish the whole man, which before nourished only the body.</p>

                     <hi>And Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech king of Salem brought foorth bread and wine, and he was a Priest of the highest God, and blessed Abraham.

For who is more the priest of the highest God then our Lord Iesus Christ, which offered vp a sacrifice to God his father</hi>

with faithfull Abraham. Wherevpon in the Gospell we find that many are raised vp of stones, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sonnes of Abraham are gathered of the Gentiles. And when the Lord praised Zacheus, he answered and saide, This day is saluation happened to this house, bicause this man is also made the sonne of Abraham. <hi>Therefore that in Genesis the blessing about Abraham might duely be celebrated by Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech the priest, the image of the sacrifice goeth before, ordeined in bread and wine.</hi>

In cyting this place, note what falshood M. Heskins vseth: first of all he leaueth out the beginning, where Cyprian calleth the supper, the sacrament of the Lordes sacrifice, by which it is plaine what he meaneth, when he calleth it afterward, an oblation or sacrifice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he falsifieth his wordes, where Cyprian saith, <hi>Fuit autem sacerdos,</hi> that is, and he was a Priest, Maister Heskins chaungeth it into <hi>Fuit enim sacerdos,</hi> for hee was a Priest. Thirdly, where Cyprian compareth Christ to Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech in three thinges distinctly, in that he was the Priest of the highest GOD, in that he offered breade and wine, and in that hee blessed Abraham, shewing, that Christe was the Prieste of the highest GOD, when hee offered his sacrifice to his father, meaning in his passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee offered breade and wine as he did, meaning in his supper: and last of all, that he blessed his people as Melchisedech did Abraham. Maister Heskins confoundeth the first with the second, by putting out the interrogatiue point, that is after <hi>obtulit,</hi> and ioyning the next sentence to it, and the last he omitteth, by cutting off the dicourse that Cyprian maketh thereof. As though Cyprian had spoken of no resemblance of Melchisedech vnto Christe, but in offering bread and wine, as he before saide most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously, that the execution of that Priesthoode lay onely therein.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs looke to his collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s out of this place. <hi>First that Melchisedech was a figure of Christ.</hi> That shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Where is then the breade that the mysterie might bee fullie signified? Is it not that which he calleth the tradition of the Gospell which is in foure bookes? I dispute not howe well he applyeth these thinges, but it is more then manifest, that he speaketh so figuratiuely, that no argument can be fastened of his wordes, for the carnal presence. And whereas M. Heskins shrinketh in his hornes about the oblation of bread and wine, saying <hi>it was not bare breade, but he sheweth what bread it was.</hi> Let him aunswere me plainly, if he dare for his eares.

After the order: that is, thou shalt not be a priest according

to the sacrifices of the Iewes: but thou shalt be a prieste after the order of Melchisedech: For as Melchisedech kinge of Salem of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered breade and wine: so shalt thou offer thy bodie and thy bloud, true bread and true wine. This Melchisedech hath giuen vs these mysteries which we haue. He it is that hath saide, he that shall eate my fleshe and drinke my bloude.

But nowe let vs see howe M. Heskins insulteth vppon vs, for this counterfete Hieronyme. First that he taketh vpon him to expound, that which was left vnexpounded by the Apostle to the Hebrues, namely that Christ was a prieste, which is altogether false, for the Apostle doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speake of his eternall priesthood, but also of his one oblation, by which hee purchased eternall redemption. And although this writer doth refer his order to the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of his sacrifice in bread and wine, yet both the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the psalme, and the Apostle to the Hebrues doe sufficiently declare, that the excellencie of Melchisedechs order doth consiste in this, that he was both a Kinge and a Priest, and so a liuely figure of the reall priesthoode of our sauiour Christ.</p>

                        </gap>h, and when he had liued so many yeres, he made an ende of his life. Euen so also he sayth of Seth and Enos with other. As for the beginning of the generation of Melchizedech, and the ende of his life he ouerpasseth it in silence. Wherefore, if the historie bee looked on, he hath neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life. So in deede the sonne of God neither hath beginning of his being, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall haue ending. Therefore in these most great and verie diuine things was Melchizedech a figure of Christ our Lord. And in his priesthood, which agreeth rather to man then to God, our Lord Christ was an high Priest after the order of Melchizedech. For Melchizedech was an high Priest of the Gentiles. And our Lord Christ offered a holy and healthfull sacrifice for all men.</hi> If I sayde neuer a word (as I neede not to say many) yet the indifferent reader would see, that here is no comparison of Melchizedechs bread and wine with the sacrament of the Lordes supper. Yea, he would easily see, that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the sacrifice of his death which our sauiour offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all men, both Iewes and Gentiles. And much more plainly by that place which M. Heskins addeth out of the first dialogue. <hi>If therefore it appertaineth to Priestes to offer giftes, and Christ concerning his humanitie is called a Priest, he offered none other sacrifice but his owne bodie.</hi> This spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Theodoret expressely of the true sacrifice of his death, and not of the fained sacrifice of his supper, nor yet of any sacrament or figure of his onely true sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which the olde writers (as I shewed before) do often call a sacrifice, oblation, burnt offring, &amp;c: But that M. Heskins cannot gaine by the doctours wordes, he will winne by reason. First, if wee denye that Melchizedech was a figure of Christe his Priesthood, saying, he was a figure onely of his eternitie, then wee ioyne with Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who graunted the diuinitie of Christe, and denyed his humanitie, vnto which his priesthood properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14727:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But who tolde M. Heskins, that wee denye Melchizedech to be a figure of Christs Priesthood? when wee most constantly affirme, that he was a figure of his eternall Priesthood, vnlesse Maister Heskins thinke the humanitie of Christe, hauing once conquered death, is not nowe euerlasting. It is not our exposition, that mainteineth the heresie of Eutyches, that the nature of Christes bodie is absorpt into the diuinitie, but it is your heresie of vbiquitie and carnall presence (Maister Heskins) that mayntaineth it most manifestly in verie deede, though in wordes you will say the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Heskins followeth his reason, and vrgeth vs, that it is the office of a Priest to offer sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if Christe resemble Melchizedech in Priesthood, he must resemble him in sacrifice, and that is the sacrifice of breade and wine, for other sacrifice wee reade none that Melchizedech offered. I aunswere, as wee reade of none other, so wee read not in the Scripture one worde of that sacrifice of breade and wine, as hath beene often declared at large. And seeing the scripture expresseth not what sacrifice Melchizedech offered, wee are content to be ignorant of it, satisfying our selues with so much as the scripture affirmeth, that Christ offering him selfe once for all on the Crosse, was in the same called a Priest for euer after the order of Melchizedech, as wee haue shewed at large before out of Hebr. 5. &amp; 7.9.10.</p>
                  <p>But it is a sport to see, how M Heskins skippeth to &amp; fro, as it were one whipped at a stake, when hee woulde reconcile his transubstantiation, with this counterfet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of breade and wine. <hi>Christe sacrificed in breade and wine. In breade and wine I say, a kinde of foode more excellent then the breade and wine that did figure it, I meane with Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret and Hierome the true bread and wine, that is the bodie and bloud of Christ, that is to say, no bread nor wine.</hi> But if you giue him a lash on the other side, and saye: if Christ sacrificed not naturall bread &amp; wine, then he answered not your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, he wil leap to the other side, &amp; say with Cyprian, &amp;

Isychius, that Christe offered the selfe same thing that Melchizedech did, and in one place he sayeth, he occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread and wine in his sacrifice: so did he a table and a cuppe, and other things, but was any thing his sacrifice that he occupyed therein, sauing onely that which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? he will say no. Did he offer bread and wine? hee dare not aunswer directly, and so the poore man to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde two lyes, the one contrarie to the other, is misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tormented.</p>

But this is not the sacrifice of the masse, but the sacrifice of CHRISTES death, whereof the holy sacrament is a memoriall.</p>
                  <p>But Augustine saith farther: <hi>The sacrifice of Aaron is taken away, and them beganne the order of Melchizedech.</hi> Very well, but once againe this sacrifice is the sacrifice of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes death, the remembraunce whereof is celebrated in the Lordes Supper: where let the Reader obserue, that he doeth yet againe denie the sacrifice of Christes passion, to be a sacrifice, after the order of Melchizedech, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the expresse worde of God; &amp; affirmeth that it was after the order of Aaron, saying, that <hi>The sacrifice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchizedech, was onely as the Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here note that he maketh the sacrament more excellent then the sacrifice of Christes death, by so muche, as the Priesthoode, and sacrifice of Melchisedech, is more excellent then the sacrifice, and priesthoode of Aaron.

Therefore he chaunged his countenance in the priesthoode, and left the nation of the Iewes, and came to the Gentiles.</hi> By this we must needes vnderstand, that Christe did institute a sacrifice of his body and bloud, after the order of Melchizedech. Yea verily. But howe doe wee vnderstand, that this was in the sacrament? Therefore for any thing that is here shewed, it is no slaunder that the Pope hath turned the holy sacrament into a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to obscure the glorie of Christe, and his onely sacrifice, once offered on the crosse. For although the Fathers did sometimes call the sacrament, a sacrifice, yet they meant nothing but a memoriall, or sacrifice of

thankesgiuing, for that one sacrifice, offered once, on the crosse for the redemption of the whole worlde. Whereof none other shalbe a better witnesse, then Augustine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and in his exposition of this selfe same Psalme: <q>

                     <q>Was not Christe once onely offered vppe by himselfe? And yet in a sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely at euery solemnitie of Easter, but euerie day he is offered for the people, neither doeth he lye, which being asked the question answereth that he is offered. For if sacraments had not a certeine similitude of those thinges, whereof they are sacramentes, they should not be sacramentes at all. And of this similitude oftentimes they take the names euen of the very thinges themselues. Therfore, as after a certeine maner the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, is the body of Christ, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bloud of Christ is the bloud of Christ: so the sacrament of faith is faith. What can be vttered more plainely, either against the Popishe sacrifice, or against their carnal presence?</q> This one place may expound what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in Augustine, or any other olde writer is spoken of the sacrifice of the Lordes supper, and of the presence of Christes body and bloud therein.</p>
                  <p>After Augustine M. Heskins citeth Chrysostome in Mat. 26. to proue that the sacrament is now of the same force that it was, when it was first ordeined by Christe at his last supper. <hi>These workes are not of mans power, what thinges he did then in that supper, he himselfe doth nowe worke, he himselfe doeth make perfect. We holde the order of Ministers, but it is he himselfe, that doeth sanctifie and chaunge these thinges. With my disciples (saith he) doe I keepe my Passeouer. For this is the same table, and none other. This is in nothing lesser then that. For Christ maketh not that table, and some other man this, but he himselfe maketh both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hieronyme followeth a vaine discourse, against, I wote not what Petrobrusians, and Henricians, that denied the body of CHRISTE to be consecrated, and giuen by the priestes, as it was by Christe him selfe: Whome peraduenture <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis,</hi> Maister Heskins Author, doeth slaunder, when they saide none otherwise, then Chrysostome saide before, and that which Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins himselfe affirmeth, <hi>That Christ and not man doth conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate:</hi> But by this place also are confuted the Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14727:63"/>
and Caluinistes, if we will beleeue Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins: who first rauing against Cranmer, vrgeth the worde of sanctification of the bread and wine, that Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome vseth, charging Cranmer to haue saide, that the creatures of bread and wine cannot be sanctified. Which no doubt, that holy Martyr spake of the substance, and not of the vse in the sacrament. Then he snatcheth vppe Chrysostomes wordes, <hi>Transmutat, he doeth transmute, and change them.</hi> This is easily aunswered. He chaungeth the vse, but not the substance.

And though you adde to Ambrose his phrase <hi>De pane fit corpus Christi, of the bread is made the body of Christ,</hi> yet the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of spirituall receiuing, which both Origen and Ambrose doe at large testifie, (as in due place hath and shall be more declared) doeth take away your grosse imagination. And that you doe not reiect the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall receiuing in the sacrament, you doe well: but you doe fondely, when you oppose it against reall recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, where you should say corporall or carnall, for <hi>Spiritus</hi> &amp; <hi>Res</hi> be not opposite, but <hi>Spiritus</hi> &amp; <hi>Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And here I would haue the Readers to note, how Maister Heskins confesseth, that <hi>The receiuing of Christe really,</hi> (whiche is all that he striueth for) <hi>profiteth not, without the receiuing of him spiritually.</hi> But it is certeine by the scripture, that the spirituall receiuing profiteth without that, which he calleth the real receiuing. For Christ doth dwell in our hearts by faith. And whereas he saith <hi>No man can receiue Christ spiritually, which beleeueth not that he receiueth him really:</hi> I demaund of him, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and such as dye without the participation of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14727:63"/>
may not receiue Christe spiritually, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of him corporally? He must needes answere, yea, or else by Christes word they haue no part of eternal life: and then his assertion is false. If I should obiect the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the olde testament, who did all eate Christ spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, before he had a naturall body, perhaps he would answere, that he speaketh of men in these dayes. But seing the Apostle 1. Cor. 10. saith, they receiued the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meat and drinke that we do, euen Christ, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that Christ both now &amp; then is eaten spiritually on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not carnally.</p>
                  <p>To match with Augustine, for default of a Lorde of the higher house, he bringeth in Damascene a Burgesse of the lower house, whose authoritie although I do little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme, yet will I set downe his wordes, that you may see, how little helpe he hath out of them, but by racking and wresting. <hi>Melchisedech with bread &amp; wine did receiue Abraham returning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the slaughter of the stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers,</hi>

                     <hi>which was a priest of the highest God. That table did prefigurate this mysticall table, as that priest bare the figure and image of Christ the true priest. Thou art (saith he) a priest after the order of Melchisedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First Damascene is plaine, that Melchisedech did not offer bread and wine, but he did entertain Abraham ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with at his table, &amp; that Melchisedechs feast was a figure of Christes feast, but not of his sacrifice, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controuersie. But you shal see how M. Heskins set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his words on the tenter, to stretch them to a sacrifice. <hi>I wold that the aduersarie did note, that the table of Melchisedech, which al men of learning do know, is taken for the sacrifice.</hi> Who shall be able to stand before M. Heskins, which hath the iudgement of all men of learning on his side? Yea and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>S. Paule taketh it so: ye cannot be partakers of the table of God, and the table of diuels also, that is, of that which was offered to God, &amp; of that which was offred to diuels.</hi> O lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>! But he must remember that S. Paul repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the Corinthians for offring sacrifice to the idols, but for sitting downe at the feastes, in whiche that meate that had bene offered was eaten. So that a table is still a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14727:64"/>
table, and for a feast, not for a sacrifice. The conclusion of this chap, if he durst openly vtter it, containeth a most dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable blasphemie: namely, that euery hedge Priest, that saith Masse, is a Priest after the order of Melchisedech. As though Christs Priesthood could not be perpetual, except it were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued by succession of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greasie order of shaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, wheras it is expresly said Heb. 7. that his Priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech, resteth only in his owne person, bicause he liueth for euer, and that it can not passe by succession. Vpon which place (to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter) and the Papists own graunt, I will reason thus. Christs Priesthoode after the order of Melchisedech, resteth in his owne person, and passeth not by succession: The Popish Priesthood consisting in the sacrifice of bread and wine, is continued in the world by succession: therfore the Popish Priesthood consisting in the sacrifice of breade &amp; wine, is not the Priesthood of Christ after the order of Melchisedech.</p>

of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning &amp; euening oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was vtterly taken away in act, as it ceassed in effect, when our sauiour Christe by his true sacrifice had taken away all figuratiue oblations. For as Hierom saith very well, whatsoeuer was afterward sacrificed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnbeleuing Iewes in the temple, <hi>was not the sacrifice of God, but the worship of the diuel.</hi> But notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standing this, M.

But he is fowly beguyled, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sarazens or Mahumetans offer sacrifice for the dead, after the maner of the Gentiles. And where this Peter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no Pagans, but such as dwell farthest in the North, it seemeth he hath not heard of so many nations as in all quarters be discouered to be Idolaters, especially those of Calechut, who beside the bloud of a cocke which they sacrifice to the Idole of the diuel, do offer vnto it all meat that the king eateth. Wherfore the conclusion of P. Cluniacensis is a very vain &amp; foolish collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as M.

For from the rising of the sunne, vntill the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in euerie place incense shall bee offered vnto my name, and a pure offering: For my name is great among the heathen.</hi> This text (saith M. Heskins) hath greatly tormented the protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: for they wrest it into diuerse senses, because it proueth inuincibly the sacrifice of the masse.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Oecolampadius expoundeth this sacrifice of the obedience of all nations, to the faith: Bucer, of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14727:66"/>
faith and the confession of the same: Bullinger, of the land and prayse of God: Vrbanus Rhegius, of mortification and inuocation of Gods name. Al which M. Heskins him selfe that firste cryeth out of their discord, confesseth to agre in this, that they vnderstand the prophesie of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall sacrifice of prayse and thanksgiuing. But these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall expositions, he saith, cannot stande. And why so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forsooth because these spiritual sacrifices be not new, but were offered by the godly, euen since Abel, who (he saith) was the first that offered sacrifice to God, and that of the fruites of the earth: whereas it is not to be thought, that Adam offered no sacrifice al that time before: and the text is plaine, that Abell offered the fruit of his cattell. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the spirituall worship of God is not newe, yet it was newe to the Iewes, that the father shoulde bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped from the time of Christ, neither in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim nor at Ierusalem, but of all nations in spirite and trueth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> that is, without all externall and figuratiue sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. An other reason is of the purenesse of the newe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, aboue the olde. For the olde sacrifices were pure by participation, the newe is pure by nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing else but the bodie of Christe. But by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the prophet in calling the newe sacrifice pure, doeth not charge the old with imperfection, if they had been offered according to their institution, but reproueth the priestes, that they had polluted the Lords sacrifices, with their couetousnes and hypocrisie, and in punishment of their pride (which thought God could not bee serued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were by them) threateneth that he will reiect them and the people that were partakers of their sinnes, and set vp the spirituall pure worship of his name, among the Gentils in all partes of the worlde, which shoulde better please God (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophete saith) then a bullock that hath hornes &amp; hooffes. And as for the purenes that M. Heskins requireth in the new sacrifices, wee haue a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the holy Ghost Heb. 13. that by Iesus Christ wee offer the sacrifice of prayse always to God, that is, the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the lippes which confesseth his name, doeing good
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14727:66"/>
and not forgetting to distribute, for with such sacrifices God is pleased. By which place you may see that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the godly before rehearsed, are grounded vpon the word of God, and not the deuise or imagination of man. It is meruell y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> M. Heskins (as the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papistes do in this place) doth not builde much vppon the worde <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14727:67"/>
pillerie for an impudent counterfeiter, then to sit in the Parleament house among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles of Christ and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy doctors of the Church. If there were nothing else to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him, but the title that he giueth himselfe, it were sufficient to prooue him a shamelesse forger. <hi>Martialis Apostolus Christi,</hi> he tearmeth himselfe (in the Diuels name) as though the scripture had not defined both of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and of the calling of the Apostles.

Heskins confesseth, that hee is not to be suspected of truth, therby insinuating that his Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, was not so honest, but that his credite might come in question. But Irenaeus lib. 4. Chapter 32. writeth thus: <hi>Sed &amp; suis discipulis dans consilium &amp;c. But also giuing counsell to his disciples, to offer the firste fruites vnto God of his owne creatures, not as to one hauing neede, but that they might be neither vnfruitefull nor vnthankefull: he tooke that bread which is of the creature, and gaue thankes, saying, this is my bodie: and likewise the cup which is of the same creature that is with vs, hee confesseth to bee his bloude, and taught the newe oblation of the newe Testament, whiche the Church receiuing of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, offereth to GOD in all the world, to him which giueth food vnto vs, the first fruites of his owne giftes in the new Testament, of which Malachias amonge the twelue Prophetes hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed: I haue no pleasure in you, (saith the LORD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie) and I will receiue no sacrifice at your handes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here M. Heskins I knowe not for what subtiltie, had translated verie absurdly <hi>primitias munerum suorum,</hi> the firste fruite of his sacrifices. But to the matter. What can bee more playne, then that Irenaeus speaketh here of the sacrifice of obedience and thankesgiuing, celebrated in the sacrament of the Lordes supper?</p>

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:14727:67"/>For he sheweth the end of the institution to be, that they should neither be vnfruitefull nor vnthankfull, which oblation the Church obserueth throughout all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, according to the Prophesie of Malachie, in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lordes supper, although not onely therein.

                  <p>First we must see how M. Heskins note booke decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him: for where the words of Augustin in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this sentence are these: <hi>Locus enim vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is not the first corruption that we haue bewrayed by a great many. Nowe to the matter Maister Heskins still harpeth vpon one string, that the sacrifice in this saying spoken of cannot be the sacrifice of praise and thankesgiuing, because that is not peculiar to the Christians, but was offered of the Iewes before Christe, and may be yet, if they be conuerted. But I haue more than once or twise declared, that here is no such peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the matter of the offering, but in the maner of the oblation. And Augustine speaketh not halfe a worde, by which we might deeme, that he refuseth the spirituall sacrifice of the Christians to be the pure sacrifice prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in Malachie. If you vrge that he sayeth, it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the order of Melchisedech, and so hath relation to the offering of breade and wine in the Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be no necessarie conclusion: yet Augustin him selfe will tell vs, that it is a spiritual sacrifice of laude and thanksgiuing.

be handled with feare, and reuerence of Gods Maiestie, vnto whom they apperteine: he will needes haue it the body of Christ, and first, he alledgeth a saying of Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, whom he falsely calleth the disciple of Saint Paule, although he be a writer of good antiquitie: Eccle.

Now therefore the word of the Lorde is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly spoken to the Priestes of the Iewes, which offer the blinde and lamue, and feeble, to be sacrificed, that they might knowe that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sacrifices, should succeede those carnall sacrifices. And not the bloud of bulles and goates, but an incense, that is to say, the prayers of the Sainctes should be offered to the Lord: and that not in one prouince of the world Iewry, neither in Ierusalem one citie of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but in euery place an oblation is offered: was vncleane, as of the people of Israel, but cleane, as in the ceremonies of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Doest thou not maruell (Gentle Reader) that Maister Heskins alledgeth this place, which in euerie point is so directly contrarie to his purpose? He saith that among the ceremonies of the Christians, none can be properly called the cleane sacrifice, but the sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christ. O shamelesse begger, that craueth no lesse then the whole controuersie to be giuen him! And that contrarie to Hierome, whose name he abuseth, which expoundeth this place of spirituall sacrifices, and more expressely of the prayers of the saintes, whiche are not vsed in one, but in all the ceremonies of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But to set some colour vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, he bringeth in an other saying of Hierome, which is written before this in exposition of another place, perteining nothing to this prophecy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure sacrifice: but wher by analogie or like reason, (as the prophet rebuketh the priestes of the Iewes) he doeth reprehend also the Bishops, Elders, and Deacons of the Church for their negligence: <hi>Offertis inquit &amp;c. You offer, saith he, vpon mine altar bread polluted. We pollute the bread, that is to say the body of Christ, when we come vnworthily to the altar, and we beeing filthie doe drinke cleane bloud, and say the Lordes table is contemptible, &amp;c.</hi> Here forsooth, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the body of Christ is, the sacrifice of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, yea, but according to the former sentence, so offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14727:70"/>
that it is a spirituall sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But what else? <hi>Here we are taught that we doe not take one thing: videlicet bread, and do iniurie to another thing, that is the body and bloud of Christ, as the sacramentaries say, but receiuing the very body and bloud of Christ we do iniury to the same.</hi> But vouchsafe to heare the same teacher, speaking of the same matter, and in the same place, in fewe wordes to satisfie the reasonable, and to stoppe the mouthes of quarrellers. <q>
                        <hi>Dum enim sacramenta violantur, ipse cuius sunt sacramenta vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur.</hi> For while iniurie is done to the sacramentes, iniurie is done to him whose sacraments they are. He sheweth a reason against them that demaunded proudly, wherein they had polluted God, when they had but polluted his sacraments?</q> Leauing therefore Hierome at open warre with M. Heskins, I will passe to Damascen, who for lacke of a Greeke auncient Baron, beeing an auncient burgesse of the lower house, Maister Heskins, is bolde to matche with Hironyme, though farre inferiour to him in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and credite, whose wordes are these:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>This is that pure and vnbloudy sacrifice, which our Lord speaketh by the Prophet to be offred to him, from the rising of the sunne, to the going downe of the same, namely the body and bloud of Christ, vnto the vnconsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and vncorrupted establishment of our body and soule, not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into secesse, (God forbid, that any such imagination should be) but it is a purgation of al manner filth, and a reparation of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hurt, vnto our sustentation, and conseruation.</hi> This place saith Maister Heskins is so plaine, that a childe may perceiue it: for it is sufficient for him, if he heare once bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud named. Howbeit, if either Damascens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie were of weight, or the corruption of the time in which he liued vnknowen, there is nothing, in this saying, which might not easily, and without any wresting, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the spirituall sacrifices, &amp; to the spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sacrificing the body and bloud of Christ, which we haue learned out of the elder fathers.</p>

But whereas he is so loftie once againe, to ioyne issue with the proclaymer, &amp; that as he hath done alwayes hitherto, vpon the negatiue, I will not refuse him. And yet by the way I must admonish the Reader, how vnreasonably he dealeth, that ioyneth all his issues vpon the negatiue, whiche sometime is harde, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is vnpossible to be proued, whereas the Bishop, whom he calleth the proclaimer, ioyneth issue with them vpon the affirmatiue, which if euer it was holden, is more probable to finde proofe in antiquitie. Whereas if I might haue libertie to ioyne vpon the negatiue, I would bring in fiue hundreth propositions, that are false, and yet neuer a one expressely denied of the olde writers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there neuer happened any controuersie aboute suche matters in their times.

                  </p>
                  <p>First here he reiecteth the authoritie of the Apostle to the Hebrues, saying, it is but wrested, which is as direct, as nothing in the worlde can be more direct, that Christ offered himselfe, and that but once, and by that one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath made perfect for euer, them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <q>But he shal heare Chrysostome vpon the same scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Hebr. 10. <hi>Aufer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> primum, vt sequens statuat, &amp;c.</hi> He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the former, that he might establish that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che followeth. Beholde againe the aboundance. This sacrifice sayeth he, is but one, but those sacrifices are many: for therefore they were not strong, because they were many. But tell me what need is there of many,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14727:71"/>
when one is sufficient? Therefore whereas they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and alwayes offered, he sheweth, that they were neuer purged. For as a medicine when it is strong and effectuall to giue health, and able to driue away, all sicknesse, being but once laide to, worketh the whole at once. If therfore being but once laide to it hath wrought the whole, it she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the vertue thereof, in that it is not laid to any more: &amp; this is the effect of it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is laid on no more but once. But if it be always laid to, it is a manifest token, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed nothing. For this is the vertue of that medicine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is but once laid on, and not oftentimes: euen so in this case. By what meanes were they always healed, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same sacrifices? For if they had ben deliuered from al their sins, there should not haue bene offered sacrifice throughout euery day. For they were appointed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways offred for al the people, both at euening &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day. Therfore, that was an accusation of sinns, not a discharge: for ther was made an accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of weaknes, not a shewing of strength. For bicause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first sacrifice was of no force, the second was likewise offered, &amp; bicause that also profited nothing, an other was offered also: wherefore this is but a conuiction of sinnes. For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were offered, there is a conuiction of sinnes, but in that they were always offred, there is a conuiction of infirmitie But contrariwise in Christ, the sacrifice was but once offered. For what neede was there of medicines, when there is no more wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining? For this cause, you wil say, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that it should always be offered, bicause of infirmitie, that there might be also a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of sinnes: What then do we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Doe we not offer euery day? we offer truely, but for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce which we make of his death, and this is but one sacrifice, not many. Howe is it one and not many? Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was offered but once, and it was offered in the holy of holies: but this sacrifice is an exemplar of that, we offer the same alwayes. For we do not nowe offer one lamb, to morrowe an other, but the same thing alwayes. Therfore this sacrifice is but one. For else by this reason, bicause it is offred in many places, are ther many Christs?</q>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:14727:72"/>
No, but one Christ is euery where, both here being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and there being perfect, euen one body. For as he which is euery where is one bodie, and not many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: so also it is one sacrifice. And hee is our highe Priest, which offered the sacrifice which purged vs: the same do we also offer nowe, which then truely being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, can not be consumed. Howbeit, that which we doe nowe, is done truely, in the remembraunce of that which was done then. For this do ye (saith he) in remembraunce of me. We make not an other sacrifice as the high Priest, but alwayes the same, but rather we worke the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the same. This place of Chrysostome sheweth, both that the Church neither doth, nor may offer the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ in such sort as the Papistes say, that is really and carnally, and for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead: and also howe the Church is saide to offer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christes body, namely, when she celebrateth the remembrance thereof.</p>
                  <p>After this holy issue ioyned, M. Heskins rayleth vpon Cranmer, which in his first booke hath not one Doctour or Counsel to alledge, but only a litle false descant vpon a scripture or two, as the proclamer in his Sermon. What reading Cranmer and Iewell, were able to shewe in the Doctours and Counsels, is so well testified by their owne learned workes vnto the world, that it can not by such an obscure doctour as M. Hesk. is, be blemished or darkned.</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins hath such store of testimonies for the sacrifice of the Masse, to proue that Christ is offred therin, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beside those which he hath alredy cited, he wil ad three or foure to this recapitulation. First he nameth Iustinus Martyr, in his dialogue against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes. Where he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his wordes truncatly, leauing out the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which declareth that Iustine maketh all Christians Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and offerers of the sacrifice of thankesgiuing in the celebration of the Lordes supper. His wordes are these. <q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:14727:72"/>

                        </gap>. Euen so we which by the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>susas al (shal be one man in God the maker of al things) hauing put off our filthy garments, that is, our sinnes, by the name of his first begotten sonne, and being set on fire by the word of his calling, are a right kinde of high priests of God, as God himself doth witnes, <hi>That in al places among the Gentiles, acceptable &amp; pure sacrifices are offred to him.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>But God receiueth no sacrifice of any but of his Priestes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God before hand doth testifie, that he doth accept all them that offer by this name the sacrifices, which Iesus Christe hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be made, that is in the Eucharistie or thankesgiuing of the bread and the cuppe, which are done in euery place of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> By these words it appeareth not, that Christ was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but thankesgiuing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, not of the priest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but by all Christians. And yet more plainely in the wordes of his, that are in the same Dialogue: <q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And as concerning those sacrifices which are offered to him of vs Gentiles in euery place, that is of the breade of thankesgiuing, and the cup likewise of thankesgiuing, hee foresheweth saying, that we do glorifie his name, and that you do prophane it. In which saying what can we see, but the sacrifice of thankesgiuing in the bread and cup?</q> And to proue that the Church hath none other sacrifice but of prayers and thankesgiuing, he saith within few lines after the place cited by M. Heskins; <q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. For I my selfe do affirme, that prayers and thankesgiuing made by worthie persons, are the only perfect and acceptable sacrifices to God. For these are the only sacrifices that Christians haue receiued to make, to be put in minde by their drie and moyst nourishment, of the passion which God the son of God is recorded to haue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14727:73"/>
suffered for them.</q> This place doth not onely shewe, what the only sacrifice of Christians was in his time, but also teacheth, that in the sacrament is drie and moyst nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, bread and drinke, not bare accidents as the transubstantiators affirme. How little Iustinus maketh for the sacrifice of the Masse, these places doe sufficiently declare.</p>
                  <p>The second place hee citeth, is out of Hierom in his booke of Hebrue questions. <hi>Quod autem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As when Hierom calleth this offering of bread and wine a mysterie, euery indifferent reader may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that he speaketh not properly in calling it the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christe, and a sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christe. But as to a sicke man of the ague, all drinkes seeme bitter, so to a popish heretique, all say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Doctours seeme popish and hereticall.</p>
                  <p>The third place he alledgeth, it is out of Ambrose his preparatiue prayer to Masse, I will not vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse it, bicause it is a meere bastard and counterfet wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, out of which it is cyted, hauing as much of S.

If any man will obiect, that then I must bring arguments to disproue it, or else I may likewise denye any authenticall writer: I answere, it were too long to do in this shortnesse that I must vse, and not necessarie, when they are notorious and well knowne already to euery man of meane reading in the Doctors, and Erasmus in

Heskins in these wordes, <hi>The sacrifice that is offered to God by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, our Lorde and maister Christ did first institute, when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Apostles his bodie and bloude, before hee was betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is redd in the Gospell: Iesus tooke the bread and the cup and blessing them gaue the same vnto them.</hi> Here beside the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all phrase of sacrifice (which we haue often declared what it did signifie, and whence it came) is nothing to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell at. For Isydore ment no doubt, the spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of thankesgiuing, which is offered in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords supper, &amp; not the propitiatorie sacrifice of the popish masse, of which scarce the foundations were begonne to be laide in his time, of certaine odde stones of vnproper speach, and licentious phrases of sacrifices and oblations.</p>
                  <p>As for Haymo and Cabasila, I will neuer trouble my self to examine their speaches, they are but late writers, &amp; therefore of small credite in these causes. And whereas M. Heskins glorieth that he hath aunswered foure mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the proclamation in this booke: the scriptures in the vulgar tongue, the reseruation of the sacrament, the offering of Christe to his father, and the presence of his bodie and bloude in the sacrament: let the iudgement reste with the indifferent readers, whether although hee hath some of the lower house to fauour his billes, &amp; more might haue, if hee woulde aske their voyces, yet I haue proued by this short aunswere, that of the higher house, he hath not one that hath giuen a voyce with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but many that haue spoken directly against them.</p>

For first to giue vs a tast what synceritie and trueth he will vse in the rest of this booke, the verie first sentence he alleadgeth out of any Doctor, is corruptly and vntruly rehearsed.

We doe not take it incongruently, that this impediment in their eies was of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Iesus shold not be knowen, but only it was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Christ for their doubtfull faithes sake, vntill they came to the sacrament of bread, that the vnitie of Christs body being partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, it might be perceiued, that the impediment of the enimie was remoued, that Christ might be knowen.</hi> In this place beside y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he turneth <hi>autem</hi> into <hi>enim,</hi> and leaueth out <hi>factum</hi> after <hi>fuisse,</hi> he addeth of his owne <hi>propter eorum fidem ambiguam, for their doubtfull faiths sake.</hi> Which words are not Augustins. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth that hee redde not this place out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine himselfe, but followed some other mans col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection as he doth almost euerie where. But Augustine in that place comparing the wordes of Marke and Luke together, sheweth that there was no alteration in the shape of Christes bodie, but onely that the two disciples eyes were helde, that they could not knowe him, but in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread which signified the vnity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church.

But what saith Theophylact of the same? <hi>Another thing also is here insum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, namely that, that their eyes which take this blessed bread are opened that they may knowe him. For the fleshe of our Lorde, hath a great and vnspeakable strength.</hi> What is there here in these authorities, either for M. Heskins bil of the reall presence, or for his fond allegorie? It pleaseth him excedingly, that Theophylact saith the flesh of Christ is of vnspeakeable power, which we doe most willingly admitte, &amp; euen in receiuing of the sacrament, it worketh mightily, but hee will not see at all, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Theophylact with Augustine, calleth the sacrament blessed bread, by which they both do shew, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance of bread remaineth, although it be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp; consecrated vnto an other vse then for bodily food.</p>

                     </note>The summe of this literal exposition is this, that three sundry breades are mentioned by Christe in this sixte of Iohn, that is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread Manna, the bread the sonne of God, and the bread the flesh of Christ, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these three breads are distincted both in nature and in time, in whiche they were giuen. For Manna was a corporall food giuen of old time in the wildernes. The second bread, the godhead of Christ, being an eternall and spirituall substance, Christ
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14727:75"/>
saith his father doth giue, in the present tence, and that he is the bread of life, and requireth beleefe in him which is proper to God onely. The third breade, is the fleshe of Christ, which he will giue for the life of the world, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the future tence, and is meant of the sacrament. And this he dare auouch, to be the natiue &amp; true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this scripture. But sauing his authoritie, there are but two breades spoken of in this Chapter, namely Manna, and the bread of life, which is not the diuinitie of Christ separated from his flesh, nor his flesh separated or distincted from his godhead, but euen his quickening &amp; spiritual flesh, which being vnited to his eternal spirit, was by the same giuen for the life of the world, not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, but in the sacrifice of his bodie &amp; bloud on the crosse, and is daily sealed and testified vnto vs by the sacrament of his bodie and bloud ministred according to his holie institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this I dare auouch to be the true &amp; natiue sense of this scripture, both by the plain circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stances of the same, and by the iudgement of the best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued ancient writers. And first to take away as wel the vain supposed distinction of time, in which the two later breads are said to be giuen, as also to proue that they are but one bread: our sauior Christ him selfe after he hath promised to giue the bread, which is his flesh, for the life of the world, and declared what fruite commeth to them that eate his fleshe, and drinke his bloude, &amp;c. in the 58. verse he concludeth and sayeth plainly: that it is the same breade that came downe from heauen, and that who so eateth of this breade, shall liue eternally. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the promise of giuing his flesh, is not to be restrayned to the giuing of the sacrament: his wordes are plaine, that he will giue his fleshe for the life of the worlde, which all true Christians will acknowledge to haue beene perfourmed in the sacrifice of his death, and not at his last supper. Finally, that his flesh must not bee separated from his spirit, nor his spirit from his flesh, he doth as plainly teach vs, when he affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> except
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14727:76"/>
we eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, we haue no life in vs. For neither the flesh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but as it is made quickening by the spirite, neither do we participate the life of his spirite, but as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto vs by his fleshe, by which we are made fleshe of his fleshe, and bone of his bone: which holie mysterie, is liuely represented vnto vs in the blessed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And this your aduersaries confesse (Maister Heskins) not denying (as you charge them) that any one worde of that Chapter perteineth to the sacrament, but affirming the sacrament to bee a seale of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is deliuered in that Chapter, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. The iudgement of the olde writers conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this vnderstanding, shall followe afterwarde in confutation of M. Heskins vngodly and hereticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, not of the two natures in Christ, but of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the one without the other, which hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by his two last breades.</p>

I aunswere, that no such thing appeareth by these wordes of Chrysostome, otherwise then as the sacrament is a liuely representation of that his bodie, which he gaue for the life of the world.

So that not the godhead of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor his flesh alone is giuen vs as two breades, but Christ by his flesh is ioyned vnto vs as one bread of life.</q> Let vs nowe see what S. Augustine sayeth, who expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same text writeth thus: <hi>Our Lorde determineth consequently howe he calleth him selfe bread, not onely after his godhead which feedeth all things, but also after his humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is assumpted of the worde of God, when he sayeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: And the bread which I will giue is my flesh, &amp;c.</hi> Once againe M.

And once againe I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, not so, but he teacheth directly the contratie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Christe God and man to be one breade, and not two breades. And that the doctrine of this Chapter, is not to be restrained vnto the sacrament, the same Augustine in the same place teacheth abundantly, while hee maketh no mention of the Lordes supper vntill he come to the ende, and then sheweth, that the mysterie of this fleshe and bloud is represented in the supper, when it is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Church in remembrance of his death &amp; passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <q>

For the bread (sayeth he) which I will giue is my flesh, which I wil giue for the life of the world. And shewing his power, that not as a seruant, nor as one lesse them his father, he should be crucified, but voluntarily, he sayeth: I will giue my flesh for the life of the world.</hi> Note (sayth M.

Christ is saide to be bread two wayes, that is after his godhead, and after his manhood, therefore when he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14727:78"/>
had taught the manner, which is after his godhead, now doeth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so teach the manner, which is after his manhoode. For he did not say, which I do giue, but which I will giue, for he would giue it in his last supper, when thankes being giuen, he tooke bread, and brake it, and gaue it to his disciples and saide: take, eate, this is my body.</hi> M. Heskins maruelleth that the aduersaries cheekes waxe not redd for shame, to see so plaine a sentence against them. But if we knew not that Maister Heskins had beene as impudent as a frier, we might maruell, that he was not ashamed, first to alledge Euthymius, as a writer within 6. hundreth yeares after Christ, who liued about the yeare of our Lorde 1180. And secondly to make two breads of that which Euthymius saith, to be one bread after two manners. Finally, although Euthymius referred this text to the sacrament, yet saith he nothing for the carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, in as much as it is manifest, that Christ spake there of a spiritual communication of his fleshe, or else all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes are damned that receiue not the sacrament.</p>

brought to passe by the meat which he hath graunted vnto vs.</hi> He addeth also an other cause of the giuing of this mysterie: <hi>When hee would shewe foorth his loue toward vs, hee ioyned him selfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> might be vnited with the head.</hi> Finally he adioyneth a plaine place for the proclamer: <hi>I would be your brother, and for your sakes I tooke flesh and bloud with you, and by what things I was conioyned vnto you, those things againe I haue giuen vnto you.</hi> Here he triumpheth, as though the game were his, when in deede there is nothing for his purpose, but much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: For no one word of all these sentences proueth, that the sixt of Iohn must be vnderstoode of the supper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, then as it is a sacrament of that feeding and coniunction of vs with Christ, which is therein described. And wheras he argueth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the last sentence, Christ gaue vs that flesh by which he was ioined to vs, but he was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vs by very substantiall flesh, therfore he gaue vs his very substantiall flesh. I confesse it to bee most true, for he gaue his very substantiall flesh to be crucified for vs. If he vrge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue his flesh in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sacrament, although Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome saith not so in this place directly, yet the manner of the participation of his flesh must be such, as is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his coniunction with vs, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is spiritual, by which he is the head, and we the members, and yet vnited in one very substantiall flesh: therefore the manner of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his flesh in the sacrament, is also spirituall and not carnall. Maister Heskins reiecteth this participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee the fruition of the benefites of his body and bloud crucified, bycause that (saith hee) is common to all the sacraments, and not proper to this. But that the substaunce of all sacramentes is one, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the manner of dispensation of them, wee haue shewed sufficiently in the first booke, which were tedious nowe to repeate. Wherefore we must now set downe what Chrysostome speaketh of the bloud of Christe. <hi>This bloud maketh that the kinges image doth flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in vs. This bloud doth neuer suffer the beautie and nobilitie of the soule, which it doth alwayes water and nourish, to fade or waxe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14727:80"/>
faint. For bloud is not made of meate soudenly, but first it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other thing. But this bloud at the first doth water the soule, and indue it with a certaine great strength. This mysticall bloud driueth diuelles farre off, and allureth Angels and the Lorde of Angels vnto vs. For when the diuelles see the Lordes bloud in vs, they are turned to flight, but the Angels runne foorth vnto vs. This bloud being shed did wash the whole world, whereof Paule to the Hebrues doth make a long proces. This bloud did purge the secrete places, and the most holy place of all. If then the figure of it had so great power in the temple of the Hebrues, and in Aegypt, beeing sprinkled vpon the vpper postes of the doores, much more the veritie. This bloud did signifie the golden altar. Without this bloud the chiefe priest durst not goe into the inward secret places. This bloud made the priestes. This bloud in the figure purged sinnes, in which if it had so great force, if death so feared the shadowe, how much I pray thee will it feare the truth it selfe? This bloud is the health of our soules, with this bloud our soule is washed, with it she is decked, with it she is kindled. This bloud maketh our minde clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the fire, more shining then golde. The effusion of this bloud made heauen open. Truely the mysteries of the Church are woonderfull, the holy treasure house is woonderfull. From Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise a spring did runne, from thence sensible waters did flowe: from this table commeth out a spring, which powreth foorth spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall flouds.</hi> Chrysostome in these wordes doth extoll the excellencie of the bloud of Christe shed vpon the crosse, the mysterie whereof is celebrated and giuen to vs in the sacrament, and therefore hee saith, it is <hi>Mysticus sanguis</hi> mysticall bloud which wee receiue in the sacrament, which word Mysticall, M. Heskins a common falsarie, hath left out in his translation, to deceiue the vnlearned reader. Hee laboureth much to proue that Chrysostome spake in this long sentence of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sacrament, which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, for as he spake of the sacrament, so spake he of the passion of Christe, and of the sacrifices and ceremonies of the olde lawe, and all vnder one name of bloud. By which it is more then manifest, that hee vseth the name of bloud figuratiuely, and ambiguously, therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee gathered thereout, to fortifie M. Heskins
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14727:81"/>
bill of the naturall bloud of Christ to be in the challice. The honourable titles of the sacrament, proue no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation nor carnal presence in this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more then in the other.</p>
                  <p>The same Chrysostome vpon <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ad Heb. Hom.</hi> 16. she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth howe the bloud of Christ that purged the old sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; is the same which is giuen vs in the sacrament of the new testament. <q>
                        <hi>Non enim corporalis erat mundatio, sed spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp; sanguis spiritualis, Quomodo hoc? Noune ex corpore mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis? Ex corpore quidem, sed a spiritu sancto. Hoc vos sanguine non Moses, sed Christus aspersit, per verbum quod dictum est, Hic est sanguis noui testamenti, in remissionem peccarorum.</hi> For that was no corporall cleansing but spirituall, and it was spirituall bloud. Howe so? Did it not flowe out of his body? It did in deede flowe out of his body, but from the holy spirit. Not Moses but Christe did sprinkle you with this bloud, by that worde which was spoken: This is the bloud of the newe testament for the remission of sinnes.</q> Thus let Chrysostome expound him selfe, touching the mysticall or spirituall bloud of Christe, which both was offered in the old sacrifices, and nowe feedeth vs in the sacrament: if it were in the olde sacrifices naturally present, then is it so nowe, if the vertue onely was effectuall, so is it also to vs, and no neede of transubstantiation or carnall presence.</p>

This bread our Lord gaue, when he deliuered the ministerie of his body and bloud vnto his disciples, &amp; when he offered him selfe to his father on the altar of the crosse. And where he saith, for the life of the world, we may not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14727:81"/>
vnderstand it for the elementes, but for men that are signified by the name of the worlde.</hi> In these wordes Beda according to the custome of the olde writers, and the doctrine of the Church of Englande in his time, and long after, calleth the sacrament, the mysterie of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, and not otherwise. Yet M. Heskins pythely doth gather, that as he calleth the flesh of Christ on the crosse, breade, and yet it is verie flesh; so the fleshe of Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called bread, &amp; yet it is verie flesh. Alas, this is such a poore begginge of that in question, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that the fleshe of Christ is in the sacrament according to his grosse meaning, that I am ashamed to heare it. Why might he not rather reason thus? the fleshe of Christe on the crosse is called bread, and yet it is not naturally bread: euen so the bread of the sacrament is called flesh, &amp; yet it is not naturall fleshe. It is plaine that breade, in that texte of Iohn is taken figuratiuely for spirituall foode, and so the flesh and bloud of Christ on the crosse is our food, and the same is communicated to our faith in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>Cyrillus in 6. Ioan. by M. Heskins alledged, speaketh neuer a worde either of the sacrament, or of Christes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall presence therein. <hi>Antiquus ille panis, &amp;c. The old bread was onely a figure, an image and a shadowe, neither did it giue to the corruptible bodie any thing, but a corruptible nutriment for a little time. But I am that liuing and quickening breade for euer. And the breade which I will giue is my fleshe, which I will giue for the life of the worlde. Thou seest howe by little and little, he more and more openeth him selfe, and doeth set foorth this wonderfull mysterie. Hee saide, hee was the liuing and quickening breade, which shoulde make the partakers of it without corruption, and giue them immortalitie. Nowe he saith his fleshe is that breade, which hee will giue for the life of the worlde, and by which hee will quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs that are partakers of the same: for truely, the quickening nature of the WORD beeing ioyned to it by that vnspeakeable manner of vnion, maketh it quickening, and therefore this flesh doth quicken them that are partakers of it. For it casteth foorth death from them, and vtterly expelleth destruction.</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:14727:82"/>
Maister Heskins alledgeth two reasons to proue that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus speaketh of the sacrament, and neither of both worth a strawe. First, bicause he calleth it a woonderfull mysterie, as though the incarnation of Christ whereof he speaketh expresly, were not a woonderfull mysterie. Secondly, <hi>By that he saith the flesh of Christe giueth life to the partakers. For the proper partaking of Christes flesh, is in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of this holy sacrament.</hi> As though we are not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Christes flesh by faith, according to that saying of Augustine vpon the same place, <hi>Vt quid paras dentes &amp; ventrem? crede &amp; manducasti.</hi> Why doest thou prepare thy teeth and thy bellie? Beleeue and thou hast eaten &amp;c. you see it is a poore helpe that he hath out of Cyrillus, when hee speaketh neuer a woorde for his cause nor of his cause.</p>

                     </note> M. Heskins stomaketh the matter, &amp; rayleth throughout this Chapter against his aduersarie, for charging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priests with such arrogancie, as though they tooke vpon them to make God. Nowe concerning the purpose of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we agree, that God &amp; no man, Christ and not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, doth consecrate the sacrament, and make Christes bodie and bloud to be present. I might therefore passe ouer his authorities, but that out of some of them he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth also his corporall presence &amp; transubstantiation. The first is Damascen: <hi>De Orth. Fid. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Ca.</hi> 14. <hi>If thou aske now how the bread is made the bodie of Christ, and the wine and water the bloud of Christ? I also answere thee: The holy Ghost euer shadoweth, and worketh these things aboue speech and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: The bread and wine are transsumed.</hi> This place Maister Heskins noteth for a plaine place, both for the presence and for transubstantiation. If it were as plain as he would haue it, yet is Damascen but a Burgesse of the lower house, out of the compasse of the challenge. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his opinion was of the presence, certaine it is that he knew not transubstantiation, which the Greekes long after did not acknowledge. And though we take the word of transuming for changing, turning, transmuting, or transelementing, which wordes the olde writers doe sometimes vse, yet meane they not chaunge of one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance into another, but of the nature and propertie of the foode to be chaunged from corporall to spirituall and not otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Next followeth Chrysostome in 2: Tim. Ho. 2. <hi>Volo quiddam, &amp;c. I will adde a certeine thing plainely wonderfull, and maruell ye not, neither be you troubled. And what is this? The holy oblation whether Peter or Paul, or a Priest of any maner of life do offer it, is euen the same, which Christ gaue vnto his disciples, and which the priestes do now make. This hath nothing lesse then that. Why so? because men do not sanctifie it but Christ which had hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14727:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it before. For as the wordes which Christ spake are the same which the priests do now pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce so also is the oblation.</hi> Here M. Hesk. cutteth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taile of this sentence, for Chrysostoms wordes are: <hi>Ita &amp; oblatio eadem est, eadem<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> baptismi ratio est, adoe omnia in fide consistunt.</hi> So the oblation is the same, and the same reason is of baptisme, so all thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in faith. Marke here that M. Heskins conceleth that the change and consecration is the same y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in baptisme, and the thing is receiued onely by faith as in baptisme. And nothing else meaneth Chrysostome in the seconde place by M. Heskins cited, Hom. 30. <hi>de prod. The same Christ is nowe present which did beutifie that table, hee doth also consecrate this. For it is not man, which by consecration doeth make the thinges set foorth on the table, the bodie and bloude of our Lorde, but euen Christ which was crucified for vs, The wordes are spoken by the mouth of the Prieste, but by the power &amp; grace of God they are consecrated. This is (saith hee) my bodye, with this worde the thinges set foorth are consecrated.</hi> Here we must note that Christ maketh the bread and wine his bodie and bloude. Wee acknowledge he doth so, for the faith of the worthy receiuer, as in the former sentence it is manifest.</p>
                  <p>Nowe commeth S. Ambrose <hi>De benedict. Patr. c.</hi> 9. <hi>Who is then rische, but he in whome is the depth of wisdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? This rich man then is the treasure of this fatte breade, which who shall eate, he cannot hunger. This breade he gaue to his Apostles, that they should deuide it to the beleeuing people. And now hee giueth the same to vs, which hee beeing the Priest doeth consecrate with his owne wordes. This bread then is made the meate of the Sainctes.</hi> 
                     <q>Here againe M. Heskins cutteth off that which liketh him not for it followeth: <hi>Possumus &amp; ipsium Dominum accipere qui sua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carnem nobis dedit. Sicut ipse ait, ego sunt panis vitae. Ille enim accipit qui scipsum probat: qui autem accipit, non moritur peccatoris morte, quia panis hic remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio peccatorum est.</hi> Wee may receiue euen the Lorde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe which hath giuen vs his fleshe, euen as he himselfe saith, I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread of life. For he receiueth him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe, &amp; he which receiueth him dyeth not the death of a sinner, for this bread is the remission of sinnes.</q>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:14727:83"/>
This place doth first ouerthrowe M. Heskins dreame of two breades. Secondly, the Papistes assertion, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men receiue the bodie of Christ. And thirdly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that to eate Christ &amp; his fleshe, is to receiue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sinnes, which M. Heskins and the Papistes denye.</p>
                  <p>Another place of Ambrose is alledged. <hi>li.</hi> 4. <hi>de sacra. Ca.</hi> 4. <hi>Let vs then teach this. How can that which is bread be the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ? By consecration. By what and whose wordes then is the consecration? Of our Lorde Iesus. For all the other things that be sayed, praise is giuen to God, petition is made in prayer for the people, for Kings, and for the rest: but when it is come to that, the honourable sacrament is made, now the Priest vseth not his owne wordes, but he vseth the wordes of Christe. Therefore the worde of Christ maketh this sacrament.</hi> This is noted to be a plaine place for M. Iuell, but for what purpose, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, except it be to proue that he will not denye, that the sacrament is consecrated and made the bodie of Christ to the worthie receiuer, by the wordes of Christe, as before. Eusebius Emissenus hath the next place <hi>in Hom. Pasc. The inuisible Priest with his worde, by a secreat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, turneth the visible cratures into the substance of his body &amp; bloud.</hi> This place being more apparant for his transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation then any that he hath alledged, he vrgeth not, nor gathereth of it, but onely that Christ is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the consecration and conuersion. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, I thinke his conscience did tell him, that it was not of the substance, but of the vse of things, a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and not a corporall change, as both Eusebius and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers do sufficiently expound what maner of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is. The last man is Cyprian <hi>De Caen Dom. It were better for them a milstone to be tyed to their neckes, and to be drowned in the Sea, then with an vnwashed conscience to take the morsell at the hande of our Lorde, who vntil this day doeth create, and sanctifie, and blesse, and to the godly receiuers diuide this his most true, and most holy bodie.</hi> Here M. Heskins vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that he createth not an imaginatiue bodie, but his moste true bodie. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blinde man seeth not, that either
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14727:84"/>
this creation is figuratiue, or else it ouerthroweth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. For to create, is not to change one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance into another, but to make a substance of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Secondly, that Christ diuideth his bodie, but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly receiuers. <q>Finally, in the same Sermon he saith: that all this mysterie is wrought by faith. <hi>Haec quotie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this Chapter, seeing M. Heskins hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured so well to proue that Christ onely &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest doth consecrate, and so often chargeth vs with slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, to make God &amp; the bodie of Christ, I would demaunde, wherefore the Bishop, when he giueth them the order of Priesthood, giueth them power to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, saying: <hi>Accip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And first he sayth, that they being carnall, could not vnderstande the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall talke of Christe, wherein as he saith truely, so hee speaketh contrarie to him selfe. For he will haue those words to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carnally. They could not vnderstand, (sayth he) because they did not beleeue, &amp; therefore they questioned how it might be, euen as the <hi>Pseudochristians</hi> do. How can the bodie of Christ be in the sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so litle a peece of bread? &amp;c. But the aunswere to all their questions is, that they be don by the power of God. <hi>And if you proceede, to enquire of his will, he hath declared it in these wordes, the breade which I will giue is my fleshe, not a fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14727:84"/>
nor a mathematicall, or figuratiue flesh, but that same flesh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that I will giue for the life of the worlde.</hi> But if wee proceede to demaund further, how he proueth, that he will giue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flesh to be eaten with our mouth, carnally in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: then is he at a staye; he can go no further. Wee doubt not of the power of God, we will extend his will no further then his worde. For to eat the fleshe of Christe is not to eat it with our mouthes, but with our hearts, by faith, as Augustine vppon the same text teacheth vs. <q>
                        <hi>Hoc est ergo manducare illam escam, &amp; illum bibere ponum, in Christo manere, &amp; illum manentem in se habere.

Thus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine teacheth, how the flesh of Christe is eaten, and by whome, and what difference betweene the flesh &amp; bloud of Christ, and the sacrament thereof, in all those points directly contrarie to the Papistes, which affirme, that the flesh of Christ is eaten with the mouth, and that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the wicked, and last of all, that the sacrament of the flesh of Christ, &amp; his flesh is all one.</q>

Ipse dicit sanguinem suum: ante consecrationem aliud dicitur, post con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrationem sanguis nuncupatur.</hi> It was the true fleshe of Christ which was crucified, which was buryed: therefore it is truely, the sacrament of that fleshe. Our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus him selfe cryeth: This is my bodie: before the blessing of the heauenly wordes, it is called another kinde, after the consecration, the bodie of Christe is signified. Hee him selfe sayth, it is his bloud: before consecration it is called another thing, after consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is called bloud.</q> By this place you see, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords supper is the sacrament of his true fleshe that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that the bodie of Christ is signified by it. Here is no one worde sounding either to the carnall presence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to the presence in many places.</p>
                  <p>His second proofe is out of Augustine, that Christ was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14727:85"/>
both in his owne hands, &amp; in his twelue Apostles hands, <hi>in Psal.</hi> 33. <hi>And he was borne in his owne hands. But brethren, howe may this be done in man, who can vnderstande? who is borne in his owne hands? A man may be carried in thè handes of other men, in his owne handes no man is borne. Howe it may be vnderstanded in Dauid, according to the letter, we find not. But in Christ we finde it. For Christ was borne in his owne hands, when he commending his owne body sayd: this is my bodie.</hi> I passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that he translateth, <hi>comendans ipsum corpus, giuing forth the selfe same bodie.</hi> 
                     <q>But howe fraudulently he abuseth the authoritie of Augustine, it is manifest by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>&amp; ipse se portabat quodam modo cum diceret, hoc est corpus meum.</hi> And he carried him selfe after a certein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he sayde: this is my bodie. These wordes declare, that Augustine woulde not teach, that Christe absolutely did beare him selfe in his hands, as M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins would beare vs in hand, but after a certeine maner.</q> And no man writeth so plainly, of the necessitie of Christes bodie to be in one place, as he. I will cite one onely short place, to auoide tediousnesse: <q>
                        <hi>In Ioan. Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Tr.</hi> 30. <hi>Sursum est Dominus, sed etiam hîc, &amp; veritas Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Corpus enim Domini, in quo resurrexit, vno loco esse potesti veritas eius vbi<expan>
                              <am>

                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> diffusa est.</hi> The Lord is aboue, and he is also here, and the Lorde is trueth. For the Lordes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in which he rose againe, can be but in one place, but his truth is spread ouer all places. This saying, beside that it limitteth the bodie of Christe to one place, will expound the other sayings, which he bringeth out of Chrysostome, Basil, &amp;c. that Christ is both in heauen and on earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next proofe is out of the Liturgies of Basil and Chrysostome, which he calleth their masses, although writen by neither of them. The wordes in effect are all one, and therefore it were vaine to rehearse them both: <hi>Looke ô Lorde Iesu Christ our God, from thy holie habitation, and from the seat of the glorie of thy kingdome, and come to sanctifie vs, which sittest aboue with thy father, and art present with vs beneath inuisibly, vouchsafe with thy mightie hande to giue vnto
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14727:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs thy immaculate bodie and precious bloud, and by vs to all thy people.</hi> The distinction of the two natures in Christ, will soone aunswere this presence of Christe, both in heauen and in earth, as in the late rehearsed sentence of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine. And Basil him selfe, in his booke <hi>de Spiritu Sancto Cap.</hi> 22. prooueth the Holie Ghoste to be God, because he is reported in Scripture to be present in diuerse places at once, so that, except wee will with Eutyches ouerthrowe the trueth of Christes bodie, wee must holde that it is in one onely place at one time, and not in many places, or euery where.</p>
                  <p>But Chrysostome (I trowe) shall helpe him <hi>In</hi> 10. <hi>Heb. Hom.</hi> 17. <hi>This sacrifice is an exemplar of that, we offer the selfe same alwayes. Neither do we nowe offer one Lambe, and to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow another, but the selfe same thing alwayes. Wherefore this sacrifice is one. Or else by this reason, because it is offered in many places, there are many Christes. Not so, but one Christ is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, both here being full, and there full, euen one bodie And as he, that is euerie where offered, is one bodie, &amp; not many bodies: Euen so also is it one sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, M. Heskins here, I knowe not for what cause, peruerteth the order of Chrysostomes wordes, for where he sayeth: <hi>Alioqui hac ratione,</hi> Heskins setteth them down <hi>vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>Secondly, which is no newe thing in him, he leaueth out that which is the resolution of all this doubtfull disputation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which followeth: <hi>Hoc autem quod facimus in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorationem quidem fit eius, quod factum est. Hoc enim sacite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit in meam commemorationem. Non aliud sacrificium sicut Pontifex, sed idipsum semper facimus, magis autem recordatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem sacrificij operamur.</hi> But this which we do is done true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in remembrance of that which was done before. For do this (sayeth he) in remembrance of mee. We do not offer another sacrifice, as the high Priest, but the selfe same alwayes, but rather wee exercise the remembrance of the sacrifice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is nowe that sacrifice which is offered euery where, by a necessarie correction, brought to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14727:86"/>
of that sacrifice, which was once offered on the crosse, but is celebrated euery where in the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sacrament. And the same wordes afterward falsely ascribed to Ambrose, haue the same interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The other place vpon the 38. Psalme, differeth not in sense, <hi>That Christ is offered on earth, when his bodie is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> For he speaketh but of a remembrance, or comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the sacrifice of Christe, euen as Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and as he him selfe teacheth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram.</hi> The wordes of the Priest in the celebration. <q>
                        <hi>Fac nobis (inquit) haenc oblationem ascriptam, rationabilem, acceptabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: quod est figura corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini nostri Iesu Christi.</hi> Make (sayeth he) this oblation vnto vs ascribed reasonable, acceptable: which thing is the figure of the bodie and bloud of our Lorde Iesus Christ. This was the Priest wont to say in the celebration of the supper in Saint Ambrose time.</q> 
                     <q>And againe <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Ergo memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res gloriosissimae eius passionis, &amp; ab inferis resurrectionis, &amp; in Caelum ascensionis, offerimus tibi hanc immaculatam hostiam, rationabilem hostiam, incruentam hostiam, hunc panem sanctum, &amp; calicem vitae aeternae, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore being mindfull of his most glorious passion and resurrection from hell, and ascention into heauen, we offer vnto thee this vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed sacrifice, this reasonable sacrifice, this vnbloudie sacrifice, this holie bread, and cup of aeternall life. Wee see therefore, that the sacrifice was a remembrance and thanksgiuing, for the onely true sacrifice of Christ once offered by him selfe for all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, because I will omitt Bernard a late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not to be heard in this controuersie: Chrysostome in his booke <hi>de Sacerdotio, lib.</hi> 3. speaketh not contrarie to him selfe in other places, saying: <hi>O miracle, O the goodnesse of God, he that sitteth aboue with his father in the same point of time, is handled with the handes of all, and deliuereth himselfe to them that will receiue him and imbrace him.</hi> 
                     <q>Wherefore, this hyperbolical exclamation proueth no more, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bodie is both in heauen &amp; on earth: then these words of his proue that our bodies are both in heauen &amp; earth,

God hath decreede that one body can be but in one place at one time, and that two bodies cannot occupie one proper place at once, nor one body without comixtion of partes, be in another bodye. And therefore both Cranmer and Oecolampadius haue true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayed, that it is vnpossible those thinges should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, then God hath decreed them. Now riseth vp this Gargantua, and will proue by scripture, that one bodie may be in another, and two bodies in one place, &amp; alledgeth the text <hi>Ioan</hi> 20. that <hi>Iesus came, the dores being shutt, and stoode in the middest of them and saide, peace be with you, and this being testifyed for a miraculous comming in of Christ, proueth that he so comming in passed through dore or wall, as his pleasure was to do.</hi> Although the wordes of the texte <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14727:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he did either open the dore and shutt it immediatly after he was passed through, or else at the vttermost, that the substance of the dore or wall gaue place to his diuine presence, and immediatly returned to his naturall state and place.</p>
                  <p>And whereas M. Heskins, no lesse impudently then vnlearnedly, doth charge Cranmer with falsifying the Scripture, where he affirmeth, that Christ might as well come into the house when the dore was shutt, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles coulde go out of prison, the dore being shutt, Act. 5. he doth nothing else but bewray his great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ioyned with no lesse malice against the trueth. Cranmer was not ignorant, that the Angell opened the dore to the Apostles, and yet shutt it againe so close, that it could not be perceiued that it had beene opened, euen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o might the Angell doe at the passage of our Sauiour Christe. What absurditie or repugnance is here, but in such an absurde persons eare, as Heskins is, that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth all lawe &amp; order of nature to establish his bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and monstrous errour.</p>
                  <p>But nowe we shall heare these monsters brought forth of the doctours, which Scripture hath not, and nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth: And firste shalbe Chrysostome <hi>Hom. de Ioan. Bapt. Sancta Maria, beata Maria, &amp;c. Holy Maria, blessed Marie, both a mother, and a virgine. Shee was a virgine before birth, a virgine after birth. I marueile at this, howe of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, a virgine should be borne, and after the birth of a virgine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mother should be a virgine. Will you knowe howe he was borne of a virgine, and after the birth, how shee was both a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a virgine? The dores were shutt, and Iesus entred in. No man doubteth, but that the dores were shutt, he that entred by the dores that were shutt, was no phantasie, he was no spirite, he was verily a body. For what sayd he? looke and see, that a spirite hath no flesh and bones, as ye see mee haue. He had flesh, he had bones, and the dores were shutt. How did fleshe and bones enter when the dores were shutt? The dores are shutt, and hee doth enter, whome wee sawe not goe in. How did he go in? all things are close, there is no place by the which he might go in,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14727:88"/>
and yet he is within, which entered in. Thou knowest in howe it was done, and doest referre it to the omnipotencie of God. Giue this also to the omnipotencie of God, that he was borne of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</hi> In these wordes Chrysostome saith, that Christe might as well bee borne of a Virgine, as hee entered into the house after the doores was shut, this was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle, and no more was that. But for two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in one place at one instant, hee speaketh nothing as yet. No more doth Hieronyme <hi>In Apol. cont. Iouin. Respondeant mihi &amp;c. Let them aunswere me howe Iesus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in, the doores being shut, when he shewed his handes to bee felt, and his side to be considered, and shewed both flesh and bones, least the trueth of his body should be thought to be a fantasie: And I will aunswere howe Saint Marie is both mother and a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, a Virgine before birth, a mother before she was knowne of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon these places Maister Heskins doth inferre, that if the doores did open as the going in of Christ, which (hee saith) is a shaddowing of the miracle, and a falsifying of the scriptures, as though it were not miraculous ynough, except it tooke away the trueth of Christes body, and ouerthrewe the immutable decree of GOD, then his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>In, could not proue that the clausures of the virginitie</hi> (I vse his owne wordes) <hi>of the mother of Christ notwithstanding his birth remained alwayes closed, which the Doctours intended to proue.</hi> I would not for shamefastnesse, enter into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the secrets of virginitie, &amp; last of all the high mysteries of the incarnation and natiuitie of our sauiour Christe, of the immaculate Virgine Marie, in any such Physicall questions, but that I am driuen vnto it by this shamelesse aduersarie. And yet will I onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the authoritie of the scripture, referring the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to the reuerent &amp; shamefast consideration of the honest reader. Saint Luke writeth of his presentation at Hierusalem. As it is written in the lawe of the Lorde, euery manchilde that first openeth the matrice, shall bee called holy to the Lorde. Luke 2. According to this text, the miracle of his natiuitie preseruing her virginitie,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14727:88"/>
and of his entering in, the doores beeing shut, are verie like in deede, and agreeable to the Doctours mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>But hee proceedeth with Chrysostomes authoritie, <hi>Hom.</hi> 86. <hi>in Ioan. Dignum autem dubitatione est &amp;c. It is woorthie of doubt, howe the incorruptible body did receiue the fourme of the nayles, and could be touched with mortall hande. But let not this trouble thee. For this was of permission. For that body being so subtile and light, that it might enter in the doores being shut, was voyde of all grossenesse or thicknesse: but that his resurrection might be beleeued, he shewed him selfe such a one. And that thou mightest vnderstand, that it was euen he that was crucified, that none other did rise for him, therefore he roase againe with the tokens of the crosse.</hi> Except wee vnderstand Chrysostome fauourably in this place, where hee deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the glorified body of Christe to haue any thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but that it might pearce through all thinges as a spirite, wee shall make him author of a great heresie, both concerning the body of Christe, and concerning our bodyes which after the resurrection, must bee made conformable to his glorious body, Philip. 3. But in an other place, as wee shall heare afterwarde, hee doeth eyther expound or correct him selfe in this matter. And yet this that hee saith here, helpeth not Maister Heskins one whit, and that for two causes, one, for that hee speaketh heere of the glorified bodye of Christe, who instituted his sacrament before his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye was glorified.</p>
                  <p>An other cause, for that hee doeth not heere make two bodyes in one place, or one bodye in an other, but to auoyde that absurditie, doeth transfourme the bodye of Christe into the subtiltie and thinnesse of a spirite. But in an other sentence, <hi>De resurrect. Hom.</hi> 9. he is of an other minde concerning the bodye of Christe. <hi>Non est meum ludificare phantasmate, vanam i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginem visus si timet, veritatem corporis manus &amp; digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus exploret. Potest fortassis aliqua oculos caligo decipere, palpatio corporalis verum corpus agnoscat. Spiritus, inquit,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14727:89"/>
carnem &amp; ossa non habet sicut me videtis habere: Quod Ostia clausa a penetrani, sola est virtus Diuini spiritus, non sola carnis substantia. It is not my propertie to delude my disciples with a fantasie, if your sight feare a vaine image, let your hand and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers trie out the trueth of my body. Some myste peraduenture may deceiue the eyes, let bodily handling acknowledge a true body. A spirite (saith he) hath neither flesh nor bones, as you see mee to haue. That I pearced through the doores beeing shut, it is the onely power of the diuine spirite, not the onely substaunce of the flesh.</hi> In these wordes, hee ascribeth it to the onely power of his diuine spirite, that he passed through when the doores were shut, and not to the subtiltie of his glorified body, as in the former sentence. Likewise in <hi>Ioan. Hom.</hi> 90. <q>
                        <hi>Qui intrauit per ostia clausa, non erat phantasma, non erat spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus, verè corpus erat.</hi> Hee that entered in by the doores beeing shut, was no fantasie, hee was no spirite, hee was a body truely and in deede. But wee must passe ouer vnto Saint Ambrose, in <hi>Luc. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</q> 
                     <hi>Habuit admiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di causam Thomas &amp;c. Thomas had a cause to maruell, when hee sawe all thinges being shut vp and closed, the body of Christe by clausures without all wayes for body to enter, the ioyntes bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnbroken, to bee entered in amongest them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a woonder, howe the corporall nature passed through the impenetrable body, with an inuisible comming, but with inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible beholding, easie to be touched, hard to bee iudged.</hi> In these woordes of Saint Ambrose, nothing can bee certainely gathered, bycause hee doth not him selfe determine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner the body of Christe came in, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sheweth what cause Thomas had to doubt and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, sauing that in an other place, I finde him write sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiously of the trueth of the body of Christe, and of the true properties thereof. <q>For in his booke <hi>De mysterijs initiandis Cap.</hi> 9. hee hath these woordes, speaking of the body of Christ: <hi>Corpus enim Dei corpus est spirituale, Corpus Christi corpus est diuini spiritus.</hi> The body of GOD is a spirituall body. The body of Christe is the body of a diuine spirite.</q> These sayinges for reuerence of the Authours, may haue a gentle construction, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14727:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are not directly consonant to the Catholique confession of the trueth of Christes body, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof, remayning euen after his Assention, as hath bene discussed by the scriptures, especially after the Church was troubled with the heresies of the Eutychians and Monotholites.</p>
                  <p>Nowe followeth Saint Augustine, <hi>De agone Christiano Cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Nec eos audiamus &amp;c. Neither let vs giue eare to them that denye, that the body of Christe is risen againe of such qualitie, as it was put into the graue. Neither let is moue vs that it is written that hee appeared soudenly to his disciples after the doores were shut, that therefore we should denye it to bee an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, bicause wee see that contrarie to the nature of this body, it entered by the doores that were shut, for all thinges are possible to GOD. For if hee could before his passion make it as cleare as the brightnesse of the Sunne, wherefore could he not after his passion, also in a moment of time, bring it into as much subtiltie as hee would, that hee might enter in by the doores that were shut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here first of all Maister Heskins according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed manner of falsification, translateth <hi>tale corpus,</hi> the same body, as though there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene substaunce: and qualitie. Secondly it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that Augustine in this place, iudgeth (as in other places most plainely) that the body of Christe nowe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, retayneth not onely the substaunce, but also the properties and qualities of a true body, which hee had before he suffered. Although for that moment, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the body of Christe might be subtiliated, by his Diuine power, to passe through the doores being shut, and yet affirmeth nothing directly, that it was so, but rather that it might bee so. Whereas more probably hee might haue thought, that eyther the doore opened: or the nature of the boordes gaue place, then that the body of Christe for the time was altered.</p>

other, that he might shew the workes of Christe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature. And both these might stand without his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For it was a miracle aboue nature, that the doores of their owne accorde, opened to our sauiour Christ at his entrie, as when Peter also came foorth of the prison Actes 12. But whereas he bringeth in an example of the eternitie of the worlde, which is held by some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall philosophers, to proue that Gods workes are aboue nature, he sheweth a grosse capacitie, that can not put a difference betweene the errours of naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and the true lawe and order of nature made by God himselfe, which is vndoubtedly knowen to all wise men, as in these propositions nowe in question.

ascention of Christ, which the Papistes doe graunt, &amp; yet acknowledge his presence on the earth in the sacrament: as though his departing out of the world, and presence in the world concerning his bodily presence, could stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Then he flyeth to his diuine power, by which he is able to be present in diuerse places, as well as do such and such miracles as he rehearseth, and wisheth that we should not be so streight and cruell to the body of Christ, as to giue it no greater prerogatiue, then vnto any other body. Verily we do acknowledge as great prerogatiue thereof, as he himselfe hath giuen it, whereof we haue vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by his holy worde, and otherwise it were madnesse in vs, to take vpon vs to be liberall to him which giueth all thinges. And if we found as good authoritie for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biquitie, or pluralitie of placing of his body, as we finde for the feeding vs thereby into eternall life, we would as easily confesse the one, as we doe the other. But we finde not in deede (as M. Heskins saith) that he himselfe hath giuen or would giue his body that prerogatiue, to be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, or in more places then one at once. As for the possibilitie, we extend it no further then his will. We know he can do what soeuer he will. And many thinges we know he cannot do, because he wil not. But M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins to assure vs of his will, hath nothing to bring, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is al the controuersie, &amp; which most impudently he affirmeth, that he hath proued both by scriptures and doctours, that Christ hath caused his bodie to be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places at one time, which neither scripture nor any Doctour of antiquitie euer did affirme in proper manner of speaking, otherwise in figuratiue speech, we may truly say we eate in the sacrament the body of Christe, which is in heauen, when to speake properly, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out figure, we eate but the bread, which to the faithfull receiuer is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and seale of our spirituall nourishment, whiche we receiue of his flesh and bloud, after a diuine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable manner vnto eternall life: saith rather lifting vs vp into heauen, then bringing Christes body into the earth.</p>

                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:14727:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>Maister Heskins saith, the scriptures that say Christ is in heauen, speake without exclusiues, or exceptiues, and therefore there is no denial imployed, but that he may be beleeued to be also on the earth in the sacrament:</p>
                  <p>When Peter in the Actes 3. affirmeth that Christ must be conteined in heauen, (which is meant of his humanitie) vntill the time of restoring of all thinges: is not this an exclusion of all other places or beeings of his humanitie? When Paule to the Colossians, Colo. 3. willeth them to seeke those thinges that are aboue, and where Christ is at the right hand of God, to set their mindes on thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and not on things vpon the earth: is not the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>son, because Christ concerning his humanitie, is aboue &amp; not vpon earth? Is not this an exclusiue and exception? When Christe sayeth not only, I goe to my father, but also I leaue the worlde <hi>Ioan.</hi> 16. Whiche saying the Apostles confessed to be plaine, and without all parable. Is not this a manifest exclusion of his bodily presence from the worlde? So that it is manifest, that this ascention and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in heauen, concerning his humane nature, in which he ascended, is an excluding and shutting out, and denying of all other places or presences of his bodie, then to be in heauen only. But now that he hath thus tombled vp the authorities of the scripture, he wil take in hand to answer the obiections brought out of the Doctours. And first shalbe the saying of Augustine <hi>Ad Dardanum ep.</hi> 57. <q>Which place contrarie to his bragg in the beginning, he alledgeth truncatly, &amp; by halfe, beginning at the middest thereof. But this place is in Augustine: <hi>Et sic venturus est, illa angelica voce testante, quemadmodum ire visus est in Coelum, id est, in eadem carnis forma atque substantia, cui profectò immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem dedit, naturam non abstulis.

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this fourme, he is not thought, to be diffused
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14727:92"/>
in all places.</q> All this hath Heskins left out, and beginneth thus: <hi>Cauendum est enim, no ita veritatem astru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is no consequent, that, that which is in God, should so be euerie where as God is.</hi> Note here, that Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine doeth not onely flatly denie the vbiquitie of Christes body, but also affirmeth that it reteineth still the nature of a bodie, which is to be conteined in one onely place. Againe he sayeth in the same Epistle <hi>Iesus vbique per id quod Deus est: in coelo autem per id quod homo est. Iesus by that he is God is euerie where: by that he is man, he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Nowe let vs heare, howe wisely Maister Heskins will auoide this authoritie. First he sayeth, that Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine in this epistle, speaketh not of the sacrament, and therefore these sentences make not against that matter.</p>
                  <p>But when Augustine speaketh generally of the bodie of Christ, that it reteineth the nature of a body, that it is not euerie where, &amp;c. he doeth not except the sacrament. Although it is false, that Heskins saith, for in the latter end of that Epistle he hath these wordes: <q>
                        <hi>Huius corporis caput est Christus, huius corporis vnitas nostro sacrificio commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur.</hi> The head of this bodie is Christ, the vnitie of this bodie is commended in our sacrifice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By sacrifice (as Maister Heskins will confesse) he meaneth the celebration of the sacrament. Wherefore he forgate not the sacrament in that Epistle, but that he might haue made exception thereof, if he had thought good. The seconde aunswere of Maister Heskins is a balde distinction, that a thing may be at one time in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places two wayes, the one is by nature, the other by gifte. By nature he confesseth that the body of Christe can not be in two places, but by gifte it may be euerie where, or in as many places as hee will: and then brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many examples to shewe that CHRISTES body hath many properties by gifte, which it hath not by nature. And in this distinction he triumpheth out of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14727:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
measure.</p>
                  <p>But the lewde sophister will not see that Saint Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine denieth to Christes body his imagined gift, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his denied nature to remaine. <q>
                        <hi>Cui</hi> (saith he) <hi>profectò immortalitatem dedit, naturam non abstudit</hi>: to which fleshe he hath giuen immortalitie, but not taken away the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</q> Doeth not Augustine here plainely deny the gift of vbiquitie, affirming the nature to remaine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the circum scription of place? You see this very place to ouerthrow his blinde distinction.</p>
                  <p>Nowe followeth another place out of this Epistle to Dardanus, in which he beeing such an impudent falsarie, as we haue so often discouered, yet blusheth not to accuse Oecolampadius for falsifying of Aug. by a subtile addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Spacia locorum tolle corporibus, nusquaem erunt, &amp; quia nus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam erunt, nec erunt.

Take the same bodies from the qualities of bodies, and there shal no place be found, where they may be, &amp; therfore we confesse Christ in body to be no where else but in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> These last words: <hi>&amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we confesse Christ in body to be no where but in heauen</hi>: as he saith truly they be not in Augustine, so he saith falsly, thei were added by Oecolampadius, otherwise then as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of his owne, gathered out of Augustines wordes. But he must haue some cauill, to shift of the matter. For his answere is so impudent, that I maruell the beast was not ashamed once to rehearse this obiection, which he could no more colourably auoide: He saith these wordes of Augustine are not spoken of the body of Christe, but of natural bodies vpon the earth: whereas the only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Augustine is, to shewe the naturall propertie of the bodie of Christ to be conteined in one place, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of al other bodies either in heauen or in earth.</p>
                  <p>But because this olde foole playeth the boy so kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let me pose him in his aunswere like a childe. Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14727:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Augustine of all bodies or of some? If of all, then of the bodie of Christ: If of some, then of particulars followeth nothing. But speaketh he of all naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the earth? Then aunswere me whether Christes body be vpon the earth? Yes, or else it could not be in the sacrament. Well admitte it be vpon the earth, is it a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie or no? Take heede what you aunswere. Yea, it is a naturall bodie: why then sir, if Christes body be a naturall body vpon earth, and Augustine speaketh of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodies vpon earth, then Augustine speaketh of Christes bodie also. This childishe kinde of reasoning were good inough for such childish aunsweres as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to so graue authorities.</p>
                  <p>But let vs see another obiection, whiche is out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine also. <hi>In Ioan. tract.</hi> 30. <hi>Sursum est Domimus, sed etiam hîc, &amp; veritas Dominus.

For the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of our Lorde, in which he rose againe, can be but in one place, his truth is diffused euerie where.</hi> This place is corruptly cited by Maister Heskins, for he setteth it downe thus: <hi>Sed etiam hîc est veritas Domini.</hi> His translation I wil not deale with, because it is the matter in controuersie. He aunswereth that Augustine saith no more, but that he may be in one onely place at one time, if it please him. A goodly saying, as though euer any man would thinke otherwise, then that it were possible for his bodie to be in one place at one time. But that one place in these wordes, is an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue of all other places: if the opposition of one place and all other places will not serue, at least wise, let the Canon law it selfe beare some sway with Papistes, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, for in the decrees <hi>De contract.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14727:94"/>
though there were no more obiections out of Augustine, or any other writer against the vbiquitie of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he endeth with this: concluding after his maner, that faith must ouer rule reason, which is true, where Gods worde hath promised any thing, but we denie that Christ hath promised the presence of his bodie in moe places then one, therefore there is no place for faith where the word hath not gone before. But left the reader should thinke, M. Heskins hath answered all obiections out of Augustine, I thinke good to set downe one or two more, first <hi>In Ioan. Tract.</hi> 31. <q>

Although it be necessarie that the same should be celebrated visibly, yet it must be vnderstoode inuisibly.

For who hath doubted, that Christe is euen so the vine, and wee the braunches, that wee receiue life from thence into vs. Heare Saynt Paule saying, that we all are one bodye in Christ: For although wee be many, yet we are one in him, for wee all take parte of one breade. Or peraduenture doth hee thinke that the power of the mysticall blessing is vnknowen to vs, which when it is done in vs, doeth it not make Christe to dwell in vs corporally, by the participation of the fleshe of Christe? For why are the members of the faithfull, the members of Christ? Knowe ye not (sayeth he) that the members of the faithfull, are the members of Christe? Shall I then make the members of Christ the members of an harlott?</hi> In this place Cyrill sayeth, that Christe doth dwell corporally in vs, but howe? by participation of the fleshe of Christe, which as he tooke of our nature, so hath he againe giuen the same vnto vs, to bee in deede our nourishment vnto eternall life, which thing is testified vnto vs by the sacrament, euen as the vnitie wee haue one with another, and all of vs with Christe, is testified in that we all take part of

one breade. Otherwise I see nothing in this place that may help Maister Heskins. For such as our vnitie is, such is our participation of his flesh, and as we are members of his body, so doe we eate his body. This M. Heskins must graunt, if he will allowe Cyrills authoritie, but our vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, participation, and coniunction of members, though it be in his body, of his flesh, and vnto him as our head, yet is not after a carnall manner, no more is the eating of his flesh nor the corporall dwelling of him in vs after a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or corporall manner, but after a diuine and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner.

For then the offering of sacrifice is cleane, and the giuing of almes is holy, when they which performe these things vnderstand what they worke. For as our Lord saith, except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you: you ought so to be partakers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly table, that you doubt nothing of the trueth of the body of Christe, and of his bloud. For that is taken with the mouth, which is beleeued by faith, and in vaine doe they answere Amen, which dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which is receiued.</hi> Leo in these words, as Maister Heskins is enforced to confesse, speaketh against the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychian heresie, which denyed the trueth of Christes body after the adunation therof to the Diuinitie (as the papistes do indeed, though not in words, by their vbiquitie &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Nowe how far Leo was from transubstantiation or vbiquitie, we haue shewed before in the 11. Chapter of this booke, where his saying may be read.</p>

the vnitie of dignitie, or as possessing a diuine habitation, but truely quickening and made proper vnto the word it selfe. For he being naturally life as God, bicause he was vnited to his owne flesh, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the sonne to haue power to giue life. And therefore although he say vnto vs: Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you, yet we ought not to esteeme it as of a man, that is, one of vs. For howe can the flesh of a man after his owne nature, be a quickening flesh? But as verily made his owne flesh, which for vs was both made and called the sonne of man.</hi> The Fathers of this Counsell do not (as M. Heskins saith) expound this text of the sacrament, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what they receiue in the sacrament, but rather shew what they iudged of that flesh, whereof they receiued the sacrament, namely, that it was not the flesh of a pure man as Nestorius affirmed, but the flesh of the son of God, &amp; therfore had power to giue life being eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith, either in the participation of the sacrament or without it. And whereas he noteth a plaine place for M. Iewel, when they say, <hi>They were made partakers of the body and bloud of Christ,</hi> there is no more plainenesse then M. Iewell will confesse.

He hath not this life that eateth not this bread, nor drinketh this bloud. For without is men may haue temporall life, but eternall they can not.

He hath answered to both, in that he saith, life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. It is not so in this meate which we take to sustaine the life of this body. For he that shall not take it, shall not liue. Nor yet he that shall take it shall liue. For it may be, that by age or sicknesse, or any other cause, many which haue taken it may dye: but in this meat and drinke, that is, the body and bloud of our Lord, it is not so. For both he that taketh it not hath not life, &amp; he that taketh it hath life, and that eternall.</hi> Although there be not one word spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here of the sacrament, and M.

First (he saith) though this meate signifie the mysticall body of Christe, yet it signifieth not that alone, but his naturall body in the sacrament, whereof he hath neuer a worde in this treatise of S. Augustine: secondly, Augustine did not go about to instruct the people what they should receiue, but how wel they shuld receiue it.

And by this he that abideth not in Christe, and in whome Christ abideth not, out of dout neither eateth spiritually his flesh, nor drinketh his bloud, although carnally and visibly, hee presse with his teeth the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ: but rather eateth and drinketh to his owne damnation the sacrament of so excellent a thing.

For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truely (as the men of God haue vnderstoode it before vs,) our Lord Iesus Christ commended his bodie and bloud in those thinges, which of many are brought to one certein thing. For the one is made into one of many graynes &amp; so consisteth: the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into one of many grapes.</hi> Because this sentence is clean contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carnal presence, &amp; transubstantiation, you must cal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, the glose of a certeine blind Authour, that there be three things in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament to be considered. The first the sacrament only, which is a signe of an holy thing, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the forme of bread. The second the thing signified, &amp; conteined, that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very bodie of Christ. The third is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified but not conteined, that is the mysticall bodie of Christ. But this balde distinction, is so farre of Augustines minde, that he cleane ouerthroweth two partes of it. First the carnall presence of Christes bodie conteined, &amp; when he affirmeth that this meate maketh them of whome it is receiued, immortall and incorruptible, whiche are onely them that receiue it by faith, for if it were conteined, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men should also receiue it: but they receiue it not, therefore it is not conteined. Secondly, he ouerthroweth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14727:103"/>
transubstantiation, when he saith that Christe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his bodie in such thinges, as are made one of many, as one bread of many graines, and one wine of many grapes. For the fourme, by which Heskins meaneth the accidents of bread, is made neither of graynes nor of grapes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fourme of Bread is none of those things in which Christ commended his body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>But when nothing is in Augustine, then the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Prosper must helpe on this manner. <hi>Hoc est quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus, &amp;c. This it is which we say, which by al meanes we labour to approue, that the sacrifice of the Church, is made by two meanes, and consisteth of two thinges: the visible kinde of the elementes, and the inuisible fleshe and bloud of our Lorde Iesus Christe, both of the sacrament, and of the thing of the sacrament, that is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ: as the person of Christ consisteth of God &amp; man see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ himselfe is very God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and verie man. Because euerie thing conteineth in it the nature and trueth of those thinges of which it is made: but the sacrifice of the Church is made of two, the sacrament, and the thing of the sacrament, that is, the bodie of Christ, therefore there is the sacrament, and the thing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> This last sentence M. Hesk. hath not translated. But he noteth three things in these words affirmed which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacramentaries denie: that is, that the Church hath a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that therein is a sacrament, which is the fourmes of bread and wine, and that there is present the very body and bloud of Christ, which he calleth the thing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Concerning the tearme of sacrifice, it is a stale quarrell, whereby he meaneth the sacrifice of thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or the Eucharistie. For the formes of bread &amp; wine, that is (as Maister Heskins meaneth) the accidentes, it is false, he hath nothing tending to that end, he saith, <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie elementorum,</hi> that is the kinde of elementes, which is the substance, and not the accidentes of bread and wine.

For if the WORDE was verily made flesh, and we doe truely eate the worde made flesh in the Lordes meate, how is he not to be thought to abide naturally in vs, which being borne a man hath taken vpon him the nature of our flesh now inseparable, &amp; hath admixed the nature of his flesh, vnto the nature of eternitie, vnder the sacrament of his fleshe to be communicated vnto vs.</hi> This with him is a plaine place, and much adoe he maketh about this worde, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, by which he meaneth nothing else but truly, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise M. Heskins (if he be in his right wittes) wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the abiding of Christe in vs, is not naturall nor after a naturall manner, but spirituall, and after a Diuine manner. And although he spake plain ynough of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of his flesh vnder a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet more euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the same booke in these wordes. <q>

Therfore to take that absolutely (as M. Heskins doth) which of him is spoken but after a certeine manner as vnder a sacrament, or a mysterie, is a grosse abusing both of the authour and of the readers.</p>
                  <p>Euthymius is cited <hi>In Ioan. Caro mea, &amp;c. My fleshe is meate in deede. It is true meate: or moste conuenient meate, as which nourisheth the soule, which is the moste proper part of man.

Well, yet we must not cast away that which Euthymius saide in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of the sentence, that it is a meate to nourish the soule, and not for the bodie to receiue, neither recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but where it nourisheth the soule.

                     <hi>Knowest thou the shadowe and the figure? Learne the very truth of the thing. For my flesh (saith he,) is meate indeed and my bloud is drinke in deede. Againe he maketh a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the mystical benediction and manna, the streames of water out of the rocke, and the communication of the holie cuppe, that they should not more esteeme the miracle of manna, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him which is the giuer of the heauenly bread, and of eternall life. For the nourishment of Manna brought not eternall life, but a short remedie of hunger. Therefore it was not the true meate. But the holie bodie of Christ is a meate nourishing vnto immortalitie &amp; eternall life. Also that water out of the rocke easied bodily thirst for a short time, neither brought it any thing beside. Therfore it was not that true drinke: but the bloud of Christ, by which death is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowen and destroyed, is the true drinke. For it is not the bloud of a man simply, but of him, which being ioyned vnto a natural life, is become life.</hi> Because M. Heskins cannot tell what to gather out of this place for his purpose, he taketh vp yes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdayes colde ashes, of the authorities cited before, by light of them to wrest this place to his purpose, but all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth still darke and dyme for his intent. Of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the fleshe and bloud of Christe aboue Manna &amp; the water as they were corporal foode, there is neither doubt nor question, nor yet that the same is eaten in the sacrament of the faithfull, but whether it be eaten corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or spiritually is all the question. And Dionyse the Charterhouse Monke, whome he matcheth vndiscretely with Cyrill, denieth also that the body of Christ is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued corporally in the sacrament. <hi>Verè est cibus animae non corporis, quia non visibiliter nec corporaliter sumitur, quamuis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum corpus sumatur. It is meate in deede, but of the soule not of the bodie, because it is not receiued visibly nor corporally although the very body be receiued.</hi> So that the Papistes them selues
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14727:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do not al agree of the maner of receiuing. In this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beside these two expositors are also cited Augustine &amp; Chrysostome. Augustine in Saint Prosper, to auouch the phrase of formes of bread and wine. <hi>Caro eius est quam forma panis opertam in sacramento accipimus: &amp; sanguis eius est, quem sub vini specie &amp; sapore potamus. It is his flesh, which we receiue in the sacrament couered with the fourme of bread, and it is his bloud, which we drinke vnder the kinde and taste of wine.</hi> Beside that this collection of Prosper is not to be found in any of Augustines owne workes, I denie the names of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> to be taken for accidentes in that sense the Papistes doe: but for a figure or signification, as by the wordes immediately following it is most manifest, which M.

But because the opinion of carnall presence was not receiued in this church of England in the age of Beda, nor long after, I thinke it not amisse, to consider his authoritie. He wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth therefore <hi>in Ioan. Dixerat superiùs &amp;c. He had sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: he that eateth my fleshe &amp; drinketh my bloud, hath life eternall. And that he might shewe howe great a difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene corporall meate, and the spirituall mysterie of his bodie &amp; bloud, he added: my fleshe is meate in deede, &amp; my bloud is drink in deede.</hi> Here Beda calleth the sacrament a spiritual my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the bodie and bloud of Christ, which although it be playne against the carnall presence, yet M. Heskins would cloke it with a fonde definition of a mysterie, to be that, (I wot not what,) which conteyneth couertly a thing not to be perceiued by sences or common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and so the sacrament is a mysterie, conteyning the verie bodie of Christ. Besides that, he remembreth not that Beda calleth it not onely a mysterie, but a spirituall mysterie, I would wit of him, what it is that Beda cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a spirituall mysterie? if he say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, I would further knowe, what he calleth the sacrament? he will aunswere, the formes of breade &amp; wine, for so they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine forsooth. Well, then Christ would not shewe the difference of the spirituall foode of his flesh &amp; bloud which is the thing conteined, but of the accidents of bread and wine, from the corporall foode.

                     <hi>He that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud abydeth in mee, and I in him.</hi> For vnderstanding of this text, he premiseth a destinction of two manners of abyding in Christ, that is spiritually and naturally: spiritually, by right faith and sincere charitie, as S. Cyrill doth teache, and naturally by receiuing of Christes fleshe, as S. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie teacheth. This distinction not being made by any doctour, but deuised vpon occasion of termes vsed by the doctours, to ouerthrowe the meaning of the doctours, he pleaseth him verie much therein. I haue shewed before, that Hillarie by the worde naturally, meaneth truelye, that as Christ is truely ioyned vnto vs by taking on him our fleshe, and we are truely ioyned to him, by eating &amp; drinking his flesh, vnder a sacrament, and vnder a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, (for both these termes of restreint he hath, to shewe the manner of our eating to be sacramentall and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, not as M. Heskins would, carnall and naturall) so Christ is truely one with God, not in vnitie of will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in vnitie of Godhead, in substance of diuinitie, in essence of eternitie. But let vs heare his owne wordes. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Trinit. Quod autem in eo, &amp;c. But that we be in him, by the sacrament or mysterie of his fleshe and bloud, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto vs, he testifieth him selfe saying: And this world doth not nowe see mee, but you shall see mee for I liue, and ye also shall liue, because I am in my father, and you in mee, and I in you, &amp;c. But that this vnitie in vs is naturall, he hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed saying: He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in mee, &amp; I in him. For there shall no man be in him, but in whome he shalbe, hauing onely his assumpted flesh in him, who hath taken his.</hi> By this place out of which he would buyld his destinction of naturall and spirituall abyding, the same is manifestly ouerthrowne. For the drift of that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14727:108"/>
distinction (as he confesseth) is to shewe, that Christe may abyde naturally, where he doth not abyde spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as in the wicked. But the place of Hillarie is plain, that where this naturall vnitie is, Christe abydeth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: therefore this naturall vnitie, is not in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Thus, while Maister Heskins harpeth greedily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the terme naturally, for the naturall presence of Christes bodie, he looseth his distinction, and with all his naturall presence also. For if his bodie be not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiued of the wicked, it is not naturally present in the sacrament, as all Papistes do confesse. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this natural vnitie, is after a spirituall manner, it appeareth by the last wordes of the sentence. <hi>That he in whome Christ dwelleth, hath onely the assumpted flesh of Christ in him.</hi> But this must needes be after a spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the holie and innocent fleshe of Christe is made oures, therefore this naturall vnitie he speaketh of, is not in that sense naturall, that Maister Heskins immagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but after a diuine and vnspeakable manner. For otherwise, Godly men haue fleshe of their owne, yea, and sinfull fleshe, which is not of the singular substance of the fleshe of Christe, though it be of the nature and kinde thereof, but corrupted with sinne, as his neuer was. Thus the shewe that Maister Heskins would make, by snatching at one worde misunderstoode, by a little diligence vsed in discussing the sentence, is turned alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against him, both in shewe and purpose of the author. The other place he citeth, though he citeth it truncately, contrarie to his promise in his preface, I will cite it whole, as I did before in the 20. Chap. of this book. <hi>If the worde in deede be made flesh, and we do verily eat the word made fleshe, in the Lordes meate, howe is he not to be esteemed, to dwell naturally in vs, which being borne a man, hath taken vppon him the nature of our fleshe nowe inseparable, and hath ioyned the nature of his fleshe vnto the nature of aeternitie vnder a sacrament of his fleshe to be communicated to vs. For so wee are all one, because the father is in Christ, and Christ is in vs. Therefore, whosoeuer shall denye the father to be naturally in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14727:108"/>
Christ, let him first denye, that either he is naturally in Christe, or Christ is in him. For the father being in Christ, and Christ in vs, do make vs to be one in them. Therefore if Christ did verily take vppon him the fleshe of our bodie, and that man which was borne of Marie is verely Christe, and we do verily receiue the fleshe of Christe vnder a mysterie, and by this, shalbe one, because the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in him and he in vs, how is the vnitie of will affirmed, when the naturall propertie by a sacrament, is the sacrament of perfect vnitie.</hi> In these wordes the fleshe of Christe is communicated vnto vs, but vnder a sacrament, wee eate the fleshe of his bodie, but vnder a mysterie: the naturall propertie by a sacrament, is a sacrament of perfecte vnitie.</p>
                  <p>And besides all this, marke, that this naturall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is such, as thereby we are vnited to the father, and being vnited to the father by Christ, it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that we are made partakers of eternitie, which no wicked men are, therefore wicked men receiue not Christ naturally nor spiritually, and so the distinction remaineth without a difference. But nowe we come to S. Augustine, of whome he borroweth the other parte of his distinction, <hi>Tract.</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioan. Deni<expan>
                           <am>

                        </expan> iam. Nowe at the last he expoundeth, how that may be done, which he speaketh, and what it is to eate his bodie and drinke his bloud. He that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloude, abydeth in mee &amp; I in him. This it is therefore to eat that meate, and to drinke that bloude, to abide in Christ, and to haue him abyding in him. And by this, hee that abideth not in Christ, and in whome Christe abydeth not, out of all doubt, neither eateth his fleshe spiritually, nor drinketh his his bloude, although carnally, and visibly he presse with his teeth sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christe. But rather hee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and drinketh the sacrament of so great a thing to his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, because he being vncleane, presumed to come to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Christe, which no man receiueth worthily, but hee which is cleane of whome it is sayed: blessed are the cleane of hart, for they shall see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. Augustine in these words maketh a distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the sacrament of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14727:109"/>
eating the bodie and bloud of Christ: and not onely of eating spiritually &amp; eating carnally, shewing that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the fleshe of Christ is eaten, carnally the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were vaine, if bothe were one. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole discourse of that treatise is against that carnall eating of the bodie and bloud of Christ, which M. Heskins him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe confesseth to be vnprofitable, yea, damnable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirituall eating, whereas the spirituall eating, vndoubtedly causeth eternall life. But better to vphold this distinction of Christes naturall &amp; spirituall aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he citeth a testimonie out of the 11. Sermon <hi>de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Dom. in Euangelio</hi> vnder the name of Augustine, which whether it be rightly intituled to him, <hi>I</hi> will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende.</p>
                  <p>The wordes are these: <hi>Illud etiam, &amp;c. This also that he sayeth: He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, abydeth in mee &amp; I in him, how shall we vnderstand? Can wee take them here also, of whome the Apostle sayth, that they eate and drinke their owne damnation, when they eat that fleshe and drinke that bloude? Did Iudas also, the seller and vngodly betrayer of his maister, although he did eat and drinke that first sacrament of his flesh and his bloud made with his own hands, with the rest of the disciples, as Luke the Euangelist declareth more plainly, did he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in Christ, or Christ in him? Finally, many which either with fained heart do eat that fleshe and drinke that bloud, or when they haue eaten and dronken they become Apostataes, do they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in Christ or Christ in them? But truely there is a certeine manner of eating that fleshe and drinking that bloude, after which manner he that shall eate and drinke, abydeth in Christ, &amp; Christ in him.</hi> We must receiue this authoritie, so that it may stande with all the rest of the vndoubted workes of Augustine, we must be as bold to distinguish the words, fleshe and bloud, as M. Heskins is the spirituall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall eating. By flesh and bloud aequiuocally, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the sacrament of the flesh and bloud of Christe, as where he sayeth, that Iudas did eate the sacrament of his flesh and bloud, he doth him selfe declare. And then he distinguisheth of the manner of eating, for the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14727:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as Augustine sayth) is eaten of both wicked and godly, but the matter of the sacrament, is not eaten but to eternall life. And that Iudas did not eate the breade that was the Lorde, as we alledged before, and Prosper in his collections out of Augustine plainly defineth: <q>He that disagreeth from Christe, neither eateth his breade, not drinketh his bloud, although he dayly receiue the sacrament of so excellent a matter vnto condemnation of his presumption. Wherefore, although we shoulde receiue this authoritie, yet it proueth not, that wicked men receiue the fleshe of Christ, but onely the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, which is in some manner of speaking called the fleshe of Christ, as Augustine euery where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth.</q> Finally, what a blasphemous absurditie is it, to say, that Christ dwelleth naturally in wicked men, in whome he is not spiritually, and that his flesh is there, where his quickening spirite doth not worke?</p>

And howe is that knowne? By the scriptures, vnto which he doth alwayes send them to be instructed by them.

And he doth often make mention of Manna, &amp; comparing the difference, allureth them to the faith: For if it were possible that they liued fourtie yeares without haruest &amp; corne, and other things necessarie to their liuing, much more nowe when they are come to greater things. For if in those figures they did gather without labour the things set foorth nowe truely, much more where is no death, and the fruition of true life. And euery where he maketh mention of life. For we are drawne with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire there of, and nothing is more pleasant then not to dye. For in the olde Testament long life and many dayes were promised, but
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14727:112"/>
nowe not simply length of life, but life without end is promised.</hi> Herevpon hee noteth, that we are come to greater things in the sacrament, then the Iewes did in Manna.

Otherwise they that were faithfull, did eate the same spirituall meate in Manna that we doe in the Sacrament. 1. Cor. 10. But if the reall presence be not in the sacrament (saith Maister Heskins) Manna is greater then a bare peece of breade. This comparison is topsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turuie. Chrysostome compareth bare Manna, which the wicked receiued, with the body of Christ, which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take: Maister Heskins compareth Manna to bare breade.</p>

Hieronyme speaketh of spirituall eating by faith: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by that he saith, we ascend with Christ into the parler, by which he meaneth heauen, and there aboue, we receiue the cup of the newe Testament. Maister Heskins noteth that the bread which descended from heauen is the body of our Lorde. But he must beware he say not, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body of Christ descended out of heauen. Againe, he forgetteth not to repeat that that bread is the body of Christe: but he will not see in Hieromes wordes, that Christ gaue wine to his disciples.

Ere he enter into his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, hee moueth this doubt: howe Christe doth say: the sonne of man shall ascend where he was before, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning his humanitie hee was neuer in heauen, before he spake these wordes? For answere, he bringeth a long sentence of Saint Augustine, which containeth this in effect, that Christ concerning his humanitie, would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend thither where he was before concerning his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. For by reason of the vnion of two natures in one person of Christe, that is often spoken of the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which is proper either to the diuine nature onely, or to the humane nature onely.</p>
                  <p>For exposition hee cyteth Augustine, <hi>Tr.</hi> 27. <hi>in Ioan. Quid est hoc? Hinc soluit &amp;c. What is this? by this he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, whome he knewe, by this he hath opened whereby they were offended, by this plainely, if they would vnderstand. For they thought that he would giue foorth his body: but he saide, that he would ascend into heauen whole. When you shall see the sonne of man ascending where he was before, certainly euen then at least you shall see, that he giueth not foorth his body after that manner, that you thinke: certainly euen then at least you shall vnderstand, that his grace is not consumed with bytinges.</hi> Although this place is so directly against him, that nothing can bee more plaine: yet hee is not ashamed to cyte it for his purpose. Affirming, that Augustine by these wordes, denyeth not the giuing of Christes bodye, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the giuing of his bodye. This wee confesse, but what manner of giuing doth hee denye? Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins saith: onely the giuing of it by lumpes and peeces, as the Capernaites did imagine. But that is false, for
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14727:114"/>
he denieth, not onely the giuing of Christes bodie by lumpes, but also al corporall and carnall manner of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thereof, as both these wordes aboue cited, and the whole discourse of that treatise doth shew most euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. First he saith, that Christ by telling them of his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth clearely resolue them, and open plainely where at they were offended: Which is very true. For when they should see that he carried his naturall bodie, whole into heauen, they might well perceiue, that he would not giue that bodie to be eaten after a corporall manner, either in peeces, &amp; much lesse in the whole. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giuing thereof in whole, is much more monstruous, then the giuing therof in peeces. And if there remained a corporall receipt of his whole bodie, notwithstanding his absenting thereof from the earth, the doubt by his ascention is nothing at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, but by an hundreth times more increased. Againe where he saith after his ascention: <hi>Then you shall see, that he giueth not his bodie after the manner that you thinke, then you shal vnderstand that his grace is not consumed with bitings.</hi> By these wordes, he doeth plainely determine, of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giuing, that the Iewes thought, which was corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, whether it were in whole or in peeces, and after what manner Christes bodie is giuen, namely by grace. But Maister Heskins citeth another place out of Augustine <hi>In Psalm.</hi> 98. to proue, that he denieth the giuing of his bodie by lumpes or peeces. But the place is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, if he had alledged the whole, and not cut it off in the waste. <hi>Tunc autem, &amp;c. Then when our Lorde setting foorth this had spoken of his flesh, and had saide, except a man eate my flesh, he shall not haue in him life euerlasting. Some of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie were offended and saide: This is an harde saying, who can vnderstand it? And they departed from him and walked no more with him. It seemed a harde thing to them which he saide: Except a man eate my flesh he shall not haue eternall life. They tooke it foolishly, they thought of it carnally, and they thought that our LORDE would cut certeine peeces of his bodie and giue them, and they saide: this is an harde saying.</hi> Here stayeth Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Heskins: but it followeth in Augustine.</p>

For when they had hearde, Verily, verily I say vnto you, Except you shall eate the fleshe of the sonne of man
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14727:115"/>
and drinke his bloud you shall haue no life in you: they thought they had bene called by Christ to the cruell manners of wilde beastes, and prouoked that they would eate the rawe flesh of a man, and drinke bloud, which are euen horrible to be heard: for they had not yet knowen the fourme, and most goodly dispensation of this mysterie. This also (moreouer) they did thinke: howe shall the flesh of this man giue vs eternall life? Or how can he bring vs to immortalitie? Which things when he vnderstod to whose eyes all things are bare and open: he driueth them to the faith by an other maruelous thing: Without cause (saith he) O syre are ye troubled for my words. And if you will not beleeue that life is giuen by my bodie vnto you, what will you do, when you see me flie vp into heauen? I doe not onely say that I will ascend, least you should aske againe how that should be, but you shall see it with your eyes so to be done. Therfore what will you say when you see this? Shall not this be a great argument of your madnesse? For if you thinke that my fleshe can not bring life vnto you, how shall it ascend into heauen like a birde? How shall it flye into the ayre? For this is a like impossible to mankinde. And if my fleshe beside nature shall ascende into heauen, what letteth but it may likewise beside nature giue life</hi>? Cyrill noteth (as M. Heskins saith) two vaine thoughtes of the Capernaites, one of eating raw the flesh of Christ, the other how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flesh shuld giue life, the latter he answereth at large, the other breefely, they vnderstoode not the fourme and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mysterie, by which he meaneth the spirituall &amp; mysticall maner of receiuing his bodie, cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their grosse imagination, for otherwise the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christe would not answere that doubt, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it. Maister Heskins citeth another text, to shewe the power of Christes fleshe, whiche is needelesse, for it is confessed of vs to be such, as he himselfe hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to be. <hi>Non verbo soliù, &amp;c.</hi>

Heskins will not allowe vs our glosse, that Cyril speaketh of the spirituall receiuing of Christes flesh, because he teacheth more then once, that we are ioyned to Christ not onely spiritually, but also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, and that by eating the same flesh: as though we could not truely be partakers of the fleshe of Christe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a spirituall receiuing of him, not onely in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but also by faith, without the sacrament. And Cyril saith, we doe both taste and eate his flesh, whiche of necessitie imployeth a spirituall manner of receiuing, for other tast we haue not of Christes flesh, but spirituall and by faith. In the ende of the Chapter to deliuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe &amp; his fellowes from the grosse errour of the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites, he scoffeth finely at our spirituall sifting of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament so fine, that we leaue nothing but the bare bran of the signifying signe in our owne hand, whiche is the grosse bread we feede on. If we taught a bare signe or bare bread in the sacrament, there were some place for Maister Heskins ieaste. But when we teache that presence and receiuing, which Maister Heskins so often confesseth to be onely profitable, and which we finde in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and auncient doctors, we haue the sacrament so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly boulted and fined to our hand, that we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no branne or drosse at al to be in the bread, neither yet any dregges at all in the cuppe, whatsoeuer there is in the Popish challice, which the priest hath sucked and lic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked so drie, that there is not one droppe of the bloud of Christe in it, to quench the thirst of the poore people.</p>

humanitie, where he was before, according to his Diuinitie. For he that can make this fleshe heauenly, can also make it meate of men.</hi> Maister Heskins inferreth vpon this saying, that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ascention vsed by Christ, is vaine to proue the spirituall eating, but good to proue the reall eating of his fleshe. Note here first, that he counteth the argument of his ascention expounded and vsed by Augustine in the Chapter next before, to be vaine. Secondly although Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus vseth the argument of Christes ascention, to prooue that Christes flesh being eaten, may as well giue life, as it could ascend into heauen, doth it therefore proue a reall, corporal, or carnal presence, &amp; eating of Christes bodie, which is taken away by his ascention? But he saith, <hi>The flesh of Christ was spiritually the meate of the holie fathers in the olde lawe, therefore that needed not to be proued possible, which was knowen so long before.</hi> A wise reason, as though Christ had to doe with faithfull Iewes, and not with Infidels, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew nor beleeued, any such matter: or, if hee had spoken to the Patriarches them selues, as though they had knowne and vnderstoode the mysteries of Christ so distinctly and plainly, that Christes instruction had bene needelesse to them. But Maister Heskins in all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and expositions almost, setteth downe that, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine and granted, which is the whole matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie. <hi>His meate is flesh in deede, his flesh is not eaten spiritually, &amp;c.</hi> He must haue an easie aduersarie, or else he shall gaine litle by such petition of principles. The saying of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus of Clunie, though he be but a late writer, conteineth more against him, then for him, for he denieth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of Christs flesh after the Capernaites imaginations, and teacheth, that it is <hi>Diuided without paine, parted without diminution, and eaten without consumption, because it is the spirite that quickeneth, and because his fleshe beeing so receiued and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode, giueth eternall life.</hi> What can we here vnderstand but a spirituall receiuing?</p>

Let vs say vnto him for he suffreth vs not gainsaying but desirous to know) O Lord good Maister, how doeth not the flesh profite any thing, when then hast said: except a man eate my flesh, &amp; drink my bloud, he shal not haue life in him? Doth not life profite any thing? And wherfore are we that that we are, but that we may haue eternal life, which thou doest promise by thy flesh? What then is it: it profiteth not any thing? The flesh profiteth nothing, but as they vnderstoode it. For they vnderstoode fleshe so, as it is rent in peeces in a dead bodie, or solde in the shambles, not as it is quickened by the spirit: It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so saide: the flesh profiteth nothing, as it is saide: knowledge puffeth vp a man.

But the spirite by the flesh hath done some thing for our health. The fleshe was that vessel, marke what it had in it, not what it was. The Apostles were sent, did their flesh profite nothing? If the flesh of the Apostles profited vs not, could our Lordes flesh not profite vs? For how came the sound of the word vnto vs but by the voyce of the flesh? From whence the stile? From whence the writing? All these workes be of the flesh, but the spirite mouing it as his instrument. Therefore it is the spirite which quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.

truncately as the heretiques do, but wholy, that the reader should not be defrauded of S. Augustines right meaning, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this scripture. And here again he repeateth his rotten distinction, that Christ giueth not his flesh by lumpes &amp; peeces, yet giueth it corporally, &amp; that S. Augustine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth none otherwise. But as long a sentence as he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he hath omitted the very interpretation of his text in hand. Which Augustine maketh in these wordes: <hi>Quid est spiritus &amp; vita? Spiritualiter intelligenda sunt.</hi> What is spirite and life spiritually to be vnderstanded: neither is there one worde in all that treatise for the corporall presence, or receiuing. And yet we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that Christ truly giueth vs his fleshe, &amp; we are truely fed therewith, but not after a corporall maner, but after a spiritual &amp; vnspeakable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Chrysostome is cited hom. 46. <hi>In Ioan. Quid igitur? caro, &amp;c. What then? Doth the fleshe profite nothing? He speaketh not of the very flesh, God forbid, but of them that carnally take those things that are spoken. And what is it to vnderstand carnally?

He that eateth not my flesh, and drinketh not my bloud, hath no life in him selfe. How doeth the fleshe profite nothing without the which no man can liue?

But spiritual vnderstanding by M.

But Chrysostom as we sawe in the Chapter before, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined otherwise of spirituall vnderstanding of this scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, namely, that the sayings must not be taken simply as they are spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but as mysteries be considered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward eyes.

But that faith requireth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed: the bread is the bodie, the cup is the bloud. In the mind of some man such a thought may arise, Our Lorde Iesus Christ we know whence he receiued flesh, namely of the virgin Marie, he was nourished, grewe vp, was buried, rose again, &amp; ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, thither he lifted vp his bodie, from whence he shall come to iudge both the quick &amp; the dead. There he is now siting at the right hand of the father, how is therfore bread his bodies? or that which is in the cuppe how is it his bloud? Brethren, therefore those things are called sacraments, because one thing is seene in them, another thing is vnderstanded. That which is seene, hath a corporall forme, that which is vnderstoode hath a spirituall fruite.</hi> What plainnes is in this place, except it be against transubstantiation, and the reall presence, let the readers iudge. And withal I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them, that M. Hesk. citeth it farre otherwise then
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14727:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is in Augustine, beside y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he leaueth out that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, &amp; maketh all the matter as plain as a pack staffe, which are these words: <hi>Corpus ergo Christi, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>Therfore if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilt vnderstand the body of Christ, heare the Apostle say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the faithful: you are the bodie of Christ &amp; his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

In verie deede, if after Christe hath sayde, the bread and wine are his bodie &amp; bloude, any man shuld rise vp &amp; saye, they are not his bodie &amp; bloud at al, we might well iudge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he spake by the spirite of Sathan: as when Christe sayeth, drinke ye all of this, &amp; the Pope sayth to the people, there shall none of you all drink of

this, we may easely acknowlege the spirit of Antichrist. But we (whome he calleth sacramentaries) doe with all reuerence &amp; humilitie confesse, that the bread &amp; the wine ministred according to Christes institution, are the body &amp; bloud of Christ, in such sence, as he saide they were. And we say with S. Augustine: <q>
                        <hi>Per similitudinem Christus multa est quae per proprietatem non est. Per similitudinem &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae est Christus, &amp; ostium est Christus, &amp; lapis angularis est Christus, &amp;c.</hi> By similitude, Christ is manie things, which he is not by propertie. By similitude the rocke is Christ, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dore is Christ, the corner stone is Christ, &amp;c.</q> Wherfore, we affirme nothing contrarie to the words of Christ, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together agreeable to his meaning. For contrarietie of Sacramentaries among them selues, he citeth a saying of Luther written in his frowardnesse, that there shoulde be eyght seuerall disagreeing spirites among the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, from which, if you take away Carolostadius, Swenkfeldius, Campanus, and the eight without name, which is belike H. N. opinion, that euery man may think of it what he list, whose opinions the godly, whome hee calleth sacramentaries, did euer more detest as wicked &amp; vngodly: there remaineth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretation of Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, of the wordes of Christ, This signifieth my bodie: &amp; of Oecolampadius, This is a token of my bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So is the iudgement of Melancthon: this is the participation of my bodie: And of Caluine, yet not as Heskins like a lewde lyer slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, to say, <hi>This is the verie substance of my bodie, but it is not my bodily substance,</hi> but agreeing in effect with all the rest, that the verie bodie of Christ is receiued, but not after a carnall or bodily manner, but after a spirituall &amp; vnspeakable manner. As for the fiue sectes numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lutherans, which dissent from vs in this point, we make none accompt of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus, where M. Hesk hath gathered, as he reckoneth,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14727:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sixteene seueral sectes, foure of them being condemned of vs for hereticall, with the authors of them, fiue agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the papistes in the carnall presence, and Luthers owne secte, if he dissent from them, as Heskins maketh him to doe, the sixt, tenne are of vs generally refused. The other sixe, that remaine in Maister Heskins num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are falsely forged to disagree, when they holde all one thing in effect, although they expresse the same thing in diuerse formes of wordes, as it is not possible for diuerse interpreters, though they agree in sense and interpretation, to iump all in one forme of words, for then all commentaries should be one. But as God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his giftes diuersely, some expound the scriptures briefely, some more at large, some more plainly, some more obscurely: so all these, and fiue hundred more, (God be thanked) learned men either in writing, or in preaching, haue shewed the vnderstanding of Christes wordes, hardly fiue of them agreeing in all termes and phrases, yet all moste sweetely consenting in one sense, and meaning, which consent and agreement is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, when it is vttered in so many diuerse formes of wordes. And yet, to take away all cauels and flaunders, all the churches for the moste parte in Fraunce, Scotland, Sauoy, Heluetia, Germanie, Hungarie, Piemont, Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, &amp;c. beside the persecuted Churches of Italians, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards, and others, haue subscribed to one forme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, concerning not onely the sacrament, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principall poyntes of religion, which wee do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise receiue in this Church of England. And if disagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men among themselues, were a matter of such importance, it were no harde thing, to shewe the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the schoole doctours among the Papists, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about other matters, but euen about the manner of the presence of Christes bodie in the sacrament, &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. If you say, all these, whome you reiecte, as the Lutherans in this poynt, the Swinkefeldians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes, Libertines, Henrinicolaites, and such other, do all disagree with you, from the Catholike church of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:14727:121"/>
Rome, therefore you are all together naught. By this reason, all Christianitie might bee condemned of the Iewes and Gentiles, because so many sectes and heresies as be vnder the name of Christianitie, together with the true Church of Christe, be all against Iudaisme &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilisme. But agreeing or disagreeing of men among themselues, is a weake argument, to proue or disproue any thing, onely agreeing with the trueth, is a sure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to allowe, and disagreeing from the trueth, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine argument to refuse, either men, or matter propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them.</p>

First, it is a trope or figure, to saye, the cupp, for that which is conteined in the cup, vnlesse they will say, that the cupp, of what metall or matter so euer it was, was likewise transubstantiated into the bloud of Christe.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, where he sayeth: this cuppe is the newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or couenant, he must either acknowledge a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, this cuppe signifieth the newe testament, or else he must make the newe testament to be nothing else but a cuppe.</p>
                  <p>Finally, where he sayeth, this cuppe is the newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in my bloud, except hee acknowledge a trope or figure, he will vtterly denye that, which is in the cup, to be the bloud of Christe.</p>

                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:14727:122"/>And out of all controuersie, this manner of speache v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Saint Luke and Saint Paule, is a manifest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the wordes vsed by S.

This breade and this cuppe receiued of you, shall assure you, that you are truely incorporated into my bodie, &amp; so made partakers of eternall life. This interpretation hath in it nothing farre fetched, or strange, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of Christ, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vsuall maner of speaking in the scripture.</p>
                  <p>But nowe M. Heskins will proue, that the wordes of Christ are to be vnderstanded without trope or figure, by the slaunders of the Infidels, which defamed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the primitiue Church, for eating the fleshe of men and of children, as appeareth <hi>in Euseb. lib.</hi> 5 <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. in the storie of Blandina and Attalus martyrs: when they did eate the flesh of Christ. But none of them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Eusebius, nor yet Iustine, Origen, Tertullian, or any other that haue written Apollogies, defended the Christians, by the commaundement of Christ, to eat his bodie, but vtterly denyed and derided the slaunder, that they were sayde, to eat the fleshe of men or children, as they did other slaunders, which had no ground nor si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of trueth, as that they worshipped an Asses head, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they companyed together in the dark like brute beastes, and such like: whereas, if they had eaten the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fleshe of Christ, as the Papists teache, they woulde neither haue simply denyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eating of a mans flesh, nor yet haue spared to shewe, how it was eaten vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine, to auoide all crueltie and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes. As for the legend of S. Andrewes passion, which M. Heskins sayeth was written <hi>per Presbyteros &amp; diaconos Achaie,</hi> is of as good credit, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of Beuis of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14727:122"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like I say of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fable of Amphilochius a newe found olde writer: concerning the Iewe, that sawe a childe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided when the sacrament was broken. The Legend and festiuall haue many such miracles. But why did he not see a man diuided, seeing Christe is not nowe a childe, but a man? Belike the authours of those miracles thought, that if they feigned him to be a little child like Tom Thumb, their miracles should be more credited, that such a one should be conteined in their cake, rather then a tall man of perfect stature. O impudent asses! But it proueth wel the reall presence (saith M. Hes.) that Auerrois a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher saith: <hi>I haue walked ouer the world, I haue found diuers sectes, and yet haue I found none so foolish a sect. is is the sect of the Christians. For they deuour with their teeth their God whome they worship.</hi> Hereof it is easie to perceiue (saith he) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fame was, that they did receiue and eate Christ, whom they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. But herein M. Hes. bewrayeth either his falshood, or his ignoraunce. For hee speaketh as though Auerrois were an ancient Philosopher, that liued in the dayes of the primitiue Church, whereas he was a Spanish Mahometist, or rather Athist, not past three or foure hundreth yeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, when Poperie was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest pride, and Idolatrie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the face of the earth. His saying therfore proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but how great an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popish Idolatrie did giue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heathen, Turkes, and Iewes. And whereas Iustinus in his Apollogie to the Emperour, declareth whatsoeuer was done in the assemblies of the Christians, he well dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them of all slaunders that were raised against them, but defendeth not the corporall eating of mans flesh by the commaundement of Christ, although he confesse that they receiued that breade not as common bread, nor as common drinke: but as their flesh and bloud was nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by that foode, so they were persuaded that it was the flesh and bloud of Iesus Christ for the spiritual foode of their soules.</p>
                  <p>As for the curse that Rupertus threatneth to them that adde vnto the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pertaineth not to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> giue the true sense of the word of God, whether it be in more
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14727:123"/>
wordes or fewer. And whereas Rupertus saith these words of Christ, I am a vine, and this is my body, be no like spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: I confesse, they are not in euery respect, bicause in the one he did institute a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in the other he taught as by a similitude, the true end, vse, and signification of the sacrament. Yet are they not altogether vnlike, bicause they are both figuratiue, and so iudged and compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the auncient Fathers. But Rupertus will proue by two reasons, that the latter is no figure. First, bicause in the former, there is a continuation of the Allegorie, which proueth it to be a figure, in the other there is none such. This is a fond reason, for both we haue shewed a continuation of the trope, where he saide, this cup is the newe Testament, and although there were none, yet that can not exclude a figure, no more then when baptisme is called regeneration, when the lamb is called the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which be sacramentall speaches and such like, where no continuation of the figure followeth. The other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Rupertus, M. Heskins diuideth into two parts. The first is, to note the enunciation of both scriptures, for he doth not take a braunch of a vine, and say, I am this vine, or this vine is my body, but he saith of the bread, this is my body. A strong reason: he saith (as <hi>signanter</hi>) by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine demonstration of substaunce, and speaking of the same sacrament, That rocke was Christe, and in the time when it was a sacrament, it was and might be truely said, pointing to the rocke, this is Christ, and to the water issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it, this is the bloud of Christ, and so no doubt, Christ spake by his spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in the consciences of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The second part of Rupertus reason is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes which followe, which is giuen for you, &amp;c. can not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the figure, therefore the sense of that place is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not figuratiue. But contrariwise, these wordes can not be applied to the sacrament, therefore the speach is not proper but figuratiue, and shewe howe the breade and the cup are the body and bloud of Christe, namely, as his body is broken and his bloud shed for vs, for the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the sacrament standeth in his passion, by which his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14727:123"/>
body and bloud offered in sacrifice for our sinnes, are made a spirituall foode of our soules. The conference that Rupertus maketh betweene the words of Christ, and the wordes of the serpent, I passe ouer, as containing no argument in them for the proofe of M. Heskins bill, but onely shewing the corrupt iudgement of the authour, whose reasons I am content to weigh, but I esteeme not his authoritie, as being a late prop of the Popish church.</p>

I will nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the same after his Latine translation, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewe M. Heskins falsification. <hi>Cum autem &amp;c. When he that is ouerseer hath giuen thankes, and all the people haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, they which are called Deacons with vs, do distribute to euery one that is present, that they may take part in the breade in which thankes is giuen, and of the wine and water, and carie it to those which are not present. And this foode which is called thankes giuing: Of which it is not lawfull for any other to take part, but he that beleeueth those things to be true which are taught by vs, and which is washed in the lauer vnto remission of sinnes and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and so liueth as Christ hath taught. Neither do we take these thinges as common bread and a common cup: but euen as by the word of God Iesus Christ our sauiour being incarnate, had both flesh and bloud: so we are taught that the foode through the prayer of his word being consecrated by thankesgiuing, of which our flesh &amp; bloud by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh &amp; bloud of Iesus Christ, which was incarnate. For the Apostles in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries, which are called Gospels, haue taught that he did so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund them, That when he had taken bread &amp; giuen thanks, he said, Do this in remembrance of me, this is my body.

                        </gap>giuing,</hi> not knowing wher to place it. The cause of this falsification is, for that he can not abide, that the food after it is consecrated, shuld nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish our bodies, which Iustinꝰ doth most expresly affirme. But before I proceede to his collections, I will gather my selfe out of this place, that which the Papistes wil not wel like of, and yet although they would burst for anger, thei can not auoyde, but that they be necessarie collections. First, that there was no priuate Masse in his dayes, for all that were present did communicate. Secondly, that the people, as well as the ministers, receiued in both kindes. Thirdly, that the things wherof they were partakers, were bread, wine, and water, which after they were consecrated, were the nourishment of their bodies. Now let vs heare M. Hes. collection for the reall presence. First he saith not, these things were signes, figures, tokens: therefore they were none. A tried argument of the authoritie, of a man negatiuely. Secondly he saith, they were taught that by consecration, they were made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of Gods worde, the flesh and bloud of Christ that was incarnated. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the same likewise. Thirdly M. Hes saith, the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was as certaine to the primitiue Church, as the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14727:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So saith not Iustinus, neither that the sacrament was the same substance of naturall flesh and bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus that was incarnat by that diuine &amp; wonderful means, by which he was incarnate, and this do we most constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue. And therefore here is no plaine place for the proclamer to proue the reall presence, whereof Iustine speaketh none otherwise, then the proclamer did speak, &amp; beleeue while he liued.</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins, although there was neuer seene a more impudent falsifier of the Doctours sayings and meanings, and euen in this place as I haue plainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, most lewdly corrupted the authours wordes by false translation: yet he shameth not to slaunder holy and learned Cranmer of the same crime. But what should an harlot do? but after she hath plaied the strumpet, call euery honest woman shee meeteth whore first? Cranmer (saith he) reporteth, as though Iustine should say, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is but called the body of Christe. This is first an intollerable lye. For Cranmer saith, it is called the body of Christ, he saith not it is but called so, that is only called so. Secondly Cranmer saide out of Iustinus, that these creatures after they be consecrated do nourish the bodies, and are chaunged into them. And therein he saith most truely, and as the wordes of Iustine are, and as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine translation is, and Maister Heskins most falsely hath corrupted them, as I shewed before. Of which falsificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being guiltie in his owne conscience, he fleeth from his former Latine translation which is true in this point, to the translation of Petrus Nannius a Papist, which yet helpeth him not, but by false pointing and displacing of the wordes, <hi>Ita quoque per preces verbi illius, cibum ex quo caro nostra &amp; sanguis per immutationem aluntur cum benedictus fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, Iesu ipsius incarnati, carnem &amp; sanguinem didicimus esse.</hi> But the Greeke Article is so placed, as it can abide no such patcherie: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is a worshipfull Alexander, that gaue you the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this discourse by his wordes. But let the occasion goe, we will looke to the matter. First he rehearseth halfe a side of M. Iewels wordes against the adoration of the sacrament, out of which he gathereth two arguments, the one thus: <hi>Christ neuer gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to worship the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ergo, it is not to be done.</hi> This argument he answereth is negatiue, and therfore concludeth nothing. But vnder correction of his great Logike, when God chargeth vs to do that onely, which he commaundeth, an argument of negatiues of Gods commaundement concludeth al things to be vnlawfull, which God hath not commaunded. Hee bringeth examples of many that worshipped Christe, yet had they no commaundement of him so to doe. A great number worshipped him not as God, but as the Prophete of God, for which they had commandement in the lawe, and they that worshipped him as God most especially. But M. Heskins will make the like argument, <hi>Christ gaue the sacrament of his body to the Apostles onely, and gaue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that all people should receiue it indifferently, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought not to be done.</hi> Reuerend M. Doctour, I denye your antecedent, for ye can not proue, that he gaue it only to his Apostles, nor that he gaue no commaundement, for he gaue an expresse commaundement to continue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same ceremonie vntil his comming againe, as S. Paule doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie. Therefore your argument is as like, as an apple is like an oyster. But to passe ouer the rest of his babbling against the proclamers learning, too well knowne, to bee defaced by such an obscure Doctours censure: I come to his second argument. <hi>S. Paule that tooke the sacrament at
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14727:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christes hand, and as he had taken it, deliuered it to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, neuer willed adoration or godly honour to be giuen to it.</hi> This argument he will not vouchsafe to aunswere, as conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing, but he denyeth the antecedent, saying, <hi>It is false, that S. Paul deliuered no more to the Corinthians then Christ did.</hi> First he will make Paule a lyar, when he saide, that which I receiued I deliuered, &amp;c. But howe will he proue that he deliuered more then Christ did? If you can spare laughter in reading, I could not in writing. Forsooth <hi>S. Paule deliuered to the Corinthians, that the vnwoorthie receiuer shall be guiltie of the body and bloud of Christ, whereas Christ when he instituted the sacrament gaue no such lawe.</hi> O noble Diuine! as though that if Christ at his supper had vsed no longer discourse of this sacrament, then those fewe words, which the Euangelistes doe rehearse, as a summe thereof, yet it was not necessarily to be gathered, that the vnworthie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer contemning the body &amp; bloud of Christ, which is offered to him, is guiltie of haynous iniurie against the same, and therefore it is necessarie that euery one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it, should examine him selfe that hee receiue it worthily. Whether Christ receiued Iudas or no, which is not agreed vpon: but if he did, knowing him by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge to be a reprobate, though not yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to the knowledge of man, hee gaue vs none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to receiue notorious wicked persons, whome wee as men knowe to be vnwoorthie without repentance.</p>
                  <p>But to make the matter out of doubt, <hi>Saint Paul, though not by the terme of adoration, yet willed honour to be giuen to the sacrament. When he saith, let a man examine him selfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup. For a man cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him self without great honor giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the sacrament. And for more manifest proofe, Saint Paule referreth the honour or dishonour that is done by woorthie or vnwoorthie receiuing, not to the grace of GOD, or merite of Christes passion, but to the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Who so eateth this breade, and drinketh this cuppe of the Lorde vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the bodie and bloud of Christ.</hi> Nay rather, hee referreth the honour or contempt of the sacrament to the body and bloud of Christe, whose sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14727:126"/>
this is, as the wordes are plaine. But who would thinke that Maister Heskins would play the foole so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiously, to abuse his reader with ambiguities and ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocations? as though there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene adoration and honouring, that is, giuing of due reuerence vnto the sacraments, and worshipping them as Gods. But S. Augustine (I trowe) helpeth him, <hi>Ep.</hi> 118. <hi>ad Ian. Placuit &amp;c. It hath pleased the holy Ghost, that in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of so great a sacrament, the body of Christ should enter into the mouth of a Christian man before other meates.</hi> I holde him as blinde as a beetle, that seeth not honour in this place to signifie reuerence, which is giuen to holy things, and not adoration, which pertayneth onely to GOD. His last reason to proue, that Saint Paul taught the adoration of the sacrament, is that, which is the whole controuersie, that Saint Paule taught the carnall presence, but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to bee proued afterward.</p>

                     </note> that it is to bee honoured, that is to say, reuerenced as a holy ceremonie. And none otherwise then the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of baptisme, as wee shall see by his proofes. First, Chrysostom being one that is named by the Bishop, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so cleere mention thereof, as M. Heskins thinkes, the reader will maruell, hee was not ashamed to name him. And what saith he? <hi>De sacerdotio lib.</hi> 6. thus he writeth: <hi>Quum autem ille &amp;c. But when he (meaning the Prieste) hath called vpon the holy Ghost, and hath finished that sacrifice, most full of horrour and reuerence, when the common Lord of all men is daily handled in his handes: I aske of thee in what order shall wee place him? Howe great integritie shall we require of him? How great religion? For, consider what handes those ought to be, which doe minister, what manner of tong, that speaketh those words. Finally, then what soule, that soule ought not to be purer and holier, which hath receiued that so great and so worthie a spirit? At that time eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angels do set by the Priest, and all the order of heauenly powers
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14727:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lifteth vp cryes, and the place neere to the altar in honour of him which is offered, is full of the companies of Angels. Which thing a man may fully beleeue, euen for the greate sacrifice which is there finished. And I truly did heare a certain man reporting, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wonderfull olde man, and one to whome many mysteries of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations are opened by God, did tell him, that God did once vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to shewe him such a vision, and that for that time he sawe as farre as the sight of man could beare, soudenly a multitude of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels clothed in shining garments compassing the altar, finally so bowing the heade, as if a man should see the souldiers stand when the king is present, which thing I do easily beleeue.</hi> In these words Chrysostom doth hyperbolically amplifie the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Ministers office, vnto which no man is sufficient. But notwithstanding, he rehearseth a vision by hearesay, of angels reuerencing the presence of God, to aduance the dignitie of the ministerie, yet speaketh he not one worde, that the sacrament is to be worshipped &amp; adored as God. And therefore M. Heskins maketh a poore consequence, the ministration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament is honourable: <hi>ergo,</hi> much more a man ought to honour the sacrament. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of baptisme is honourable, doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that the water of baptisme is to be worshipped as God? An other testimonie he cyteth out of Chrysostomes Liturgie, which he calleth his Masse, which though it be out of doubt none of Chrysostomes penning, yet maketh it nothing for the adoration of the sacrament: <hi>Thou that fittest aboue with the father, and art here present with vs inuisibly, vouchsafe to giue vnto vs thy vndefiled body, and thy precious bloud, and by vs to al the people. Then the Priest adoreth, and the Deacon in the place where he is, thrice sayth secretly. God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me a sinner. And all the people likewise with godlinesse and reuerence do adore.</hi> It is said here they doe adore, but not the sacrament, but God. For here haue passed no words of the consecration as yet by the Papistes owne rule, therefore this adoration can not be referred to the sacrament. And yet M. Heskins is so blockish to gather, that he fitteth in heauen, and yet is here present, as though he were present in body before they had prayed that he would giue them
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14727:127"/>

This body did the wisemen reuerence in the manger, and being both vngodly men and barbarous, after they had ended a long iourney with much feare and trembling did worship it. Let vs therfore that are citizens of heauen folow those strangers. For they when they did see only that manger and cottage, and none of those things which thou nowe beholdest, came with great reuerence and horrour. But thou seest it not in the manger but in the altar, not a woman which holdeth it in her armes, but the Priest present, and the spirite so aboundantly powred vpon the sacrifice that is set foorth.

Wherefore it is intollerable, that M.

For none of these three can be concluded out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same places.

sacraments as though Christ were present in them, as he is in heauen, for that he acknowledgeth not, but only a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall presence, as hath beene shewed often already, &amp; more shalbe, as occasion serueth. And he saith we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or reuerence the flesh of Christe in the mysteries, he saith not we worship the mysteries as the flesh of Christ. Finally we worship Christ in the sacramentes as we do in the word, and yet we imagine no carnal presence in either of them. Yea, we honor him, his ministers, both ciuil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and Ecclesiasticall teachers, &amp; yet we haue none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as transubstantiated into Christ. The last is S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine <hi>In Psal.</hi> 98. <hi>Adore ye the footestole of his feete, for it is holie. But see brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what he biddeth vs to adore. In another place the scripture saith: Heauen is my seate, &amp; earth is the footestoole of my feete. Then he commandeth vs to adore the earth, because he said in an other place, that it is the footestoole of God. And how shall we adore the earth? when the scripture saith plainely, thou shalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Lord thy God, and here he saith, adore his footestoole. And expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to me what is his footstoole, he saith: the earth is my foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole, I am made doutful, I am afraide to adore the earth, least he condemne me, which hath made heauen and earth. Againe, I am afraid not to adore the footstoole of my Lord, because the Psalme saith to me, Adore ye his footstoole. Thus wauering vp and down I turne me vnto CHRISTE, because I seeke him here, and I finde howe without impietie the earth may bee adored, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impietie his footestoole may be adored. For he hath taken on him earth of the earth, because flesh is of the earth, &amp; of the flesh of Marie be tooke flesh. And because he walked here in that flesh, and gaue that flesh to be eaten of vs to saluation: And no man eateth that flesh except, he do first adore it, it is found out how such a footestoole of the Lord may be adored, and we should not onely not offend in adoring, but offend in not adoring.</hi> The Papists make no small accompt of this place, and yet there is no place in al S. Augustines workes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh more against them then this, if it be wel marked with that whiche fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. For first he saith not that the sacrament must be, or may be worshipped as God, but that the flesh of Christ may be worshipped as the earth, which is Gods footstool,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14727:128"/>
whereunto Diuine honour is not to be giuen, but reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as to an holie thing, &amp; no man eateth his flesh, but he that before hath worshipped it, not as really present in the sacrament, but he that hath reuerently acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his incarnation, passion, and giuing of his flesh to be holsome vnto vs. But to put al out of doubt, he so maketh the sacrament Gods footestoole, that he doeth expressely denie speaking in the person of Christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his bodie which was seene and crucified should be eaten, but a sacrament which being spiritually vnderstood, should quicken them or giue them life. The place hath beene already once or twise set downe. <hi>Non hoc corpus quod videtis mandicaturi estis, &amp;c.</hi> You shall not eate this bodie which you see, &amp;c. The corporall presence therefore being flatly taken away by S. Augustine in that place, it is easie to see what kinde of worship is left to the sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But he is cited againe <hi>Lib. Confess</hi> 9. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. speaking of his mother. <hi>Illa imminente, &amp;c She when the day of her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was at hand, tooke no care to haue her bodie sumptuously buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

She did not giue vs in charge any of these thinges, but onely she desired that remembrance shold be made of her at thine altar, which she without any dayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission had serued, from whom she knew that holie sacrifice to be dispensed, by which the hand writing that was against vs, was put out, by which triumph was obteined against the enimie.</hi> Maister Heskins would learne of the proclaymer what seruice she did, was it not the seruice of Christ her Lord God? Yes, and why did she it at the altar, and not in heauen? Haue you heard of such a blind question? While she liued on earth, although she worshipped him that is in heauen, yet she serued him in the place appointed for publike prayer and administration of the sacramentes, and she serued him with prayer and thankesgiuing, not with knocking and kneeling to the sacrament, which is the thing he would haue if he could tell howe to bring it about: as for the carnall presence it was spoken off euen in the place next before cited out of the 48.

A substantiall proofe I promise you. It may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue they had some vse of bread &amp; wine in their religion, but no adoration of it. For the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men did not take bread and wine to be Ceres and Bacchus, but Ceres and Bacchus to be the Gods of bread and wine. S.

Heskins after his accustomed manner, hath falsified the worde by wrong translation, to deceiue the vnlearned. For he hath transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Quamuis amplectamur sacramentum,</hi> although we honor the sacrament. Yet again S. Augustine is cited <hi>In Psal.</hi> 48. <hi>Edent pauperes, &amp;c. The poore shall eate and be satisfied. What eate they? That which the faithful know. How shall they be satisfied? In following the passions of their Lord, and not without cause taking their price. What do the riche? They also do ease: but how do they eate? All the riche of the earth haue eaten and worshipped. He saith not, they haue eaten and are satisfied: but they haue eaten and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. They do in deede adore God, but they will not shewe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly humanitie, they eate and adore, these eate and are satisfied, yet all do eate.</hi> Augustine saith expresly the rich adore God, but of adoring the sacrament he speaketh neuer a worde. Last of all he citeth him <hi>Ep.</hi> 120. <hi>ad Honoratum. Neque enim frustra ita distincti sunt, &amp;c. Neither are they without purpose so
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14727:129"/>
distincted, that before it was said of the poore: The poore shall eate and be satisfied: And here all the riche of the earth haue eaten and haue worshipped. For they also are brought to the table of Christ, and receiue of his bodie and his bloud, but they doe adore onely, they are not also satisfied, because they doe not followe. For eating the poore men, they disdaine to be poore because Christ suffered for vs leauing v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I wil passe ouer and come to Leo: sauing that I wil note, that though Paschasius alledgeth Hilarie, Ambrose, Augustine, Cyrill, and the counsell of Ephesus, he doeth but wrest their sayings, as the Papists do now to vphold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> errour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was not so olde in his time. The wordes of Leo are <hi>Ep</hi> 22. <hi>ad Constant. Separentur &amp; huiusmodi, &amp;c. Let such men be separated from the holy member of the bodie of Christ, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the Catholique libertie suffer the yoke of the vnfaithfull to be laide vpon it. For they are to be accounted without the house of Gods grace, and without the sacrament of mans health, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the nature of our flesh in Christ, doe both speake against the Gospell, and striue against the Symbole. Neither doe they perceiue through their blindenesse, that they are brought into such a steepe place, that they stand neither in the truth of the Lords passion, nor of his resurrection for both is made voide in our sauiour, if flesh of our kinde be not beleeued to be in him.

That not as much as of the tongues of infantes, the veritie of the bodie and bloud of Christ is vnspoken of among the sacraments of the common faith: for in that mystical distribution of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall foode, this thing is giuen foorth, this thing is receiued, that receiuing the vertue of that heauenly meate, we may goe into his fleshe, which was made our fleshe.</hi>

And that he allowed no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, it is manifest by that he saith in the same place, that the Bishop doth after consecration, cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the vndiuided bread, &amp; speaking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, doth often affirme, that by those symboles or signes, wee are changed into God &amp; Christ, meaning, we are renewed by his spirite, but neuer affirmeth, the bread &amp; wine to bee turned into the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ.

great &amp; worthie of greatest things, and what remedie had shee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her infirmitie? For nowe the secreat is disclosed, when shee had dispaired of all other, shee flyeth to the Phisition of all men, and taking the solitarinesse of the night, when the disease had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her a little respite, shee fell downe with faith, before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, and with a lowde voice and all her might, shee called vppon him which is worshipped at is, and vnto him shee rehearsed all the myracles that he had done of olde time.</hi> M. Heskins imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, that it was such an altare as they haue in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Churches, which is vntrue, for it was a table, &amp; men stoode round about it, as is to be proued by many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of antiquitie. Secondly, he immagineth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament was hanged ouer the altare to be worshipped, as it is among them, but that is vtterly false: for it was receiued at such time as it was consecrated, except some remanents that were kept to be eaten. Therfore, though shee made her prayer at the altare, shee made no prayer to any thing vppon the altare, but to God, whome shee did worship and reuerence, and whose mysteries shee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to receiue at the same altare. Therefore M. Heskins falsifieth Gregories words, which are these: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. but thus they are turned by him into latine, <hi>ante altare cum fide procubuit, &amp; illum quem super altare veneraba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp;c.

And if her hand had layde vp any where, any parte of the figures of the precious bodie, or of the bloud, that shee mingled with teares, O marueilous thing! and immediatly departed feeling health.</q> By these wordes it appeareth, that shee brought this remanent of the sacrament with her, which Gregorie calleth <gap reason="foreign">

of the bodie and bloud of Christ, and not the verie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie of Christe: and those shee worshipped not, but wett them with teares, whether superstitiously let the Papistes iudge, for they them selues will allowe no such fashions, nor yet reseruation for such purposes, but as for adoration of the sacrament, which is the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, here is none spoken of in this place. After this, he toucheth the facte of Satyrus the brother of S.

Although Satyrus as a young nouice, not throughly instructed in Christian religion, cannot simply be defended, though he may be excused, howsoeuer by his brother Ambrose he is highly commended. Then followed <hi>Eusebius Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us Hom. Pascal. Because he woulde take away his assumpted bodie from our eyes, and carrie it into heauen, it was needefull that this day he should consecrate vnto vs the sacrament of his bodie and bloud: vs coleretur iugiter per mysterium quod semel offerebatur in precium: that it might be continually worshipped or exercised by a mysterie:</hi> (for <hi>colere</hi> signifieth both) <hi>whiche was once offered for our price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>M. Heskins gathereth hereof, that the same bodie, should be honoured by mysterie, whose visible presence not his bodie, was taken away from the earth. But Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius sayeth, not onely that he would take his bodie from our sight, but also place it in heauen, and in steede ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he leaueth the sacrament of his bodie and bloude, which no man doubteth, but it ought to be honoured, as so high a mysterie deserueth, but not as God or Christe. The other saying of Eusebius, which hee addeth, doeth shewe, howe it is to be honoured: <hi>When thou commest to the reuerende altare to be satisfied with heauenly meates, beholde with faith the holy bodie and bloud of thy God, honour it, wonder at is, touch it with thy minde, take it with the hande of thy heart, and cheefely, receiue it with the inwarde draught.</hi> What can be layed more plainely for the spirituall receiuing, and the like reuerence to be giuen to so holie a sacrament? But because M. Heskins thinketh this saying to make more
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14727:132"/>
against him, then for him, therefore he sayeth, to auoyde cauilling, Eusebius proceedeth sone after in these words: <hi>Sicut autem, &amp;c. As any man comming to the faith of Christe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wordes of baptisme, is yet in the bands of the olde deis, but when the words are spoken, is foorthwith deliuered from all dreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iuell, what else? But if it be rightly vnderstood, it is a plaine place against M. Hesk. for he sheweth the change or transubstantiation that is in the Lordes supper, to be the same, that it is in baptisme, which is spirituall, and not carnall, and so doth verie fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compare them together, or else his similitude were to no purpose, if it were not to shewe by that which is don in baptisme, what is likewise done in the other sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>M. Heskins still blattereth of a bare figure, which is of vs always denyed. Consequently he citeth Bernarde, whose authoritie I leaue vnto him, being a burgesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lower house, in which he hath many voices, as he hath neuer a one in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper house, though he wrest their spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches most iniuriously. To confirme some phrase of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, he rehearseth certein phrases of the old writers like to them in words, but not in sense, which haue bene aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered alreadie, as <hi>Hierom. ad Hed. qu.</hi> 2. <hi>Our Lord Iesus is the feaster, &amp; the feast: he that eateth and which is eaten.</hi> Ambrose <hi>in praepara. ad miss.</hi> which is none of his, but falsly intituled to him: <hi>Thou art the Priest and the sacrifice, wonderfully and vnspeakably appointed.</hi> And Augustine <hi>in Psal.</hi> 33. <hi>He was borne in his owne hands.</hi> But he leaueth out a worde, which expoundeth both Augustine, and all the rest that speake so: <hi>quodam modo,</hi> after a certeine manner Christ was borne in his owne hands, is the feast &amp; that which is eaten, &amp; the sacrifice.

the sacrament is not to be adored.

But if it were generally beleeued &amp; vsed in all ages before, as M Hesk. would beare vs in hande, what neede had Pope Honorius to commaund it?

He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it a phantasie, like to that which ioyned with aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, pulled downe all the Abbeys in England. The like phantasie, he sayth, might moue vs, not to honour Christ in heauen, and much more the Apostles that honoured Christ in the flesh, percase not sufficiently discerning the humanitie from the Deitie, and so likewise others that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14727:133"/>
worshipped Christ &amp; yet doe, euen some of the proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers schollers, vnderstand not these quiddities. Shal they therefore fly the honor of Christ in heauen? A wise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, betweene Christe both God and man, who no doubt is to be worshipped both as God &amp; as the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of God &amp; man, and the accidents of breade &amp; wine, or bread and wine, when they are not consecrated. Christ in the flesh is to be worshipped, because he was incarnate and ioyned to the humanitie in a personall vnion, but he is not to be worshipped in bread &amp; wine, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread &amp; wine, because he is neither impanated, nor inuinated, nor inaccidentated, that is, not ioyned to any of them in a personall vnion. To these doubtes that are moued by his owne schoolemen, what if the Priest do not consecrate? what if he speake not the wordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration? what if he had none intention to consecrate? in all which cases, the schoolemen define, that the people committ idolatrie if they worship their hoste. First hee sayeth: he goeth about to shake the foundation of this sacrament, as Brentius doth of baptisme. Concerning Brentius, although it were easie to defende his assertion euen by the schoolemen, yet because it is no matter of our controuersie, I will briefely passe it ouer. Brentius helde that Christ hath not bound vs to baptise in certein forme of wordes to be pronounced by the minister, so the meaning be obserued, that he baptise into the name of the Father, &amp; of the Sonne, &amp; of the holie ghost. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, charitable M. Heskins rayleth on him, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth the forme of baptisme, and reiecteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of baptisme, which is vtterly false: and then he reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>that if the wordes of baptisme may be without daunger o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, why may not the words of consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewise</hi>? as though Brentius sayeth, they might be omitted, where he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of altering the forme of wordes, when the same sense remaineth. Next to this he farceth in another slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of vs, that we agree not in the number of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, some admitting three, some two, some foure, and some neuer a one. The world knoweth what we holde
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14727:134"/>
herein. After this, he sheweth out of Basil &amp; Damascen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necessitie of the forme of baptisme, which wee confesse, &amp; Brentius him self doth not denye. At length he defineth contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scholemen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if consecration be omitted, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> danger is to the priest, &amp; not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people that worship an idol. Finally, he wil moue the like doubt of our ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what if the minister of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> communion, doe neither speake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of consecration, nor haue intent to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, what do the people receiue? I aunswer, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee haue nothing to doe, but for asmuch as nothing is whispered, or mumbled in our Communion, but so vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men may heare and vnderstand, if any thing be omitted that is necessarie to the consecration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people communicate with him, they are in as great fault as he. As for Richerus, whome he calleth a Caluenist, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forbiddeth to pray to Christ, and reiecteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of consecration, if any such be, let him aunswere for him self, we haue nothing to do with him.

                     <q>Here M. Hesk. choppeth off y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taile, for it followeth: Euen to him which giueth foode vnto vs, the first fruites of his giftes: which words do both open the purpose of Irenaeus, &amp; shewe that the oblation was of bread &amp; wine, &amp; not the naturall bodie of Christ, as M. Hesk. gathereth, together with the reall presence.</q> But for clearer proofe, he addeth another testimonie out of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nęus,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14727:134"/>
which he quoteth lib. 5. but it is lib. 4. ca. 34 which it seemeth he redd not him selfe in the author, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knewe not where it was writen, &amp; also because he omitteth some wordes in it. <hi>Quomodo autem constabit eis, &amp;c.</hi> he leaueth out <hi>autem &amp; eis</hi>: but thus the wordes are in English. <hi>But how shall it be knowen vnto them, that that bread, in which thankes are giuen, is the bodie of their Lorde and the cupp of his bloud, if they say not that he him selfe is the sonne of the maker of the worlde? &amp;c. And how againe do they say, that the fleshe commeth to corruption, &amp; receiueth not the life which is nourished of the bodie &amp; bloud of our Lord?</hi> Out of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he noteth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament is the bodie and bloud of Christ, &amp; that our flesh is nourished by the same bodie &amp; bloud. This we confesse, so he meane spiritually, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will not haue. And therfore, to drawe the places to his carnall presence, &amp; nourishing, he sayth that Irenaeus hereby impugned two heresies: <hi>One, that Christ was not the sonne of God that made the world, but a man liuing in Iewrie, which dissolued the law &amp; the Prophets, &amp; all the works of God that made the world: The other, that the soule only should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; not the bodie. And therefore to confute the former, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an argument of the real presence, How could a bare naturall man compasse, that his bodie should so be, if he were not the sonne of God that made the world? &amp;c.</hi> This proceedeth of grosse ignorance, or rather of intollerable mallice, to deceiue the ignorant. For the heresie against which he writeth, was not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ was a bare man, &amp; not the sonne of God, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the sonne of another God, then he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, for they made two gods, one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maker of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, which they sayd was God of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old testament, &amp; another y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of Christ, which they said, was God of the newe testament. Now Irenaeus proueth by institution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in the creatures of bread &amp; wine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is the sonne of God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> created y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp; of none other God, to which purpose he sayth in the 57. Chapter of that fourth booke: <q>
                        <hi>Quomodo autem iustè Dominus si alterius patris existens, huius conditionis quae est secundiòm nos accipiens panem fuum corpus confisebatur, &amp; temperamentum calicis sui
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14727:135"/>
sanguinem confirmanit?</hi> How did our Lorde iustly, if being sonne of another father, taking bread which is of this creation that we are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confesse it to be his bodie, and the temperament of the cuppe he confirmed to be his bloud?</q> Thus you see neither in the one place, nor in the other, he reasoneth of the diuine power of Christe, to make a reall presence, or transubstantiation, but of the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that Christ shoulde ordeine his sacrament in the creatures of another God. The seconde heresie he impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth in deede, by the receipt of the bodie and bloude of Christe in the sacrament, by which our fleshe is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vnto immortalitie, which nourishing, M. Heskins in no wise will haue to be vnderstoode spiritually, but corporally, and sayeth, it doth inuincibly proue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence. I will not rippe vp what absurdities do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, if wee say, that Christes fleshe doth nourish our flesh corporally, or after a carnall manner, as of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and digestion thereof, to be turned into our nature, where he sayed before, that our flesh is turned into his fleshe: but I will proue out of Irenaeus, that he meant nourishing spiritually and not corporally. For <hi>lib.</hi> 5. he hath these wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Quando ergo &amp; mixtus calix, &amp; factus panis, percipit verbum Dei, fit eucharistia sanguinis &amp; corporis Christi, ex quibus auge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; consistit carnis nostrae substantia: quomodo carnem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant capacem esse donationis Dei qui est vita aeterna, quae san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine &amp; corpore Christi, nutritur &amp; membrum eius est.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When therefore the cuppe that is mixed, and the bread that is made, receiueth the worde of God, it is made the Eucharistie of the bloud &amp; bodie of Christe, of which the substance of our fleshe is increased and consisteth: howe do they denye, that the flesh is capable of the gift of God, which is eternall life, which is nourished with the bodie and bloud of Christ, and is a member of him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you see plainly, that our fleshe is so nourished of the bodie and bloud of Christ, that it is increased of the same, and so consisteth of them, that wee are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but our bodies are not increased, &amp;c. but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14727:135"/>
therefore they are not nourished but spiritually, &amp; after an heauenly manner.</p>
                  <p>But moste plainly, for impugning of both the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies aforesaide, and other heresies more of transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and the carnall presence, and the sacrifice propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of the masse, he writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 34. <q>
                        <hi>Nostra autem consonans est sententia Eucharistiae, &amp; Eucharistia rursus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat sententiam nostram. Offerimus enim ei quę sunt eius, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruenter communicationem &amp; vnitatem praedicantes carnis &amp; spiritus. Quemadmodum enim qui est a terra panis, percipiens vocationem Dei, iam non communis panis est, sed Eucharistia ex duabus rebus constans, terrena &amp; caelesti: sic &amp; corpora nostra percipientia Euchaeristiam, iam non sunt corruptibilia, spem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectionis habentia. Offerimus autem ei non quasi indigenti, sed gratias agentes donationi eius, &amp; sanctificantes creaturam.</hi> But our sentence is agreeable to the Eucharistie or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of thankesgiuing, and the Eucharistie againe doth confirme our sentence. For wee offer vnto him those things that be his owne, agreeably setting foorth the communication and vnitie of the fleshe and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. For as the breade which is of the earth receiuing the calling of God, is not nowe common bread, but the Eucharistie consisting of two things, an earthly thing &amp; an heauenly thing: euen so our bodies also receiuing the Eucharistie, are not nowe corruptible, hauing hope of resurrection. And wee offer to him, not as to one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neede, but giuing thankes for his gifte and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature.</q>

                  <p>By this place is transubstantiation ouerthrowen, where" he sayth, the sacrament consisteth of two things, an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and an heauenly, the carnall presence, when hee defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it to be a heauenly thing, that is a diuine and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual communication of the bodie and bloud of Christ, the propitiatorie sacrifice, when he sayeth, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of breade and wine were offered for a thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, &amp;c. That Melancton defending the popish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence abused the authoritie of Irenaeus against Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius, it ought to be no preiudice to vs, especially

seeing as M. Heskins before confessed, that Melancthon him selfe forsooke that opinion in the end.</p>
                  <p>Now come we to Tertullian, whose testimonie, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh it bee flatly against him, yet hee hath laboured if it were possible, by wrestling and wrangling, to make it serue his turne, or a least to auoyde it, that it should not hurt his cause, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Marcionem. Professus itaque, &amp;c. When therefore he had professed that with desire he desired to eate the Passeouer, as his owne (for it was vnmeete that God shuld de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any thing pertayning to an other) the breade that was taken and distributed to his disciples, he made it his body, saying. This is my body, that is to say, a figure of my body. But it had bene no figure except his body had bene of trueth.</hi> 
                     <q>Here M. Heskins cutteth off: but it followeth in Tertullian, <hi>Caeterum &amp;c.</hi> For a vaine thing which is a fantasie could receiue no figure. Or if therefore he feigned the bread to be his body, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he lacked the trueth of a body, then ought hee to haue giuen the breade for vs. It would haue made for Marcions vanitie, that the breade should haue bene cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</q> The alteration, falsification, and truncation of Tertullians wordes, which Maister Heskins vseth, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the first booke partly, and it wearieth me to note these faultes so often as he committeth them. But here he turneth these wordes: <hi>Figura autem non fuisset nisi verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis esset corpus. But it had not bene a figure except it were a body of trueth.</hi> As though the breade were both a figure and a body of trueth, which cleane peruerteth the sense of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, and is contrarie to his purpose, as you may see by that which followeth. For Marcion agreed with Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, against whome Irenęus writte, that Christ was not the GOD of the olde Testament, and moreouer affirmed, that Christe had not a true body, but a fantasticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Against both these hereticall opinions, hee reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this sentence. First he saith, Christe desired to eat the Passeouer, therefore it was of his owne instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it was vnmeete that God should desire any thing of an other Gods institution. And that Christe had a true bodye, hee proueth by the institution of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14727:137"/>
which was a figure of his body, for a fantasticall body, or a vaine thing, can haue no figure, for a figure hath a necessarie relation to a thing of trueth, whereof it is a figure, the sacrament is a figure of Christes body, therefore Christe hath a true body.</p>
                  <p>That this is the true meaning of Tertullian, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainely by the wordes before alledged, and by these that followe, and by the whole discourse of his worke, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. hee saith. <q>
                        <hi>Proinde panis &amp; calicis sacramento iam in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelio probauimus corporis &amp; sanguinis Dominici veritatem aduersus phantasma Marcionis.</hi> Therefore by the sacrament of the breade and the cuppe, nowe in the Gospell we haue proued, the trueth of the body and bloud of our Lorde, against the fantasie of Marcion. But M. Hes. interpretation of Tertullians meaning, is not onely false, but also ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</q> He saith, that Tertullian to proue that Christ had a true body, bringeth in the institution of the sacrament, saying, that Christ made the breade his true body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had a true body, as though Marcion, whiche woulde not beleeue that Christe had a true body when he liued on the earth, would acknowledge that Christe had a true body in the sacrament. But Marcion acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the sacrament to be a figure of Christes body, and therevpon Tertullian inferreth that hee had a true body, whereof the sacrament was a figure.</p>
                  <p>But nowe it is a sport to see howe M. Heskins taketh vpon him <hi>To open Tertullian, and to deliuer him from the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</hi> His saying hath two partes, the one that Christe made the breade his body, the other that he saith: This is my body, that is to say, a figure of my body. Nowe hee will require of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduersarie, whether of these two parts he will receiue? and he is certaine they wil not receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, bicause Zuinglius, Oecola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>padius, &amp; Bullinger, with the rest, denieth the bread to be the naturall body of Christ. But he is fouly beguiled, for al these &amp; we with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will neither receiue the first part by it selfe, nor the latter part by it selfe, but both parts together, as they are vttered by Tertullian, that Christ so made the bread his body, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:14727:138"/>

And we do so vnderstand Tertullian, as he is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to him selfe, nor to any Catholique writer of his time in this matter, which is Maister Heskins rule to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Catholique Authour, And we so vnderstand the sacrament to bee a figure, as it is not a bare figure. But nowe, bicause Maister Heskins must needes acknowledge the sacrament to be a figure, he maketh two kindes of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. A figure of a thing absent, and a figure of a thing present. Bicause there is no doubt of the former, I will touch onely the latter. An example of a figure of a thing present, he maketh in these wordes: <hi>As the spouse beholding her very husband, and seeth the scarres and tokens of wounds that he suffered for her defence and safegard, and of his children and hers: is brought in remembrance of his louing kindnesse, and of the dangers sustained for her sake. In which case although the substance of the man be present, yet to his wife he is a figure and token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of him selfe absent, in condition of a man nowe in fight &amp; dangered with sore and deepe woundes. For nowe he is no such man, but whole &amp; sound, &amp; a perfect man.</hi> Haue you not heard a wise similitude thinke you? Is the substance of the man present, a figure of his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; passions absent? or rather the scarres present, a token of his wounds suffered, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes passed? If hee be so grosse, that he cannot distinguish betweene substance and accidents, and the properties and effectes of them both, yet very children can plainely see, that the substance of the man occasioneth no such reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance as he speaketh of, but the scarres of the woundes: neither do they bring the substance of the man in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but the actions and passions of the man. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14727:138"/>
this is too blockish an example, that a figure may be of a thing present in substance. But Augustine <hi>Lib. sentent. Prosperi.</hi> doth helpe this matter as he weeneth: <hi>Caro carnis, &amp;c. The flesh is a sacrament of the flesh, and the bloud is a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bloud. By both which being inuisible, spirituall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, is signified the visible and palpable body of our Lord Iesus Christ, full of the grace of all vertues, and diuine Maiestie.</hi> M. Hes. noteth, that the inuisible body of Christ in the sacrament, is a figure of the same visible. Very good. But let me goe with him. Although S. Augustine or Prosper speake not of an inui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ible body. But he saith directly, that the flesh and the bloud in the sacrament, are both spirituall and intelligible flesh and bloud, which is as much as I aske. Then the spirituall flesh of Christe which is in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth signifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> visible and palpable body of Christ, then the which nothing can be said more plainly against the corporall presence, nor for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spiritual presence. But he obiecteth further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the scriptures also vse such speaches, saying, that Christe was made in the likenesse of a man. Ph. 2. When he was a man in deede, and so Tertullian might well cal it a figure, although it be the body it self. As though S. Paule in that place speaketh of the substance of his humanitie, &amp; not rather of the base shewe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he tooke vpon him in his humanitie, whereas he might haue behaued him self as God, being both God and man. Yet Augustine hath two places, by conference whereof this thing shall appeare; that the sacrament is both a figure and the very thing it selfe. The first place is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. speaking of Iudas the traytour, which place M. Heskins read not in Augustine, but in some other mans collections, for both he cyteth it truncately, &amp; also addeth wordes both in the Latine and the English, which are not in Augustine, although he do not alter the sense. But Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines wordes in deede are these. <hi>Et in historia &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>And in the historie of the newe Testament, the patience of our Lord was so great and woonderfull, that he suffered him so long as though he had bene good:</q> 
                     <hi>Whereas he was not ignorant of his thoughtes, when he had him present at the feast, in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14727:139"/>
which he commended and deliuered to his disciples, the figure of his body and his blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d.</hi> The other place is cyted <hi>Ep.</hi> 162. <hi>Our Lorde him selfe doth suffer Iudas, a diuill, a theefe, and his seller. He letteth him take among his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t disciples, that which the faithful know, our price.</hi> But when Augustine him selfe saith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacraments beare the name of those thinges whereof they are sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is no maruell, if the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, be called our price, whereof it is a figure or sacrament, especially seeing Augustine flatly denyeth, that Iudas did receiue the bread which was the Lorde, but only the Lords bread. This conference therefore maketh against him, not for him: As for Theophylactes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which he calleth a plaine place for the proclamer, wee refuse, although it is not so plaine as he pretendeth, for we also affirme, that the sacrament is not a bare figuration of the flesh of Christ, but his flesh in deede, spiritually recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Finally, Tertullians place <hi>De resur. Car.</hi> is nothing at all for him. <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o corpore &amp;c. The flesh eateth the body and bloud of Christ, that the soule may be fed with God.</hi> For by the body and bloud of Christe, he meaneth the sacrament of them, which is called by the name of that is figured or signified by it. As for the last shift, that <hi>No Catholique Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour saith, that the sacrament is only a figure,</hi> is too childish for a Doctour to vse; for in these words of Tertullian: <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum, id est<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> figura corporis met,</hi> my body, that is to say, a figure of my body, there needeth not to be added the exclusiue onely, for the latter part is a description of the former, which must containe all that is in the thing des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, or else it is nothing worth: as for example.

                  <p>He noteth further, that this is called of Cyprian, a new doctrine, and therefore it can not be the drinking of the figure of the bloud of Christ, for that was olde. I answere briefly, it was so new, as the gospel is the new Testament,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14727:140"/>
whiche yet was preached to Adam and Eue, but not so clearely and distinctly as since the time of Christ, and so was the eating of the bodie and bloud of Christe, all one with that it is now, differing but in manner of reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not in substance of spirituall foode.</p>

And as any man comming to the faith of Christ, before the wordes of baptisme, is yet in the band of the olde debt, but when they are rehearsed, he is forthwith deliuered from all dregges of sinnes: So when the creatures are set vpon the holie altars to be blessed with heauenly wordes, before they be consecrated by inuocation of the highest name, there is the substance of bread and wine, but after the wordes of Christe, the bodie and bloud of Christ. And what maruell is it, if those things, which he could create with his word, beeing created, he can conuerte by his worde? Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it seemeth to be a lesse miracle, if that which he is knowne to haue made of nothing, he can now when it is made, chaunge into a better thing.</hi> Vpon these sayings Maister Heskins vrgeth the chaunge. I acknowledge the chaunge, and vrge the kinde or manner of chaunge to be spirituall, according to the examples of baptisme &amp; regeneration. Vnto these authorities hee annexeth a large discourse of transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, and citeth for it diuers testimonies olde and newe, what the olde are, we will take paynes to viewe, as for the younger sorte, we will not sticke to leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

Wherefore we doe nowe also rightly belieue, that the bread sanctified by the worde of God, is chaunged into the bodie of God the WORDE.</hi> Maister Heskins after his vsuall manner translateth <hi>Quodammodo</hi> in a manner, if not false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the least obscurely. But that worde <hi>Quodammodo,</hi> that is after a certeine manner, looseth all the knotte of this doubt.

How when the life of God is in vs, the WORD of God being in vs, shall our bodie also be able to giue life? But it is an other thing for vs to haue the sonne of God in vs after the manner of participation: and an other thing, the same to haue beene made flesh, that is, to haue made the bodie which he tooke of the blessed virgin his owne bodie. Therefore it was meete, that he should be after a certeine manner vnited to our bodies, by his holie flesh &amp; precious bloud, which we receiue in the quickening blessing, in bread and wine. For least we should abhorre fleshe and bloud set vpon the holie altars, God condescending to our fragili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, inspireth to the thinges offered, the powre of life, turning them into the trueth of his owne flesh, that the bodie of life may be found in vs all, certeine seede giuing life.</hi> Here Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins in his translation cleane leaueth out <hi>Quodammodo,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certeine manner Christe is vnited to our bodies by the sacrament, and so is this chaunge made after a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner, for otherwise this place is directly against transubstantiation, where he saith we receiue the flesh and bloud of Christ in bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>Euthymius is the next <hi>In Matth</hi> 26. <hi>Quemadmodum, &amp;c. As he did supernaturally Deifie (as I may so say) his assumpted flesh, so he doeth also vnspeakably chaunge these thinges into his quickening bodie and his precious bloud, and into the grace of them.</hi> When he saith the bread and wine are chaunged into the grace of his bodie and bloud, it is easie to vnderstand, that he meaneth a spirituall chaunge, and the last clause is an exposition of the former, they are chaunged, into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of CHRISTE, that is, into the grace of them.</p>

The rest that remaine although I might well expound their sayings so, as they should not make for Popish transubstantiation, which the Greeke Church did not receiue: yet beeing late writers out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, as Damascen, Theophylact, Paschasius, I omit them. But of all these doctors, M. Heskins gathereth, that it is a maruelous and wonderfull worke, that is wrought in this chaunge of the sacramentall bread and wine, therefore he would proue it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be into a bare token, or figure, but it may well be into a spirituall meate, to feede vs into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, which is a wonderful and great work of God, as likewise that the washing of the bodie in baptisme, should be the washing of the soule from sinne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be saith very lewdly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the institution of sacramental signes, as the Pascall lambe, and such like, is no wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke of God, and as fondly compareth he the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of sacramentes with bare signes and tokens of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, as the twelue stones in Iordane, &amp;c. And yet more lewdly, with the superstitious bread vsed to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Cathechumeni in Saint Augustines time, that had no institution of God.

For as there the grace of the word of God maketh that bodie, whose nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment consisted of bread, and was after a certeine maner bread: So bread as the Apostle saith, by the word of God and prayer, is sanctified, not because it is eaten, growing to that that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the bodie of the WORDE, but foorthwith by the worde it is chaunged into the bodie, as it is saide by the WORDE. This is my bodie.</hi> This place saith Maister Heskins ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth three heresies. The first of Luther or Lutherans: that the sacrament is not the bodie of Christ, except it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Gregorie saith, it is not the bodie of Christ, because it is eaten. But that is no ouerthrow to Luthers assertion, for Gregorie meaneth, that the sacrament by nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our bodies, is not made the bodie of Christe, as the breade that a man eateth is turned into his bodie, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:14727:145"/>
so was the bread y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our sauiour did eat, turned into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his bodie while he liued, but by the power of God, &amp; this notwithstanding, it is made that bodye of Christ, only to the worthie receiuer.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sertion M. Hesk. saith, they haue no substantial grounde in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: as though an argument framed out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the end &amp; vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, were not a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ground. And as for the popish counsell of Florens, is a sorie ground without scripture. Although <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

The second supposed heresie, to be ouerthrowen, is, that the substance of bread &amp; wine do still remaine, because Gregorie sayth, it is changed into the bodie of Christe. But this change is not of substance, but of vse, for as hee sayth, it is changed into the bodie, so he sayth it is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the diuine vertue, which words, though Maister Hesk. would racke to signifie the diuine flesh of Christ, yet cannot he auoyde a manifest figure in the speache of Gregorie, &amp; therfore it is nothing so plaine for him, as he pretendeth. To this he adioyneth a defence of the terme of transubstantiation, which he confesseth to be but new, (as in deede the doctrine therof is) but yet he compareth it with the terme vsed of olde by the fathers Homou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to signifie that Christe is of the substance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But to be short, for termes, we will not striue, let him proue transubstantiation so olde as he pretendeth, &amp; we will acknowledge the terme. The thirde pretended heresie to be ouerthrowen, is, that he teacheth a reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and therefore the wordes: This is my bodie, are to be vnderstood without trope or figure. But this is auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in aunswere to the seconde, and so we leaue him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of M. Hesk. cauils.</p>

                     <q>The second que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. How that saying of our sauiour in Mathew is to be taken: I say vnto you, I will not drinke from hence forth of this fruite of the vine, vntil that day, in which I shal drinke it newe with you in the kingdome of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Out of this place, some men build the fable of a thousand yeres, in which they contend, that Christ shall raigne corporally, &amp; drinke wine, which hee hath not dronke from that time, vnto the end of the world. <hi>But let vs heare, that the bread which our Lord brake &amp; gaue to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is the bodie of our Lord &amp; sauiour, as he saith vnto them.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Take &amp; eat ye, this is my bodie, &amp; that the cupp is that, of whiche he spake againe: drinke ye all of this: this is my bloud of the new testament, which shalbe shed for many, &amp;c. This is that cupp, of which we read in the Prophet: I will take the cupp of saluation. And in another place, Thy cup inebriaeting is verie noble. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bread, which came downe from heauen, is the bodie of our Lord: and the wine, which he gaue to his disciples, is his bloud of the new testament, let vs reiect Iewish fables, &amp; ascend with our Lord into the great parler, prepared &amp; made clean, &amp; let vs receiue of him aboue, the cup of the new testament: &amp; there holding passouer with him, let vs be made dronke with the wine of sobrietie. For the kingdome of God is not meat &amp; drinke, but righteousnesse, &amp; ioy, &amp; peace in the holy ghost. Neither did Moises giue vs the true bread, but our Lord Iesus, he being the guest &amp; the fest, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe eating, &amp; which is eaten. His bloud we drinke, &amp; without him we cannot drinke it, &amp; daily in his sacrifices, wee tread out of the generation of the true vine &amp; the vine of Sorec, which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted chosen, the redde newe wines, and of them wee drinke newe wine of the kingdome of his father, not in the oldnesse of the letter, but in the newnesse of the spirite, singing a newe song, which none can sing, but in the kingdome of the Churche, which is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the father.</hi>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14727:146"/>
and rayment to couer mee. For as many of vs as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in Christ, haue put on Christ, and do eat the breade of Angels, and do heare our Lorde saying: My meate is, that I may do the will of him that sent mee, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I may accomplish his worke. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the will of his father which sent vs, and let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his worke: and Christ shall drinke with vs his bloud in the kingdome of the Church.</q> This is the whole discourse of Hierome, and by the distinction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letter, you see what Maister Heskins hath left out, both in the beginning, and in the ende, and yet he raileth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer, for snatching truncately a fewe wordes, to make a shew to deceiue his auditorie. But by this whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, you may see what the question is, and howe it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, namely, that the promise of Christ must bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode, of a spirituall drinking in the Church, which vtterly ouerthroweth the popish fantasie of real presence. For Christ is so present at euery celebration of the supper in his church, that he eateth his bodie, and drinketh his bloud, as Hierome sayth: which no man, except he bee mad, wil say to be otherwise then after a spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the end, Hierome openeth what is his meate, and how he drinketh his bloud with vs, and that wee so eat his bodie, as we put him on for a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in baptisme, and as Iacob did eat it, which must needes be spiritually.

Sancta sanctorum, &amp;c. The most holie things properly are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christ, because it is his bodie, of whome Gabriell said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the virgin: The holy ghost shall come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, and the power of the moste highest shall ouershadowe thee, therefore that holy one that shalbe borne of thee, shalbe called the sonne of God. And Esay also: The Lord is holie, &amp; dwelleth in the heightes, that is to saye,

in the bosome of his father. For from this sacrifice he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, not onely strangers and soiourners &amp; hyred seruaunts, but hee commaunded also, not to receiue it by ignorance. And he taketh it by ignorance, which knoweth not the vertue and dignitie thereof, which knoweth not that this bodie and bloud is according to the trueth, but receiueth the mysteries, and knoweth not the vertue of the mysteries. Vnto whome Salomon sayth, or rather the spirite which is in him: When thou sittest to eat with a Prince, attende diligently, what things are set before thee. He also compelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and constraining him that is ignorant to adde a fifth parte. For this fifth parte being added, maketh vs to vnderstande the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine mysteries, intelligibly. Nowe, what the fifth parte is, the wordes of the Law giuer may teache thee. For he sayth: he shall add a fifth parte, with that he hath eaten. And howe can a man adde a fifth parte of that which he hath alreadie eaten and consumed? For he biddeth not another thing, or from any other where. But a fifth parte to be added of it, or with it, or as the</hi> 70. <hi>interprete vpon it. Then the fifth parte of it, vpon it, is the worde which was vttered by Christ him selfe vpon the Lordes mysterie. For that being added, deliuereth and remoueth vs from ignorance, as to thinke any thing carnall or earthly of those holie things, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth, that those thinges shoulde bee taken diuinely &amp; spiritually, which is properly called the fifth part, for the diuine spirite which is in vs, and the worde which he deliuered, doth sett in order the senses that are in vs, and doth not onely bring foorth our taste vnto mysterie, but also our hearing &amp; sight and touching &amp; smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, so that of these things which are verie high, we do suspect, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is neare to lesse reason or weake vnderstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This place M. Hesk. noteth, that the mysteries are called a most holy thing, and a sacrifice. We confesse it is a most holy thing, &amp; a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, for so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers meant, and not a propitiatorie sacrifice. Moreouer he noteth, that it is called the verie bodie and bloud in verie deede. Although the wordes of the author sounde not so roundly, yet let that be graunted also, what is then the conclusion? Marie then, haue ye a plaine place for the proclaimer, &amp; issue ioyned thereupon, that no one writer of like auncientie, sayth, it is not the verie bodie. For thè
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14727:147"/>
plainesse of the place, I wish always, that the author may be his own expositor. First, where he sayth, that the fifth part added, maketh vs to vnderstand the mysteries intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly (that is as he vseth the terme) spiritually &amp; mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, although M. Hesk. translate <hi>intelligibiliter</hi> easily.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, where he sayth, wee must thinke nothing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally or earthly of the holy things, and that the worde of God decreeth, that they should be taken diuinely and spiritually. As for the issue it was ioyned &amp; tryed in the one and twentieth Chapter of the first booke. But wee must heare what Hesychius sayth further. <hi>Quicunque ergo sanctificata &amp;c. Whosoeuer therfore shal eat of the things sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ignorance, not knowing their vertue (at we haue saide) shall adde a fifth parte of it vpon it, and giue it to the Priest into the sanctuarie. For it behoueth the sanctification of the mysticall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the translation or commutation from thinges sensible to things intelligible, to be giuen to Christ, which is the true Priest, that is, to graunt and impute to him the miracle of them, because that by his power and the worde vttered by him, those things that are seene, are as surely sanctified, as they exceede all sense of the flesh.</hi> Out of these words M. Hesk. would proue transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, because he saith, there is a translation or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation from things sensible to intelligible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, from bread, which is perceiued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> senses, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, which in this manner is not perceiued by senses. But M. Hesk. must proue the bodie of Christe to bee no sensible thing, but a thing which may be perceiued by vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding only, or else his exposition wil not stand, for here is a diuision &amp; exposition of things sensible &amp; intelligible, which is a plaine ouerthrow of popish transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; carnall presence, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wherunto the things sensible are changed, is not a sensible thing, as the naturall bodie of Christ is, but they are changed into things intelligible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, which may only by vnderstanding be conceiued, &amp; so is the spiritual feeding of our soules by faith, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie body &amp; bloud of Christ. Next Augustin is cited <hi>in Ps.</hi> 33 a place which hath ben cited &amp; answered more then once alreadie. <hi>Et ferebatur, &amp;c. And he was carried in his own ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.

Brethren how could this be true in a man? &amp;c.</hi> I will remit the reader to the 10. Chap. of this second book, where it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by Aug. him self, &amp; in the same exposition. Christ caried himself, saith Aug. in his hands, <hi>quodam modo,</hi> after a certaine manner, but not simply. Maister Hesk. iang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an onely figure, hath bene often reproued: wee make not the sacrament such an onely figure, as Dauid might carrie in his handes of him selfe, for Dauid could make no sacrament of him selfe, but such a figure, as is a diuine and heauenly worke, to giue in deede, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth in signe. An other place of Augustine, is cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>De Trin. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. but truncately (as he termeth it) for he neither alledgeth the heade nor the feete, by which the scope of Augustines wordes might be perceiued. But the whole sentence is this. <hi>Si ergo Apostolus Paulus, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>If therefore the Apostle Paule, although hee did yet carrie the burthen of his body, which is corrupted and presseth downe the soule, although he did as yet see but in part, and in a darke speach, desiring to be dissolued and to bee with Christ, &amp; groning in himself for the adoption, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption of his body, <hi>Could neuerthelesse preach our Lord Iesus Christ by signifying, otherwise by his tong, otherwise by his Epistle, otherwise by the sacrament of his body &amp; bloud for neither his tong, nor the parchments, nor the ynke nor the signifying sounds vttered with his tong, nor the signes of the letters written in skinnes, do we call the body and bloud of Christ, but only that which being taken of the fruits of the earth, &amp; being consecrated with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall prayer, we do rightly receiue vnto spiritual health, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our Lords suffring for vs: which when it is brought by the hands of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to that visible forme, it is not sanctified that it shuld be so great a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but by the spirit of god working inuisibly</hi>:</q> 
                     <q>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God worketh al these things which in that work are done by corporall motions, mouing first the inuisible parts of his ministers, either the soules of men, or of secret spirits y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are subiectes seruing him: what maruel is it, if also in the creature of heauen &amp; earth, the sea, &amp; al the ayre, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth what he wil both sensible and inuisible things, to set forth him selfe in them, as he him selfe knoweth it shuld
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14727:148"/>
be:</q> his owne substaunce as it is not appearing, which is altogether vnchangeable, and more inwardly and secretly, higher then all the spirites which he hath created.</p>
                  <p>He rayleth vpon Oecolampadius, for leauing out of S. Augustine that which maketh against him, as though hee him selfe hath not an hundreth times done so as he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him. Although it is not to be thought, that Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius vsed any fraud, when he tooke as much as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his purpose for which he alledged it, and nothing fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that was contrarie to it, for all M. Heskins lowde crying out. For Paule preached Christe by signifying in the sacrament, which is called the body &amp; bloud of Christ, bicause it is a sacrament thereof, whereas his tong, nor his parchment, nor ynke, nor sound of words, nor figures of letters were no sacraments, and yet he preached the same Christ by signifying, in speaking, writing, and ministring the sacrament. But besides this, M. Heskins would haue vs note two things. That the bread is sanctified and made a great sacrament: and that it is sanctified and made by the inuisible worke of the holy Ghost. The first (he saith) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Oecolampadius &amp; Cranmer, that say, the creatures receiue no sanctification, but the soules of men. They meane, that holinesse is not included in the creatures, but consisteth in the whole action, and so Augustine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the consecration the due receiuing in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christes death, without which the bread is no sacrament. But M. Heskins would learne what he meaneth by calling it a great sacrament, and what the worke of the holy Ghost is in it? If it please him to vnderstand, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost working inuisibly, maketh it a greate mysterie of our saluation, assuring our consciences, that we are fed spiritually with the body and bloud of Christ, as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are corporally with bread and wine.

                  <p>But howe S. Augustine did expound these wordes, M. Heskins if he durst, might haue cyted this place, <hi>Contra

Let his word I beseech you ouercome both our sense and our reason, which thing let vs do in all matters, and specially in mysteries, not looking vpon those things only which lye before vs, but also holding fast his wordes. For we can not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his wordes, but our sense is most easie to be deceiued: they can not be false, but this our sense is often and often deceiued. Therefore bicause he hath saide: This is my body, let vs be held with no dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, but let vs beleeue, and throughly see it with the eyes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> Here M. Heskins noteth that it passeth not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to make present a figure of his body, as though the mysterie of the sacrament were nothing, but a figure of his body. Secondly, that Chrysostome willeth Christes wordes to be vnderstanded as they be spoken. No doubt, but he would haue them to be vnderstoode as they were meant by Christe, and that is spiritually, for which cause he willeth vs to beholde the matter with the eyes of our

He that saide, This is my body, did bring to passe the thing also with his worde.</hi> We confesse he did so, but thereof it doth not followe, that al figure is wiped away, as he saith: neither is there any plaine place for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamer, or in any thing that followeth in the same Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely. <hi>Quando igitur &amp;c. When then thou seest the Priest giue the body, thinke not the hand of the Priest, but the hand of Christe is put foorth vnto thee.</hi> Surely in these wordes, we must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say that the Priestes hande is transubstantiated into the hande of Christ, or else we must acknowledge a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue speach.

                        <hi>For he that hath giuen a greater thing for thee, that is to say, his life, why will he disdaine to deliuer his body to thee? Let vs therefore heare both Priestes and other, howe great and how woonderfull a thing is graunted to vs. Let vs heare I pray you, and let vs tremble, he hath deliuered his flesh vnto vs, him selfe offered hath he set before vs. What satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall we offer, when after we are nourished with such a foode, we doe offend? When eating a lambe, we are turned into woolues? when beeing satisfied with sheepes flesh, we rauine as lyons?</hi> M. H. noteth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here be termes to plaine for figuratiue speaches, &amp; yet in spite of his nose, he must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse al this speach to be figuratiue, or else he must make Chrysost. Authour of grosse absurdities. I will only speak of one, which is most apparant. Chrysost. saith, it is a greater matter that Christ gaue his life, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he giueth his body. Let me aske him this question. Doth hee giue a dead body in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a liuing? If hee giue a liuing body, hee giueth his life in the sacrament, and then howe is it lesse, when hee giueth both his life and his body? But Chrysostome meaneth, that he suffered death, which is a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then that he giueth vs his body in the sacrament, for that is a memoriall of his death, and receiueth all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from his death, &amp; so the giuing of his life is a greater matter, then the giuing of his body in the sacrament, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was in acte, this in mysterie.</q> But let vs followe M.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14727:149"/>
The sacrament is a wonderful thing, therefore no figure, nor spiritual receit only, which are not wonderfull. This argument is false, for sacramentall figures and spirituall things are great wonders, thought not sensible myracles. As for eating the Lamb, the Sheepe, and such other, are so plaine figures, that impudencie her selfe would not deny them to be figures. Finally he noteth, that sinners receiue the bodye of Christe in the sacrament, which hee saith, the Protestantes denye, which is as grossely, for except sinners should receiue Christe in the sacrament, no men should receiue him. <q>But the Protestantes say, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men or reprobate men, vngodly men, vnpenitent sinners, receiue not the body of Christe, which though it haue bene sufficiently proued before, yet I will adde one more testimony out of Saint Augustine <hi>De ciuitate Dei. Lib.</hi> 21. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Nec isti ergo dicendi sunt manducare corpus Christi, quoniam nec in membris computandi sunt Christi.

Finally he himself saying: He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eateth my flesh &amp; drinketh my blud, abideth in me &amp; I in him: sheweth what it is, not touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but indeed to eat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, &amp; drink his bloud.</q> But now let vs returne to Chrys. who <hi>Hom.</hi> 83. <hi>in</hi> 26. <hi>Math.</hi> hath these words, <hi>Praecipua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;. He dissolueth their chiefe solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another table ful of horror saying: Take ye and eat ye, this is my body. How then wer they not troubled hearing this? bicause they had heard many &amp; great things of these before.</hi> Here M. Hes. troubleth him self very much &amp; his readers more, to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the doctrin which they heard before, vttered in the sixt of Iohn, they were so instructed as they were not troubled, which we confes to be true, although that doctrine doth none otherwise pertaine vnto the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then as the sacrament is a seale of the doctrine.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14727:150"/>
But Chrysostome saith further in the same Homely. <hi>Hac de causa &amp;c. For this cause with desire I haue desired to eate this passeouer with you, that I might make you spirituall. He him self also dranke thereof, least when they had heard his wordes, they should say: what then do we drinke bloud and eate flesh? and so should haue bene troubled. For when he spake before of those things, many were offended only for his wordes. Therefore least the same thing should happen nowe also, he him selfe did it first, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them with quiet minde, to the communication of the mysteries.</hi> Here M. Heskins falleth into a sound sleepe, and then dreameth a long dreame of the reall presence, and the trouble of the Apostles, and lothsomnesse of bloud, the contradiction of Chrysostomes wordes, and I wote not what beside<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to a man that is awake, Chrysostom spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth plaine ynough. He saith, this was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause, why Christ desired to eate the Passeouer with them, which he taketh to be, that hee did first drinke before them &amp;c. that hee might make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spirituall, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might not haue carnall imaginations of eating his body and his bloud as the Capernaites had, but vnderstande those thinges spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, the rather when they sawe him eate and drinke of them, which if he had eaten his owne naturall body, and drunk his owne natural bloud, would haue troubled them more, then if he had not tasted of them. And how so euer M. Heskins drumbleth and dreameth of this matter, Cranmer saith truely, that if Christ had turned the breade into his body, as the Papistes affirme, so great and woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull a chaunge, should haue bene more plainely set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth in the scripture, by some of the Euangelistes.</p>

And he that shall say, that Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for diuels, must allowe also that it is to be saide vnto them: This is my body, and take ye, this is my bloud. For if he be crucified for diuels (as the author of new doctrine doth affirme) what priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge shall there be, or what reason that onely men should commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with his body and bloud, and not diuels also for whome he shed his bloud in his passion</hi>? Hee saith here is no mention of tropes and figures. A substantiall reason, therefore none are vsed. It is a good reason that Theophylus vseth: that Christ died not for the diuels, bicause he giueth them no participation of his body and bloud, but it hangeth on a rush that M. Hes. concludeth. Such as are partakers of his reall body, may be made partakers of his spirituall body: but diuels can not of his reall body, therefore not of his spirituall body be partakers. See how this peruerse man, maketh the sacrament to be the reall body of Christ, and that which was crucified, his spirituall body.

But the same writer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first booke, doth more certainly auouch the real presence, &amp; deny the figures in these wordes: <hi>Dicit spiritum sanctum &amp;c. Origen saith, that the holy Ghost doth not worke vpon those things, which are without life nor commeth to vnreasonable things. Which when he saith, he thinketh not that the mysticall waters in baptisme by the comming of the holy Ghost to them are consecrated, and that the Lords bread by which our sauiours body is shewed, and which we breake for san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of vs, and the holy cup which are set on the table, and be things without life, are sanctified, by inuocation and comming of the holy Ghost to them.</hi> M. Hes. translateth <hi>quo saluaioris corpus ostenditur,</hi> in which the body of our Sauiour is shewed, but it is plaine ynough, Theophylus meaneth, that by the breade the body of Christe is shewed, that is signified,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14727:151"/>
or figured, or represented. As for consecration, which terme he giueth to the waters in baptisme, Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins chattereth I wot not what about it, nor to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Certaine it is, that he vseth not the terme as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes doe, for they apply it only to the sacrament of the altar, as they call it.</p>
                  <p>Leo is cited <hi>Serm.</hi> 7. <hi>de pass. dom. Iesus confisij sui certus &amp;c. Iesus being at a point with him selfe, and ready to doe his fathers disposition without feare, finished the olde Testament, and made the newe Passeouer. For his disciples sitting with him to eate the mysticall supper, while they in the house of Caiphas were treating howe Christ might be slaine, he ordaining the sacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud, did teach, what manner of sacrifice should be offered to God, and from this mysterie remoued not the traytour.</hi> This place being against Maister Heskins, where hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the sacrament of his body and bloud &amp;c. hee would aunswere the matter by this principle, that olde writers did so call the very naturall body of Christ in the sacrament, which is all the matter in question. But hee will proue it by an other saying in the same place. <hi>Vt vmbrae &amp;c. That shaddowes might giue place to the body, and images might ceasse vnder the presence of the trueth, the olde obseruance is taken away with a newe sacrament, the sacrifice passeth into the sacrifice, bloud excludeth bloud, and the festiuitie of the lawe while it is chaunged, is fulfilled.</hi> These wordes must needes bee referred to the passion of Christe, whereof the sacrifice is a memoriall: for the sacrifice of Christe, and his bloud shedding on the crosse, was the very fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the shaddowe and image of the Paschall Lambe in the olde lawe, and not the institution of the sacrament, whiche is a figure or sacrament thereof. And so the groundwork of al M. Hes. building is quite ouerthrown.</p>

Maister Heskins inferreth, that the wordes of Christe are manifest, and so to be taken in the literall sense with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out figure, bicause he vseth these wordes, Christ saide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, this is my body: but this is a childish mockerie.

We ought therfore, seing we see this present world to be passed away, with al our mind to contemne it, to offer to god the daily sacrifices of teares, the daily sacrifices of his body and bloud. For this sacrifice doth singularly saue the soul from eternal destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which repayreth to vs the death of the only begotten, by a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie. Who although since he arose from death, he doth not now dy, and death shal haue no more dominion of him: yet liuing in him self immortally &amp; incorruptibly, is sacrificed againe for vs in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the holy oblation. For his body is there receiued, his flesh is diuided for the health of the people, his bloud is shed, not nowe vpon the hands of the Infidels, but into the mouthes of the faithfull. Hereof therefore let vs consider, what sacrifice this is for vs, which for our deliuerance doeth followe the passion of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne. For which of the faithfull ought to haue any doubt, that in the same houre of the immolation, the heauens are opened at the Priestes voyce? that the companies of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14727:152"/>
Angels are present in the mysterie of Iesus Christ? That the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est things are coupled to the highest: earthly things are ioyned to heauenly thinges, and that one thing is made of thinges visible and inuisible?</hi> Of these last wordes of ioyning high and lowe, heauenly and earthly thinges, he maketh a greate matter, which is (saith hee) that Christe is ioyned to the earthly formes of breade and wine. Where note (I praye you) that he nameth the accidents of things, for the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them selues, which is a toy to mocke an ape. And yet he pleaseth him selfe so well therein, that he would drawe Irenaeus, which is cleane contrarie to transubstantiation, to bee a great patrone thereof:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Li.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 34.</note> Irenaeus saith as wee haue shewed before more at large, that <hi>Eucharistie</hi> consisteth of two thinges, earthly and heauenly. Nowe hee inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs, what is the heauenly part of the sacrament? And he reasoneth that it is neither the grace of God, nor thanksgiuing, nor the worde of God, nor sanctification. Well: what is it then? Gregorie saith, it is the bodye of Christ, and so say we, spiritually receiued. But if I shuld aske M. Hes. what is the earthly part of the sacrament, hee wil say, the accidents of bread &amp; wine, but sauing his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, accidents be neither earthly not heauenly, but the earthly thing must needs be a substantiall thing, &amp; what other earthly substance can there be, but the substance of bread and wine? He saith, that corporall receiuing is here auouched by Gregory. Then must he tel me how in these words, the sacrifice of teares, is matched with the sacrifice of his flesh and bloud, and how the death of Christe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by a mysterie, howe the fleshe of Christ is diuided or parted, if this can not bee done, but spiritually, then Christes body can not be eaten, but spiritually.</p>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14727:152"/>
of the challenge, yet bicause Euthymius vseth much to followe auncient Doctours, and Isidorus was neere the time of the challenge, I will set downe their places and examine their wordes. Euthymius is cyted <hi>In</hi> 26. <hi>Math. Sicut vetus testamentum &amp;c. Euen as the olde Testament had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and bloud: so hath the newe, namely the body and bloud of our Lorde. Nowe he did not say: These are the signes of my body and my bloud: but these thinges be my body and bloud. Therefore we must not looke to the nature of those things that are set foorth, but to the vertue of them. For as he did supernaturally deifie (if I may so speake) his assumpted flesh: so doth he also vnspeakably transmute these thinges into the same his quickening body, and into his precious bloud, and into the grace of them. And the bread hath a certaine similitude vnto the body, and wine to bloud. For both the bread and body are earthly: but the wine and the bloud are airie and hote. And as bread doth comfort, so the body of Christe doth the same and much more, it sanctifieth both the body and the soule. And as the wine doth make glad: so the bloud of Christ doth the same, and moreouer is made a defence.</hi> Although the chiefest partes of this place are answered in the 17. Chapter of the first booke, and in the 51. Chap. of this second booke: yet as M. Hes. gathereth here two other matters, so I wil make answere to them. First he saith, <hi>That the figuratiue glose of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries is flatly denied</hi>: But by what words I pray you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marrie where he saith: Christ saide not these be signes of my body and bloud, but these are my body and bloud, if this be a flat deniall of a figure, bicause Christe saide not so, then is it likewise in these speaches, he saide not the rocke was a signe of Christe, but the rocke was Christe, the Lambe is the Passeouer &amp;c. Euthymius meaneth not to exclude all figures from the saying of Christ, but to shew that the sacrament is not a bare, naked, and vaine signe, but a true signe of the very body and bloud of Christe, giuen to the faythfull in the administration of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p>The second matter that Maister Heskins noteth, is, of the vnspeakable transmutation, and that must needes bee meant of transubstantiation of the breade and wine into
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14727:153"/>
the naturall bodie and bloud of Christe, by this reason: there be foure thinges called the bodie of Christ. 1. The figure. 2. The Church. 3. The merite, fruite, or vertue of his passion. 4. And his bodie naturall, but it can not be into the figure, nor into the Churche, <hi>Nor into the spirituall bodie of Christe, I meane the merite, vertue, and grace of Christes passion, Ergo</hi> it must needes be spoken of the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ. But vouchsafe (gentle Reader) to runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once againe these wordes of Euthymius, which in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine are these. <hi>Ita &amp; hec ineffabiliter transmuta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thinges into the same his quickening bodie, and into his owne preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud, and into the grace of them.</hi> Now tell me whether M. Heskins doth flatly denie, that which Euthymius doeth flatly affirme, that the bread and wine are chaunged into the grace of the bodie and bloud of Christ? By whiche words he doth sufficiently expound, what kind of change he meaneth of them into the bodie and bloud of Christ, not a corporall but a spirituall transmutation. To the rest of the sentence which is a good exposition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parte, shewing both the bread and wine to remaine in the sacrament, and for what cause they are vsed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the bodie and bloud of Christe, namely, for the similitude they haue vnto the bodie and bloud of Christ: Maister Heskins sayeth nothing. But let the reader weigh it well, and he shall see it cleane contrarie both to transubstantiation, and the carnall presence.</p>
                  <p>Nowe we come to Isodorus, whom he confesseth to be somewhat out of the compasse of the challenge, and his wordes <hi>De Offi. Eccle. Lib.</hi> 18. are these. <hi>Sacrificium, &amp;c. The sacrifice that is offered of the Christians vnto God, Christe our God and Maister did first institute, when he commended to his Apostles his bodie and his bloud before he was betrayed, as it is read in the Gospel: Iesus tooke bread and the cuppe and blessing them gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this place is nothing for the carnall presence, but that Isydore calleth the sacrament the bodie and bloud of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:14727:153"/>
Christ, which we also do, and acknowledg to be so right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called. And Maister Heskins can conclude nothing but vpon a negatiue, he saith not he gaue a figure, so may I conclude, he saith not he gaue his naturall body, and no figure. After this he reasoneth as fondely of Christes blessing of the bread, which although the Euangelistes do expound to be giuing of thanks, yet admit blessing to signifie consecration, and what hath he gayned? Forsooth Christ wold not haue blessed it to make but a figure: still he playeth the foole with that bable, but a figure, onely a figure, a bare figure, which we vtterly doe forsake. But toward the ende of the Chapter, he falleth to gathering his voyces, and affirmeth that none of the olde fathers cal the sacrament a figure, except Tertullian onely, wherein he lyeth impudently, for beside Ambrose, and Augustine, which both vse the very worde figure, we haue shewed in due places, that both they &amp; in a manner al the rest of the fathers, haue either written plainely against the carnall presence, or else nothing for it. As for his last challenge, that all the protestants must bring forth when any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie did professe the same religion that is now preached, is vaine: and hath beene sufficiently aunswered in other treatises. It is certein, that all nations y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were conuerted by the Apostles, before they were corrupted by heresie and Antechristianitie, professed the same religion that we doe. As for the alterations in King Henries time, King Edwardes, and the Queenes Maiesties, that now is, it is easie to answere. King Henrie began the worke, whiche King Edwarde finished, and the Queene repayred and vpholdeth in spight of the diuel and the Pope. As for the consent and peace of the Popishe Church, it proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that the diuell had then all thinges at his will, and therefore might sleepe on both sides, but now hee is disturbed of possession of the house, nowe he stormeth, and of Robin good fellowe, which he was in the Popishe time, is become playne Sathan the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>

Dist.</hi> 2. <hi>Vbi pars est. Non enim est quantitas visibilis in hoc aestimanda mysterio, sed virtus sacramenti spiritualis.</hi> The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible quantitie is not to be regarded in this mysterie, but the spirituall vertue of the sacrament. But M. Heskins proceedeth, and by Anselmus authoritie he will auoide the trifling sophysticall argument, made by Maister Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinton in the open disputation holden in Cambridge.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:14727:155"/>By like Maister Heskins had not learned the solution at that time, and therefore nowe he sendeth it ouer the sea to him. The argument was this: Christe tooke bread, he blessed bread, he brake bread, wherfore he gaue bread to his disciples: if he gaue bread, then not his bodie. M. Heskins saith, he so vseth the words, as though by the actes which the verbes expresse, nothing had beene done. Yes M. Heskins he chaunged the vse, but not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. But by the like sophisme (saith Maister Heskins, he might proue that he gaue no sacrament of his bodie. For that he deliuered which he tooke, but he tooke bread, no sacrament: therfore he deliuered bread, no sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But by his patience, this sophisme of his, is nothing like Maister Pilkintons argument. For in one proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he speaketh of the substance, in the other of another qualitie or affection beside the substance, as in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: that which you bought in the shambles you haue eaten, but you bought cowe fleshe, therefore you haue eaten caulfes fleshe. Euerie childe seeth this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not. But if I speake of the substance in both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, it followeth as thus. That which you bought in the market, you haue eaten, but you bought mutton, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue eaten mutton. Vpon the premises graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this argument followeth of necessitie, and such is the argument of Maister Pilkinton, which all the Papistes in Louayne can not answere.</p>

Because we haue begon to speake of holy things, it is not to be left vnspoken, but that sanctification is one thing, and the thing sanctified another: For that is a sanctification that sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another thing: but that which is sanctifyed cannot sanctifie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, although it selfe be sanctified. As for example, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ignest the bread which thou eatest, as Paule saith, it is sanctifyed by the worde of God &amp; by prayer. Thou hast sanctified it, thou hast not made it sanctification. But that which the priest giueth from his hand is not onely sanctified, but also it is sanctification, because that onely is not giuen which is seene, but also that which is vnderstoode. Of the sanctified breade therefore it is lawfull to cast to beastes, and giue it to infidels, because it doth not sanctifie the receiuer. But if that which is taken of the hande of the priest, were such, as that which is eaten at the table, all men would eate of the table, and no man receiue it of the priestes hands. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord also did not onely blesse the bread in the waye, but gaue it with his hand to Cleophas &amp; his fellowe. And Paul fasting did not onely blesse the bread, but also reached it with his hande to Luke, and the rest of his disciples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three things M. Heskins noteth. First, that Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome calleth the sacrament, not only a sanctified thing, but also sanctification it selfe. And here he would haue the aduersarie to answere him, where this sanctification resteth? in the bread, or in the priest. I answere in neither of both, but in Christ, which is the heauenly matter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament receiued by faith: for if sanctification rested in the bread, then all they that receiue the bread should bee sanctified, but all they that receiue the bread, receiue not sanctification, neither be they sanctified, therefore sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication resteth not in the breade: and so consequently, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ is not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread. And whereas M. Hesk. reasoneth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest giueth sanctification, I answere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is said, because he giueth the outward sacrament, as Iohn baptised, yet speaking properly of the ministerie of man,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14727:157"/>
he restraineth it to the washing of water. The seconde thing he would haue noted, is, that Christe deliuered the sacrament to Cleophas and his fellow, wherof, as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome hath no ground in the scripture, so that which he affirmeth, that Paule in the ship should minister the sacrament (which is the third thing M. Hesk. obserueth) is vtterly false, and confuted by the text. For his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was to the whole multitude, whereof the greatest parte, and almost all, were infidels. And the text sayeth, that they did all receiue foode; &amp; being satisfyed, cast the rest ouer borde to lighten the shippe. But the place, Actes 2. that they continued in the doctrine of the Apostles &amp; communication, &amp; breaking of bread &amp; prayers: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse may well and aptly be vnderstood of the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords table, &amp; yet nothing lesse may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of it, then that horrible sacriledge of robbing the church of the Lords cupp, because bread is onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as in the next Chapter shalbe shewed.</p>

                     </note>It aunswereth to one parte of the challenge (he saith) to proue, that the communion was ministred within 600 yeres after Christe in one kinde onely. And this he will do verie easily. For he beginneth with Christ himselfe, whome moste impudently and blasphemously, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue ministred the Communion in one kinde onely, to the disciples at Emaus. First, although diuerse of the olde writers are of opinion, and yet wthout as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seueration, that Christe there gaue the sacrament, yet none of them is so bolde, to gather any such diuision of the sacrament out of that place. Secondly, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their opinion, it is most probable, that hee neuer ministred the sacrament after his first institution thereof, not onely, because there is no mention thereof, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he gaue that as the last pledge of his presence with them, immediatly before he departed from them. And
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14727:157"/>
although after his resurrection hee appeared to them at sundrie times, by the space of fourtie dayes, eating and drinking with them, to shewe the certeintie of his resurrection, speaking of the kingdome of God: yet is there no worde of celebrating of the sacrament with them. And it is altogether vnlikely, that he would giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, the comfort of his absence, at his first returne againe to them, and that he woulde celebrate the same to two disciples, and not to the whole number of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who had as great neede to be confirmed in faith, as those two.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if euer he had repeated the vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, it is moste probable, he woulde haue done it immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before his assention, but then he did not (which S. Luke, who sheweth that storie exactly, would not haue omitted) therefore there is no likelihood, that he did it before. But admitt that he did then minister the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, doth it followe because bread is onely named, therefore the cuppe was not giuen? But Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins woulde haue it proued, that the figure Synechdoche is here vsed, that is, part named for the whole. For profe, the institution of Christe, and practise of the church, for more then a thousand yeres after Christ, may serue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man.</p>
                  <p>Also the vsuall phrase of the scripture, which by bread meaneth whatsoeuer is ioyned with it to be receiued: as Math. 15. &amp; Mark. 7. The disciples are accused for eating bread with vnwashed handes, &amp;c. shall wee here exclude meat and drinke, because bread is onely named? Also, Marke the 3. they had no leysure to eat breade: &amp; Luke 14. Christe came into the house of the Pharizee to eate bread. And Iohn. 6. You seeke mee not because you haue seene the signes, but because you haue eaten of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breade and are satisfied. And 2. Cor. 9. He that giueth seede to the sower, shall minister bread for foode. And 2. Thess. 3. wee haue not eaten our breade freely. And in the same Chapter, the disordered persons are exhorted, to labour and eat their owne bread.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:14727:158"/>In all these places and a great number more, breade onely is named, in which it were mere madnesse to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that only bread is spoken of, &amp; not meat or drink. So the whole supper of Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of bread &amp; wine, for the outwarde or earthly parte: vnder the name of breade, the cuppe also is comprehended. Wherefore the practise of Christ is not contrarie to his institution, as M. Heskins most arrogantly, wickedly, and vnlearnedly affirmeth. The second reason he vseth is, that the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perteineth onely to priestes, because Christ did then minister it onely to priests. But first, that is not proued nor like to be true: for, seeing our Sauiour Christe did minister the communion in the house of one of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, with whom he did eat the passeouer, it is not like that he excluded him from the sacrament of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, with whome he was partaker of the sacrament of the olde testament. For proofe that both he and his familie were partakers of the Passouer with him, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that it was not possible for thirteene persons to eate vp a whole sheepe and other meat also at one meale. For it was a sheepe of a yeare olde, although it were a verie small one, and must be eaten with the head, feete &amp; the purtenaunce, and nothing reserued vnto the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe. But graunt that onely the Apostles were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the first institution by the same reason, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one part of the sacrament perteined to them only, the other parte also might be left to them onely, and so the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should haue neither of both kindes, because one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priestes had both kindes deliuered vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Further he sayeth, the doctrine of Saint Paule is not sufficient to proue, that the sacrament ought to bee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in both kindes: <hi>for Saint Paule doth but onely set foorth the institution without an exclusiue, excluding all other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners but this.</hi> O shamelesse dogge: is not the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christe an exclusiue of all other manners? take example of baptisme, is it lawfull to baptise with any other lycour then water? into any other name, then the name of the Father, the Sonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the holy Ghost? yea,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14727:158"/>
it is sayed in the Actes, that the Apostles baptised in the name of Iesus Christe: and yet no man will saye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they brake the institution of Christe, and baptised onely in the name of Christe, excluding the father and the holy ghoste. Euen so it is sayde, they continued in breaking of breade, shall wee not vnderstande this after the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as well as the other? Againe, if the institution of Christ, had not heene an exclusiue of all other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, howe doth the Apostle, by the institution of Christ, reproue another manner brought in by the Corinthians? Finally, when the holy Ghost by Saint Paule, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euery Christian man and woman to trye themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and so not onely to eate of that breade, but also to drinke of that cupp: what Lucifer is that, which wil op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him selfe against the flatt commaundement of the holie ghost, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and saye, the lay people shall not drinke of that cuppe, or may be without the cupp well ynough? <hi>But the doctrine of the Catholike church (as he sayeth) is, that the whole sacrament is in either of both kindes, the bloude is in the bodie, and the bodie in the bloud.</hi> But this is neither the doctrine of Christ, nor the doctrine of the church of Christ. For Christ to shewe, that he is a perfect nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs, which of necessitie consisteth of meate and drinke, and neither of both can be lacking, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of our bodies: hath instituted his sacrament both in bread and drinke, to testifie vnto vs, that wee are perfectly fedd in him, and therefore hath deuided the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament into two signes, the one to signifie his bodie, as meate, the other to represent his bloud, as drinke: and therefore confounded be he, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confoundeth these things, which his heauenly wisedome hath thus mercifully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished. Iustinus also a moste auncient writer of the church affirmeth, that the sacrament consisteth of a drye and moyst nourishment, <hi>in Dialog. Cum. Tryphone aduersus Iudęos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And euen this verie diuision of the sacrament, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confuteth both transubstantiation &amp; the carnal presence. For, if he had purposed to giue vs his naturall

bodie in the forme of bread, or otherwise in the bread, he would not haue deuided his bloud from his bodie. But euen hereby he taught vs, that hee spake of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, mysticall, and spirituall manner of eating his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and drinking his bloud by faith, and not of a swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or gulping in of the same at our mouth and our throte. But the cuppe (saith Maister Heskins) is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, and howe is it consecrated? by these words, This is my bloud. Why? where is nowe the plaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of scripture, where bloud is taken for a whole bodie? But seeing Christ sayth further, This is my bloud which is shed for you, and that bloud, which was shed for vs, was separated from his bodie, therefore this bloud in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuppe is separated from his bodie. And in verie deede, the mysterie of the cuppe is sett forth, in that he sayeth, his bloud was shedd for vs, and not as it remayned in the veynes of his bodie: for, not his bloud in his bodie, but the shedding of his bloud, hath washed our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead workes, to serue the liuing God. So the breaking of his bodie on the crosse, hath made it a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat for vs to feede vppon, and therefore he saith: this is my bodie which is giuen for you. <q>And so sayeth Hesychius verie well of the crosse, <hi>Quae etiam superimposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Dominicam carnem esibilem hominibus reddit: nisi enim su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimposita fuisset cruci, nos corpus Christi nequaquam mysticè perciperemus.</hi> The crosse maketh our Lordes fleshe layde vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it eatable of men: for except it had been layde vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse, we should not receiue mystically the bodie of Christ <hi>in Leu. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</q>

                  <p>But M. Heskins by miserable detorting of a worde or two, woulde make the auncient fathers patrones of his monstrous sacriledge, as though they taught whole Christ to be vnder eche kinde, of which opinion, there is not one title to be found in all their workes. First, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian <hi>de Cana Domini, Panis iste communis in carnem &amp; sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Domini mutatus, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14727:159"/>
falsifying the wordes of Cyprian, by adding <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> and leauing out that which followeth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all out of doubt, that Cyprian speaketh not here of the sacramentall bread, but of common breade. <q>His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are these: <hi>Panis iste communis in carnem &amp; sanguinem mutatus, procurat vitam &amp; incrementum corporibus, ideo<expan>

                  <p>Who seeing hee was so vehement against them that vsed water onely in the cuppe, would he (think you) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that neither wine nor water shoulde be giuen? Especially, when hee giueth a generall rule, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christe bee precisely obserued, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else is to be done concerning the cuppe, then that Christe him selfe did before vs, <hi>lib.</hi>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14727:160"/>
wordes, thou mayst see plainly here, that hee meant not to exclude the bread, but that they both together make the sacrament. But Maister Heskins alledgeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Irenaeus: <hi>Sanguis non est nisi a venis, &amp; carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; reliqua quae est secundùm hominem substantia. Bloud is not but of vaines and fleshe, and other substance of man.</hi> By these wordes which he vseth to proue, that Christe had a true bodie, because he had bloud, M. Heskins like a wise man would proue that wheresoeuer bloud is, there must be fleshe, and vaines also, wherein all the pudding wiues of Louayne will holde against him. In deede, bloude commeth from vaynes and fleshe, (as Irenęus sayeth) but it doth not followe, that where bloud is, there must be vaines and fleshe. As for the saying of Bernarde, wee are as little moued withall, as M. Heskins with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon, to whome in his brauerie, he sayeth <hi>vale,</hi> and will cleaue to the substantiall doctrine of the fathers for the communion in one kinde, of which he is not able to bring one. But to conclude this Chapter, <hi>If he be asked why Christe did institute the sacrament vnder both kindes, if it bee sufficient to receiue one: he aunswereth, to frequent the solemne memoriall of his death and passion.</hi> But all Christian men ought to frequent the solemne memoriall of his death and passion, therefore he did institute it, for all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men to receiue vnder both kindes. And so S. Paule concludeth, as often as you eate of this bread, and drink of this cuppe, you shewe the Lordes death vntil he come. Wherefore the scripture is directly contrarie to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious decree of the Papistes, of receiuing the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one kinde onely.</p>

And otherwise, for as much as the Lordes supper is a seale and sacrament of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and participation of the fleshe and bloude of our sauiour Christ, which he there teacheth: we may necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily gather, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seeing he ioyneth eating and drinking in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, we may not omitt either of them in the signe.</p>
                  <p>And where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistes would shift off that matter with their concomitans of bloud with the bodie, it will not serue, seeing he requireth drinking, as necessarily as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, euen as he is a perfect foode: and therefore, is not meate without drinke, but both meate and drinke.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, diuerse counsels, and specially <hi>Bracarense tertium Capitul.</hi> 1. and it is in the decrees <hi>De Con.

                        <hi>Illud verò quod pro complemento communionis intinctam tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt eucharistiam populis, nec hoc probatum ex Euangelio testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium receperunt, vbi Apostolis corpus suum commendauit &amp; sanguinem, Seorsim enim panis &amp; seorsim calicis commendatio memoratur.

For we read not that Christ gaue dipped bread to others, except that disciple only, whome the dipped soppe shewed to be the traitour of his maister, but did not set forth the institution of this sacrament.</q>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:14727:161"/>
Note here the iudgement of this Counsell, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ is to be obserued. Secondly, that they are condemned, that receiue not the testimonie of that first institution, as an onely rule to followe in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the sacrament, as the Papistes do. Thirdly, that the bloud must not be deliuered in the bread, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the cuppe, but seuerally the breade, and seuerally the cup must be deliuered. Fourthly, that the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not perfect, without both kindes, which euen they confessed, that dipped the bread in the wine, and so gaue it foorth. Fiftly, consider if this Counsel could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the ioyning of both kinds in one soppe, what would they haue thought of taking one kinde cleane away?</p>
                  <p>But to follow Maister Heskins. The second obiection, and that presseth him hardest, is the saying of Gelasius bishop of Rome: <hi>That the diuision of one and the same myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cannot be done without great sacriledge.</hi> To auoyde this most manifest and cleare authoritie, he thinketh it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to shewe, that the decree was made against other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, namely, the Manichees &amp; Eutychians, as though it were sacriledge in one kinde of heretiques, and lawful in an other. He saith, the Manichees, to cloake their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, would dissemblingly receiue the breade, and would not receiue the cup, bicause they held that Christ had but a fantasticall body, without bloud. And the Eutychians ioyned with them, which receiued the breade as a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diuine body of Christe, in which was no bloud.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Eutychians, there might bee some such fantasie, if they ioyned with the Manichees in this point, which presently I doe not remember that I haue read. But concerning the Manichees, it is certaine, there was an other cause of their refusall of the cup, bicause they condemned all drinking of wine. And of them it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that Leo spake, <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>de quadra.</hi> which M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins rehearseth. <hi>Abducunt se &amp;c. They withdrawe them selues from the sacrament of the health of man, and as they deny Christe our Lorde to be borne in the veritie of our flesh, so they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14727:161"/>
that he did verily die, and rise againe, and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the day of our health and of our gladnesse, with the sadnesse of their fasting. And when to couer their infidelitie, they are so bold to be present at our mysteries, they so temper them selues in the communion of the sacraments, that sometimes they are more safely hidden. With vnworthy mouth they receiue the body of Christe, but the bloud of our redemption they altogether refuse to drinke: which thing we will your holinesse to vnderstand for this cause, that suche kinde of men may be knowne to you and by these tokens, and that they whose sacrilege and dissimulation shall be found out being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bewrayed, by the Priestly authoritie, may be banished the societie of the Saints.</hi> This M. Hes. confesseth to be spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Manichees. And I wold he would further note, that Leo chargeth them with dissimulation ioyned with sacriledge, which yet is more tollerable, then the Papistes open impudencie and violent sacriledge. But here he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a plaine place for the proclamer, in that Leo saith: with vnworthy mouth they receiue the body of Christe, but that Leo so calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament of the body of Christ, which after a certaine manner is the body of Christe, and not simply or absolutely, it appeareth by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth imediatly, that those heretiques refuse to receiue the bloud of our redemption, whereby hee meaneth the cup and the sacrament of his bloud, for if hee should not meane the outward sacramentes, but the body and bloud of Christ indeed, how could his body be receiued without his bloud? Therefore it is manifest hee speaketh of the signes and not of the things signified euen by their owne rule of concomitance.</p>
                  <p>And nowe followeth the whole saying of Gelasius, <hi>Comperimus autem &amp;c. We haue found out of a certaintie, that certaine men after they haue receiued a portion of the holy body, do abstaine from the cup of the holy bloud, who (bicause I knowe not by what superstition they are taught to be withholden) let them without all doubt receiue the whole sacramentes, or else let them bee forbidden from the whole. For the diuision of one and the same mysterie, can not be done without great sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Maister Heskins to shift off this place, saith, it was
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14727:162"/>
written against the Manichees. But that is altogether vnlike, for then Gelasius would not haue saide, he knewe not by what superstition they were led, for he knewe well the blasphemies of the Manichees. Wherefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, they were other such superstitious people, as the Papistes be nowe. But if it were written against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, the Papistes following their steppes, shall gaine nothing, but proue them selues to ioyne with the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Maister Heskins saith, the diuision of one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, is not the diuiding of the cuppe from the breade, but of the body of Christ from his bloud, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees did. Although hee bee worthie to be knocked in the head with a mall, that will not vnderstand Gelasius, to speake of the sacrament, yet there is no shadowe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shrowde him most impudently affirming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. For the Manichees did not diuide the body of Christe from his bloud, but vtterly denyed him to haue either body or bloud. Againe, when hee saide imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, that they should eyther receiue the whole sacramentes, or abstaine from the whole, hee addeth this for a reason. For the diuision (sayth hee) of one and the same mysterie, can not bee done without greate sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Hee therefore that denyeth him to speake one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of diuiding the one kinde from the other, is woorthie to bee diuided in peeces, and to haue his partes with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, where shall bee weeping and gnashing of teeth. But as though he had not passed impudencie her selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, hee falleth on rayling against the proclamer, that had not brought foorth past halfe a score wordes of this place, suppressing the rest for very shame, they make so much against him. Surely, in all reasonable mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, what so euer hee left out of this place, hee left the aduauntage of his owne cause, and no title againste him.</p>
                  <p>But let vs see here what Maister Heskins, a man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention passing Sinon the Gręcian, hath gathered out of it. There bee two thinges in this place plainely
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14727:162"/>
taught: <hi>The first is, the reall presence of Christes body and bloud, in that he so reuerently calleth the sacrament vnder one kinde, the portion of the Lords body, and the other he calleth the cup of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bloud. For the spiritual bloud is not contained in external or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial vessels.</hi> No syr, but the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his natural bloud is, wherof he speaketh: as it is manifest by the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before, <hi>the portion of the Lords body,</hi> for his natural body is not broken into portions, but the bread which is a sacrament thereof, is broken, and therby is shewed, what wicked men receiue both in this saying of Gelasius, &amp; in the other of Leo, not the naturall body of Christe, which cannot be receiued in portions, but a portion of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental bread, which is therfore called the body of Christ, bicause it is so indeed to them that receiue it worthily, &amp; is consecrated to that vse, that it may be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the body of Christ. And as it hath ben often shewed, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments beare the names of the very things wherof they are sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. <hi>The second thing that he teacheth (saith M. Hes.) is, that he calleth not these two kindes, Sacramentum, a sacrament, but, Sacramenta, sacramentes, in the plural number signifying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that each of them is a whole sacrament.</hi> O new Diuinitie! the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye Papistes haue eight sacraments. But are you such a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gatherer M. Hes? it appeareth you wil lease none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage for the taking vp. I commend you. But for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, doth not your Authour Leo call both kindes <hi>sacramentum</hi> a sacrament? and that is more (for it is too too childish, to reason of the singular number) doth not Gelasius call the sacrament in both kindes, <hi>Vnum idémque mysterium,</hi> one and the same mysterie? And when he vseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the ground of your Achillean argument, doth he not say, <hi>Integra sacramenta percipiant, aut ab integris arceantur.</hi> Let them take the whole sacramentes, or else let them be kept from the whole, signifying, that they which tooke the bread onely, tooke but halfe the sacramentes, and none took the whole, but they that tooke the cup also.</p>
                  <p>But nowe for the practise of the Primitiue Church to haue receiued in one kinde: he saith, that in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, the Priest deliuered them of the sacrament wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14727:163"/>
in fine linnen clothes to carie home with them, and to receiue it secretly by them selues, and this could bee none other, but the sacrament vnder the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne of breade. Admit it were so, that they caried home the sacrament, yet it followeth not, but they might as well carie the wine in a faire pot, as they caried the breade in a faire cloth. And although Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writing to his wife, name bread only, yet doth it not followe, but that he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the cup also. The wordes of Tertullian are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearsed and answered, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Next is brought in Basil. <hi>Episto. ad Caesareant patriciam. Illud autem &amp;c. As for that to be a grieuous thing in the times of persecution, any man to be inforced to receiue the communion with his owne hand, the Priest or Deacon not being present, it is more then nedeth to proue, for bicause the same thing is by a long custome, and by the very vse of things established. For all they that in the wildernesse lead a solitarie life, where there is no Priest, keeping the communion at home, communicate of them selues. But in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria and Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ypt, euery one of the people for the most part, haue the communion in their owne house. For when the Priest doth conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the sacrifice and distribute it, we must well beleeue to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate and receiue it. For in the Church the Priest giueth part, and he that taketh it receiueth it with all libertie, and putteth it to his mouth with his owne hand It is therfore the same thing in vertue, whether a man take one part of the Priest, or many parts together.</hi> Of the credite and authoritie of this Epistle, which being cited in the name of Saint Basil, is not to be found in all his workes, I haue spoken before sufficiently, as also of the reseruation of the sacrament gathered out of it in the first booke cap. 27. But for the communion in one kinde, I see nothing that he saith, sauing that Maister Heskins gathereth, that <hi>Such small portions of wine will not be kept in those hote countries conueniently in their own kind such long time, as they were forced to reserue the sacrament in the wildernes and else where.</hi> But I aunswere him, that such strong wine as they haue in those hote countries, will bee kept longer from sowring, then the breade will bee from moulding, and therefore his gathering is altogether fond &amp; ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14727:163"/>
                     <hi>But now you shall heare a more plaine testimoine for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt vnder one kinde, if you will hearken to S. Cyprian.</hi> He is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>In sermone de Lapsis,</hi> a long saying &amp; to litle, yea to no purpose at all. <hi>Praesente ac teste meipso, &amp;c. Heare what came to passe, my selfe beeing present and witnesse. The parentes of a childe flying by chaunce, while for feare they tooke no good aduisement leaft their young daughter vnder the cherishing of a nource, the nource brought her so left, vnto the Magistrates. They before an Idole where the people were gathered, because for her age she could yet eate no flesh, gaue vnto her bread mixed with wine, which remained also of the sacrifice of them that perish. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde the mother receiued her daughter. But the litle mayde could no more speake and declare the offence, that was committed, then vnderstand it before and forbidde it. Through ignorance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fell out that her mother brought her in with her, whyle we were sacrificing. But truely the girle beeing among the Saintes, not abiding our prayer and supplication, sometime was constrained to crie out, sometime with vehement greefe of minde was tossed here and there, euen as though a tormentor compelled her, the ignorant soule, by such tokens as she could, acknowledged the conscience of her fact in those yong and tender yeres. But after the solemnities beeing accomplished, the Deacon began to offer the cup to them that were present, and when the rest had receiued, and her place was next, the little one by the instinct of Gods Maiestie, turned away her face, pressed her mouth with her lippes stopped, refused the cuppe. Yet the Deacon persisted, and though it were against her will, powred in somewhat of the sacrament of the cuppe. Then followed belking and vomite. In a bodie, and a mouth that was defiled, the Eucharistie could not remaine. The drinke sanctified in the bloud of our Lord, brake out of her polluted bowels, &amp;c.</hi> Out of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, Maister Heskins gathereth two thinges. <q>First, that the sacrament in that time was ministred to infantes which was in deede a great abuse, contrarie to the worde of God. Secondly, that this childe receiued onely the cup, which is false, for though she was not so troubled at the receipt of the bread, yet it followeth not that she receiued no bread, but contrariwise Cyprian saith, the Eucharistie (by whiche wordes the fathers alwayes vnderstand the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14727:164"/>
whole sacrament) could not remaine in her bodie.</q> And whereas he reasoneth foolishly, that if she had receiued the bread, she should like wise haue beene troubled: he must vnderstand, that when God worketh a miracle, he taketh times and occasions at his pleasure. And it is like he would not discouer her pollution that come by bread and wine, before she had receiued both bread and wine as the sacrament. If I should vrge vpon this place, as the scoole men doe, whether this that was vomited, was the bloud of Christ, and what should be done with it, or what was done with it in this storie, I should trouble him more then he could easily answere.</p>
                  <p>Another tale he telleth out of Sozomenus. <hi>Eccl. hist. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Ioanne Constantinopolitanum, &amp;c. When Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome did very well gouerne the Church of Constantinople, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine man of the Macedonian heresie, had a wife of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. When this man had heard Iohn teaching what was to bee thought of God, he praysed his doctrine, and exhorted his wife to be of the same minde with him. But when she did more obey the words of noble women, then his conuersation, and after many admonitions her husband had profited nothing: Except (quod he) thou be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with me in Diuine matters, thou shalt not be hereafter a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of liuing with me. When the woman heard this, &amp; promised her consent dissemblingly, she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the matter with a certeyne maide seruant, which shee iudged to be trustie vnto her, and vseth her seruice to deceiue her husband. And about the time of the mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, (they that be receiued to them know what I say) she keping that she had receiued, fell downe as though she would pray. Her maide, standing by, giueth her priuily, that which she brought in her hand with her, which thing, when it was put to her teeth, it congeled into a stone. The woman beeing astonnied fearing least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euil should happen to her, for that thing whiche came to passe from God, made hast to the Bishop, and bewraying her selfe, sheweth the stone, hauing yet vpon it, the markes of her bit, and shewing an vnknowen matter, and a wonderful colour, and also desiring pardon with teares, promised that she would agree with her husband. And if this matter seeme to any man to be incredible, this stone is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is kept to this day among the Iewels of the Churche of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14727:164"/>
Constantinople.</hi> If this storie be true, as it is no article of our beleefe, yet proueth it not, that the communion was ministred in bread only, to all the rest, that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the cuppe, although I wote not what was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a stone, before the time came she should receiue the cuppe. If M. Heskins will vrge, she could not haue any thing to conuey into her mouth in steede of the wine, I answere, she might easily counterfet the drinking, by kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the cuppe, and so letting it passe from her, without tasting thereof. Wherefore this is but a blind and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable coniecture of Maister Heskins, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ministred in one kinde, because she that had dissembled in the receipt of one kinde, was punished with depriuation from both kindes.</p>
                  <p>The last reason he vseth, <hi>Is that it is testified by learned men, that the manner of receiuing vnder one kinde, which is vsed in all the Latine Church vpon good Friday, on which day the priest receiueth the hoste consecrated vpon maundie Thursday, hath been so vsed from the primitiue Church.</hi> 
                     <q>But what learned men they be, except such as him selfe, and what proofes they haue of this vsage, he sayeth not so much as halfe a word. The whole matter standeth vpon his owne credite. But if he, and all the learned of that side, should fast from good Friday vntill they haue shewed proofe of such an vse in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> primitiue church, (not as they vse to fast in Lent,) but from all manner of nourishment, there would not one learned Papist be left aliue on gang Monday to shew what proofes they haue found.</q> Thou hast seene (Reader) what his reasons and authorities are, iudge of the answers according to thy discretion.</p>

In so much that Irenaeus saith: <hi>Libro</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Quid autem, &amp;c. And what if the Apostles, had left vs no writinges, ought we not to haue followed the order of tradition which they deliuered to them to whome they had committed the Churches</hi>? Wherevpon Maister Heskins gathereth, that not onely for matters conteined in scripture, but also for traditions vnwritten in the holie scriptures, the fathers are to be credited. But he goeth farre from Irenaeus minde, who confuted the heretiques both by the scriptures, and by the authoritie of the moste auncient Churches, whose traditions must haue beene all our institution, if there had ben no scriptures: But seeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> scriptures inspired of God by his gratious prouidence, are left vnto vs, al tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be examined by them, &amp; that is twise proued (after Irenaeus minde,) whiche is proued both by the scriptures, and by the authoritie of the Churches. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the scriptures are sufficient of them selues. 2. Tim. 3. And no tradition or authoritie is to be receiued which is repugnant or contrarie vnto them. The text of Saint Paule, that he speaketh, is written, 1. Cor. 10. <hi>Brethren I would not haue you ignorant, that all our fathers were vnder the cloude, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptised by Moses in the cloude and in the sea, and did all eate the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate, and did all drinke the same spirituall drinke, for they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14727:165"/>
dranke of the same spirituall rocke, which followed them, and the rocke was Christe.</hi> Where it is to be noted, that Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins in steede of the same spirituall meate, and the same spirituall drinke, translateth one spiritual meate, and one spirituall drinke, as though the sense were, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did all eate &amp; drinke of one spiritual kind of meate and drinke, but not of the same that we doe. Which is directly contrarie to the meaning of the Apostle, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by many reasons, whereof some I will set downe, because this one text of scripture, if it be rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, is sufficient to determine all the controuersies that are betweene vs and the Papistes, concerning the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes. First therefore the argument of Saint Paule is of no force to conuince the Corinthians, except he shewe, that the fathers of the olde Testament, had the same sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in substance, that we haue, and yet pleased not God by meanes of their wicked life, no more shall we, hauing the same sacramentes if we followe their wicked conuersation. Secondly, except he had meant to make the fathers equal vnto vs in the outwarde signes or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of Gods fauour, he would rather haue taken his example of circumcision, and the pascal lambe, which all men knowe to haue beene their principal sacraments: then of their baptisme and spiritual foode, which in them was so obscure, that except the spirite of God had by him reuealed it vnto vs it had beene very harde for vs to haue gathered. Thirdly, when he saith the fathers were all baptised, there is no doubt, but that he meaneth, that they all receiued the sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christ, for there were no reason, why they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the one sacrament, rather then the other. Fourthly, seeing the Apostle saith expressely, they did eate the same spirituall meate, and drinke the same spirituall drinke, and after doth precisely affirme, that they dranke of the same rocke, which was Christe, it is moste euident, that their spiritual meate was our spiritual meate, namely the bodie of Christ, and their spiritual drinke was our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall drinke, namely the bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:14727:166"/>And this place ouerthroweth transubstantiation, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal presence, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder one kinde, the grace of the worke wrought, the fiue false sacramentes, the Popish consecration, the Popish reseruation for adoration, and in a manner, what so euer the Papistes teache of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contrarie to the truth. For if we haue no preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aboue the fathers concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance &amp; outward signes of the sacramentes, then we receiue the bodie and bloud of Christ in the sacramentes, none otherwise then they did before his bodie was conceiued of the virgine Marie, and that is spiritually by faith, not carnally with our mouth. The rest of this Chapter is consumed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing out of Chrysostome, the general purpose of the Apostle in these wordes, which we haue shewed before, &amp; it is most plaine, by the text as it followeth: Finally in declaring what temporall benefites the Israelites recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the cloude, the sea, manna, and the water of the rocke. But that which is principall, and for which cause the Apostle alledgeth their example, namely, for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace that was testified by these outwarde signes, Maister Heskins speaketh neuer a worde.</p>

                     </note>The second Chapter sheweth what these foure thinges done in the olde Law, did figure in the newe Lawe.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter he laboureth to shewe, that these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of theirs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fulk.</hi>
                     </note> were not in deed the very same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that ours are, but onely figures of them. And for this purpose, he citeth diuers authorities of the fathers, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Chrysostome, and Augustine, which cal them fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of our sacraments, whereof we will not striue with him. But he doth not consider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in so calling them, they compare not the substance, or thinges signified by these auncient sacramentes, with the substance or thinges sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by our sacraments, but the outward signes of theirs with the substance and things signified by ours. As it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in sundrie places of S. Augustine, whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in this Chapter he citeth: which affirmeth that the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14727:166"/>
fathers also receiued, not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signes of our sacraments, as bare figures, but also the grace and substance of them, whereof they were no counterfet seales. Neither doeth Chrysostome or Origen say any thing to the contrarie, for Chrysostme saith, that as all sortes of men, riche and poore were vnder the cloude, passed through the sea, and were fedde with the same spirituall foode, so in our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of baptisme and the supper, there is no respect of persons, but all members of the Church are partakers of them alike.</p>
                  <p>And Origen saying that: <hi>Baptisme was then in a darke manner, in the clowde, and in the sea, but nowe in cleare man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner regeneration is in water and the holie Ghoste</hi>: Doeth both affirme the same sacrament to haue beene then, which is nowe, namely baptisme, and also sheweth the onely difference betweene this and that, when he sayeth, that was after a darke manner and this after a cleare manner. But Augustine is moste playne in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, namely: <hi>Tract. in Ioan.</hi> 26. speaking of the bread of life, in the sixt of Ihon, he sayeth: <hi>Hunc panem signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauit manna, hunc panem significauit altare Dei.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Sacramenta illa fuerunt: in signis diuersa sunt, sed in re, quae significatur, paria sunt. Apostolum audi. Nolo enim (inquit) vos ignorare fratres, quia patres nostri omnes sub nube fuerunt, &amp; omnes mare transie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, &amp; omnes per Mosen Baptizati sunt in nube &amp; in mari: &amp; omnes eandem escam spiritualem manducauerunt: spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem vtique eandem, nam corporalem alteram: quia illi manna, nos aliud: spiritualem verò, quam nos.</hi> This bread did manna signifie, this bread did the altar of God signifie. Those were sacramentes: in signes they are diuerse, but in the thing which is signified, they are equall. Heare what the Apostle saith. For I would not haue you ignorant brethren (sayeth he) that our fathers were all vnder the cloude, and all passed the sea, and were all baptised by Moses in the cloude and in the sea, and they did all eate the same spirituall meate: I say the same spirituall meate, for they did eate another corporall meate, for they did eate manna, and we another thing: but they
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14727:167"/>
did eate the same spirituall meate that we doe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Likewise in his exposition of the 77: Psalme vpon this very text in hand, he saith thus: <hi>Idem itaque in myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio cibus &amp; potus illorum, qui noster, Sed significatione idem non specie: quia idem ipse Christus illis in Petra figuratus: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis in carne manifestatus.</hi> The same meate and drinke in mysterie was theirs, which is ours: but the same by sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, not in cleare manner: because the selfe same Christe was figured to them in the rocke, whiche is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh vnto vs.</q>

                     <q>The same S.

Nisi quia cundem quene nos.</hi> They did eate (saith he) the same spirituall meate, what is the same? but the same that we eate? and a little after. <hi>Eundem (inquit) cibum spiritualem manducauerunt.

                     </q> They did eate (saith he) the same spirituall meate. <q>It had suffised that he had said, they did eate a spirituall meate: he saith the same. I can not finde, how I should vnderstande the same, but the same whiche we doe eate. What then sayeth one? Was that Manna the same thing that I doe nowe receiue? Then is there nothing come nowe, if it were then before. Then is the slaunder of the crosse made voide? Therefore how should it be the same, but that he added spirituall? I coulde cite other places out of Augustine, but that I will not cloie the Reader, with two many at once.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"The last parte of the Chapter, would proue, that the baptisme of Iohn was not the baptisme of CHRIST, wherevppon I will not stande, because it is an other controuersie, out of the purpose of the booke, onely I will note these grosse absurdities: that hee denyeth
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14727:167"/>
the baptisme of Iohn to be the very baptisme, and then it followeth, that CHRISTE was not baptised with the very baptisme, who was baptised of Iohn.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he denieth, that sinnes were remitted in the Baptisme of Iohn, whiche is directly contrarie to the Scripture: Luke. 3. verse 3. He alledgeth Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome for his proofe, but the blinde buzzarde can not see the difference betweene the ministerie of Iohn in his baptisme, and the worke of CHRISTE in the same, whiche maketh him with his fellowes to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a difference of baptismes, by as good reason as they might make a difference betweene the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per whiche was celebrated by CHRISTE him selfe, and that whiche was ministered by his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Finally, where the Apostle sayeth expressely, that the Fathers were baptised, hee is so bolde as to say, they were not baptised in deede, but onely recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a bare figure of baptisme, whiche is as muche for the Apostles purpose, as if hee hadde saide nothing at all.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <p>The thirde Chapter expoundeth the residue of the texte: Et om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes candem escam spiritualem, &amp;c.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>First he declareth that this one meate, whiche the Fathers did eate, was Manna,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fulke.</hi>
                     </note> and that hee proueth by the authoritie of Saint Chrysostome, and Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, as his manner is to heape vppe testimonies of the Fathers, where no neede is of any proofe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he determineth wherefore it is called spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meate, and the water that flowed out of the rocke, spirituall drinke. Namely, because it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them miraculously, and not naturally, and for none other cause, whiche is altogether vntrue: for as it hath beene prooued before, both out of the text, and confirmed by the iudgement of Saint Augustine, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was called spirituall meate, because it fedde the faithfull, not onely bodily, but also spiritually, with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14727:168"/>
the bodie of CHRISTE, and the water with his bloud. But Maister Heskins seemeth to builde vpon Chrysostomes authoritie, who in 1. Cor. 10. writeth thus. <hi>Quanuis, &amp;c. Although those thinges that were giuen were perceiued by sense: yet they were giuen spiritually, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of consequences, but according to the grace of the gifte.</hi> By these wordes Chrysostome meaneth, that although Manna and the water were sensible things, yet had they a spirituall signification and vertue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with them: for as they were not giuen by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie course of nature, but by speciall Diuine power: so they had more then a naturall propertie of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and were to be esteemed according to the speciall grace, by whiche they were giuen. But Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins will acknowledge nothing in this miracle of manna, but the feeding of their bodies, nor in the water of the rocke, but the quenching of their thirst, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their bodily necessitie. In whiche grosse mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hee maketh no difference betweene the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and their brute beastes, whose thirst and bodily necessitie, that water did satisfie, as muche as their Maisters.</p>
                  <p>So that if the water bee called spirituall drinke, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it was miraculously giuen, this horrible ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie will followe, that the cattell whiche dranke thereof, did also drinke of the spirituall rocke whiche followed them, which rocke was Christ: which euerie Christian man detesteth to heare. But contrariwise, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that water was a sacrament of the bloud of Christe, we may see no lesse then three heresies of the Papistes about the sacrament ouerthrowen thereby.</p>
                  <p>First, because all the people did drinke of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christes bloud, and not the Priestes onely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the elementes are no longer sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, then they be in vse of ministration. For the water which was a sacrament of Christes bloud vnto the Israelites, so often as they dranke of it, was no sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they occupied it to other necessarie vses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:14727:168"/>Thirdly, that bruite beastes, as Dogges, Apes, and myse, eating and drinking the bread and wine that hath beene consecrated to the vse of the sacrament, doe not eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of CHRISTE. For the bruite beastes did drinke of this water, which to the faithfull was consecrated in the right vse thereof, to be the bloud of CHRISTE. Yet did not the bruite beastes touche the sacrament of his bloud.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Heskins will haue vs to note, <hi>That Saint Paule saith not, they dranke of that materiall rocke: but they dranke of a spirituall rocke which followed them, whiche spiritual rocke was Christe.</hi> And herevpon he condemneth Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius, for abusing Saint Paules wordes. <hi>The rocke was CHRISTE, to make it a figuratiue speache, whereas the saide proposition is to be vnderstoode grammatically or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and not tropically, or figuratiuely</hi>: And so is nothing like, to this proposition. This is my bodie. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the Reader looketh for a newe transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when hee heareth Maister Heskins exclude all tropes and figures from this saying, <hi>The rocke was Christe.</hi> But vouchsafe to heare his reason, and you shall more maruell at his monstruous impudencie. Because it is called a spirituall rocke, therefore there is no trope or figure in the speache.</p>
                  <p>But admitte that Saint Paule had no relation to the materiall rocke, out of which the waters did flowe, is this a proper and essentiall praedication to say, Christe is a spirituall rocke? will not all the Grammarians, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, and Rhetoricians in the worlde throwe stones at him, that will so affirme? But all men endewed with reason will confesse, that Manna and the rocke are in one sense of Saint Paule, called spirituall: but the materiall manna was the spirituall meate, by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Heskins owne interpretation, therefore the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall rocke was the spirituall rocke out of whiche flowed the spirituall drinke.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Heskins hath another reason, to proue that the material rock was not called the spiritual rocke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14727:169"/>
the materiall rocke stoode still in the Wildernesse, but the spirituall rocke followed them. Although Saint Paule meane of the streames and riuers of water, which flowing out of the rocke, followed them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their iourneys in the wildernesse: Yet if wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande it (as he doeth) of Christe who rather went before them then followed them, it proueth not, that the materiall rocke was not called the spirituall rocke. For in sacraments, that is spoken of the signe often times, which is proper to the thing signified, &amp; wrought by them, as baptisme is called regeneration, the Pascall Lambe, the passing ouer, so the spirituall rocke follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them, and was Christe. But he woulde faine father his monstrous absurditie, vppon Chrysostome, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Cum dixisset, &amp;c. When he had sayed, that they dranke spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drinke, he added: For they dranke of the spirituall rocke which followed them, and ioyned to it, and that rocke was Christ. For not of the nature of the rocke (sayeth he) flowed out the water, for then it would haue flowed out before that time, but a certeine other spirituall rocke, wrought all things, that is Christ, which being present euery where, did all the miracles, therefore he sayde following them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these wordes, Chrysostome putteth a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the signe, and the thing signified, that is, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall rocke, and Christe whome because it represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was called a spirituall rocke, as Manna being a corporall foode, was called spirituall meate, because it represented Christes flesh, which is the spirituall meat of our mindes. Otherwise, that the materiall rocke was not called the spirituall rocke, Chrysostome sayeth not. But Saint Augustine, as wee haue shewed before, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth plainly, that which Maister Heskins denyeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently.</p>
                  <p>Proceeding in his confutation of Oecolampadius his principle, that figures bear the names of things, of which they be figures, as the fierie tongues, the Doue, and the breathing of Christe vppon his Apostles, of the holie Ghoste, and Iohn Baptist, of Helias, he denyeth that any
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14727:169"/>
of these examples doe proue it: for that neither any of these is called the holie Ghoste, nor Iohn called Helias. But he is fouly beguiled: for although hee quarrell at the aduerbe <hi>veluti,</hi> as it were fyerie, alledging Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome to proue, that it was not naturall fyre, or winde, but the holie Ghoste: yet was that visible forme, called the holie Ghoste, as both in the seconde of the Actes, and in the eleuenth it is plaine: Hee sat vppon euery one of them.</p>
                  <p>If Maister Heskins were posed (as boyes bee in the schoole) who or what sat? hee may not saye the fierie tongues, which is the plurall number, but the holie Ghoste which was represented by them. And Actes. 11. Peter sayeth: The holie Ghoste fell vppon them, euen as vppon vs at the beginning, that is those visible signes, of his inuisible and incomprehensible presence. And whereas hee cauelleth, that the Doue is not called the holie Ghoste: I aske him howe could Iohn saye, he sawe the holie Ghoste which is inuisible, but that he sawe the bodily shape of a Doue, which was a sacrament of him? And as for the breathing of Christe, to signifie the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoste, and to bee so called: howe coulde the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles vnderstande it otherwise, at that time, when gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them his breath, he sayde, receiue the holie Ghost, then when he gaue them bread, and sayed: receiue this, it is my bodie? for in both, by an outwarde and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sacrament, hee testified, what he did giue them in deede, no more turning the breade into his naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, then his breath into the substaunce of the holie Ghoste.</p>
                  <p>But of all the rest, it is moste intolerable impudence, that he denyeth <hi>Iohn Baptist to bee Helias that was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied by Malachie, affirming that the prophesie speaketh of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Helias before the seconde comming of Christ, which shall be to iudgement: saying that Christe doeth not assertiuely saye, that Iohn was Helias, but if ye will so take it, this is hee.</hi> But to knocke his blockishe ignorance, or rather serpentine mallice in the head, the Angel <hi>in Luk.</hi> 1. doth assertiuely
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14727:170"/>
applye that Prophesie to Iohn Baptiste, saying: Hee shall goe before him in the spirite and power of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, to turne the heartes of the fathers vnto the children, which be the verie wordes of the Prophet. And our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christe him selfe, Math. 17. and Marke the 9. doth assertiuely saye, that Helias was alreadie come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prophesie, and his disciples vnderstoode, that he spake to them of Iohn the Baptist. What a shamelesse beast is this Heskins, to reason against so manifest a trueth, to mainteine so false an errour? But wee must aunswere his reasons, although no argumentes are to bee heard against the expresse authoritie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>First, he sayeth, that Prophesie cannot be expounded of the first comming of Christ, because he sayth, Helias shall come before the greate and fearfull daye of the Lorde: whereas the first comming of Christe, was not fearfull, but peaceable, not to iudge, but to saue. But he will not vnderstand, that Christes comming, as it was moste comfortable to the penitent sinners, so moste terrible to the hypocrites and obstinate wicked men: witnesse Iohn Baptist him selfe, Math. 3. from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verse to the ende of the twelfth. What shoulde I spende time in so cleare a matter? His seconde reason is of the authoritie of Euthymius, and Chrysostome, which if they go against the plaine authoritie of Christe, who will receiue them? Although neither of them both in the places by him cited, affirme that hee sayeth. <q>For Euthymius, <hi>in</hi> 11. <hi>Math. Si vultis recipere quod suturum esse dictum est de hoc tempore, siue suscipere, id est, rebus animuni aduertere, ipse est Helias qui venturus erat, vtpote ipsum illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ministerium perficiens:</hi> If you will receiue that which is sayed shalbee of this time: or if you will giue your myndes to marke the thinges, he is Helias, which was to come, as one perfourming his ministerie: which Maister Heskins hath falsified by translating thus: <hi>If ye will receiue that that is spoken to be done hereafter to be of this present time.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:14727:170"/>And although Euthymius do hold, that Helias shall come before the seconde comming of Christe: yet doth he affirme, that Iohn is called Helias for similitude of office: <hi>Sicut primus Helias, secundus praecursor dicitur</hi>: <q>
                        <hi>ita sanè &amp; primus praecursor secundus Helias appellatur, propter simile ministerium.</hi> As the firste Helias is called the second fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner: so the seconde forerunner, is called the first He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias by reason of like ministerie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The place of Chrysostome, although either the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des going immediately before, or comming after, doe plainly expresse his minde, which Maister Heskins hath fraudulently concealed: yet as it is cited by him, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for him, but against him. I wil only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the place, and leaue the iudgement to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Rectè apposuit, &amp;c.</hi> He hath well added, if you will receiue it: I came not to compell any man: <q>that hee might seeme to require a thankefull minde of all men. <hi>And he signified that Iohn is Helias, and Helias is Iohn. For both they haue taken vppon them one administration, and both are appointed forerunners, wherefore he sayde not, this truely it Helias, but if ye will receiue it, this is hee:</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <q>That is, if with diligent studie, and with a gentle, not a contentious mynde, you will consider the dooings of them both.</q> Thus Chrysostome. And yet I am not ignorant, that else where, he supposeth that Helias the Thesbite shall come before the day of iudgement, which sauoureth of a Iewish fable, more then of a Christian trueth, as is plainly proued before.</p>

Howe much better, are these things then the former? For they which did eate that Manna, that is that breade, are deade. But whosoeuer shall eate this breade, shall liue for euer. But it is a spirituall Manna, that is, a rayne of spirituall wisedome, which is powred into them, that be wittie and searching is from heauen, and deweth the myndes of the Godly &amp; sweeteneth their iawes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because there is nothing in this saying of Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose for his purpose, hee falleth into a greate rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Oecolampadius, for leauing out of this sentence: <hi>Quanto praestantiora sunt haec superioribus? Howe much more excellent are these, then the other aboue rehearsed?</hi> Which, howesoeuer it was, as I am sure, it was not of a falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying mynde, so no man in the worlde, might worse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime against falsifying of the doctours then Maister Heskins, as I haue often shewed, and doubt not but I shall shewe hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But to the purpose, it is euident, that Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose in the former sentence, speaketh of Manna, as a corporall foode, not as a sacrament, in which respect, there is no comparison between it, &amp; the body of Christ. And he is so farre from saying, that Manna, as it was a sacrament, was but a figure of the bodie of Christ (as M.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14727:171"/>
Heskins belyeth him) that he saith not at all, that it was a figure.</p>
                  <p>But hee chargeth vs with two other wicked opinions, namely, <hi>That the sacramentes of the newe lawe giue no grace, and that they are of no more excellencie then the sacraments of the olde lawe.</hi> To the first we aunswere, and say, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes giue not grace of the worke wrought, as they teach, but that GOD giueth grace by his sacramentes in all his elect, wee affirme. And to the second, wee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that as in substaunce the sacramentes of the olde time were not inferiour to oures, so in cleerenesse of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation and vnderstanding, oures are farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then theirs, and that the place of Saint Ambrose, which Maister Heskins doeth next alledge, doeth very well shewe. <hi>Oriente autem &amp;c. The sonne of righteousnesse ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and more bright sacramentes of Christes body and bloud shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning foorth, those inferiour thinges or sacramentes should cease, and those perfect should be receiued of the people.</hi> Maister Heskins noteth, that if the sacrament were but a bare signe, it should not be so magnified by Saint Ambrose. But so often as hee chargeth vs with a bare signe, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten must we charge him againe with an impudently. For wee doe as much detest a bare signe or figure, as hee doth a signe or figure.</p>
                  <p>As for the three kindes of Manna that Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins gathereth, is altogether out of Saint Ambrose his compasse. For hee hath no more but the bodily Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and the spirituall Manna, as the signe and the thing signified. And the rayne of spirituall wisedome, is the spirite of GOD, which sealeth inwardly in the heart, that whiche is expressed outwardly by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall signes. I maruell Maister Heskins alledgeth not Saint Ambrose vpon this text 1. Cor. 10. whose woordes might seeme to haue more colour of his bare figure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be flat against it in deede. <q>

For all sacramentes haue their strength of the death of Christ. Secondly, we see that this father calleth our sacrament, a mysterie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christ: which speach is farre from a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manner of presence, that M. Heskins would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by his authoritie.</p>
                  <p>The other places cited out of Euthymius a late writer, as we haue often saide, affirme that Manna was the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue bread, and a figure, but not Christe which was the trueth. Howbeit, he meaneth nothing else, but that Christ was not in flesh present to the fathers in Manna, before he was incarnate, and so vseth the terme, figure, as a prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and shadowing, not of the sacrament, but of Christ him selfe, which is the matter of the sacrament, euen as Christ him selfe in the 6. of S. Iohn, opposing Manna a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the true bread that came downe from heauen, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of that spirituall meat which Manna was to the faithfull, but of the outward creature, which was onely considered of the wicked, to fill their bellies, and not to feede their soule.</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins remitteth his reader, for al matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the 6. of Iohn, to the second booke 36. chapter &amp;c. and so do I to the same places for answere. Neuerthelesse, he will touch a word of Oecolampadius, where he saith, that the inward man is fed by faith, which is so straunge to him, that he neuer read the like phrase in any authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike authour. <q>By which woondring, he sheweth him selfe to be a great stranger in S.

Nowe when Moses came vnto vs, and is ioyned to our Aethiopesse, the lawe of God is not nowe knowne in figures and images as before, but in the very apparence of the truth. And those things, which were first set foorth in darke speaches, are nowe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in plaine shewe and trueth. And therefore he, which declared the plaine forme of figures and darke speaches, saith, we knowe that all our fathers were vnder the cloude, and all passed through the sea &amp;c. Thou seest howe Paule assoyleth the darke riddles of the lawe, and teacheth the plaine shewe of those darke speaches.</hi> And a little after. <hi>Then in a darke manner Manna was the meate, but nowe in plaine shewe, the flesh of the sonne of God is the true meat, as he himselfe saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my flesh is meat in deed, and my bloud is drink in deede.</hi> M. Heskins thinketh, this is as plaine as neede to be, for his onely figure, and the bodily presence: and me thinke it is as plaine for the contrarie. For he affirmeth, that Manna was the same spirituall meate, that the flesh of the sonne of God is nowe, and layeth the difference in the obscure manner of deliuering the one, and the plaine manner of deliuering the other, which can not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:14727:173"/>

Euen I before a despised people of sinners, haue nowe the reuerend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the heauenly sacramentes, nowe I am receiued to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the heauenly table. The rayne is not powred downe on my meate, the spring of the earth laboureth not, nor the fruite of the trees. For my drinke no riuers are to be sought, nor welles. Christe is meate to me, Christe is drinke to me. The fleshe of GOD is meate to me, the bloud of GOD is my drinke. I doe not nowe looke for yearely increase to satisfie me: Christe is ministred to mee daily. I will not bee afrayde; least any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature of the ayre, or barrennesse of the countrie shoulde hang ouer mee, if the dilligence of godly tillage doe continue. I doe not nowe wishe the rayne of Quayles to come downe for me, which before I did maruell at. Not Manna which earst they preferred before all meates, bicause those Fathers which did eate Manna, haue hungered. My meate is that, which doeth not fatten the bodye, but confirmeth the heart of man. Before, that breade which came downe from heauen, was woonderfull to mee. For it is written, hee gaue them bread from heauen to eate, but that was not the true breade, but a shaddowe of that was to come. The father hath reserued for me that true breade from heauen.</hi>

                     <hi>which giueth life to this worlde. It hath not descended to the Iewes, nor to the Synagogue, but to the Church, to the younger people. For howe did that breade which giueth life, descend to the Iewes, when all they, that did eate that breade, that is Manna, which the Iewes thought to bee the true breade, are deade in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Howe did it descend to the Synagogue: when all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue perished and fainted, beeing pyned with euerlasting hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of fayth? Finally, if they had receiued the true breade, they had not sayde: Lorde giue vs alwayes this breade. What doest thou require, O Iewe, that hee shoulde giue vnto thee? The bread which he giueth to all, which he giueth daily, which hee giueth alwayes, it is in thy selfe, that thou maiest receiue this bread.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14727:174"/>
Come vnto this bread, and thou shalt receiue it. Of this bread it is said, all they that estrange them selues from thee shall perish. If thou estrange thy self fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, thou shalt perish. If thou come neere vnto him, thou shalt liue. He is the bread of life. He that eateth life can not die. For howe doth he die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose meate is life? How shall he fayle, which hath that vitall substance? Come ye vnto him, and be satisfied, for he is breade. Come ye vnto him and drinke for he is a wel Come ye vnto him and be lightened, for he is light. Come ye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and be deliuered for where the spirite of the Lord is, there is libertie. Come ye vnto him, and be absolued, for he is remission of sinnes. You aske who this may be? Heare ye him selfe saying I am the breade of life, he that commeth to me shall not hunger, and hee that beleeueth in me, shall neuer thirst. You haue heard him, and you haue seene him, and you haue not beleeued him, therefore you are dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The latter part of this long discourse sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the former. That Christe and the flesh and bloud of God (which M. Heskins noteth to be a plaine place for the proclamer) is so our true meate and drinke, as he is breade, as he is a well, as he is light, as he is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as he is remission of sinnes: that is, after a spiritual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And where he saith, Manna was a figure or shaddowe, and not the trueth of that which was to come: he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Manna, as it was corporall meate, and eaten of the vnfaithfull that are dead, and not as it was spiritual meat, and eaten of the faithfull which are aliue, as S. Augustine saith. Moreouer, it is to be noted, that S. Ambrose saith, that he which eateth this bread which is life, can not dye. Therefore no wicked man eateth this bread, this meate, this flesh of God, which with S. Ambrose are all one. As for the difference of our sacramentes, what it is, we haue shewed before, and this place sheweth none. For Ambrose speaketh of Manna as a corporall meat, and not as it was a spirituall meate and sacrament.</p>

                     </note> that Manna of the olde fathers is called a figure of the body of Christ, but that it was only a bare figure, and not the body of Christe vnto the faithful, that is it we deny. Cyprian is cited to litle or no purpose <hi>in ser. de Coen. Dom. Huius panis &amp;c. Of this bread Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na was a figure, which rayned in the desert. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are come to the true bread in the land of promise, that meat fayled.</hi> M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins saith, it is more manifest, then that it can be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this bread he speaketh of, is the holy bread of the sacrament: in which he acknowledgeth to be no breade at all. Then as manifest as he maketh it, it was a figure of Christ, which is the spiritual matter of the sacrament, and not of any holy breade thereof. But this he saith, will be proued by the last wordes of that sermon, which in deede, proue the cleane contrarie to his purpose. <hi>Sed &amp; nos ipsi &amp;c. But we also being made his body, both by the sacrament, and by the thing of the sacrament, are knit and vnited vnto our heade, euery one being members one of an other, shewing the ministerie of loue mutually, do communicate in charitie, are partakers of one cup, eating the same meate, and drinking the same drinke, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and runneth out of the spirituall rocke, which meate and drinke is our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Here is a plaine place for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamer, the meate and drinke is our Lorde Iesus Christe. But what proclamer denyeth, that our meat and drinke in the sacrament, is the body and bloud of Christe? This we deny, that the same is present after a bodily maner, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a bodily manner receiued, but spiritually onely, or by faith: euen as the same writer faith immediatly before <hi>Haec quoties agimus &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>As often as we doe these things, we sharpen not our teeth to eate, but with sincere faith wee breake and diuide that holy bread. But how can M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins auoyde this, that we are made the body of Christe, as we are partakers of his body in the sacrament?</q> whiche must needes be spiritually. Howe liketh he the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sacrament, and the thing or matter of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when with Papistes, either there is no difference made betweene the sacrament of his body and his body it selfe, or else the sacrament is nothing else, but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14727:175"/>
of breade and wine, by which we are neither made the body of Christ, nor vnited to him. But to auoyde our glose of spiritualitie, he fleeth backe to the saying of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus <hi>in</hi> 15. <hi>Ioan.</hi> which he hath so often repeated, and yet mangled and gelded, least the true sense might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of it. <hi>Non tamen negamus &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Yet do we not denye, but that we are spiritually ioyned to Christ, by right faith and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere loue, but that we haue no manner of coniunction with him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his flesh, that truely we doe vtterly deny, and say it to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether repugnant to the holy scriptures.</hi> For who hath doubted that Christe is also a vine, and we the branches, which from thence receiue life into vs. Heare what Paule saith, that we are all one body in Christ. For although we be many, yet are we one in him. For we all take part of one breade.</q> 
                     <hi>Or doeth he thinke, perhaps that the vertue of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal benediction is vnknown to vs? Which when it is done in vs, doth is not make Christ to dwell in vs corporally, by communication of the flesh of Christ.</hi> For why are the members of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the members of Christ? &amp;c. In these wordes Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus reasoneth against an Arrian, which abusing this text, I am a Vine, and my father is the husband man, saide it was spoken of the deitie of Christ, and could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of his manhoode, which Cyrill denyeth, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are not onely spiritually ioyned to Christe, as to God, but also corporally, that is, to his body as to man, yet after a spirituall manner, as the textes by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged doe proue sufficiently, and namely the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken of the vertue of the mysticall blessing, which by communication of his fleshe, maketh vs his members of his body, which all men confesse to bee so after a diuine manner, that euen they which neuer receiued that sacrament, are yet members of Christe, hauing put him on, and beeing ingrafted to him in baptisme.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Heskins will tell vs the difference of the sacrament, and the thing of the sacrament, out of August. in deede out of the sentences of Prosper: <hi>Hoc est quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus &amp;c. This is that we say, that by all meanes we labour to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14727:175"/>
proue, that the sacrifice of the Church is made of two thinges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of two thinges, the visible forme or kinde of the elementes, and the inuisible flesh and bloud of our Lorde Iesus Christe, both of the sacrament and of the thing of the sacrament, that is, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christe. &amp;c.</hi> This visible forme, Maister Heskins will haue to be the accidentes onely, then hee will haue a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, whereof one part by his owne interpretation is bare accidentes without a subiect: and thirdly, that it is the body of Christe corporally receiued. But let vs heare, not Prosper, an vncertaine Authour, but Augustine him selfe, declare these thinges vnto vs <hi>in Ioan. Tr.</hi> 26. <q>
                        <hi>Huius rei sacramentum, id est vnitatis corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi, alicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi quotidie, alicubi certis interuallis dierum in Dominica mensa pręparatur, &amp; de mensa Dominica sumitur, quibusdam ad vitam, quibusdam ad exitium.

But the thing it selfe whereof it is a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is life to euery man, and destruction to no man, who so euer shall bee partaker of it.</q> Nowe iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Augustine esteemeth the sacrament to bee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidentes, and the thing of the sacrament to bee a bodily presence, whiche the wicked can not bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of: or whether the wicked receiue nothing, but the accidents to their destruction, seeing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the sacrament, but not the thing of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Chrysostome the second barron named in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is cited <hi>in dictum Apost. Nolo vos igno. Dixi enim quod. &amp;c.

Euen as he saide, that they all passed thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh the sea, so he prefigured the nobilitie of the Church, when he saide: They did all eate the same spirituall meat. He hath insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same againe: for so in the Church, the rich man receiueth not one body, the poore man an other, nor this man one bloud, and that man an other. Euen so then the rich man receiued not one Manna, and the poore man an other, neither was this man parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of one spring, and that man of a lesse plentifull.</hi> Not content with this, he addeth another sentence out of the same Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely. <hi>Sed cuius gratia &amp;c. But for what cause doth S. Paule make mention of these thinges? For that cause which I tolde you at the first, that thou mayest learne, that neither baptisme, nor remission of sinnes, nor knowledge, nor the communion of the sacraments, nor the holy table, nor the fruition of the body, nor the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the bloud, nor any other such thing can profite vs, except we haue a right life, and a wonderfull, and free from all sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere Maister Heskins gathereth, that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and bloud may bee receiued of wicked men, but eyther hee must vnderstand Sainte Chrysostome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the sacramentes, by the name of the thinges whereof they be sacramentes, or else hee will fall into a great absurditie, for he saith, forgiuenesse of sinnes shall not profite, by which he meaneth, the ceremonie of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and not the forgiuenesse of God in deede. Againe he must note an hyperbole or ouerreaching speach in this
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14727:176"/>
sentence, or else whom shal the body and bloud of Christ profite, when no man is free from sinne? But we yet must heare a sentence or two more out of Chrysostome, <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Hom.</hi> 23. <hi>Quae autem &amp;c. Those thinges that followe, doe signifie the holy table. For as thou eatest the Lordes body, so did they eate Manna. And as thou drinkest his bloud, so did they drinke wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the rocke.</hi> But here Maister Heskins playes his old part, for he leaueth out that which following imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately expoundeth Chrysostome contrarie to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <q>
                        <hi>Quamuis in sensu quae dabantur, perciperentur, spiritualiter tamen dabantur, non secundùm naturae consequentiam, sed secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm muneris gratiam, &amp; cum corpore etiam animam in fidem adducentem nutriuit.</hi> Although those thinges that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, were perceiued by sense, yet were they giuen spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, not according to the consequence of nature, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace of the gift, bringing into faith, he nourished y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule also with the body. By these words it is most euident, that Manna and the water, were not bare figures or corporall foode onely, but also foode of the soule through fayth, howe so euer Chrysostome in other places speaketh of them as figures, and as corporall food, and in those respectes preferreth our sacramentes before them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let vs heare the last sentence: <hi>Qui enim illa illis &amp;c. For he which gaue those things vnto them, euen he hath prepared this table: And euen he him selfe brought them through the sea, and thee through baptisme: And to them gaue Manna and water, and to thee his body and bloud.</hi> Vpon all these places of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Maister Heskins reasoneth, that the Fathers one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued a figure, and we the veritie, or else there were no difference, if we both receiue a veritie spiritually, and a figure outwardly. I haue shewed the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be, not in the substance or vertue, but in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reuelation, which was to them obscure, to vs cleere, to them in expectation of that which was to come, to vs in assuraunce of that which is fulfilled, namely, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Christes death. For Iesus Christe was the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the worlde, and the

Manna was a figure of the bodie of Christe.</hi> It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, we neuer saide the contrarie. But the same Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome in the same place vpon that saying: <q>The rocke was Christe, Saith, that the rocke was a figure of Christe, which Maister Heskins vtterly denyeth. <hi>Quia Christus erat postmodu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sequnturus, cuius figuram tunc Petra gerebat: idco pulchrè dixit consequente eos Petra.</hi> Because Christe was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to followe, of whom the rocke was a figure: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saide very fitly of the rocke, that followed them.</q> By which wordes it is most manifest, that by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they dranke of Christes bloud, who was to come, and consequently did eate his bodie, whereof Manna was a figure. But it followeth after in Hieronyme which Maister Heskins rehearseth at large, and to no purpose <hi>Omnia enim, quae in populo, &amp;c. For all thinges, which at that time were done in the people of Israell in a figure, now among vs are celebrated in truth: for euen as they by Moses were deliuered out of Egypt, so are we by euerie priest or teacher deliuered out of the worlde. And then beeing made Christians, we are ledde through the wildernesse, that by exercise of contempt of the worlde, and abstinence, we may forget the pleasures of Egypt, so that we
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14727:177"/>
knowe not to go backe againe into the worlde. But when we passe the sea of Baptisme, the diuell is drowned for our sake with all his armie, euen as Pharao was. Then wee are fedde with Manna, and receiue drinke out of the side of Christ. Also the clearenesse of knowledge, as a piller of fire, is shewed in the night of the worlde, and in the heate of tribulation, we are couered with the clowde of Diuine consolation.</hi> In these wordes Maister Heskins no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth two thinges, the applications of the truthes to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and the drinke flowing out of the side of Christe. concerning the first, it is cleare, that he maketh their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall benefites, figures of our spirituall benefites, and in that sense he vseth the tearmes of figures and trueth: for otherwise hee confesseth, that those thinges were truely done among them, and in a figure were the same, that ours are, immediately before these wordes before rehearsed by Maister Heskins: <q>

As for the drinke flowing out of his side, we confesse to be the bloud of Christe, as I haue shewed a hundreth times, receiued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a spirituall manner.</q> But Maister Heskins reasoneth wittily (as he thinketh) when he sayeth: as the Iewes did verily eate Manna, so we doe verily eate the bodie of Christ. But he marketh not howe Hieronyme saith: <hi>We are fedde with Manna, and we receiue drinke flowing out of the side of Christ.</hi> Wherevpon I will inferre, as we are fedde with Manna, so we eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of Christe: but are not fedde with Manna cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, but spiritually: so we eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of Christ, not corporally but spiritually. After this, least we should doubt of this authoritie, as falsly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Hierome, he returneth to Hierome <hi>Ad Hedibiam qu.</hi> 2. which we cannot refuse to be S.

So that no man eateth Christe, but he that eateth him spiritually, and hath life by him. Then no wicked man eateth him, which hath not life, &amp; consequently no man eateth him corporally.

but Iesus committeth not him selfe to them, that is he giueth not vnto them his bodie and his bloud. Let them be ashamed therefore because they knowe not: let them goe through the red sea: let them eate Manna, that as they haue beleeued in the name of Iesus so Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus may commit himselfe vnto them.</hi> M. Heskins himselfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place saith: <hi>It is common by the name of the figure, to vnderstand the thing figured.</hi> Therfore as Manna is called the bodie of Christ, so is the sacramentall bread and wine called his bodie and bloud. What is here for a Papist? But Augustine in his Booke <hi>De vtilitate poenitentiae</hi> (as he weeneth) maketh much for him. <hi>I am ergo lumine illato &amp;c. Now therefore the light being brought in, let vs seeke what the rest signifie? What meaned the sea, the clowde, Manna. For those he hath not expounded. But he hath shewed what the rocke is. The passage through the sea is baptisme, but because baptisme that is the water of health, is not of health, but beeing consecrated in the name of Christ, which shed his bloud for vs, the water is signed with his crosse, and that it might signifie this, the redde sea was that baptisme. Manna from heauen is openly expounded by our Lord himselfe. Your fathers (saith he) haue eaten Manna in the wildernesse and are dead. For when should they liue? For the figure might pronounce life, it could not be life. They haue eaten manna (saith he) &amp; are dead. That is, Manna which they haue eaten could not deliuer them from death, not because Manna was death vnto them, but because it deliuered not from death. For he should deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, which was figured by Manna. Surely Manna came from heauen, consider whome is figured: I am, saith he, the bread of life that came downe from heauen.</hi> M. Heskins ioyneth another place of Augustine <hi>Lib. Nou. &amp; vet.

Manna is a figure of that spirituall meate, which by the resurrection of our Lorde is made trueth, in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the Eucharistie.</hi> By this he will proue, that Manna in the former place, was meant to be a figure of the body of Christ in the sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But in spite of his beard he must vnderstande it of the spiritual maner of receiuing therof, by faith, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefites of his death which are made perfect in his resurrection, or else how saith he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the figure was made trueth by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection

They drinke therefore the same drinke that wee doe, but spirituall drinke, that is, which was receiued by faith, nor which was drawen in, with the bodie. And againe: <hi>Eundem ergo cibum, eundem potum, sed intelligentibus &amp; credentib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14727:180"/>
idem Christus.</hi> The same meate therefore, and the same drinke, be to them that vnderstoode and beleeued. But to them which vnderstoode it not, it was onely Manna, that was onely water: that meate to the hungrie: this drinke to the thirstie: neither that, nor this to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: But to the beleeuer, the same which is nowe: for then Christ was to come: nowe Christe is come. To come, and is come, are diuerse wordes, but the same Christe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let M. Heskins nowe go and saye, that Manna was a figure onely of Christe, and not Christ him selfe to the beleeuers: let him saye, that our sacraments in substance are not all one with theirs. Finally, that we eate Christ corporally, which eate him none otherwise then they did before he had a bodie. For in all these Augustine is directly contrarie to him, though he be not ashamed to abuse his name, as though he were of his opinion. Nowe followeth Oecumenius a writer, farre out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the challenge. But what sayeth he <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Comederunt nempe Manna, &amp;c. They haue eaten Manna, as wee the bodie of Christ. They haue dronke the spirituall water flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the rocke or stone, as wee the bloud of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maister Heskins inferreth, that the fathers did eate Manna, and drinke the water corporally, therefore wee eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of Christe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. By the same Logike he may conclude, the fathers did eate manna visibly and sensibly, therefore wee eate the bodie of Christ visibly and sensibly. Or else, as the wordes of Oecumenius sounde, wee eate the bodie of Christe inuisibly, so the fathers did eate Manna inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But euery man that hath but halfe an eye, seeth these grosse inconsequences, and yet they are as good as Maister Heskins argument and illation. Oecumenius therefore meaneth, that as Manna and the water were their sacraments, so we haue ours, whose spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is the bodie and bloude of Christ, the earthly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is bread and wine, and Manna and the water were to them sacramentes of the same Christ, whome wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14727:180"/>
And whereas M. Heskins sayeth, that no catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctour teacheth the sacrament to be only a figure, we agree with him, for we hold him accursed that comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to be onely a figure, or a bare figure, as he doeth often most iniuriously charge vs. The rest of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is spent in vaine repetitions of sentences &amp; collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before set downe and aunswered.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe vppon the other texte, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 104. <hi>Hee satisfied them with the breade of heauen:</hi> Saint Hierome sayeth: <hi>For, as they were refreshed by Manna rayning from heauen, so wee at this day are refreshed, receiuing the bodie of the Lambe. He brake the rocke, and the waters flowed. For that precious corner stone was striken, and brought foorth vnto vs vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fountaines, which washe away our errours, and water our drynesse.</hi> Here is as before, a comparison of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites towarde them, and towarde vs, which he seemeth to make equall, as they were in deede in substance, and all matters perteining to aeternall life: but here is no prophesie spoken of, neither doeth Maister Heskins ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one worde out of it, for that intent.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be sayde of Saint Augustine vppon the 77. <hi>Psalme: Quid enim, &amp;c. For he which commanded the clowdes aboue, and opened the gates of heauen, and rayned to them Manna to eate, and gaue them the bread of heauen, so that man did eate the breade of Angels: Hee which sent vnto them meate in aboundaunce, that he might fill the vnbeleeuers, is not vnable to geeue to the beleeuers, the verie true breade from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which Manna did signifie, which is in deede the meate of Angels, which WORDE of God feedeth them that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible incorruptibly, which that man might eate, was made flesh and dwelled among vs.</hi>

And lest thou shouldest doubt, what rayne that was, it followeth: To eate Manna: Manna is interpreted, what is this? which we verie fuly applye to the holie Communion: for while this meat is sought by wandring, the giftes of the Lordes bodie are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.

What other breade of heauen is there, but Christe our Lorde, of whome the heauenly things receiue spirituall foode, and doe enioy inestimable delight? Finally, thus it followeth: Man hath eaten the breade of Angels. Therefore, Christ is saide to be the breade of Angels, because they are fedde with his eternall praise.

Also, that the

Augustine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so witnesseth for one miracle, that Manna tasted to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man as hee woulde. Hereuppon he concludeth, that Manna farre excelleth the sacramentaries sacramentall bread, which shalbe graunted, and so it doeth the Papists consecrated host, which is subiect to putrifaction, and in none of the twelue miracles comparable to Manna. But Manna for all this doth not excell the bodie and bloud of Christe, which is giuen vs that are faithfull with our sacramentall bread and wine. He sayeth the Iewes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Manna, receiued Christe spiritually. Nowe at the length he sayth trueth. And we also receiuing the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread and wine receiue Christ spiritually. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are our sacraments, as I haue sayde, concerning the spirituall or heauenly substance more excellent then theirs, as our saluation is the same with theirs, but in clearnesse of signification more excellent, as the doctrine of our saluation, is more plainly reuealed vnto vs. But M. Hesk. replyeth, that if our sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts excel not theirs, then their sacraments and figures farre excell ours, and that in three things. The first: In excellencie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing signified. The second: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulnesse &amp; liuelinesse of the signification. The third: in the worke of God about the same figures. But I aunswer, concerning the first, they are aequall: concerning the second, ours are superior &amp; more excellent: and concerning the thirde, I distinguish of outward working of God, &amp; inwarde. Concerning the outward work of God, about their sacraments &amp; figures, it was meete it should be more notable, because the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was more obscure, &amp; that the creatures themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that were the elements of their sacraments &amp; figures should be more excellent &amp; glorious, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inwarde grace, was not so clearely reuealed: and it was meant, the sacraments &amp; figures should be many more in nomber,

because the doctrine was much lesse manifest, then it is to vs. But concerning the inward working of God, there is no doubt, but it is as marueilous, &amp; as wonderfull in our sacraments, as in theirs: and in respect of illumination, according to the doctrine, which is more lightsome, and of full assurance, as of that mysterie, which is alreadie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, it is much more excellent &amp; notable in our sacraments, which are (as Augustin sayth) in number most fewe, in matter most simple, in signification most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. <hi>Ep. ad Ian.</hi> 118. <q>

of any thing, and therefore I count it not worthie of aunswere. Secondly, he will proue, that the sacraments of the olde lawe, are weake and beggerly elements, not onely nowe when they be abrogated, but also when they were in their greatest strength, and therefore in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect equall with ours. <q>For proofe hereof, hee alledgeth the Apostle to the Hebrues, 7. that the lawe brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to perfection, &amp; Chap. 10. The law hauing the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of good things to come, and not the verie facion of the things them selues, can neuer with sacrifices which they offer, make the commers thereunto perfect.</q> But hee is verie ignorant, if he knowe not, as he pretendeth, or else verie obstinate, if he will not acknowledge, that the Apostle, as he writeth to the Hebrues, so he speaketh of the lawe, as the vnbeleeuers esteemed it, that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seperated from Christ, &amp; so of the ceremonies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and not as the lawe and the ceremonies thereof, were considered of the faithfull, with Christ the ende and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of it and them. For otherwise Christ him selfe is called a minister of circumcision, for the trueth of God, to establish the promises of the fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 8 After this he gapeth and cryeth out vppon Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, for saying, that our bread is no better then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lamb of the spirituall fathers. Whereas, if hee speake of the elements in both, there is no question, if of the heauenly parte, that he sayth is true, neuerthelesse, there is a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; an excellencie of our sacrament about these, and that is in clearnes of vnderstanding the mysterie therof, as I haue often shewed. And all the textes and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that Maister Heskins citeth, proue nothing else. As first, Iohn Baptist was greater then all the Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he spake more clearly of Christ being present, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they described to come, when he sayed: beholde the Lambe of God, that taketh away the sinne of the worlde: that confirmeth Chrysostome, <hi>in Math. Hom.</hi> 38. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Iohn to that noble man that commeth next to the King. And Oecumenius preferreth Iohn, because he prophesied of him, whome he sawe and baptized. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14727:184"/>
Maister Heskins gathereth, that if Iohn were the more excellent Prophet, because he sawe Christ present, of whome he prophesied, then the sacrament must bee more excellent, because he was present whome it figured. By like reason, he may gather, that they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were baptized in Christs prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce were better baptized then we are now. But the reason holdeth (as I sayd before) not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence, but of the clearer doctrine, that was by meanes of his presence. So Abraham desired to see the day of Christ, and sawe it, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 8. yet blessed are your eyes (sayeth he) which see that you see, for many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; righteouse men, desired to see, &amp; haue not seene the things that you see, that is, although they haue seene them by faith, yet not so clearely as you haue seen them, and so be the verie wordes of Chrysostome, which M. Hesk. citeth <hi>in</hi> 13. <hi>Math. Hom.</hi> 46. vpon that place: Manye Prophets and righteous men, haue desired, &amp;c. that is saith Christ, <hi>My comming, presence, myracles, voice. For here he doth not onely preferre them before those lost and damned men, but also he affirmeth them to be more excellent and happie, then the Prophets &amp; righteous men. Why so? Because they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see these things which they haue not seene, but also those things which they desired to see, these men sawe with their eyes. For they also by faith, did beholde these things, but these much more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did see all things.</hi> You see therefore, howe vainly he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth against Oecolampadius and the trueth, when the texts and authorities he citeth, be al cleane contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him selfe.</p>

Note by the way, that the Communion vnder both kinds instituted by Christ, and practised in the Church a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares after Christ, is called of Maister Heskins an heresie. The third proofe is, that Iohn spake nothing of the institution of the sacrament, bicause hee spake of it most plentifully in this Chapter by Augustines iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Ioannes &amp;c. Iohn saide nothing in this place of the body and bloud of our Lord, but plainely in an other place he testifieth, that our Lord spake of them most plentifully.</hi> Here he will haue vs note, that Augustine calleth it not a signe or figure, but plainly the body and bloud of Christ, therefore it is not a figure or signe. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same reason he may say, Augustine calleth it not a sacrament, therefore it is no sacrament. But Christ him selfe saith: <hi>Not as your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse and are dead. He that eateth this bread shall liue for euer.</hi> In which wordes M. Heskins noteth two thinges: The first, that Manna is a figure of Christe in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for proofe of which he sendeth vs backe to the 4.5.6.7.8.9. &amp; 10. Chapters of this booke: The second is the excellencie of the body of Christ in the sacrament, aboue Manna, the eaters whereof are dead: but the eaters of the body of Christe in the sacrament shall liue for euer. M. Heskins saith he wot not what, for if you aske him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all they that eat the body of Christ in the sacrament shall liue eternally, he will say no. For wicked men (as he saith) eate it, which shall not liue eternally. Againe, if you aske him, whether al they that did eat Manna are dead, he will say no. For though they be dead in body, yet bicause many did eate Christ spiritually by faith, they shall liue for euer. You see what pith is in his reason, and substance in his doctrine. But in very deede, Christe compareth his flesh with Manna, as it was a corporall foode only, and so all that did eate it are dead: but all they that eat the flesh of Christe, which is eternall life, shall liue eternally; for though they dye corporally, yet will be raise them vp in the last day.</p>

The Lorde Iesus him selfe testifieth vnto vs, that wee receiue his body and bloud, ought we to doubt of his fidelitie and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification? Nowe returne with me to my proposition. It was truely a great and a venerable thing, that he rayned Manna to the Iewes from heauen. But vnderstand which is the greater, Manna from heauen, or the body of Christe? The body of Christe truely, who is the maker of heauen. Further, he that hath eaten Manna hath dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he that shall eate this body, it shall be made to him remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, and he shall not dye for euer.</hi> By the effectes of the sacrament, which are remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes &amp; eternal life, M. Hes. saith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellencie thereof is proued aboue Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. I answere, Ambrose folowing our sauiour Christ, doth not compare Manna the sacrament with our sacrament, but Manna the corporall foode, with the body of Christ the heauenly substance of our sacrament, &amp; so it is more excellent without comparison.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Heskins skippeth ouer with a drye foote, that Ambrose saith, Whosoeuer shall eate of this body, it shall be made to him remission of sinnes, and he shall not not die for euer, by which words it is euident, that no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man eateth this body, but they only which eat it spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually by faith. An other place of Ambrose hee citeth: <hi>De myster initiand. Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Considera nunc &amp;c.

                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:14727:186"/>Maister Heskins asketh wherein bee they greater in power, but in this that the sacramenets of the olde lawe had no power but to signifie onely, oures not onely to signifie, but also to giue that they signifie? And I will aske him, seeing he maketh the sacraments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Gods grace, by what instrument did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the grace of God, if they receiued it not by the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? But Augustine, as I haue often shewed before, is farre from M. Heskins iudgement, wherefore in this place against the Manichees, which denyed the olde testament, he sheweth the abrogation of those rites, not bicause they were euill, but bicause their time was expired, and they fulfilled in Christ: who hath instituted newe sacraments, more effectuall and more profitable, bicause according to the doctrine whereof they be seales, they doe more liuely strengthen the faith of the receiuers, in respect of the mysterie of redemption already accomplished, then those olde sacraments did, which obscurely and darkely preached vnto the receiuers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> redemption, which was not accomplished in acte, yet was as effectuall in power, for their saluation.

But M. Hesk. wil confute vs by the definition of a sacrament, which he saith by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, to be this. <hi>A sacrament is a signe of an holie thing in such manner as it may beare the image, and be the cause.</hi> If we do admit this definition, being rightly vnderstood, what gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he thereby?

Marie <hi>Then it is not a bare signe.</hi> Gods curse light on him, that teacheth Gods sacraments to be bare signes. <hi>And then sacraments giue grace.</hi> Nay M.

He that is innocent of hands, &amp; of a cleane hart. These things we say most deare brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that you may al learn out of the new Testament, not to cleane to earthly things, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine heauenly thinges. The precepts therefore beeing discussed, are found to be all the same, or else scarse any in the Gospel, which haue ben said of the prophets. The precepts are the same, the sacraments are not the same, the premises are not the same. Let vs see wherfore the praecepts are the same: because that according to them we ought to serue God. The sacramentes are not the same, because they be other sacraments giuing saluation, other promising the sauiour. The sacramentes of the new Testament, do giue saluation: the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the old Testament promised the sauiour. Therefore now that thou holdest the thinges promised, what seekest thou things promising the sauiour, now hauing him? I say, holdest the things promised not that we haue already receiued eternall life, but because Christe is already come, which was foreshewed by the prophets. The sacraments are changed, they are made easier fewer, holsomer.</hi> Notwithstanding the vain exclamation of M. Hesk. vpon this place, (except we wil make S. August. contrarie to him selfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places before alledged) we may plainly see, how he expoundeth himself in the latter end of this long passage, whereof the greatest part might altogether haue ben spared. Namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no difference in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance of our sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christ is already come. And our sacraments do not giue saluation, as though we had eternal life deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by them in possession, but because Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authour of eternal life, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the other was promised, is now come. Not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grace in them was only promised, &amp; not giuen for them. M. Hesk. own definition of a sacrament should be false, wherin he wil not allow any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is superfluous, &amp; much lesse vntrue. But M.H. is not content with this interpretation, saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Augustine compareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the olde lawe to childrens trifles in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place: <hi>Numquid quiniam puero, &amp;c. Because there are giuen to a childe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14727:188"/>
certein childish playing trifles, by which the childish minde is called away, are they not therefore plucked out of his hands, when he wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great one? No more therfore God, because he hath plucked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way those things as childrens trifles, out of the handes of his sonnes by the new Testament, that he might giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> something more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable they beeing now waxed greater, is to be thought not to haue giuen those former things.</hi> Gentle Reader, I wish thee to turne ouer to this place in S. Augustine, and except thou be too much blinded in affection toward M. Hesk. thou wilt confesse that he hath aduouched a manifest vntruth, when y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shalt see that Augustine vttereth not these words of the sacraments of the olde Testament, but of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of earthly benefites, made vnto the Fathers of those times.

The bread which we breake, is it not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion or partaking of the bodie of Christ?</hi> This text (he saith) proueth the reall presence and sacrifice. And first he will haue no trope or figure to be vnderstoode in this place, but the very things themselues: with how grosse absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is, I referre it to the iudgment of al reasonable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, that know what a trope meaneth. Secondly he saith, it is an euil manner of disputation, to go about to proue like effectes, of vnlike causes. Wherein I will agree with him. But what vpon this? Forsooth, then it followeth, that as the Iewes, of whom S. Paule taketh example, were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the altar, because they did eate the sacrifices, so we are partakers of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, because we eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of Christ corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and not because we eate a peece of bread and drink a litle wine. Againe, as the Corinthians, by eating meate offred to idols were made partakers of idols: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, because they did eate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ, are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof. But to discusse this vaine cloude of sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, I wil reason vpon his own Maxime: like causes, haue
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:14727:189"/>
not vnlike effectes: S. Paule saith, he would not haue the Corinthians partakers of Diuels by eating meate offered to idols, which in effect was offred to diuels. As they that were made partakers of Diuels, bycause they did eate meat offred to diuels, were not partakers of the substance and nature of diuels, neither did they eate the substance of diuels, no more doth it follow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we eating &amp; drinking the bread of thanksgiuing, &amp; cup of thanksgiuing, which are a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the bodie and bloud of Christ, do corporally eate and drink the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, or be made partakers corporally of the nature &amp; substance of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ. The like I say of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar. Now concerning the sacrifice M. Hesk. saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if S. Paule did not as well take the cup, &amp; table of the Lord to be a sacrifice, as the cup and table of diuels to be a sacrifice, &amp; as the sacrifices of the Israelites, he would not haue vsed like termes, but shewed a difference. I answer, if the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ben a sacrifice, he would haue so called it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this place, or at least in some other place, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no sacrifice: &amp; he shewed a sufficient difference, when he called the one a sacrifice, and not the other. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if I shold grant it to be a sacrifice of thanksgiuing M. Hes. were neuer the neere of his propitiatorie sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But the fathers of Christes Parleament house must be heard to establish this interpretation of M. Hes. and first Chrysost. <hi>In</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Maximè, &amp;c. With these wordes he doeth get greatly to him selfe, both credite and feare. And the meaning of them is this, That which is in the cup, is the same, which flowed one of his side, and thereof we are partakers. And he called it the cup of blessing, because that when we haue it in our handes with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a certeine horror of that vnspeakable gift, we prayse him giuing thankes, because he hath shed his bloud, that we should not remaine in errour. Neither hath he onely shed it, but made vs all partakers of it. Therefore (saith he) if thou desirest bloud do not sprinkle the altar of idols with the slaughter of bruite beasts, but my altar with my bloud. What is more maruelous then this? Tell me I pray thee wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14727:189"/>
louers truely doe shewe this desire in mony, garments, possessions: no man euer in his owne bloud. But Christ in this hath shewed both his care, and his vehement loue toward vs. And in the olde Testament, when they were more vnperfect, that bloud which they offered to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> he himselfe would accept, that he might turne them away from idols, which also was a signe of inspeakable loue. But here he hath prepared a much more wonderfull and magnificall sacrifice, both when he changed the sacrifice it selfe, and for the slaughter of brute beaste: commanded him selfe to be offered.</hi> Although M. Hesk. hath disioyned this place to make shew of varietie, I haue set it down whole and entire. Here M. Hesk. triumpheth not a litle, rayling against blessed Cranmer for abusing S. Paules words, because Chrysostome saith, that which is in the cup is that which flowed out of Christes side, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs be his bloud, &amp; that corporaly receiued, neither can he abide to heare tell of a trope or figure in these wordes. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in spight of his heart, Chrysostom must be vnderstood with a trope or figure, because he saith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ willeth the Corinthians to sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle his altar with his bloud. I am sure M. Hesk. wold not dip his holiwater sprinkle in the challice, and shake it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the altar. Therefore the whole speech of Chrysostom is a continued trope and allegorie. And therfore neither M. Hes, his presence, nor his sacrifice ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be proued out of this place. Concerning the sacrifice, I haue often shewed, how the ancient fathers called the sacrament a sacrifice, namely of thanksgiuing. First, not of propitiation, &amp; so we grant that Christ did institute a sacrifice in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Secondly vnproperly, as a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of Christes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and so doth Chrysostome expound him selfe, vpon the tenth to the Hebrues: <hi>Non aliud, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>We offer not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sacrifice, as the high priest, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same we do always, but rather we worke the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of that sacrifice.

But why
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14727:191"/>
doth he adde: Which we breake? This may we see in the Eucharisty but in the crosse not so, but altogether contrariwise. There shall no bone of his be broken, (saith he) but that he suffred not in the crosse, he suffereth in the oblation and permitteth for thee to be broken.</hi> Here first he misliketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> translation of the English Bible, that calleth it participation. A simple quarrel. I would see the Bible perfectly translated into English by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. And yet the vulgar Popish Latine hath <hi>Participatio,</hi> &amp; M. Heskins himselfe translateth it the partaking. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the communion whiche hee passeth ouer, M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins gathereth his reall presence and sacrifice. I will adde none other place of Chrysostome, to explane his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this is so manifest of it selfe against both. First whereas M. Heskins reasoneth for the reall presence of the communion, which is such with vs &amp; Christ, as is with Christ and his bodie, and that is substantially, and not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually: I answer he vtterly falsifieth Chrysostoms mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for he speaketh of our coniunction one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is spiritually, &amp; not of Christe with vs: we communicate (saith he) in vnitie, that we might be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one with an other in an vnion. Therefore M. Heskins argument holdeth not. Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he speaketh of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Christ in the sacrifice, is so manifest to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood spiritually, that it ouerthroweth, both the presence and the sacrifice: for Christ is not broken but spiritually: therefore he is not present but spiritually. M. Heskins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ombleth out the matter with a foolish caueat, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though Christ suffer &amp; be broken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, yet he suffreth no violence nor paine. But let him speake plainely, if he dare for his eares, that Christe is really and substantially broken, though w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out pain, for that breaking of his body, which Christ speaketh of in the institution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was perfourmed really and substantially vpon the crosse. Wherefore vpon Chrysost. authoritie I will conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistes in the world: Christ is so present in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is broken therin, but he is not broken cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally but spiritually, therefore he is not present cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, but spiritually.

S. Hierom is cited 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Calix. bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis &amp;c. The cup of blessing, &amp;c. Therefore he named the cup first, that he might dispute more at large of the bread. Is it not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the bloud of Christ, as our sauiour himselfe saith? he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud abideth in me &amp; I in him.</hi> Here is nothing but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do all confesse, sauing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> M.

The other place of Hierome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he interlaceth after his maner, <hi>In Psal.</hi> 110. is answered before <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ca.</hi> 30. The third place followeth in Hierome immediatly after the first. <hi>Et panis quem frangimus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatio corporis Domini est? Ita &amp; panis idolatrie, daemonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatio esse monstratur. And is not the bread which we breake a participation of the bodie of our Lord? Euen so also the bread of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie is a participation of diuels.</hi> Here M.H. to mainteine his fond quarrel against the translation of the English Bible hath falsified S. Hier. &amp; in steede of <hi>Participatio,</hi> set downe <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio corporis, &amp;c.</hi> a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, &amp;c. The place it self is directly against M.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>&amp; of the same cupp.</hi> First. M. Hesk. sayeth, that the Apostle speaking of our Communion with Christ, and with our selues, declareth, that bread and the cuppe bee not taken for bare figures of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, in which argument he fighteth with his owne shadowe, for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test bare figures, as much as grosse transubstantiation. Secondly, he sayeth, our communion with Christ, is both spirituall and corporall: spirituall in baptisme, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall in this sacrament, or else this sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in vaine, if we haue none other communion with Christ thereby, then spirituall, which is in baptisme. I answere his argument is nought, for the diuerse dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of the same grace, is testified and confirmed to vs by diuerse sacraments, our regeneration by baptisme, and our preseruation, as by spirituall foode, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes supper. As for the superstitious bread that was giuen in Saint Augustines time to those that were Catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni in steede of the sacrament, hee doeth well to compare to their popish holie bread, sauing that there is greate difference: for that was giuen onely to them that were not baptised, this altogether to them that are baptized, &amp; many that haue receiued the other sacrament at their hands. But where he hath tossed his corporall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to &amp; fro, at last he addeth a condition of receiuing worthily, so that he denyeth in effect, that he saide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that by receipt of Christes bodie, men are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to Christ, &amp; forceth the wordes of the Apostle to be many, and not all, which is false, for he sayeth all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eate of this bread, though we be many yet are made one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Finally, in that the Apostle sayeth, we all eate of one bread &amp; drink of one cupp, M. Hesk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith, that he tooke it not for bare material bread, for then it were not true: as for his bare bread, let him keepe to crome his pottage. But howe prooueth he, that Saint Paule spake not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14727:195"/>
bread, as the earthly parte of the sacrament? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth all do not eat one bread: for the Greekes eat leue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, &amp; the Latines fine &amp; vnleuened bread. In the Popish church is giuen to euery communicant a sundrie bread, in the scismaticall church, euery conuenticle hath a sundrie bread, and sometimes diuerse breades, therfore it is no materiall bread, that S. Paule speaketh of, but the heauenly bodie of Christ. If I were as froward a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, as M. Hesk. I would aske him whether the body of Christ be not a materiall body, because he maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall &amp; heauenly, diuerse differences, as though he were an Eutychian. But admitt that by materiall bread hee meaneth bread properly so called, and the heauenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die figuratiuely called bread, which he is loth to come to: what mad man woulde vnderstand that one breade which S. Paul sayeth, to be distributed in euery commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to all that are present, and whereof euery one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth parte in token of the communion or fellowship of many in one bodie, for all the kindes &amp; fashions of bread that are vsed in all communions in the worlde? For the Apostles argument is grounded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> similitude of bread, which of many graines is made one bread, so wee being many are made one bodie. And therefore in vaine doeth he racke these wordes of S. Paul, to the meaning of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde, whose authoritie we receiue not, or to the words of Chrysostome, which he falsly alledgeth to be <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Hom.</hi> 17. whereas they be <hi>in ad Hebraeos.</hi> 10. <hi>Hom.</hi> 7. which is nothing, but an obiection of his: the place is wholy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the first booke &amp; 37.

                     </note>Chrysostome vpon this place is cited thus: <hi>Quoniam v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus panis &amp; vnum corpus, &amp;c. For there is one bread &amp; wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are one bodie. For what do I call (saith he) a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration? wee are the selfe same bodie. What is the breade? the bodie of CHRIST, and what are they made
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14727:195"/>
which receiue it? the body of Christ, not many bodies but one body. For as the breade is made one of many cornes, so that the cornes do not appeare, and yet there are cornes, but ioyned together, so that they can not be discerned: so are we ioyned one with an other, and with Christ. For thou art not nourished of one body, and he of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all of the same, therefore he added all we, which doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the same bread.</hi> Of these wordes Maister Heskins wil haue vs to learne three things. First, that communication is to be all of one body, which is true, so wee vnderstand a spirituall kinde of coniunction, by which wee are not only ioyned to Christ, as Chrysostome saith, but also one to an other in one body. Secondly, that it is the body of Christ, by the eating whereof we are made one body, and this also is true, for we contend not for the eating of Christes body, but for the manner of eating.</p>
                  <p>The third note I thinke hee maketh, that by Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes iudgement Saint Paule meant not materiall breade, but the body of Christe, which is proued to bee false and absurde by these two reasons. First, if Saint Chrysostome by breade meant not the sacramentall breade, but the body of Christe, then his question is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in effect, but what is the body of Christe? And then he answereth, the body of Christe, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry absurde and ridiculous. Secondly, that he meaneth materiall breade vsed in the sacrament, it is manifest in that hee saith, it is made of many graines, but the body of Christe it not made of graines, therefore hee can not meane the body of Christe, but the sacramentall breade, which signifieth the body of Christe. But here Maister Heskins, as though hee were the first that espied the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter insulteth vpon him that translateth this part of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, which was Franciscus Aretinus, whom either of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or of malice, he chargeth to haue falsified Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, and in steede of his wordes which according to the Greeke are, What is the bread? to haue turned it, What doth the bread signifie? For my part, although the Greeke copies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly extant in print, are not as he hath transla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted it, yet I suppose, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he followed either some other copy
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14727:196"/>
that I haue not seene, peraduenture printed, peraduentur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> written. For vndoutedly, although he were ignorantly or willfully deceiued, yet the sense of Chrysostomes words must needes be: what doth the bread signifie? which M. Heskins can not altogether dissemble, but then he will haue it not materiall bread, but the word, bread. But how friuolous that is, I haue shewed before, for this worde, Breade, is not made of cornes, but the materiall bread gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the sacrament. Neither doth the other worde hee citeth, any thing helpe him. <hi>Non enim simpliciter &amp;c. For hee hath not simplie giuen his body, but when the former nature of the flesh formed out of the earth, by sinne being made mortall, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of life, he brought in an other (as I might so say) lumpe or leauen, that is, his flesh, in nature truely the same, but free from sinne and ful of life, which he giueth to all, that they might be made partakers of it, that being nourished with it, and the first that was dead being cast away, we might be ioyned together by this liuing &amp; immortall table.</hi> Loe (saith M. Heskins) this is not a peece of dead breade, but a liuing and immortall meate, hee dare not say, table, as Chrysostome doth, for feare of a figure. But is he so blinde, that he seeth not the partaking and nourishing of the newe flesh to be such, as the casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the olde is? which no man doubteth to be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. <q>But seeing he braggeth so much of Chrysostome, and is such an enimie to signes and figures, let him heare what he writeth <hi>in Math. Hom.</hi> 83. <hi>Sed ficut in veteri, eodem h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when they say, howe is it knowne that Christ was sacrificed, and many other mysteries? For when we bring foorth those things, we soe vp their mouthes. For
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:14727:196"/>
if Iesus be not dead, of whom is this sacrifice a token and signe? Thou seest howe great care he had, that we might alwayes keepe in remembrance, that he dyed for vs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can nothing be spoken more plainly, to declare either what the sacrament is, or for what end it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, or finally, what manner of sacrifice it is accounted of Chrysostome, and the auncient Fathers. But nowe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth S. Augustine <hi>Ser.</hi> 2. <hi>Pasc. Quia Christus passus est &amp;c. Bicause Christ hath suffered for vs, he hath commended vnto vs his body and his bloud in this sacrament: which also he hath made our owne selues. For we also are made his body, and by his mercy we are that which we receiue.</hi> I like this saying very well, it maketh altogether for the truth on our side. Yet M. Heskins no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that he saith not, he hath commended a figure or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall, but his body and his bloud. I agree well, but hee saith, that hee hath commended his body and bloud in a sacrament, hee doth not say, the sacrament is his naturall body present vnder the formes of bread and wine corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that I may followe M. Heskins negatiue argument. But especially let vs note what he saith, and not what hee saith not. He saith, we are the same that we receiue, but we are not his naturall body after a corporall manner, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee receiue not his naturall body after a corporall manner. The rest that followeth to moue vs to abide in this body of Christ, confirmeth the same. <hi>Dic mihi quid est &amp;c. Tell me what is it whereof thou liuest? Doth thy spirite liue by thy body, or thy body by thy spirite? Euery one that liueth aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: I liue by my spirite. And he that can not answere this, I knowe not whether he liueth. What answereth euery one that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? My body truely liueth by my spirite. Wilt thou therefore liue by the spirite of Christ? Be thou in the body of Christ. For whether doth my body liue of thy spirite? Mine liueth of my spirit, and thine liueth of thy spirit. The bodie of Christ can not liue but by the spirit of Christ.

For then infants which eate not the sacrament, should want a necessarie manner of the coniunction of their bodies with the body of Christe, and so be out of hope of resurrection.

is cited <hi>in</hi> 17. <hi>Ioan. Cum trinitas vnum natura sit &amp;c. For as much as the Trinitie in nature is one, let vs consider how we our selues also among our selues corporally and with God spiritually are one. The only begotten sonne comming out of the substance of God his father, and possessing in his nature the whole father, was made flesh according to the scriptures, and hath vnspeakably ioyned and vnited himselfe to our nature. For he that is God by nature, is made man in deede, not Theophorus, that is, hauing God in him by grace, as they that are ignorant of the mysterie do contend, but he is both very God and very man. So he hath ioyned together in him selfe that is one, those things which according to nature differ very much among them selues, and hath made vs partakers of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the communication of the spirite, and as I may say, the dwelling, was first in Christ, and from him hath perced into vs, when being made man, he him selfe annoynted and sanctified his temple with his owne spirite. The beginning therefore, and the way by which we are made partakers of the holy spirite, and are vnited to God, is the mysterie of Christ. For we are all sanctified in him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might vnite euery one beetwene our selues &amp; God, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we be asunder both in body and soul) yet he hath found out ae meane agreeable to the counsel of his father &amp; his own wisdom. For blessing the beleuers by the mystical communion, by his body he hath made vs one body both with himself and also among our selues. For who shall thinke them straunge from this naturall vnion, which by the vnion of one holy body are vnited in one Christe? For if we all eate one bread, we are all made one body. For Christe suffereth vs not to be diuided and disioyned. Therefore all the Church is made the body of Christ, and euery one of vs the members of Christe after S. Paule, for being conioyned to one Christ by his body, bicause wee haue receiued him in vs which is indiuisible, our members be rather appropriated to him, then to vs.</hi> Concerning the vnitie of God the father with the sonne, of the two natures of God and man in Christ, and of the vnitie of the members of Christ with their head, which M. Hesk. noteth out of this place of Cyril, it shall be no neede to speake, seeing there is no controuersie betweene vs, but that these three vnities be there. Only of the maner how we be vnited, is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. We are vnited to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, but whether by
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14727:198"/>
eating the same with our mouthes, or by faith, through the vnspeakable working of Gods spirite, is all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. All the holde, he catcheth of this place, is, that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill calleth it a naturall vnion, as he doth also in the same place a corporall vnion, by which he meaneth, not that we are vnited after a naturall manner, or after a bodily manner, but that we are vnited vnto the very humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and body of Christ, but after an heauenly and diuine manner. For thus it followeth in the same place, I meane in <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. of Cyrill vpon the 17. of Iohn, which M. Hesk. note booke belike, did not serue him to set downe: <q>

If then we be all one body among our selues in Christe, and not among our selues only, but also with him which by his flesh is come vnto vs, howe shall we not be all one, both among our selues and in Christe?</q> This place of Paule by which the faithfull of the Gentiles are saide to be made one body with the faithfull of the Iewes, speaketh nothing of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the body of Christe in the sacrament, but of the spirituall incorporation by faith in the promises of the Gospell, nowe made common vnto the Gentiles with the Iewes, whereof the sacrament is not a bare signe, but a liuely and effectuall seale and confirmation.</p>

And as wine doth make glad, so the bloud of Christe doth the same, and moreouer is made a defence. And if all we that are faithfull doe partake of one body and bloud, we are all one by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these mysteries, both all in Christe, and Christe in us all. He that eateth (saith he) my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, abideth in me, and I in him. For the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> truely by assumption is vnited to the flesh: and this flesh again is vnited to vs by participation.</hi> This place seemeth to M. Heskins to be very plaine, and so thinke I: for there is nothing in it but I graunt to bee true, being rightly vnderstoode. M. Heskins saith, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the breade and the cuppe, to be the body and bloud of Christ, or else the text were cleerer then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, in which fantasie he pleaseth him selfe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. We graunt, that the breade and cup in S. Paule, signifie the body and bloud of Christe, which we receiue in the sacrament, after a spirituall and diuine manner. Thirdly he noteth, that we are vnited by participation into the flesh of Christe, which he saith we deny, but hee lieth impudently, for we constantly affirme, that except we be partakers of the flesh and bloud of Christe, we can not be partakers of eternall life. But that this partaking is after a corporall manner, or only in the sacrament, that we deny. And that also doth Euthymius deny in effect, where he teacheth, that whereas we are vnited to Christe, &amp; Christe to vs, so are we vnited together. but this is after a spiritual &amp; ineffable manner: so is the other. We graunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cyril saith, we could not be partakers of eternal life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we were ioyned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of natural or true life, that is, to the body of Christ, <hi>in Ioan.</hi> 6. <hi>li.</hi> 15. but we are ioyned otherwise then by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords supper, or els no infants shuld be partakers of eternall life. Finally where M. Hes. affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the words of Euthymius by no engin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:14727:199"/>
from his carnal maner of prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, bicause he speaketh before of the transmutation of the bread &amp; wine into the body &amp; bloud of Christ, I answere, he speaketh of no such transmutation, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do graunt the same, namely a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental change, such as is of the water in baptisme, of which also he taketh a similitude. <q>

For bicause our soule is inclosed in our body, God hath deliuered vnto vs intelligible things in sensible things.</q> The water in baptisme is not chaunged into regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor regeneration included in the water: and speaking of the same transmutation, hee saith, the breade and wine are transmuted into the body and bloud of Christe, and into the grace of them. But the substance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wine is not turned into the grace of the body and bloud, therfore neither into the body and bloud.

Although Theophylact being reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expounded, according to his owne sayings in other places, saith nothing directly against vs. But in default of these, here is a third man taken, belike <hi>de circunstantibus,</hi> &amp; that is Remigius, whome M. Heskins to make him a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iewrie man, affirmeth to haue liued <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 511. and so within the compasse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> challenge. But if he deale so, wee must haue a writ against him <hi>de identitate nominis.</hi> For as we finde that there was in deede one Remigius bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Remes about that time, so likewise we finde that the authour of this commentarie in 1. Cor. 10. was bishop Antisiodocensis almost 400. yeres after, namely about the yere of Christ. 894. Notwithstanding, bicause his words are almost the same which are before ascribed to Hierom Cap. 17.

of the bloud of Christe? Therefore he named the cup first, because he would afterward treate more at large of the bread. It is called the cup of blessing which is blessed of the priestes in the altar, &amp; the cuppe it selfe is called a communication as it were a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, because all do communicate of it, and receiue parte of the Lordes bloud which it conteineth in it. And the bread whiche we breake in the altar, is it not the participation of the Lordes body? Surely it is first consecrated and blessed of the priests, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, and afterward is broken, when as now although bread be seene, in trueth it is the bodie of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of which bread whosoeuer do communicate they doe eate the bodie of Christ. Because we being many, which eate that bread, are one bread, (vnderstand of Christ,) and one bodie of Christ.</hi> Maister Heskins noteth that the cup conteyneth the bloud of Christ, which speech may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, because the cup conteineth the wine, which is the bloud of Christ after a certeine manner, as S. Augustine saith. Secondly that though it seem bread, yet indeed is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, he saith <hi>Lices panis videatur,</hi> Though bread be seene, yet Christ his bodie is present, after a spirituall and incomprehensible manner. But M. Heskins wil note, that all men did drinke the bloud of Christe out of the cup. And that he saith, the bread is broken, when it is the bodie of Christe, by which wordes he denyeth transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, as in the former, the communion vnder one kinde. Finally in affirming vs that eate that bread, to be the same bodie of Christ which we do eate: he doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowe the carnall manner of eating Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the sacrament, as he doeth establish the spirituall manner of coniunction, that we haue with the bodie and bloud of Christ.</p>

Against the force of the Gospel, against the law of our Lord and of God, by the rashnesse of some, communication is set as libertie to them that are vnprouided. Which is a vaine and a false peace, perillous to the giuers, and nothing profitable to the receiuers. They seeke not the patience of health, nor the true medicine by satisfaction. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is shut vp from sinners. The remembrance of a moste greeuous and extreeme offence is taken away. The woundes of them that are in dying are couered, and the deadly strype in the deepe and inward bowels is hidde with dissembled sorrowe.</hi>

                     <hi>Retourning from the altar of the diuell with handes filthye and defiled with the greasie sauour, they come to the holie of the LORDE. Almoste yet belching out the deadly meates of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, with their lawes yet breathing out their wickednesse, and sauouring of their deadly infections, they set vpon the Lords body: whereas the Scripture commeth againste them and cryeth, and sayeth: Euerie cleane person shall eate the fleshe: But if any eate of the fleshe of the wholesome sacrifice whiche is the Lordes, hauing his vncleanenesse vpon him, the same soule shall perishe from among his people. The Apostle also witnesseth and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: ye can not drinke the cuppe of the Lorde, and the cuppe of Diuels: Ye can not communicate of the table of the Lorde, and the table of diuels.</hi> In this sermon Cyprian reproued those men whiche had admitted to the communion, such persons as had sacrificed to idols, before they were throughly penitent, and had made satisfaction to the Church which was offended by them, contrarie to the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:14727:202"/>
order of good discipline. Now saith Maister Heskins he would not so sharply haue reproued them, if the thing they receiued, had beene but a peece of bread. A wise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. What if a man at that time had come vnreuerently to baptisme, had it not ben an horrible offence, although the outward element of baptisme be nothing but a litle water? Although when we say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that bread is a parte of the sacrament, we neuer teache, that it is but a peece of bread, neither doe we say that baptisme is nothing but water. They that vnreuerently rush vnto the Lords sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are punished for their presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, not in respect of that they receiue, whether it be bread, wine, or water, but for that they receiue it vnworthily. Another thing he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of Cyprian, is, that Christes bodie is a sacrifice, because he alledgeth the scripture of Leuiticus, which is spoken of a sacrifice, as though the scripture could not be rightly applyed, that spake of holie meate vnreuerenely receiued, vnto the vnreuerent receiuing of the sacrament, except the sacrament were a sacrifice: this is out of all compasse of reason. He might as well say, the sacrament is a burnt offring, because it is compared to a sacrifice which is a burnt offring, and an hundreth other absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may likewise be inferred, which for reuerence of the blessed mysteries, I spare to name.

For swearing is of the wicked, sacrifice is of the Lord. Therefore what communication is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene light and darknesse, what agreement between Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall?</hi> Here saith M. Hesk. by the excellent titles he giueth the sacrament, is proued the reall presence. The holie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, wonderful mysteries, the bodie of our Lord, light, &amp; Christ himself. But one of these titles is manifestly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and figuratiue, namely that of light, and why may not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest be so likewise?

The second note, to proue the reall presence is, that saying: how shall we w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> defiled tong receiue the Lordes body? Here the body is receiued with the mouth and tong, therefore corporally. <q>But if I should say, that Chrysostome by this interoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denyeth, that it can be receiued with a defiled tong, where were the strength of this place: but I will graunt, that he vseth so to speake, but vnproperly, that the hand &amp; the tong receiue the bodie and bloud of Christ, and yet meaneth no carnall maner of presence, as <hi>Ho.</hi> 21. <hi>ad Pop.

And here he taketh vpon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the rule of Cranmer, or of him that set forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> book in his name, as though that learned father, was not able to set forth his booke himselfe as wel, as this blind buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard Heskins, who hath nothing in effect, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath stolne out of Gardiners M.

in respect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath bene offered. So was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament of the old writers called a sacrifice vnproperly, because it was a memorial of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only sacrifice of Christ once offered by him self, &amp; in respect of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> action of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> administration, which is a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, &amp; therefore of them was called Eucharistia, a thanksgiuing. Another reason to proue it no gratulatorie sacrifice, is, because he calleth it a wonderful sacrifice, but thanksgiuing is but an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie duetie. Shore vp your drousie eyes M. Hesk. &amp; you shal see, he calleth it a holie sacrifice, &amp; so the sacrifice of thanksgiuing. He calleth it not a wonderfull sacrifice, but a wonderful mysterie, except mysterie &amp; sacrifice be al one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, but if he had called it a wonderful sacrifice, as else where he calleth it a fearfull or terrible sacrifice, doth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> proue it to be no sacrifice of thankesgiuing? Hee calleth it fearful, terrible, reuerende, wonderful, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine working of our sauiour Christ, to make vs partakers of his bodi &amp; bloud, by receiuing these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward creatures worthily, according to his appointment, as for the names I haue answered before, they proue no sacrifice propitiatorie. But now at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth M. Hes. (hauing builded on this place of Paule &amp; Chrysost. which deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partaking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie &amp; bloud of Christ to them that are made partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table of diuels, or otherwise be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men) giueth S. Paul &amp; Chryso. a new interpretation. S. Paul (saith he) doth not absolutely deny, but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, saying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men cannot be partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table of diuels: that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ought not, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye cannot, &amp; ye ought not, is al one with M.

After this, Theophylact was there bishop, and although the histories bee not certeine what time he liued: yet it must needs be gathered, to be when the contention was hote betweene the Greekes &amp; Romanes, about the proceeding of the holie Ghost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in his exposition vpon the thirde of Iohn, hee inueygheth against the church of Rome, defending the Greekes about the proceeding of the holie Ghoste, and this was about the yeare of Christ 1049 when Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius liued and reproued the church of Rome for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall presence that then or not long before was begon to be grossely defended. But the chiefe matter he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of Anselme is, that he expoundeth the table in Saint Paule, for an altare, whereupon Maister Heskins will make a discourse of Altares, and proue the vse of them, euen from the Apostles times: And firste he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with Dionyse the disciple of S.

I haue shewed before, that neither Eusebius, nor Hierome, nor Gennadius knewe any such Dionyse, by the space of fiue or sixe hundreth yeares after Christ; therefore his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie must be so many hundred yeares short of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times. But M. Hesk. wil not see that his Dionyse

But before I proceede to the next author, that he citeth for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which is Augustine, I will set downe a manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of M. Hesk. proofe, that altars haue ben vsed since the Apostles times. Firste, it is certeine, that our sauiour Christ did institute this sacrament at a table, &amp; at no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, whereas if it had bene a sacrifice, he would haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an altar to be made, which had bene soone done. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Apostle Paul calleth it the Lords table, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer calleth it an altar. M. Hesk. alledgeth for the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the actes of the Apostles, that the disciples continued in breaking of bread in euery house, but I suppose he wil not dreame, that there was an altar in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie house. In the primitiue church, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people mett in corners &amp; secrete places, no man of reason wil imagin they had altars set vp in those places.

                  <p>But lest hee might replye, that the table was an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, I must further alledge Saint Augustines authoritie, that it was a table, for it was made of boordes and was remouable.

The like complaint maketh Optatus in his booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Donatistes, sauing that he nameth not wood or bordes, yet it is plaine by the circumstance that hee spake of none other.</q> The place, as Maister Heskins ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, is this: <hi>Quid est tam sacrilegum, &amp;c. What is so great sacriledge, as to breake, scrape, or shaue, and remoue the altares of God? in which you also sometimes haue offered, on which the prayers of the people, and the members of Christ haue been borne, at which God almightie hath beene called vppon, where the holie Ghost being desired hath come downe, from which the pledge of aeternall life, and the sauegarde of faith, and the hope of resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath beene receiued of many: the altares I say vpon which our Sauiour hath commaunded the giftes of the fraternitie, not to be layde, but such as are made of peace. Lay downe (saith hee) thy gifte before the altare, and returne and firste agree with thy brother, that the Priest may offer for thee. For what is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar but the seat of the bodie and bloud of Christe? All these your furie hath either scraped, or broken, or remoued. What hath God done to you, which was wont to be called vpon there? What had Christe offended you, whose bodie and bloud dwelleth there at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine momentes? And what doe you offende your selues to breake the altars, on which long time before vs (as you thinke) you haue offered holily? Thus haue you followed the Iewes. They layde handes vppon Christe on the crosse: of you he was striken in the altar: of whome the Prophet Helias complaineth to the Lorde, speaking in the same wordes, with which you among other haue deserued to bee accused. Lorde (sayeth he) they haue broken downe thine altares. While hee sayth thine, he sheweth that the thing is Gods, where any thing is offered of any man to God.</hi> Vppon pretence of this place, Maister Hesk. char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs with great sacriledge, for pulling downe their popish altares, on which they committed idolatrie and moste horrible sacriledge. And therefore wee are commaunded to ouerthrowe such altares, to breake downe their pillers, &amp; burne their images with fire,

And whereas he compareth vs to one Iulianus an heathen man, that pissed against the altare, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was horribly punished, hee sheweth his wisedome. For there an idolater did vilanously contemne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians religion, &amp; therfore was iustly plaged of God, but we as Christians haue obeyed the lawe of God, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing their antichristian &amp; idolatrous altars. And yet I thinke the fact of Iulianus was not worse then the filthinesse of Pope Iohn, that lay with his whores vppon your altares. In the conclusion of this chapter he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the altar, &amp; sacrifice are correlatiues, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there coulde be none altars, but there was also sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. I haue shewed sufficiently howe the old writers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the communion table an altare, and the sacrament a sacrifice, namely a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, and not of propitiation, and yet more must I saye vpon M.

Thirdly, that there is no such Hebrue worde, as Maister Heskins affirmeth to bee, <hi>Mas,</hi> signifying a seruice, as I report mee to all that haue but meane knowledge in the tongue. Fourthly, that although the name of <hi>Missa</hi> bee of some antiquitie in the Romane church, yet is it neither so auncient as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, and that which is chiefely to be regarded, it is neuer founde in the holie scripture.</p>
                  <p>But nowe let vs consider his authoritie. First, Leo bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome Epist. 79. sayeth thus: <hi>Necesse est vt quaedam pars populi sua deuotione priuetur, si vniut tantùm Missae more seruato sacrificium offerre non possunt, nisi qui prima diei parte conuenerint. It must needes be that some parte of the people bee depriued of their deuotion, if the manner or custome of our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly masse being obserued, they cannot offer sacrifice, except such as came together the first part of the day.</hi> Vppon coulour of this place Maister Heskins will not onely prooue, that the name of <hi>Missa</hi> is auncient, but also that it is lawfull to saye more then one Masse in one church in one day, if two then three, if three then tenne, if tenne then fifteene, and so twentie, which the proclaimer sayed could not be proued. But you shall see howe lewdly hee abuseth his reader. The proclaimers challenge was of tenne or twentie priuate Masses sayed in one church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at one time. Maister Heskins bringeth in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Leo, which proueth, that when one commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion coulde no serue any more, then so manie as the church woulde holde at one time, it was meete it should be celebrated twise, or as often as the same was filled with people, vntill all had receiued, which as wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be true, so maketh it nothing in the worlde for the priuate Masse, but altogether against it, as is plaine by the whole treatie going before, which Maister He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins according to his accustomed synceritie hath cleane left out.</p>

Heskins vrgeth in the place by him cited, that the word <hi>missa</hi> is vsed, which is not denyed, but this was almost 500. yeres after Christ, about the yere 480. Secondly, that the Masse is a sacrifice. But he will not see that it is such a sacrifice, as all the people offer, which can not be a sacrifice propitiatorie, but of thankesgiuing. Howbeit, he saith, <hi>The Masse is a sacrifice, that is or ought by ioyne affection and deuotion of the people to the Priest, to be offered of them all.</hi> What affection or deuotion he would haue to the Priest, I do not well vnderstand, but let him shadowe him selfe, in what fond phrase of word he will, yet can he not auoyde, but that the people by the wordes of Leo, did offer sacrifice in as ample manner as the Priestes, and then they were all Priestes. Besides this, in the words of Leo he obserueth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a custome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church before his time to haue but one Masse or Communion in a day, so straightly kept, that vpon necessitie they would not relent therein, vntill he tooke this order with them. But Maister Heskins asketh what scripture the proclamer hath to the contrarie for twentie Masses in one Church in one day? I aunswere: Saint Paule willeth the Corinthians to tarie
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14727:209"/>
one for an other 1. Cor. 11. for the Communion. By which it is euident, that it is not lawfull for euery man to haue his priuate Masse, as M. Heskins would most absurdly proue. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice propitiatorie of their Masse, hath all those scriptures against it, that set foorth the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie sacrifice of Christ, and namely Heb. 9. &amp; 10.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, M. Heskins findeth the name of Masse vsed of Saint Ambrose, <hi>Ep.</hi> 33. <hi>Ego mansi in munere, missam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere coepi, orare in oblatione Deum vt subueniret. I did abide in mine office, I beganne to say masse, to pray to God in the sacrifice, that he would helpe.</hi> Howe faithfull a reporter of antiquitie Maister Heskins is to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, this place among a great number doth sufficiently declare, and that he receiued not this text out of Ambrose him selfe, but out of some other mans collection or relation. <q>Ambrose in that Epistle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his sister Marcellina about deliuering of a church to the heretiques, which he refused to do at the Emperour Valentinianes request, writeth thus: <hi>Sequenti die (erat autem Dominica) post lectiones atque tractatum dimissis Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menis, Symbolum aliquibus competentibus in baptisterijs trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam Basilicae.

                     <q>The day following, which was Sunday, when the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Catechisme were dismissed after the Lessons that were read, and the treatise made vpon them, I was instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Creede certaine that desired Baptisme, in the baptizing place of the Church. There it was tolde me, after it was knowne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had sent officers from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace vnto the church called Portiana &amp; hanged vp clothes (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> part of the people were going thither.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14727:210"/>
I for all that abid in mine office, I beganne to let it goe. While I offered, I vnderstoode by the people, that one Castulus was taken by force, whome the Arrians saide to be a Priest. Him had they found as they passed by in the streate. I beganne to weepe most bitterly, and to pray to God in the very oblation, that hee would helpe that no mans bloud might bee shed in the cause of the Church, and truely that my bloud might be shed, not onely for the sauegard of the people, but also for the vngodly them selues. What neede many wordes, I sent Priestes and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and deliuered the man from iniurie.</q> I knowe M. Heskins will not allowe me to translate, <hi>missam facere,</hi> to let goe the Church, seeing they had entered vpon it, the rather bicause <hi>offero</hi> and <hi>oblatione</hi> doth followe. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, seing Masse is neuer named in S. Augustin, Hierome, nor any other place of Ambrose in his or their authenticall writings, I can not of the onely colour and coniecture of oblation folowing be resolued, that S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose vseth <hi>missam facere,</hi> to say Masse. For although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the name of <hi>Missa</hi> for the Communion, began neare about that time to be in vse, yet did they neuer vse that phrase <hi>missam facere,</hi> but <hi>missum</hi> or <hi>missarum solennia ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librare,</hi> to celebrate the Masse or the solemnities of Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for so they called the administration of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Whereas <hi>missam facere</hi> can not be translated to say Masse, but rather to make Masse. Againe, if the only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of <hi>offero</hi> and <hi>oblatione</hi> following, were sufficient to proue <hi>missa</hi> to signifie Masse, M. Heskins might by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like colour of Priestes and Deacons following, translate <hi>Missis, Presbyterie, &amp; Diaconibus &amp;c.</hi> with Masses, Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, I deliuered the man from iniurie. But to take it at the worst that the name of <hi>missa</hi> is here vsed for Masse, yet was this within the time of the Bishops limitation, &amp; no Popish Masse, but a Christian communion, although some abuses perhaps were in it.</p>
                  <p>And for the decrees of Thelesphorus, Sixtus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, and such like Bishoppes of Rome, bycause they bee meere mockeries, and counterfeted long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:14727:210"/>
their times, to get credite by the antiquitie of their names, I will loose no time in confuting them. And whereas M. Heskins saith, the proclamer reiecteth them without proofe, although it be not to be required, that in a sermon such matters should be debated at large, as in publique writings are throughly knowne to be debated and determined among the best learned: yet will I adde this one disproofe or two, of those Epistles to be forged. First Eusebius which was a most dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gatherer of such writings found none such in his time. Secondly, if there were nothing else, the very barbarous phrase of them all, and the false Latine that is in many, is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them for counterfets: seing there was no vnlearned woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Rome in those times, but spake better Latin the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these men feigne those learned Bishops to haue writen in those decretall Epistles. But M. Hesk. will proue Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander to be the Authour of that Epistle which is ascribed to him, and therein will vse neither bare wordes, nor faint likelyhoods. In deed, for likelihoods he vseth none, either faint or strong, but in steede of authoritie whereof he bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, he vseth none at all but very bare wordes. He onely quoteth in the margent, The 6. Counsel of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not naming so much as in what part or action thereof this matter is intreated of, the actes of that counsel, being contained in a great booke as large as M. Hesk. third book at the least. And surely, although I haue vsed some dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in search, yet I can finde no such matter, nor this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander once named in that Counsell. In deede I found long since, Dionysius authoritie cited by the name of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyscus Areopagisa</hi> Bishop of Athens, which is the matter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perhaps deceiued M. Hes. or him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ministred notes of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities vnto him. But to be short, the assurance remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still vnshaken, which the proclamer made in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the name of Masse is not found in ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, vntil 400. yeres after Christ. As for the Masse it selfe, if hee meane that forme of seruice vsed in the Church of Rome, and of them commonly called Masse, he knoweth it was not throughly peeced together, 600. yeares after
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:14727:211"/>
Christ. For Gregorie had no small share in it, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth in this Chapter, that Telesphorus, Sixtus, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Felix, added somewhat vnto it. As for the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie prayers of Ambrose, hee doth well not to auouch them to be his, bicause no man of learning will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be his. And seeing the Greeke Liturgies are very vnlike the Latine Masse, hee doth but mocke the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant readers, to say they be all one. Finally, hee doth most absurdly conclude, that his Masse should be within the compasse of Saint Augustines rule. <hi>ad Ian. Ep.</hi> 118. <hi>That those thinges, which the vniuersall Church obserueth throughout the worlde, we may vnderstand that they are retayned, as ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either of the Apostles them selues, or of the generall Counsels, whose authoritie in the Church is most profitable.

Moreouer he saith, this is but a description of Masse in the large signification. <hi>But the Masse it selfe properly is the holie consecration of the bodie and bloud of Christ, the holy oblation and offring of the same, in the memoriall and remembrance of his passion and death, with humble and lowly thankes, lawdes and prayses for the same, and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of that body and bloud so consecrated.</hi> Here is the Lions skinne couering the asse, but yet not so closely but the long eares may be seene hanging out. For as the forme of these wordes for the most parte may be applyed to the holy communion, so almost by euerie word, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth another thing then either the scriptures or the auncient fathers do teache, as we shall best see in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the partes which followe. First where he sayeth, the proclaymer cannot abide consecration, he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth falsely, for both he graunteth consecration and the presence of Christes bodie and bloud, but not the Popish charming, nor their carnall manner of presence, whiche how they be proued by M. Heskins let the readers iudge. Oblation the second part, he sayeth is proued in the first book, and declaration of the prophesies of Melchisedech, Damascen, Malachie, and in the 37. Chapter. In the same places let the reader consider the answere.</p>
                  <p>In receiuing, which is the thirde part, two things (saith Maister Heskins) offend the proclaymer, that is; receiuing
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:14727:212"/>
vnder one kinde, and receiuing of the Priest alone. The former is defended by him <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. from the 64. Chap. to the end of 67. Chap. &amp; there it is in this booke confuted. The priuate receiuing (he saith) shall be defended after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In doctrine the 4. part, he knoweth not what faulte the proclaymer can finde, wherein is greatest fault of all, but M. Heskins will haue nothing to be the doctrine of the Masse, but the Gospell and Pistle and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scriptures that are read in it.</p>
                  <p>In prayer the fift and last parte, he findeth two faultes, namely prayer to Saintes, and for the dead, for triall of these, he will haue recourse to the primitiue Church. It is well he can haue no recourse to the holie scriptures, nor to the most ancient Church, which is properly called the primitiue Church, although these two errors be of great antiquitie. But before M. Heskins vndertake these trials, he girdeth at the communion ministred in copes, and the proclaymer wearing Aarons garment for a bishoprick. If the Popish priestes had no more pleasure to say masse in their vestments, then the proclaymer to minister in copes, I thinke the common sort of Papistes would haue lesse deuotion to the Masses, then Gods people haue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, when it is ministred without any ceremoniall attyre. But Maister Heskins will proue (that neuer yet was heard off) that Christ himselfe saide Masse. For he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Masse in his last supper, and that he will proue by Cyprian, but why doth he not rather proue it by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelistes? Forsooth, because the scriptures haue no such vnproper speech to make any shewe of the Masse, as Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and the rest of the fathers haue. Well let vs heare how Cyprian affirmeth that Christ saide Masse. Maister Heskins saith: First for the consecration, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. He writeth thus: <hi>Vt in Genesi, &amp;c. That the blessing in Genesis by Melchisedech the priest might be duely celebrated about Abraham, the image of the sacrifice appointed in bread and wine goeth before, which thing our Lord perfecting and fulfilling offered bread &amp; the cup mixed with wine, and he that is that fulnesse hath fulfilled the veriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the prefigured image:</hi> In these wordes M. Heskins
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:14727:212"/>
forgetting that Christ offred bread &amp; wine, gloseth vpon the veritie of the image fulfilled by Christ, and expressed by Cyprian in other wordes. <hi>Obtulit, &amp;c. He offred the same thing which Melchisedech had offered, that is bread and wine, euen his bodie and bloud.</hi> Here againe is bread and wine offered by Christe, which is his bodie and bloud after a spiritual manner, as it was offered by Melchisedech. Hitherto no worde of consecration, nor of the carnall manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but directly against it. Nowe let vs heare howe he proueth oblation. <hi>Quaerendum est, &amp;c. It must be asked whom they haue folowed. For if in the sacrifice which is Christ none but Christ is to be followed, we must then obey and doe that whiche Christ did, and which he commanded to be done.</hi> Here Maister Heskins noteth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is the sacrifice. I answere euen as the bread is his bodie &amp; the wine his bloud. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ commaunded the Church to offer this sacrifice in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, he teacheth plainely (saith M. Heskins.) Yea sir, but where doth he teach, either plainely or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, that the Masse is a sacrifice propitiatorie for the quicke and the dead, which is the matter in question? And not the name of sacrifice vsed by Cyprian vnproperly &amp; figuratiuely, meaning a remembrance and thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the onely once offered sacrifice of Christe. But let vs heare his words. <hi>Quod si nec minimia, &amp;c. If it be not lawful to breake the least of the Lordes commaundements, how much more is it not lawful to infringe or breake things so greate, so weightie, so apperteining to the very sacrament of the Lords passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our redemption, or by mans tradition to chaunge it into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing then is ordeined of God? For if Iesus Christ our Lord and God be himselfe the high Priest of God the father, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe first did offer sacrifice, and commanded this to be done in his remembrance, that Priest supplyeth the roome of Christ truly, which followeth that which Christ did. And then he offereth a true &amp; full sacrifice in the Church to God the father if he so begin to offer, as he hath seene Christ him selfe to haue offered.</hi> Here M. Hesk. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth our ministration in two points: First, for that we minister with wine alone contrarie to Christes instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But when he can proue that Christ added water to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:14727:213"/>
his cup of wine, we will grant it to be a breach of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and not before. Secondly he reasoneth, if it be so greate a matter to take away wine or water from the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is much greater to take away. Christes body there fro: but it is as false that we take away his bodie, as it is true, that they take away his bloud. <q>Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the tearme sacrifice, vsed by S. Cyprian, his wordes in the same Epistle declare plainely, that he vsed it (as I said before) vnproperly: <hi>Et quia passionis eius mentionem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacrificijs omnibus facimus (passio est enim Domini, sacrificium<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> quod offerimus) nihil aliud quàm quod ille fecit facere debemus.</hi> And because we make mention of his passion in all our sacrifices (for the sacrifice which we offer is the passion of our Lord) we ought to do nothing, but that he hath done.</q> By this you see, that the sacrifice is Christe, euen as it is the passion of Christe, that is to say, a sacramentall memoriall of Christes body, and of his passion, &amp; not otherwise. But Maister Heskins taking occasion of the former saying of Cyprian by him cited, rayleth at his pleasure vpon the author of the apologie, for saying, the contention betweene Luther and Zwinglius, was about a small matter. And so it was in deede, in comparison of these cheefe and necessarie pointes of religion, in whiche they did agree. And if you make the moste of it, yet was it no greater, then the matter of rebaptising, wherein Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian his authour, dissented from Cornelius Bishop of Rome. Neuerthelesse Maister Heskins returning to vrge the image of the sacrifice, set foorth in Melchisedeches feast of bread and wine, bringeth in Tertullian <hi>Contra Marcion. Ita nunc sanguinem suum in vino consecrauit, qui sunc vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>um in sanguine figurauit. So now he hath consecrated his bloud in wine, which then figured wine in bloud.</hi> He quoteth not the place, least his falsification might appeare. For first he applyeth this figure to Melchisedech, which Tertullian doth to Iuda, and translateth <hi>Vinum in sanguine figurauit.</hi> He figured wine in his bloud, whereas Tertullian speaking of the blessing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iacob gaue to Iuda, that he should wash his garment in the bloud of the grape, sayeth, he figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:14727:213"/>
wine by bloud, that is, by the name of bloud of the grape, he meant figuratiuely wine. As for the name of consecration in the true sense thereof, we neither abhorre nor refuse to vse. But he hath neuer done with Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deches bread &amp; wine, &amp; when all commeth to all, Christ offred neither bread nor wine, as they say. Yet M. Heskins affirmeth, (if he wold abide by it) that <hi>Christ offred bread &amp; wine in verity.</hi> But if you aske him whether he mean bread and wine in truth and veritie, he will say no verily, so M. Hesk. veritie is contradictorie to truth. To draw to an end he citeth Ambrose <hi>In praefatione Missae in coena Do. Christus formam sacrificij perennis instituens, hostiam se primus obtulit &amp; primus docuit offerri, &amp;c. Christ instituting a fourme of perpetuall sacrifice, first offered himselfe for a sacrifice, and first taught it to be offered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But where Maister Heskins founde this authority, I leaue to all learned men to consider, when there is not such a title in all the workes of Saint Ambrose that are printed, new or olde. Therefore whether he fayned it him selfe, or followed some other forger, he sheweth his honest and faithfull dealing. But if we should admitte this testimonie as lawfull, whereas it is but a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fete: yet vnderstanding howe the auncient wryters abused the name of sacrifice for a memoriall of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and not for a propitiatorie sacrifice, it helpeth Maister Heskins nothing at all. Saint Ambrose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very improperly vseth the name of <hi>Hostia,</hi> or sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as <hi>De Virgine Lib.</hi> 1. <q>
                        <hi>Virgo matris hostia est cuius quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano sacrificio vis diuina placatur.</hi> A Virgine is the hoste or sacrifice of her mother, by whose daily sacrifice the wrath of God is pacified.</q> If Maister Heskins coulde finde thus muche in Saint Ambrose for the sacrifice of the Masse, he would triumph out of measure, that he had found it a propitiatorie sacrifice, euen for the quicke and the dead: and that those wordes of Christe: doe this in rememembraunce of me, were expounded of the Fathers for, offer a sacrifice propitiatorie. But who so listeth to heare the trueth, neede not to bee deceiued
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:14727:214"/>
in the word of sacrifice and phrase of offring vsed by the olde writers, which was not properly, but figuratiuely &amp;c sometimes abusiuely. For further instruction of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and oblation he sendeth his Reader backe to the 2. book, 41. Chapter, to the end of the book. For the rest vnto the 1. booke, 33. Chapter, to the end of that booke. And euen in the same places shall the Reader finde mine answere.</p>

                     </note>It is maruell the Apostles were such great sayers of Masse, and yet neuer make one worde mention of it in all their writinges. But we must see what Maister Heskins can picke out of them. And first he maketh another diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Masse into inward substantiall partes, whiche are consecration, oblation, and receiuing, instituted by Christ, and into outward ceremonies, prayers, gestures, &amp; manners <hi>Instituted by the ministerie of the holie Ghost, but not of Christe.</hi> In these later he graunteth, that the Masses of S. Peter, of S. Andrew, of S. Iames, of S. Clement, of S. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyse, S. Basil, Chrysostome, S. Ambrose do differ one from another, but not in the former substantiall partes: &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in consecration, and oblation, wherein the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie standeth: which M. Heskins wil proue adding two handmaides vnto them, that is, to consecration intention, and to oblation, prayer for acceptation. So by his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the intention of the priest, hath more force then the wordes of consecration to make the bodie of Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and when it is present and sacrificed, it hath neede of the priestes prayers for acceptation. But he will begin with S. Peters Masse, and that he proueth by this reason, the proclaymer confesseth (though in scorne) that some say S. Peter saide Masse at Rome, but no auncient writer saith, he did not say Masse, therefore it is true, that he did say Masse. This argument is of like force with this that I will bring: some say that Maister Heskins in King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:14727:214"/>
time married a Nunne, whiche no auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter denieth, therefore it is true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he married a Nunne, and so peraduenture it is, although it followe not vpon the assumption that no auncient writer denieth it. And as for S. Peters Massing, as there is no auncient writer that writte within 600. yeares of Christe that denieth it, so is there none that affirmeth it. But you shall heare another reason. S. Peter that sate 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. yeares at Rome and had saide Masse at Antioche, is not like to haue neglected his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at Rome. Admit it were true, that he was at Rome, which is not all out of doubt, and that he sate as Bishop there 25. yeares, which is proued false by the scriptures, all though Hierome and Eusebius doe affirme it: yet howe proueth M. Hesk. that it was any part of his dutie to say Masse, either there or else where, or that he did say Masse at Antioche? His first witnesse is <hi>Hugo de S. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Sacra. par.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. Who although he be a late writer, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of credite in this cause, yet I wil set downe his words, that you may see howe much they make for M. Heskins cause. <hi>Celebratio Misse &amp;c. The celebration of the Masse is done in commemoration of the Passion of Christ, as he commaunded the Apostles, deliuering to them his bodie and his bloud saying: This do ye in remembrance of me. This Masse S. Peter the Apostle is saide first of all men to haue saide at Antioch. In the which in the beginning of the faith, there were only three prayers saide.</hi> If this be true, none of the Apostles saide Masse at Hierusalem many yeare after Christ, but it is manifest, that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred the Lordes Supper, therefore the Masse is not the Lordes supper. But if he will restraine the words of Hugo to meane, that Peter was the first that saide Masse at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, the consequence will be the same, for it is certeine, that the Gospell beeing first preached at Antiochia by those Cyprians, and Cyrenians that fled vpon the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Stephan, Barnabas, and Paul, sent thither by the Apostles, brought the Antiochians to be perfect Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in so much that the name of Christians began there, before Peter came thither to say Masse, but they could not be Christians, without the celebration of the Lordes supper, therefore the Lordes supper is not the Masse.

where he saith, there were but three praiers in S.

For Gregorie is made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institutor of the Popish Masse, whiche was not long before Isidorus. Next he will proue, that S.

As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order &amp; forme of ministration, it was agreable to that doctrine: &amp; when he said, Other things I wil set in order when I come, although it be not necessarily to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, sauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority of Hugo, Hierom, &amp; Augustine: yet it is out of question, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did dispose nothing contrary to the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, as all the Popish filthines is, which M.

In deede the B. of Sarum, confesseth, that there is more in those liturgies against the Papistes, then for them, as by examining these parcels which M. Heskins citeth, we shall easily perceiue. First the liturgie of Iames, hath these wordes. <hi>Dominus, &amp;c. Our Lord Iesus the same right, in which he was betrayed, or rather in which night he deliuered himselfe for the life of saluation of the world taking bread into his holie, vndefiled, innocent &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall hands, looking vp into heauen, &amp; shewing it to the God &amp; father, giuing thankes, sanctifying, breaking, he gaue it to vs his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples saying Take ye, eate ye, this is my bodie, which is broken for you, and giuen vnto remission of sinnes. Likewise after he had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he tooke the cup, and mingling it with wine and water, &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp into heauen and shewing it to the God and father, giuing thankes sanctifying, blessing, filling it with the holy Ghost, he gaue
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14727:216"/>
it to vs his disciples, saying, Drinke ye all of this: this is my bloud of the new Testament, which is shed for you and many, and giuen for remission of sinnes.</hi> This saith Maister Heskins was his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of consecration, vnlike the manner of the newe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in their communion, which only rehearse the words of Christ historically, not directing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God as a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein he lyeth most impudently, as euerie man that heareth or readeth the praier immediately before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the sacrament can testifie. Concerning the tearme of consecration. I haue often shewed, that in the true sense thereof, we both allow &amp; vse it, although he wold make ignorant &amp; obstinat papists, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil neither heare our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, nor read our writings, to beleeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie, only because he saith it. Another ridiculous cauil, he hath, that we take not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread into our handes before we consecrate it, <hi>But let it lie on the table, as though we had nothing to do with it.</hi> Surely we do not acknowledge such holines in our hands, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can consecrate the bread, but we pray to God to blesse those his creatures of bread &amp; wine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be vnto vs the bodie and bloud of Christ his sonne our Lord. If the Papists haue such holy, vndefiled, and immortal hands, as this Iames speaketh of, it is more then we knowe, or will confesse, before they can proue it. In the consecration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine, he chargeth vs. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we mingle no water with the wine. But when he can proue, by the word of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our sauiour Christ did so, we will confesse our errour, otherwise we see no necessitie of the water, &amp; so their own schoolemen do confesse. We acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the primitiue Church, it was an ancient custome, to mingle water with the wine, but not as a ceremonie at the first, but as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vsage of al men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drank y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hotte wines of the East countries: but afterward it grewe to be counted a ceremonie, including some mysterie, and at length with some it excluded the wine altogether, as with those that were called Aquarij, so daungerous a matter it is to vse any thing in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, more then is prescribed by himselfe. <q>But M. Heskins ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be persuaded, that after al this sanctifying, blessing, and filling of the cup with the holy Ghost, there should bee nothing else but a bare hungrie figure. As though
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14727:217"/>
there were no choyce, but either transubstantiation, or a bare hungrie figure.</q> In baptisme there is sanctification, blessing, and filling with the holie Ghost, as much as in the communion, is there therefore transubstantiation in baptisme, because there is not a bare hungrie figure? But if I might be so bold, as to examine him in his own fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Masse of S. Iames, I would aske him, how the cuppe is filled with the holie Ghost? essentially, so that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, or any parte of him is conteined in the cupp? I dare say he will say no. And why then may not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ be present, and yet not corporally nor lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally conteyned in pixe, corporax, cupp, hand, or mouth, but after a spirituall manner, as the holy Ghost is in the cuppe, by his owne Iames his saying. The last quarrell he picketh, is to our ministers, who (sayeth he) haue none authoritie to consecrate, because they receiue it not from the catholike succession. As for that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which we haue receiued of God by the outwarde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the church, wee minde not to exchange with the Popes triple crowne, and much lesse with Maister Hesk. shauen crowne. But to shape him an answere according to his lewde obiection: seeing many are suffered to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in our church, which were made priestes after the Popish order of antichrist, why should he denye any of them, them at the least, to haue power to consecrate, according to the Popish diuinitie, though the wordes be spoken in English, so long as he hath <hi>intentione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> consecran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> before he be of them disgraded, and hath his indebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character scraped out of his handes and fingers endes? I aunswere he is not able to defend his opinion, that thei cannot consecrate, neither in Sorbona of Paris, nor in the schoole of Louain. To shutt vp this Chapter, he flappeth vs in the mouth, with S. Mathewes Masse, testified by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias in the diuels name, a disciple of the Apostles (as hee saith) but one that sawe Christ him selfe, (as M. Harding sayeth) in verie deed a lewd lying counterfeter of more then Caunterburie tales. And thinketh he that such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, will nowe bee credited? except it bee of such as wilfully will be deceiued.</p>

                  <p>The fiue and thirtieth Chapter, sheweth the manner of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration vsed and practised by the disciples of the Apostles, and the fathers of the primitiue and auncient church.<note place="margin">

                     </note> but a late writer, who affirmeth that Clemens did write a Liturgie, which Peter, Paule, and the Apostles vsed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that, which he rehearseth of Clemens his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, be to small purpose, &amp; litle or nothing differing from that hee had before of Iames, yet Nicolaus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, is too yong a witnesse to bee credited in this case. For he was not of yeres of discretion to discerne that for the authenticall writing of Clemens, which the more auncient church, by a thousand yeres could not haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge to be his. Neither doth the testimonie of Proclus help him any whit. For, as it is not to be doubted, but S. Iames &amp; the other Apostles, &amp; Clemens also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed some forme of Liturgie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches by them planted &amp; instructed, which is all that Proclus saith: yet how proueth M. Hesk. that those which we haue, were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same which were written by Iames, Clemens, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lawful antiquitie, when wee bring manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations for the contrarie? Againe, where he saith that Peter vsed the Liturgie of Clemens, he is contrary to Hugo cited in the last Chap. which sayth that Peter vsed a Liturgie of his own, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of three praiers only. The next witnesse should be Dionysius falsly surnamed Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagita, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is clean contrary to M. Hes. transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, carnal prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, priuate Masse, or sole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, &amp; therefore vnder pretence of his obscuritie he dare cite ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a sentence out of him. Then follow the Liturgies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the names of Basil &amp; Chrysost. verie litle in words &amp; nothing at al in matter, differing from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> former Liturgie ascribed to S. Iames, which because M. Hesk. knoweth, we cannot receiue as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawful writings of Basil &amp; Chrysost. he would vnderprop them by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of Proclus B. of Constantinople, as he did S. Clem. &amp; S. Iames masse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now. The reason alledged by Proclus, will cleane ouerturne his ground worke, &amp; proue that none of these Liturgies, were writen by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to whom they be ascribed.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:14727:218"/>
For Proclus sayeth, that Basil and Chrysostom made the auncient Liturgies receiued from the Apostles shorter, cutting many things away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, because they were too long for the peoples colde deuotion to abide. First, this is a colde reason to alter the tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, so many yeres continued in the church, for want of the peoples deuotion. But be it, that they followed this reason, then doth it followe moste manifestly, that this Liturgie which is ascribed to S. Iames is none of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is as short as either that of Chrysost. or the other of Basil. But, if M. Hesk. will defende that of S. Iames, then hee must needes refuse these of Basil and Chrysost. for these are as long as it, &amp; therfore none abridgements of it. After these Liturgies, hee addeth the testimonie of the sixt counsell of Constantinople, which condemned Pope Honorius for an heretike, wherein it is reported, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> S. Iames, Basil &amp; Chrysostome ministred, &amp; in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies prescribed wine to be mixed with water. But this proueth not, that these Liturgies which we haue are the same, that were set forth by those fathers, &amp; as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they striue not for it, but for wine to be vsed, &amp; not water onely. Finally, where the fathers of that counsell call the celebration of the communion, an oblation and an vnbloudie sacrifice, they speake in the same sence, that the elder fathers vse the same termes, otherwise that counsell, being an hundreth yeres without the compasse of the challenge, hath no place but in the lower house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Burgesses, whose speaches may be hearde, but they haue none authoritie to determine in this cause by M. Heskins order, according to the challenge.</p>
                  <p>Now at length M. Hesk. thinketh it time to see the manner of consecration in the Latine church: as though Clemens, if he were bishop of Rome, and wrote a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as he affirmeth before, that of his making might not serue the Latine church. But Ambrose is cited, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Sacr. Ca.</hi> 5. <hi>Vis scire, &amp;c. Wouldest thou knowe, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is consecrated with heauenly wordes?

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14727:218"/>
ascribed, reasonable &amp; acceptable, which is the figure of the bodie &amp; bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, which the day before he suffred, tooke bread in his holie hands, looked vp to heauen to the holie father, almightie, eternall God, giuing thanks blessed it, brake it, &amp; being broken gaue it to his Apostles and disciples saying: Take ye, &amp; eat ye all of this: for this is my bodie, which shalbe broken for many. Likewise also he tooke the cupp, after he had supped, the day before he suffered, looked vp to heauen to the holie father, almightie, eternall God, giuing thankes, he blessed it, deliuered it to his Apostles &amp; disciples, saying: Take ye, and drinke ye all of this for this is my bloud.</hi> M. Hesk. passeth ouer that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the church, is the figure of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; for feare he should be espied &amp; taken with such an assertion, he flyeth in all the haste to other words of Ambrose following. <hi>Vide, &amp;c. See all those be the Euangelists words, vnto these words: Take either the bodie or the bloud, from thence they be the wordes of Christ. Note euery thing. Who (saith he) the day before he suffered, tooke breade in his holie hands. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be consecrated it is bread, but after the wordes of Christe be come vnto it, it is the bodie of Christ. Finally, heare him saying: Take ye &amp; eat ye all of it, this is my bodie. And before the wordes of Christ the cuppe is full of wine &amp; water, after the wordes of Christ haue wrought, there is made the bloud which redeemed the people.</hi> To the like effect be the words taken out of his treatise, <hi>de oration. Dom. Memini, &amp;c. I remember my saying, when I entreated of the sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told you that before the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Christ, that which is offered is called bread, when the wordes of Christ are brought forth, nowe it is not called bread, but it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his bodie.</hi> Here M. Hesk. triumpheth in his consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; of the vertue therof. <q>But he must remember what Ambrose saith, <hi>De ijs qui myster, initiant. Ipse clamat Dominus Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> Our Lord Iesus him selfe doth speake alowde. This is my bodie, before the blessing of the heauenly wordes, it is named another kinde, but after the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, the bodie of Christ is signified. And <hi>lib. de Sac.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ergo didicisti, &amp;c.</hi> Then hast thou learned, that of the bread, is made the bodie of Christ, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is put into the cup, but by consecration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly

word, it is made his bloud. But peraduenture thou sayest, I see not the shew of bloud. But it hath a similitude. For as thou hast receiued the similitude of his death, so also thou drinkest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> similitude of his precious bloud, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there may bee no horror of bloud, &amp; yet it may worke the price of redemption.</q> Here M. Hesk. for all his swelling brags hath not gained one patch of his popish Masse, out of the auncient writers: for none of them vnderstoode consecration, to cause a transsubstantiation of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the naturall bodie of Christe, but only a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of them, from the common vse, to become the sacraments of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish cauil he vseth against protestants refusing to follow the primitiue church, for loue &amp; liking of innouation, is not worthie of any reputation, for in al things which thei followed Christ, most willingly we folow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> steps of Christs doctrin are not seene, there dare we not follow them, although otherwise we like neuer so well of them.</p>

make this bread, the holy body of thy Christe, and this cup the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud of thy Christ, that it may be to all that receiue of it, vnto forgiuenesse of sinnes, and life euerlasting.</hi> M. Heskins saith, he would not haue prayed so earnestly, that the holy Ghost might haue sanctified the bread and wine, to be onely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and tokens, which they might be without the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sanctification of Gods spirite, as many things were in the lawe. As for only figures and tokens, it is a slaunder confuted, and denyed a hundreth times alreadie. But what a shamelesse beast is he, to affirme, that the sacraments of the olde lawe which were figures of Christe, had no speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sanctification of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghost, or that baptisme which is a figure of the bloud of Christ, washing our souls, may be a sacrament without the speciall sanctification of Gods spirite? you see, howe impudently he wresteth and wringeth the wordes of this Liturgie, which if it were graunted vnto them to be authenticall, yet hitherto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it nothing in the world for him.</p>
                  <p>But let vs heare how S. Clement came to the altar: <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus vt mittere digneris &amp;c. We pray thee that thou wouldest vouchsafe to send thy holy spirite vpon this sacrifice, a witnesse of the passions of our Lord Iesus Christ, that he may make this breade the body of thy Christ, and this cup the bloud of thy Christ.</hi> Here saith M. Heskins his intent was, that the bread and wine should be made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloude of Christ. And so they be, to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiue worthily. But M. Heskins will not see, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he calleth the bread and wine a sacrifice, before it is made the body and bloud of Christ, by which it is plaine, that this Clemens, intended not to offer Christes body in sacrifice, as the Papistes pretend to do. S. Basil in his Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, hath the same intention in consecration. <hi>Te postulamus &amp;c. We pray and besech thee ô most holy of al holies, that by thy wel pleasing goodness, thy holy spirit may come vpon vs, and vpon these proposed gifts, &amp; to blesse and sanctifie them, &amp; to shew this bread to be the very honourable body of our Lorde God &amp; Sauiour Iesus Christ, and that which is in the cup, to be the very bloud of our Lord god &amp; sauiour Iesus Christ, which was shed for the life of the world.</hi> Of this praier M.

                     </gap>, exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or figures. You see therefore, howe with patches and peeces, rent off here and there, he goeth about to deceiue the simple readers, which either haue no leasure, or no boookes, or no skill, to trie out his falsifications and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious corruptions.</p>
                  <p>The like sinceritie hee vseth in citing Chrysostomes Masse, for so he calleth his Liturgie, in which is a prayer for Pope Nicholas, and the Emperour Alexius, which was seuen hundreth yeres after Chrysostomes death, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not possibly be written by him. Besides this, there be diuers copies in the Greeke tong, one that Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus translated, which is very vnlike that copie which is printed in Greeke since that time, as the learned sort doe knowe. The wordes he citeth, be in a manner the same that were in Basils Liturgie, sauing that in the end he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Permutans ea sancto spiritu tuo, changing them by the spirt.</hi> This change may well be without transubstantiation, as hath bene often shewed before. The saying of Ambrose is more at large in the Chapter next before. As for the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Popish Masse, that the oblation may be made the body and bloud of Christ, as it is vnderstoode of them, is nothing like the prayers of the elder Liturgies, although in sound of some words it seeme to agree. And as foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as vniustly, he findeth fault with our praier in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:14727:220"/>
that wee receiuing the creatures of breade and wine in remembrance of Christes death according to his institution, may be made partakers of his most blessed body &amp; bloud. S. Iames, S. Clement, and the rest (saith he) prayed not that they might receiue bread and wine. No more doe we, thou foolish sophister. But that receiuing bread and wine, we might be partakers of Christes body and bloud, and this did all the Apostolike and Primitiue Church pray, as we pray in baptisme, not that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue water, but that receiuing water we may be borne a newe. Neither did they euer pray, that the breade and wine might be transubstantiated into the body &amp; bloud of Christ, but that they might be made the body &amp; bloud of Christ to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after a spirtual &amp; sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal maner. But I am much to blame, to vouchsafe these childish sophismes of any answere. Next to this, he would knowe what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie the Protestants can shewe, that the eating and drinking of bread &amp; wine, is of Christes institution. That it is a part of his institution, the Euangelists &amp; S. Paul do shewe most euidently. But though he tooke breade and wine in his hands (saith M. Heskins) he changed it before he gaue them, so that it was no more bread and wine, but his body and bloud, and therefore we charge Christ with an vntrueth: to say, that receiuing of bread and wine is of Christes institution. O Maister of impietie and follie! Christ made no such change in his handes, but that which was in the cup was still the fruit of the vine, as he himself testified, saying: I wil no more drinke of this fruit of the vine, vntill the day come when I shall drinke it a newe with you in the kingdome of my father. Math. 26. As for the praier of those Liturgies of Iames and Basil, <hi>That God would make them worthie to receiue the body and bloud of Christe, without condemnation,</hi> proueth not, that they meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the body of Christ after a corporall maner, nor that the very body of Christe may be receiued to damnation. The thirde Liturgie of Chrysostome, which Erasmus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth, hath it otherwise. <hi>Dignos nos redde potenti manu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sanguinis, &amp; per nos, omnis populus.</hi> Make vs worthy by thy mightie hand, that we may be partakers of thy vndefiled body, and of thy precious bloud, and so may al the people by vs. This prayer is godly &amp; sound, and so are the other, being rightly vnderstoode, namely, that they which eate of that bread, &amp; drinke of that cup of the Lord vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as S. Paule saith) do eat and drinke their owne damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not considering the Lords body. But M. Heskins vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that the spiritual body of Christ, or Christ spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot be deliuered by the Priestes to the people, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> real body may. Yes verily, much rather then the body of Christ corporally, euen as the holy Ghost may be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in baptisme, and as eternal life and forgiuesse of sinnes may be giuen in preaching the Gospell, and none of these feinedly, but truly, yet otherwise are they giuen by God, otherwise by this Ministers. But in this distinction of M. Hes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is good to note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maketh Christ to haue a reall body, which is not spirituall, &amp; a spirituall body which is not reall. Christ hath in deede a mysticall body, which is his Church, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not his natural body, but by spiritual coniunction vnited to his only true &amp; naturall body. But of this mystical body, M. Hes. speaketh not. Further, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth exceptions to our prayer, &amp; affirmeth, that <hi>It is not the institution of Christe to receiue the creatures of breade and wine in the remembrance of his death.</hi> But notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standing all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish &amp; blockish quarels, our prayer is waranted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words 1. Cor. 11. As often as ye eat of this bread, &amp; drinke of this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till he come. In the last part of this Chap. he will determine of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the ministers of the new Church. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, that <hi>Desiring to receiue the creatures of bread &amp; wine, they exclude the body and bloud of Christ.</hi> Who euer heard a more shamelesse lye, or a more inconsequent argument? But seing there be two sorts of ministers in this new founded Church, he wil speake of them both: one sort were made Popish Priestes, &amp; so haue authoritie to consecrate, but they lacke inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now they be fallen to heresie: there is a second sort; which thought they could not haue intention to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:14727:221"/>
yet being none of the greasie and blasphemous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they lack authoritie. But I wold there were not a third sort, of whom I spake in the last chap. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer made popish Priestes, and so continue, but in outward dissimulation ioyne with vs, if these intend to consecrate when they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, how can M. Hes. dissuade the Papists from receiuing of them, or count their sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nothing but bare bread? And wheras M. He. seemeth in the end to inueigh against such, I will willingly confesse, that they are worse then he is, or such as professe what they are, but not worse then hee hath beene in King Henries &amp; King Edwards dayes, when he dissembled and swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for our intention, seeing it is to doe that which Christ commanded to be done, and to receiue that which he deliuered vs to be receiued, if the particular explication of our faith will not satisfie M.

Concerning the Fathers, as they vse the terme of sacrifice, so I haue often shewed, that they meane a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and not of propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or else they vse the name of sacrifice vnproperly for a memorial of the onely sacrifice of Christ, which he once offered neuer to be repeated. Neither do any of these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, which M. Heskins calleth Masses, though they be falsly ascribed to Saint Iames, Saint Clement, Saint Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil, Saint Chrysostome, &amp;c. shewe any other thing, but manifestly the same that I haue saide. First that which is falsly ascribed to Saint Iames, in these wordes: <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res &amp;c. Therefore we sinners being mindfull of his quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:14727:222"/>
passions, of his healthfull crosse and death, his buriall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from death the third day, of his ascension into heauen, and sitting at the right hand of thee ô God the father, and of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond glorious and fearefull comming, when he shall come with glory to iudge the quicke and the dead, when he shall render to euery one according to his workes, we offer vnto thee ô Lord, this reuerend &amp; vnbloudie sacrifice, praying that thou wilt not deale with vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our sinnes.</hi> No reasonable man can vnderstand here any other but a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, or prayer, or a memoriall of the sacrifice of Christ. For he saith not, we offer the body and bloud of Christe, but being mindfull of his sufferings &amp;c. we offer this reuerend and vnbloudy sacrifice, for such is the sacrifice of prayer and thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
                  <p>The like and more plaine is that which is ascribed to Clemens by Nicholas Methon. <hi>Memores igitur: Therefore being mindfull of his passion, death, and resurrection, returning into heauen, and his second comming, in which he shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, and to render to euery man according to his workes, we offer vnto thee our king and God, according to his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, this bread and this cup, giuing thankes vnto thee by him, that thou hast vouchsafed vs to stand before thee, and to sacrifice vnto thee.</hi> This is so plaine against M. Heskins, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation of Christes body and bloud &amp;c. that he is enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to flee to shamefull petitions of principles, the end of which is, that this bread is no bread, &amp; this cup is no cup, but as Christe called bread in the 6. of Iohn, and S. Paule in the 1. Cor. 10. &amp; 11. in exposition whereof lyeth all the controuersie. That Liturgie which is intituled to S. Basil, is yet more plaine for a spirituall oblation of thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. <hi>Memores ergo &amp;c. Therefore being mindfull ô Lord of his healthsome passions, of his quickening crosse, three dayes buriall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from death, ascension into heauen, sitting at thy right hand ô God the father, and of his glorious and terrible second pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, we offer vnto thee, tua ex tuis, thy giftes of thy creatures.</hi> M. Heskins saith, he abhorreth not from the name of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as we do, but he falsly, belyeth vs, for if he will looke in our Liturgie or communion booke, he shall finde, that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:14727:222"/>
we also offer a sacrifice of thankesgiuing, euen our selues, our soules and bodies, (as the Apostle exhorteth vs) to be a holy, liuely, and acceptable sacrifice to God. But he will not remember, that the sacrifice he speaketh of, is not the body and bloud of Christe, but <hi>tua ex tuis,</hi> thy creatures of thy giftes, or thy gifts of thy creatures, namely the bread and wine which also after consecration, he prayeth to be sanctified by Gods holy spirite, but the body of Christe hath no neede of such sanctification. Secondly, he noteth not, that his Basil maketh but two presences of Christe in the worlde, the first, when hee liued in humilitie in the the world, the second which shall be terrible and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by which he doth manifestly exclude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned presence of Christ in the sacrament. To the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect prayeth the Priest in the other Liturgie, ascribed to Chrysostome: <hi>Memores &amp;c. Therefore being mindfull of this wholesome commaundement, and of all those things which are done for vs, of his crosse, buriall, resurrection, ascension into heauen, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand, of his second and glorious comming againe, we offer vnto thee, tua ex tuis, thy giftes of thy creatures.</hi> Maister Heskins saith, he will not seeke the deapth of this matter, but only declare, that al these fathers did offer sacrifice. In which words he mocketh his readers egregiously, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he should proue, that they offered the body and bloud of Christe to be a propitiatorie sacrifice, and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth neuer a whit. Nowe that the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Liturgie was not, to offer Christ in sacrifice, this prayer therein vsed before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration (as they terme it) doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. O Lord, receiue this sacrifice vnto thine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly altar. So that it is manifest, they called the bread &amp; wine a sacrifice, not the body &amp; bloud of Christ. The like is that of Ambrose, <hi>The Priest saith: Therefore being mindfull of his most glorious passion, resurrection from death, and ascension into heauen, we offer vnto thee this vndefiled sacrifice, this reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sacrifice, this vnbloudy sacrifice, this holy bread and cup of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> This vndefiled sacrifice (saith M. Heskins) must needes be the body and bloud of Christe, for else there is
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:14727:223"/>
nothing vndefiled, that a man can offer. But why may it not be as Ambrose calleth it here, the holy bread and cup of the communion, or as he calleth it a little before in the same place, the figure of the body &amp; bloud of Christ? For the bread and the wine, which vnproperly he calleth a sacrifice, in steede of a memoriall of a sacrifice, in that they be the holy sacraments of Christes body and bloud, are holy, vndefiled, and the foode of eternal life. The same Ambrose, called the soule of his brother, an innocent sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and offered the same to God in his prayer: <hi>De obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>To conclude, not one of all these Liturgies, no, not the Canon of the Masse it selfe saith, that the body of Christe is the sacrifice that they do offer, or that they offer a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie sacrifice, or that they offer any other, but a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of thankesgiuing, or a memoriall of the sacrifice of Christ, by which it is easie to iudge howe the doctrine that the Papistes do nowe holde of the propitiatorie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, doth agree with the auncient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, ascribed to the Fathers of the Primitiue Church.</p>

                     </note>That the Apostles and Fathers commended to God by prayers the sacrifice which thei offered, it is a manifest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that they offered not a propitiatorie sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christe, for that needeth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of our prayers. They prayed therefore, that their sacrifice of thankes giuing, and duetifull seruice, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the memorie of Christes death, might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, as you shal see by al their prayers. First y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Liturgie vntruly ascribed to Iames praieth thus: <hi>Pro obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. &amp;c. For these offred and sanctified, precious, heauenly, vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, immaculate, glorious, feareful, horrible, diuine gifts, let vs pray to our Lord God, that our Lord God accepting them into his holy &amp; heauenly, mentall and spirituall altar for a sauour of spiritual sweet smell, may giue vs againe, and send vnto vs the diuine grace and
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:14727:223"/>
gift of the most holy spirite.</hi> These sanctified giftes can not be the body and bloud of Christe, which are holy of them selue, but the bread and wine sanctified, to be a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the death of Christe in a spirituall sacrifice of than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kesgiuing. Saint Clement, if wee beleeue Nicholas Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, prayed thus: <hi>Rogamus &amp;c. We pray thee, that with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and cheerefull countenaunce thou wilt looke vpon these giftes set before thee, thou God which hast no neede of any thing, and that thou mayest be pleased with them to the honour of thy Christ.</hi> These wordes are plaine that he offered not Christe, but the breade and wine to bee sanctified to the honour of Christe, namely that they might be made the body and bloud of Christe, to as many as receiue them worthily. In the Liturgie imputed to Basil, the Priest prayeth thus: <hi>Dominum postulemus &amp;c. Let vs desire the Lorde for these offered and sanctified the most honourable giftes of our Lorde God, and for the profite of the goods of our soules, that the most mercifull God, which hath receiued them in his holy, heauenly, intelligible altar, for a sauour of sweete smelling, would send vnto vs, the grace and communion of his holy spirite.</hi> The same wordes in a manner be in the Liturgie fathered vppon Saint Chrysostome, though it be manifest that it was written seuen hundreth yeares after his death, as is shewed before. <hi>Pro oblatis &amp;c. For the offered and sanctified precious giftes, let vs pray the Lorde, that our mercifull God, who hath receiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his holy, heauenly, intelligible altar, may send vs therfore grace, &amp; the gift of the holy Ghost.</hi> Maister Heskins would haue vs note, that these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seeme to pray for their sacrifice, which we note very willingly, for thereby is proued, that their sacrifice was not the very body of Christ, for that nedeth no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our prayers. Wel, S. Ambrose followeth. <hi>Lib. de Sacr.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Petimus &amp;c. We pray and desire, that thou wilt receiue this oblation in thy high altar by the handes of the Angels, as thou hast vouchsafed to receiue the gifts of thy seruant righteous Abel, and the sacrifice of our Patriarch Abraham, and that which thy high Priest Melchisedech offered to thee.</hi> The very name of gods heauenly, mental, intelligible, holy, &amp; high altar, do argue a spirituall sacrifice, and not a reall oblation of the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:14727:224"/>
naturall body and bloud of Christ. Next to these Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, Maister Heskins adioyneth the wordes of the Canon of the Popish Masse, agreeing in effect with these of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, but nothing at all in vnderstanding. For that the Papistes esteeme their sacrifice to be very Christ, God, and Man, which none of the auncient fathers did. For which cause the Bishop of Sarum iustly reproued those three blasphemies in their Canon, not in respect of the words, but in respect of their vnderstanding of them. The first, that they seeme to make Christ in his fathers displeasure, that he needeth a mortall man to be his spokesman. The second, that the body of Christe should in no better wise bee receiued of his father, then a Lambe at the handes of Abel. The third, that they desire an Angel may come and carie away Christes body into heauen. These three blasphemies M. Heskins taketh vpon him to auoyde or excuse. To the first, after many lowd outcries and beastly raylings against that godly learned father of blessed m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, he answereth, defending it first by example of these auncient Liturgies: that they prayed for their sacrifice: but this helpeth him not, for they neither thought nor saide, that their sacrifice was very Christe, God, and Man, but a sacrament and memoriall of him. Afterward hee saith, the meaning of their Church, is not to pray for Christe, but by Christ, to obtaine fauour bicause they say in the end of euery prayer, <hi>per Christum Dominum nostrum,</hi> by our Lord Christ. But this hole is too narrowe for him to creepe out at. For he confesseth, that he prayeth for his sacrifice, and he affirmeth, that his sacrifice is Christ, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he praieth for Christ.</p>
                  <p>To auoyde the second blasphemie, hee saith, that the meaning of their Church is not, to pray that God will accept the sacrifice, which is acceptable of it selfe, but their deuotion and seruice, and them selues the offerers, as hee did accept Abell and his sacrifice &amp;c. and so flyeth to the example of the olde Liturgies: but that will not serue him. For their sacrifice was not a propitiatorie sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christ, but a seruice and duetie of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:14727:224"/>
thankesgiuing in remembrance of Christe. And therefore they might well pray that their sacrifice might be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Abell and his sacrifice, as Noe and his burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and so of the rest, but this meaning will not stande with the wordes of their Canon, which are that God will accept the sacrifices, that is, the body and bloud of Christ, as hee accepted the giftes of his iust seruaunt Abell &amp;c. Therefore they must either chaunge the wordes of the Canon: or his aunswere to the second accusation, by the meaning of their Church, can not stande, howe so euer Hugo &amp; Heskins would seeme to salue or rather to daub vp the matter. To the third and last hee aunswereth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that the meaning of their Church is, that the body of Christe should be caried by an Angel, but that their prayers should bee offered by an Angel or Angels in the sight of GOD, making a long and needlesse discourse, of the ministerie of Angels, and howe they offer our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to GOD, which is nothing to the purpose. For the Maister of the sentences: affirmeth, that an Angel must be sent to consecrate the quickening body, or else it can not be called a Masse, which is nothing like to Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins seruice? <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 13. In the end, he will ioyne issue with the proclamer that no Catholique euer thought, that Christes body was caried into heauen by an Angell. And it seemeth plainly, that they are all ashamed of the grosse absurdities and blasphemies of their Masse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are forced to feigne meanings and interpretations, which are cleane contrarie to the wordes thereof. The trueth is, that these and some other prayers of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, were vsed in the Romane Church, before the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of transubstantiation, carnall presence, or propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorie sacrifice of the Masse were receiued, and this is the cause, that being nowe applyed to these monstruous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, they imploy such detestable blashemies, as all the Papistes in the world are ashamed to heare of, and not able to defend, whereas before these errours receiued, some of them were good prayers, some were tolerable.</p>

                     </note>Prayer for the dead beeing an auncient errour, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Heskins triumpheth out of measure, that he findeth some spottes thereof, in the auncient writers bookes. But there is great difference betweene praying for the dead, which is an errour rising of superstition and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and offring the bodie of Christe in sacrifice for the dead which is a most horrible blaspheming. Therefore he doeth maliciously wrest such thinges, as are spoken of prayer for the dead, or the sacrifice of prayer for the dead, yea and sometimes the sacrifice of thanksgiuing for the dead, to the oblation of CHRISTE for the dead.</p>
                  <p>Thus he abuseth first all the liturgies, falsely ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Saint Iame, Basil, Chrysostome. Which as we haue proued before, pretended not to offer Christes body in sacrifice, and therfore offred it not for the dead, although they offer prayers for the dead. And here it is to be noted that Clementes liturgie forsaketh him for prayer for the dead, or else we should surely haue heard of him as we did before. He would get credite to that whiche is vntruely ascribed to Saint Iames, by the proclaymers testimonie, because he saide it was full of knowledge, and full of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours also. When Dionysius can say nothing for him, concerning the sacrifice of the Masse to be auaileable for the dead, he bringeth him in, speaking of prayers made for the partie deceassed at his buriall. Concerning the antiquitie of this Dionysius we haue shewed before, that he cannot be so olde by sixe hundreth yeares, as the Papistes would make him. That the Apostles taught not prayer for the dead in their writinges, he saith the cause was, that they needed not, for that the Iewes vsed both, prayer &amp; sacrifice for the dead before Christes comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by testimonie of the Booke of Machabees which (he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) S.

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:14727:225"/>
though Augustine allowe it to be read, so it be soberly, yet doeth not he take it for Canonicall, and Hierome vtterly denieth it for Canonicall: <hi>Expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But for as much as this controuersie of praying for the dead, is vnpertinent to this cause, and requireth a larger discourse then the answere to this Chapter may conteine, &amp; also that Maister Heskins in the end ioyneth issue and maketh a newe challenge, I thinke it best, to referre the Readers to mine answere against Maister Allens Booke of Purgatorie, where he shall finde all those and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more of places alledged and answered both touching prayers for the dead, and the sacrifice of the Masse to be auaileable to the dead, in the same also is some treatie of prayer vnto dead Saintes. In the meane season, this is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient against all mans authoritie, that the worde of God prescribeth neither the one nor the other, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them both, for what so euer is not of faith is sin: and whatsoeuer is not of the word of God, is not of faith: therfore prayers for the dead and to the dead, beeing not of the worde of God are sinne. Neither were they vsed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church more then an hundreth yeres after Christ. And the first that maketh mention of any praiers for the dead, which is the elder errour by two or three hundreth yeres, is Tertullian, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was an heretike, who had receiued it with other heresies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Montanistes, who were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares after Christ: notwithstanding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Epiphanius &amp; Augustine number it among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> errours of Arrius, that he denied prayers for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, yet they both do also num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it for one of the heresies of the Heracleonites, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme their dead with inuocations, and other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vsed at their buriall. How M. Heskins falsifieth the councel of Carthage, which made a decree that such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to pay the oblations of the dead, should be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated as murtherers of the poore: I shall not neede to rehearse, vnderstanding dead mens legacies for the vse of the poore, for Masses saide for the dead. The same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth M. Allen with this and other councels.</p>

                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:14727:226"/>Likewise M. Heskins falsifieth Cyprian <hi>De Cerna Dom: In huius praesentia non superuacuè in endicant lachrymae veniam, nec vnquam patitur contriti cordis holocaustum repulsam.</hi> In presence of him teares do neuer begge pardon in vain, neither do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the sacrifice of a contrite heart euer suffer repulse. Here doth he translate <hi>Huius</hi> of this sacrifice, and applyeth it to the sacrifice of the Masse for the dead, whereas there is not one worde in all that sermon, either of prayer or sacrifice for the dead. But leauing this argument of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and offering for the dead, M. Heskins chargeth the y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proclaimer with three vntrueths in one sentence, where he saide, that <hi>Saint Iames in his Masse preached and set foorth the death of Christ, but the Papistes in their Masse haue onely a number of dumbe geastures, and ceremonies which they themselues vnderstande not and make no manner mention of Christes death.</hi> To the first he answereth, that they haue all thinges that S. Iames had in his Masse, by the proclaymers confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who diuideth their Masse into holie prayer, holie doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, holy consecration, holy receiuing. See the impudent quarrelling of this froward sophister. The Bishop saith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistes diuide their Masse into these partes, therfore he acknowledgeth their Masse to consist of these partes: and yet all these are but dumbe gestures and ceremonies, because the people vnderstand none of them, were they neuer so good, as a great parte of them is starke naught.</p>
                  <p>To the second he saith, that they them selues vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not their owne gestures and ceremonies: he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that diuerse writers haue expounded euerie parcell of them, as Isidorus, Rabanus, Hugo, Hoffnester, Gare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and others, he leaueth out Bonauentur, and Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus the cheefe, belike beeing ashamed of their ridiculous interpretations. But admitte these things to be set foorth in bookes, doth it therefore followe, that all or the moste priestes doe vnderstand them, whereof a great number, can neither conster the Latine of their masse, nor of those bookes? And generally it may be said, that they all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them not, because these writers themselues, doe not agree in the interpretation of them.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <q>When you come together, &amp;c. Nowe is it not the LORDES supper, but a mannes supper, when euerie one falleth to it alone, as it were his owne supper, and giueth no parte to another, which hath offered nothing: so that you seeme to come together, rather to fill your bellies, then for the mysteries sake. But the Lordes supper ought to be common to al men, because he deliuered his sacramentes to all his disciples that were present, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And it is therefore called a supper, because the Lorde at supper deliuered the sacramente. Also he saith this, therfore, for that when they came together in the Church they offered their oblations seuerally: and after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whatsoeuer was left to them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice, euen there in the Church, eating a common supper, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed it together. And one truely is a hungred: whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had not offred did not communicate, because they that had offred, consumed all alone. By this let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der iudge, what falsifying the proclaymer vsed and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hierome that condemned seuerall communions of riche men, would allowe a singular partaking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest alone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>An other reason he hath of baptisme, whiche though it be common to all men, and that two speciall times in the yeare were appointed for the ministration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet it may be ministred alone. But the example is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:14727:227"/>
like, for it was alwayes lawfull and often vsed, to baptise singuler persons at all times, so was it neuer of the Lordes supper, because the mysterie that S. Paul spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Many partaking of one bread, cannot bee expressed, when one priest receiueth alone. The third reason he bringeth, is a counterfet decree, ascribed to Fabianus of Rome 242. yeres after Christe, that people should receiue thryse in the yere, which had beene need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, if they receiued so often as the priest saide Masse. In deede the impudent forgerie of this decree is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, when two hundred yeares after Fabianus the people of Rome, as both Saint Augustine, and Saint Hierome do write, and Maister Heskins cannot denye, receiued the communion euery day. As for the decree of once a yere receiuing, I knowe not when it was made, but wicked it was whensoeuer it was made. But Chrysostome, I wene doth make much for priuate Masses, for he writeth, but Maister Heskins dare not tell where for shame: <hi>Nonne per singulos dies offerimus? offerimus quidem, sed ad recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem facientes mortis eius. Do wee not euery day (sayth hee) make oblation? we offer in deede, but doing it to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his death.</hi> This question of Chrysos. is but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the vsual phrase of offering, which he expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be nothing else, but a celebration of the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of Christs death: and therfore in the end of that discourse for a full resolution he setteth down: <q>
                        <hi>Non aliud sacrificium sicut Pontifex, sed id ipsum semper facimus, magis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem recordationem sacrificij operamur.</hi> Wee offer not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacrifice as the holie priest, but the same alwayes: but rather wee make the remembraunce of that sacrifice.</q> This correction sheweth, what he meaneth by the name of sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Maister Heskins vrgeth, that they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred dayly, &amp; none were bound but priests to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, aboue thrise in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere, he concludeth the priest recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued oftentimes alone. But he playeth the papist notably in taking, rather then begging two principles: one that the people were not bounde, which hee is not able
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:14727:228"/>
to proue; another, that there was but one Priest in a church, whereas at that time commonly there was but one church in a citie, in which were many priestes, which by his owne confession were bound to receiue as often as the sacrament was ministred, therefore one Priest did not eat vp all alone in Chrysostomes time.</p>
                  <p>To the saying of Ambrose which the Bishop alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Inuicem expecta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Ad inuicem expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctandum dicit, vt multorum oblatio simul celebratur: &amp; vt omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ministretur.</hi> He sayeth, they ought to tarie one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that the oblation of many might bee celebrated together, and that it might be ministred vnto them all. <q>M. Heskins aunswereth, that this doctour doth onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their want of deuotion, which is false: for he doth also shewe, that all ought to communicate together, or else it is not to eat the Lordes supper, vppon which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the Apostle, he sayeth also: <hi>Murius enim oblatum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius populi sit, quia in vno paene omnes significantur: per id quod enim vnum sumus, de vno paene omnes n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for that balde shift hee flyeth vnto, that all priestes in seuerall places communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together, is too bad for a begger to vse, for so might the Corinthians whome the Apostle reproueth for not tarying one for another, say they communicated with them whome they left out, and with al Christians in the worlde. But now M. Heskins with full sayle in rayling seas inueigheth against the proclaimer, for falsifying &amp; wrong translating of Leo, when hee doth not translate him at all; but onely doth gather the summe of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in fewe wordes, and that truely: though hee name neither Masse nor sacrifice, which are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saying of Leo, which, how little it maketh either for the popish Masse, or for the sacrifice propitiatorie, or finally for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuate Masse, I desire the reader to returne to the 32. Chapter of this booke, where he shall finde the place at large set
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:14727:228"/>
downe and vrged, which therefore I thought it in vaine to repeat in this Chapter. After this hee defendeth, that by the Masse booke they are not bounde to haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but one priest may receiue alone. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Bishop rehearseth diuerse exhortations to prayer, vsed in the Masse, as: <hi>Oremus, let vs praye: Orate pro me fratres &amp; sorores, pray for me brethren and sisters, &amp;c. And after the Agnus Dei: haec sacro sancta, &amp;c. This holie commixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and consecration of the bodie and bloud of our Lorde Iesus Christ be vnto mee &amp; to all that receiue it, health of mind &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi>: All which sayings import a number present, &amp; the last a number receiuing, whereas in the priuate Masse, there is neuer a brother or sister present many times, but one sorie boy, that helpeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest to Masse, &amp; though they be present, yet vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they not that they are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to pray for the priest, when he turneth about: Maister Hesk. trifleth vpon the former prayers, separating them from the last, and affirming that they may pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they do not receiue together. For he saith: there be two communions in the Masse, beside the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, (and therfore-belike that is not needefull) the one of prayer, the other of sacrifice, and as for the last prayer for them that receiue, is not ment onely of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the church at that time, but for all receiuers of all places and times, when and wheresoeuer. But what reason hath he to persuade vs, that those brethren &amp; sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne whome the priest firste exhorteth to pray for him, that their sacrifice might be acceptable to God, are not the same, which ought to receiue with him? neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in the ende, supposing the priestes prayeth with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of time and place, he sayth it is no reason, that if the people will not receiue, the priest should not: ye as verily, because Christe instituted a communion of many participantes in one time and place, and not one priests breakefast in a corner by him selfe. Againe, the wordes of the Masse: <hi>Omnibus sumentibus,</hi> to all which do receiue, and <hi>quae sumpsimus,</hi> which wee haue receiued, doe proue a number of receiuers, and which haue receiued at tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

time, and in that place, or else the Priest should saye, to mee which receiue it, and which I haue receiued. And whereas Maister Heskins chargeth the proclaimer, for adding the worde, Consecration, which is not in their Masse booke, I confesse I knowe not whether it be in all coppies omitted, but I am persuaded, the bishop had some ground of his saying, or else it might be the faulte of the Printer. But whereas the proclaimer alledgeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canons of the Apostles, and decrees of the bishops of Rome, Maister Heskins sayth, as odious as the Popes be to him, faine he is to praye ayde of them. But he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deceiued, God be thanked the holy scriptures are sufficient for vs, both to proue al trueth, and to disproue all errours. But if either counsels or Popes decrees, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, it is to beat downe the Papistes with their owne weapons, and to cast their owne doung in their owne faces, as the Prophet sayeth. But let vs heare the Canon of the Apostles, <hi>Can.</hi> 9. <hi>Fideles, &amp;c. The faithfull, which come to the Church and heare the Scriptures, and receiue not the holye communion, let them be excommunicated, as men that disquiet the church.</hi> Here he doth most impudently charge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer with falsification, which he himself committeth, alledging it, not out of the booke of Canons, but out of the Popes dirtie decrees: <hi>Omnes fideles, &amp;c. All Christian men that in the solemne seruice come together to the church, let them heare the scriptures of the Apostles &amp; the Gospell. And such as continue not in prayer vntill masse be all done, nor do receiue the holie communion, it is meete they be excommunicated, as such as moue disquietnesse to the church:</hi> but that the learned reader, may see how syncerely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishop hath dealt, &amp; how falsly Hesk. belyeth him, I wil set down the Canon in Greek, as it was firste written <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. All the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or Christians which enter into the church, and heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures, but tarrie not out the prayer &amp; the holie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or participation, ought to be separated, as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of disorder in the Church. Here you see no mention
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:14727:229"/>
of Masse at all. And if any ignorant papist dare not trust my translation out of Greeke, let him vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> book of councels, he shal find two translations of this &amp; the rest of those Canons, called the Canons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, of which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishop hath followed the one, but Hesk. neither of both: for as I said before, there is no mention of the Masse in any of them. Therfore, what is the falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed in the Popes lawe, out of which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, how honestly in so doing, &amp; reprouing the bishop for following the trueth, let the readers iudge. But for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he foysteth in the name of his Masse, yet can he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necessitie of receiuing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lay people, which is the matter in question. And therefore it is a verie shame to report, what an absurde interpretation of the Canon he would make, namely, that <hi>it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creede against good Catholike people, which ioyned in prayer and receiued when deuotion serued them, but against licentious &amp; yet dissembling heretikes and schismatikes, which being present in the churche, would not communicate, either in prayer or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the sacrament.</hi> For confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which blind mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: first, I woulde aske, whether <hi>omnes fideles,</hi> all the faithful (as the Canon sayeth) doth signifie all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dissembling heretikes and scismatikes? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Canon is made expressely against them that after thei haue heard the scriptures, depart when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayer &amp; celebration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginneth, whether those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be present &amp; ioyne not in prayer &amp; participation can be vnderstood? Thirdly (if he knew what kind of Censure this was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is spoken of) whether <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were a sufficient punishment, for men knowne to be licentious, dissembling, heretikes, &amp; scismatikes? But hee wil father his feyned vnderstanding, vpon the councel of Antioch, which (saith he) expoundeth it so almost, word for word: <hi>Omnes qui ingrediuntur, &amp;c. All that come into the Church of God, &amp; heare the holie scriptures, &amp; communicate not in prayer with the people but of a certein wantonnesse turne them selues away from the receiuing of the holie communion, let them be remoued from the church, vntill by confession they shewe fruites of repentance, and by prayers obteine pardon.</hi>

                     <hi>But with excommunicate persons it is not lawfull to communicate, neither may we pray with such, as go from house to house auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the prayers of the church.</hi> But who will graunt to M. Heskins, that this should be an interpretation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Canon, contrarie to the wordes thereof? Secondly, when this Canon consisteth of two partes, and in deede comprehendeth two of those Canons of the Apostles, the former parte concerning all men that come into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, the later onel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> excomunicate persons, and scisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: who is so deuoyde of reason, to graunt that this Canon was made onely against heretikes &amp; scismatikes? But in the ende, as it were forsaking his holde, he claspeth another rotten post, that the Canon was made against the slacknesse of the people, and not against the deuotion of the priest: so that if none of the people would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, the priest might receiue alone. Surely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse is such a monster, as it is not credible, that it once entred into any of their heads, that decreede those Canons. But seeing they would not suffer any smal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christians to withdrawe them selues from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is it like they would suffer all not to receiue? And seeing the worde of God was the ground of their decree: Tarrie one for another, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but that if the peoples deuotion serued them not, the priest was as well bound to tarrie for the people, as one lay man for another? So that all the congregation ought to communicate together, and none to be left out, but such as either be vnworthie, or haue some necessarie impediment. Finally, if the Papistes were grieued at the seeldome receiuing &amp; communicating with the priest, as they pretende, why do they not execute the censures of these Canons against all that be present at their Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and do not receiue with them?</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins proceeding in confutation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers arguments, first chargeth him to father a decree vpon Calixtus, which was decreede by Anacletus, as though one thing might not be decreed by two bishops, and as though in the Canon lawe and other like-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:14727:230"/>
one lawe is not fathered vppon diuerse bishops. And Gratian ascribeth it to both, and namely to <hi>Calixtus dist.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap. Peracta.</hi> The words are these: <hi>Peracta consecratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp;c. When the consecration is done, let euery man receiue the communion, vnlesse he wilbe put from the vnitie of the church. For this thing the Apostles haue ordeined, and the holy churche of Rome continueth the same.</hi> Two great faultes M. Hesk. fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this allegation. First, he doth detort, abuse, and wrest the place: secondly he doth mutilate it, and cutt it off by the knees. Here be vehement accusations, but in the tryall you shall see the bishop clearely discharged, &amp; all the slaunder verified vpon the accusers owne dealing. For first to reproue the bishops allegation, which was brought out of a decree of Calixtus, hee bringeth in an Epistle of Anacletus. Secondly, he will not alledge the wordes of the Epistle, but the report of Bartholomewe Garanza, a common falsifier of Canons &amp; decrees, and thus he citeth it: <hi>Sacerdotes quando, &amp;c. The priestes when they do offer sacrifice vnto our Lorde, they ought not to do it alone, but let them take witnesses with them, that they may be proued to sacrifice perfectly vnto the Lord in places dedicated to God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of Deutron.</hi> 12. <hi>Take heede thou offer not sacrifice in all places that thou seest, but in the place that thy Lord God hath chosen. Let a bishop sacrificing to God haue witnesses with him, &amp; more then another priest, with whome when the consecration is done, let all the ministers communicate, which will not bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the entrie of the church.</hi> Maister Heskins in his translation hath falsifyed the wordes, for where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is <hi>Non soli hoc agere debent, The Priestes ought not to do it alone,</hi> he hath turned it, <hi>they shall not do it alone</hi>: &amp; where the Latine is, <hi>sed testes secum adhibeant,</hi> he turneth it, <hi>but they shall haue witnesses with them:</hi> wheras hee should saye, let them take witnesses with them. His pollicie is easie to espye. Hee would haue it seeme to the Englishe reader, that witnesses are appoynted, which if they faile to bee present, the Priest might notwithstanding saye his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse alone, whereas by the wordes of the decree, the Priestes are commaunded to get witnesses, and it is
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:14727:231"/>

Let a bishop sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to God haue witnesses with him, as is before sayed, &amp; more then another priest. For as he enioyeth a degree of greater honor, so he hath need of the increase of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter testimonie. For in more solemne dayes, let him haue with him either seuen, or fiue, or three deacons, which are
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:14727:231"/>
called his eyes, &amp; the subdeacons and the rest of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, which being cloathed in the holie vestimentes, let them stand before and behind him, &amp; the priests ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him on the right hand &amp; on the left hande with contrite heart, &amp; humbled spirite, &amp; sober countenaunce, preseruing him from malicious men, &amp; let them giue their consent to his sacrifice. And when the consecration is ended, let al communicate, which will not be depriued of entrie into the church. These be the wordes of that Epistle which M. Hesk. mangleth and falsifieth thus:</q> 
                     <hi>Episcopus, &amp;c. The bishop doing sacrifice vnto God, let him in the solemne dayes haue either seuen, or fiue, or three deacons which be called his eyes, &amp; subdeacons &amp; other ministers.</hi> First, he leaueth out, That, no priest ought to sacrifice alone, but must take witnesses w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. Secondly, that a bishop ought to haue more then another priest at all times. Thirdly, hee citeth the words so, as though the bishop should haue no neede of witnesses, but only on solemne dayes. Fourthly, he leaueth out, how the deacons &amp; other ministers should stand before and behind the bishop, which will not agree with his popish altar: for who can stande before the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priest, except he stand in the windowe, or vppon the altar? Finally, wheras <hi>omnes</hi> may reasonably be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of al present, he restraineth it onely to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministers, which if it were so, yet it ouerthroweth the Popish priuat Masse. For, if there be twentie or fortie priests &amp; clarkes, as there be often so many at Masse, &amp; sometimes an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth &amp; more, as at a Synode, yet not one of them wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest, neither are they banished y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> refuse to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. But to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this word, all, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to all the clergie, he citeth the Can. 9 Apost. <hi>Si quis episcopus, &amp;c. If any bishop, &amp;c. when the oblation is made, do not communicate, either let him shew a cause, that if it be reasonable he may obteine pardon, or if he shew none, let him be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as one that is cause of offence to the people, giuing suspition of him which did sacrifice, that he hath not wel offered it.</hi> This Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be no interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epistle, and though it were, yet is his priuate Masse in neuer the better case: for here are still a number necessarily bounde to communicate
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:14727:232"/>
with the Priest, vnder paine of excommunication. But M. Hesk. sayeth: <hi>possible it might be, that when the bishop had bene three attendant vpon him, or such small number, they might all haue cause to absteine.</hi> This is a possibilitie not to like to come in <hi>esse,</hi> or being, once in 20. yeares. For where findeth he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bishop might haue but three with him? The decree before cited, requireth three deacons at the least, beside subdeacons &amp; other ministers: of which in the auncient church, there was great store &amp; diuerse functions, as aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, exercistes, readers, dorekeepers, &amp;c. But admitt it were possible, that all these should absteine (yet saith he) there is no prohibition for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest to receiue alone. The decree sayeth they ought not to sacrifice alone, and both it &amp; the Canon, commaund all Christians, &amp; especially the Clergie that be present to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate: yet M. Hesk. sayeth, they are not prohibited to saye Masse alone, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not sayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the priuate Masse is naught. What reason is in these aunswers let the readers iudge. But for cleare proofe &amp; ouerthrow of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proclaimers challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, M. Hesk. sayth, that in the Masse of Chrysost. there is a plain rule giuen, what was to be done, when the priest receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp; that the Proclaimer had not learned so farre, as to know this. Indeed this is an high point of learning (M. Hesk.) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proclaimer could neuer attain vnto, to play with your readers noses so impudently, which cannot smell out your falshod, when you beare them in hande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that was Chrysostomes Masse, which was written seuen hundreth yeres after Chrysostome was dead, as appeareth plainly by the prayer for Pope Nicolas, &amp; the Emperour Alexius that is in it, which the proclaimer as vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as you make him, yet had wit to finde out &amp; laye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode to your open shame, and to all their shames that vse the same Liturgie, as authenticall &amp; rightly to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to Chrysostome. The issue that you ioyne, that priuate Masse is not naught, nor prohibited in scripture, councel, or catholike writer, is tryed alreadie by suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent euidence, giuen by the B. of Sarum against Harding, &amp; by answere to your counterfet and false euidence vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

His Maior is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the authoritie of his aduersaries. But which of his aduersaries sayeth that all things forbidden are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by name? In deede we say that all things that are contrarie to Gods commaundment are forbidden, so are priuate Masse &amp; sole receiuing, therefore they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That priuate Masse &amp; sole receiuing are contrary to Gods commaundement, it is manifest by the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, which is of a communion, &amp; not of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse or sole receiuing. <hi>Vnus panis, &amp;c.</hi> One bread we being many are one bodie, &amp;c. After this fond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is returned vpon his own neck, he cauilleth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proclaimers words, because he saith, he knoweth they haue such replyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as there be many things spoken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old doctors of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> communion, so as many things or mo, are spoken by them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuate Masse: but this latter part saith M. Hesk. he passeth ouer &amp; will not rehearse one. I cannot blame M. Hesk. if he would faine haue the Bishop find something for him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctors, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> soundeth for the priuate Masse, because hee can finde nothing him self. But when the bishop sayeth, hee knoweth they haue such replyes, he doth not graunt, that their reply is true, but denyeth it, as false, and if it were so, that any thing
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:14727:233"/>
were in the old Doctours that might seeme to fauour the priuat Masse, yet what obligation hath M. Hes. of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, wherein he is bound to shewe it forth in a sermon. I vse more words about this cauil, then the matter needeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only to shew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foolish frowardnes &amp; peruerse foolishnes of this man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil seek a knot in a rush, to take occasion to rayle and slander: But to the purpose, M. Hes. confessing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the Primitiue Church the people did often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat, addresseth him self to proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacrament may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be receiued of one alone, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by Iustinus, whom both Cranmer &amp; the proclamer (he saith) doth pitifully abuse, and truncatly alledge: but he him selfe doth falsifie and truncatly alledge, as we haue shewed before. But first I wish the reader to consider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath forsaken his priuat Masse, for which is no shew in the Doctours, and fleeth to sole receiuing in cases of necessitie, or in superstitious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, which proue not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any priuat Masse was said. Iustinꝰ he citeth thus: <hi>Diaconi distribuunt &amp;c. The Deacons deliuer of the consecrated bread and wine and water to euerie one that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and if there be any away, they carie it home to them.</hi> In this translation he leaueth out <hi>ad participandum,</hi> to be receiued, which is in his Latine text, and only maketh mention of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuerie, omitting for what vse it was deliuered. <q>In deede the Greek is otherwise, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The distribution and participation of those thinges, for which thanks hath ben giuen, is made to euery one, &amp; to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not present, by the Deacons there is sent.</q> First I say, as there is a communion confessed of them that are present, so it was not cleare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which was caried to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were absent, was caried as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, but as almes: but admit it were caried as the sacrament, yet it foloweth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was receiued of euery man alone, but of euery family, which vpon necessarie cause was absent from the whole congregation, or of diuers families meting in one, which could not meete in the common assembly, so that here is no priuat Masse said, but a communion ministred, neither is there so much as any sole receiuing proued, which if it were, yet proueth it not the priuat Masse. And therefore
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:14727:233"/>
all M. Heskins babbling of the sacrament to be one, that is ministred or receiued in diuers places, and at diuers times, is vaine, and to no purpose, and most fond it is, that he compareth it to the sacrament of baptisme, which is but one to all men. For of that I may thus reason: tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh euery mans baptisme is not a diuers baptisme, but all is one baptisme, as there is one faith and one God, yet as no man is baptized by other mens baptisme, but by his owne, so no man communicateth with other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions but onely in that action wherein he is a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant him selfe. Therfore M. Heskins fantasie of one Priest communicating with all Priestes in all places, is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by his owne argument and similitude. But he wil proue sole receiuing by Tertullian, S. Cyprian, Basil, and Hierome, by whom (he saith) it may be gathered, that the godly brought with them, a fine linnen cloth, or a pretie boxe to carie it home. I finde the sacramentall breade in some old writers of credite, caried in a cloth or a wicker basket, but I remember not any pretie boxe. For they had not such pretie cakes sixe hundreth yeres after Christ, as M. Heskins imagineth the pretie boxe serued to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them in. In the superstitious Dialogues of Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 56. we reade of two cakes called <hi>Coronae,</hi> which should haue bene giuen to a poore man in almes, for his seruice done in the Bathe, but this supposed poore man being a ghost, desiered that the same might be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Masse to redeeme him out of that his purgatorie: Out of this fable which Gregorie rehearseth, this truth is proued, that the breade they saide Masse withall at that time, was so great, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two of these cakes wold giue a poore man his dinner at the least: for two of the Popish singing cakes would haue done him small pleasure for his bodily reliefe, for which at the first it was meant to be bestowed. But let vs heare Tertullian, who writing to his wife, and dissuading her from marrying with an Infidel after his death, saith thus: <hi>Non sciet maritus quid secretò ante omnem cibum gustes? Et si sciuerit panem non illum credet esse, qui dicitur. Shall not thy husband knowe what thou doest secretely eate before all meate? And if he knowe it to bee breade, hee will
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:14727:234"/>
not beleeue it to bee that breade, which it is saide to bee.</hi> I passe ouer howe M. Heskins hath corrupted Tertullian by false pointing, howe be it he can gather nothing of this place, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> superstitious receiuing of women in corners, and that in time of persecution. But their superstition proueth neither sole receiuing to be good, &amp; much lesse priuate Masse to be lawfull. That this custome was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious and naught, M. Heskins can not deny, for it was abolished by ancient councels, and the Papistes them selues do not obserue it, nor suffer it to be vsed, else why send they not ouer their consecrated cakes to their frends, as they doe their <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> their graines of the Trinitie, and such other gaudes and bables? But Saint Basil hee weeneth giueth a notable testimonie, who writing to a Gentlewoman called Caesaria Patritia, which feared to touch the sacrament with her owne hande, saith thus. <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municare per singulos dies &amp;c. To communicate euery day, &amp; to participate of the holy body and bloud of Christ, it is a godly thing and very profitable, as hee saith manifestly. Hee that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, hath life eternall. For who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but the often participation of life, is nothing else but many ways to liue? Wherefore we communicate foure times in euery weeke: On Sunday and Wednesday, on Friday and Saturday, and on other dayes, if there be the memorie of any Saint. But that it is no gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous thing, that any man should be constrained by necessitie in times of persecution, when the Priest or the Minister is not present, to take the Communion with his owne hand, it is superfluous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, for so much as it is by the very vse of the thing confirmed by a long custome. For all they that lead a solitarie life in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse where there is no Priest, keeping the Communion at home, doe receiue it of them selues. But in Alexandria and in Aegypt, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them which are of the people for the most part, hath the Communion in his owne house. For after the Priest hath consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sacrifice and distributed it, we must beleeue worthily to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate and receiue it. For in the Church the Priest giueth part, &amp; he which receiueth it, taketh it with all libertie, and putteth it to his mouth with his owne hand. Therfore it is the same in vertue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any man take one part of the Priest, or many parts together.</hi>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:14727:234"/>
Here M. Heskins vrgeth, that euery man in his own house receiued the sacrament in time of persecution. But this proueth not a sole receiuing, if priuate men haue the Communion in their house, for they might receiue many together. But concerning the Hermites that dwelled in dens &amp; caues alone, he saith they could haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, and therevpon insulteth against the proclamer, for saying the Indians, Arabians, Armenians, Grecians, &amp;c. neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued nor vsed the priuat Masse. And hath he proued the priuate Masse by the receiuing of the Hermites, which were Lay men, and no Priests? No forsooth. For he is feine to fasifie the wordes of this epistle in translating, to proue that they receiued alone. The wordes are in Greeke thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. in Latine <hi>a se ipsis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municant.</hi> Which he turneth falsly. They communicate by them selues, as though they did receiue it alone, whereas he should say, they receiue the Communion of them selues, that is one of an other, for it is well knowne, they were not so solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but they had meetings at sometimes, as appeareth by the histories. As for other things that M. Heskins noteth out of this place, bicause they are noted and aunswered in other partes, where some of these sentences are alledged, I will spend no time in repeating of them here. Only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of this fragment of an Epistle, which is not extant in al S. Basils workes, I giue the reader to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that it may be doubted of what antiquitie it is, whether it were written by the ancient Basilius surnamed the great, or by some other of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name of much later time. Next is brought in Hieronyme, to testifie that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like hath ben vsed in Rome in his time, in time of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uel why M. Hes. addeth in time of persecution, for in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes time there was no such persecution at Rome, &amp; he speaketh not of it as a shift in time of persecution, but as a custome in time of peace. Belike M. Hes. would haue the custome excused by necessitie of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he can not allow to be good of it self. But what saith <hi>Hier. ad Iouin. Apoll. Scio Romae hanc esse consuetudinem &amp;c. I I know this custome is at Rome, that the faithfull do always receiue
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:14727:235"/>
the body of Christ, which thing I do neither reprehend nor allowe. For euery one aboundeth in his owne sense. But I appeale to their conscience, which the same day after carnall copulation do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and as Persuis saith, purge the night with water: Why dare they not goe to the Martyrs? Why come they not into the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? Is Christe one in the publique place, an other in the priuate houses? That which is not lawful in the church, is not lawful at home. Nothing is hid from God, yea, the very darknesse is bright with him. Therefore let euery man examine him selfe, and so let him come to the body of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here hee vrgeth that the people did communicate in their houses sometimes, namely after companie with their wiues, when they durst not come to Church. But this custome doth Hierom seuerely reproue, &amp; would not haue them communicate, but when they might come to the Church without scruple of conscience. So that Maister Hesk. bringeth in an vnlawfull custome, to proue his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse to be lawfull, which yet is neuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neerer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this custome were good: for therby is not proued so much as sole receiuing, nor reseruation as we haue shewed before, bicause nothing appeareth to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but that they might haue the Priest to consecrate and minister to them at home. As for the admonition he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to married persons, to abstaine from companie with their wiues &amp;c. I passe it ouer, as not worthie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rehearsal.

there was a number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cleargie which always did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate: although none of the people would receiue, as was proued before by the ancient canons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called of the Apostles. And where as you labour to proue, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse was not in vain, although no man did receiue with the Priest, because the Masse had two ends: the one of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the other of receyuing, so that although it were in vain in respect of the receiuing, yet it was not in vaine in respect of oblation, I pray you look back again to Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostoms words, &amp; see if he do not say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was done in vaine, whiche you labour moste to proue could not bee in vaine, namely <hi>Frustra habetur quotidiana oblatio,</hi> The dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offring or sacrifice (as you turne it) is done in vaine. For make what respectes you can, the oblation is in vaine to them that do not receiue it. And where you would proue that Chrysostome saide Masse, though no man receiue with him, because he saith: <hi>Nemo est qui parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipet:</hi> There is no man to participate: you may as well say that Chrysostome himselfe did not participate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saith generally no man, and then he sayde no Masse by your owne rule, for you holde it necessarie that the priest himselfe should receiue. But to shewe that Chrysostome meaneth not generally as the worde soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that none of the people did communicate, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the whole circumstance of his discourse in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sermon. <q>For immediately before the wordes cited by M.

Quomodo cum manseris, de mensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ista non participas?

Seeing thou hast tarried, how hast thou not participated of this table? Thou sayest, I am vnworthie: therefore thou art vnworthie of that communion, which is in prayers.</q> By this place it is manifest, that a great number did alwayes receiue, although many did refraine. And that Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes communion was nothing like a priuate Masse, mumbled in a corner, (as M. Heskins most impudently affirmeth,) but such a one, as all the people sung hymnes together at it, and they were counted wicked and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which stoode by and did not communicate. <q>Finally that Chrysostome compted it not lawfull for any to be present, which did not communicate, he saith also: <hi>Post acta mysteria accedere licet ac videre: praesentibus verò mysterij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:14727:236"/>
Thus Chrysostome you see maketh nothing for the priuate Masse, but altogether against it. His next argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of Serapion, who being sick at the point of death, for his comfort, (because he had beene excommunicated) desired to receiue, at which time the minister was also sicke, which should haue receiued with him, and therfore sent him the sacrament by his boy. So that here is a case of extreame and double necessitie, for sole receiuing, to proue what might lawfully be done where no necessitie vrgeth: <hi>Euseb. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 34.</p>
                  <p>Concerning S. Augustines priest, that saide Masse in a priuate house, to driue away spirits, we shal heare more in the next Chapter. After this followeth the counterfet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Soter, that no priest should say Masse except two were present to aunswere him, when he saith <hi>Dominus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum,</hi> which yet the Popish priestes doe not obserue, for they say Masse, when they haue but one boy with them, or their Parish clearke, and sometimes perhaps none at al. Here saith M. Heskins some are commaunded to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but none are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. An argument like the authoritie of the decree, howbeit if a man would stand to reason w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, there is like cause, why they should communicate, as why they should be present, for as the priest saith: The Lorde be with you, therefore two must be present: so he saith of the sacrament, <hi>Quod sumpsimus,</hi> which we haue receiued, which is not true, when he onely hath receiued. To this decree, he ioyneth a Canon of the councell of Agatha. Wherein the people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to heare Masse euerie Sonday, and to tarrie to the end, but they are not commanded to communicate.</p>
                  <p>First I aunswere this Canon is not found in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient recordes, as Peter Crabbe honestly confesseth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, where it is found, it is <hi>Missas die Dominico secularibut tenere,</hi> which signifieth, that seculer men are commanded to frequent the assemblies, (for so <hi>Missae</hi> of olde time did signifie,) for which Maister Heskins turneth it, <hi>Missas tota<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:14727:237"/>
he bringeth out the councel of Orleans: <hi>That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should not departe before the solemnitie of the Masse be ended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which proue not a priuate Masse: for either they meant, that the people should communicate that were present, or else at the least the Cleargie receiued with the Bishop. For long after the time of these councels, it was decreed, that al persons both men and women should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euerie Sonday. <q>As Matisconense. 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Decerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus vt omnibus diebus Dominicis, altaris oblatio ab omnibus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; mulieribus offeratur tam panis, quam vini: vt per has immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationes &amp; peccatorum suorum fascibus careant &amp; cum Abel vel caeteris iustè offerentibus promereantur esse consortes.</hi> We decree that euerie sunday, the oblation of the altar be offered of all persons men and women, both of bread and wine: that by these offrings, they may be loosed of the bandes of their sinnes, and with Abel and the rest offering righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, they may be worthie to be companions.</q>

                     </note>First M. Hesk. compareth himselfe with Helias, which challenged the Priests of Baal to shewe a miracle, so he challengeth the Lutherans and sacramentaries to bring forth first some miracle. But he could neuer heare of any sauing one, and that was of Luther, which he reporteth of himselfe (as he saith) in his Booke of the priuate Masse,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:14727:237"/>
and as Prateolus sayeth, in his Booke <hi>De Missa Angulari,</hi> but where it is written I could neuer yet finde, though I haue made some searche for it. Luther reporteth that the Diuell awaked him out of his sleepe at midnight, and disputed with him that the priuate Masse is horrible idolatrie, &amp;c. For any thing that I can perceiue, by the wordes cited by Maister Heskins, there is no miracle at al spoken of by Luther, but only he confesseth what inward temptations of Sathan he susteined, for saying priuate Masse, by the space of 15. yeares together. Which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes after their accustomed synceritie doe interprete, as though he boasted of a miracle, as though he were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by the diuell, to forsake the priuate Masse, as a thing abominable. But Luther in deede in this booke written against the priuate Masse, vtterly reiecteth all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that are alledged to mainteine false doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the worde of God, and namely those miracles that are reported to haue beene done, to confirme the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of the priuate Masse, which either were feigned (as a great number were) or else wrought by the sleight of Sathan, to establish idolatrie, as in all Heathen nations, the diuell hath thus wrought miracles to confirme the people in their errours.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore we are to iudge of miracles, that they are euen as the doctrine, for which they are alledged, so that if Maister Heskins can not proue his priuate Masse, and other heresies by scripture, they will be made neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse by miracles. But let vs heare in order, what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful miracles he alledgeth. First a feigned fable out of a counterfet writer called Amphilochius, that a Iewe sawe in Saint Basils hand a childe diuided. Then a tale out of Vituspatium of as good authoritie as <hi>Legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Aurea,</hi> that the sacramente was turned into blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die fleshe to a doubting olde man. Next out of Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <hi>Libro</hi> 2. <hi>Contra Donat.</hi> That dogges after they had eaten the sacrament, caste vnto them by the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, ranne madde and werried their Maisters.</p>
                  <p>Which last might be a true &amp; iust punishment of God
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:14727:238"/>
against the Donatistes, for their heresie, yet proueth it not that the dogges did eate the body of Christe, which God forbid that any Christian man should thinke. Another miracle is reported by S. Augustine, <hi>Lib.</hi> 22. <hi>De ciuitate. Dei Cap.</hi> 8. That one of his priestes saying Masse in a house, that was molested with the power of the diuell, deliuered the house from such disquietnesse. This belike is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the priuate Masse. But that proueth nothing. For Augustine in that place nameth no Masse: he saith, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered there the sacrifice of the bodie of Christe, praying that the house might be deliuered from that molestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so it came to passe. Now it is nothing credible, that he offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d that sacrifice alone, but that the owner of the house and all his familie did there communicate with him, and therefore here is nothing to helpe the priuate Masse in this miracle.</p>
                  <p>Next vnto this, interlacing certeine sentences of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde of the vertue of the sacrament, he returneth to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and then telleth a tale out of Paule the Deacon, of a noble woman of Rome for whom S. Gregorie by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, turned the sacramental bread into the fourme of <hi>A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bloudie fleshly litle finger.</hi> A faire miracle I promise you, but if it had beene true, Gregorie that was so light of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, to beleeue and report so many miracles, would haue written it him selfe. But Gregorie, though otherwise full of superstition, was not yet come to the carnall manner of presence. Two miracles are rehearsed of his reporte, one of a prisoner that was deliuered out of his chaynes, when Masse was saide for him by his wiues procurement, supposing he had ben dead. Gregorie in deede speaketh of sacrifices, whiche perhaps were prayers, and not the Masse. But if he speake of that prophanation of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that in his time tooke some strength, to offer it for the dead, yet he speaketh of another maner of offring, then the Papistes vse. For thereof he saith, in the same place as Maister Heskins confesseth: <hi>Hinc ergo, &amp;c. Of this decree brethren gather you certeinely, how great a band of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in vs the holie sacrifice offered by our owne selues, is able to
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:14727:238"/>
loose, if beeing offered for another it could in another loose the bandes of the body.</hi> These wordes declare, the sacrifice was such as euerie one might offer for himselfe, which coulde not be the sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse, which only the priest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth. The last miracle is of Agapetus, that by giuing the sacrament to a dumb man, restored him to his speech.</p>
                  <p>Admitting this to be true, it maketh nothing for the carnal manner of presence, which the Church of Rome at that time had not receiued. And although such miracles might now be wrought by Papistes, we would giue no more credite vnto them, then they could winne by Gods worde: for so we are taught by God him sefe. Irenaeus a moste auncient writer of great credite testifieth, <hi>Lib. Cap.</hi> 9. that Marcus the heretike by his sorcerie caused the wine in the cup at his ministration to appeare purple and redde like bloud, that the people might thinke, that Christ dropped his bloud into his cup through his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: likewise he wrought so cunningly, that he multiplied the wine, so that out of a litle cruse, he filled a great pot, so ful that it ranne ouer. But the Church of God was not moued by these lying miracles, to giue credite to his false doctrine, or to think that he had the bloud of Christ in his challice for all that counterfet shewe of bloud, which he made: no more wil we beleue the Papistes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending miracles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the word of God. And as for diuers of these miracles, which he alledgeth to confirme the dignitie of the Masse, they were done, or at least said to be done, before the Masse was throughly shapen, and therfore if they be true, yet they confirme not the doctrin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse, which was afterward inuented. Finally wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he vrgeth the proclaymer to bring one miracle, for the confirmation of his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although it were an easie matter to bring foorth many signes of more certeintie, and better credite then the Papists can bring any, shewed by God since the restitution of the Gospell: yet because our doctrine is the same, that was confirmed by all the miracles of Christ and his Apostles, we seeke no confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof by later miracles, but onely by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                     </note>The recapitulation conteining nothing but that, which is confuted in the discourse at large, I will omitte it, and come to the conference, that the Bishop made betweene the liturgie falsely ascribed to S. Iames, and the Popishe Masse, beeing content for the time to call it Saint Iames Masse, as Maister Heskins doth, although neither it is a Masse, nor such as it is, was it writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by S. Iames the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, but by some of much later time as appeareth by the prayer therein conteined, for such as liue in Monasteries, and other thinges fauouring of the errours of that time, in which it was written. <hi>The first point of the conference is, that S. Iames saide Masse in the common tong vnderstoode of the people, the Papistes say Masse in a straunge tonge.</hi> M. Heskins answereth, that this point toucheth not the substance: for the Masse may be good, though it be not vnderstood: but he himselfe maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the Masse, to be of the substance of it, wherefore seeing there lacketh doctrine in the Masse, there lacketh one of the foure substantiall partes. But he would make the reading of the epistle and Gospel in Latine Doctrine, and good doctrine. What doctrine that is, by which the people are not taught, let reasonable men iudge, for although all the Masse were nothing but scripture, yet it were not good to be read in the Church, in a straunge tong: 1. Cor. 14. because it were not profitable for edifying. His childish sophismes of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, his substance and his accidents, I disdaine to rehearse: the trueth is manifest.</p>
                  <p>The second comparison <hi>S. Iames spake out of the words of consecration. They in their Masse suppresse them and keepe them close.</hi> Maister Heskins aunswereth, this is a small fault, and from the Masse of S. Iames, flyeth to S. Basils Masse, Where it is said, the Bishop prayeth secretly, yet he spake the wordes (as they call them) of consecration openly. The thirde comparison <hi>S. Iames in his Masse ministred the communion to the people, The Papists in their Masse, receiue them
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:14727:240"/>
selues alone.</hi> To this he aunswereth, denying that S. Iames did always minister the communion to the people, which is an impudent shift, except he will denie the fourme of that liturgie, which prescribeth the ministration to the people after the consecration. His reason is, because in Chrysostomes liturgie, which was written more then a thousand yeares after S. Iames, and falsely beareth the name of Chrysostome, there is a rule what the priest shall doe when there are no communicants.</p>
                  <p>The fourth comparison: <hi>S. Iames ministred the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to the people vnder both kindes: The Papists in their Masse in one kinde onely.</hi> Here hath he none other refuge, but to say, that S. Iames did not alwayes minister vnder both kindes. Then let him denie the credite of the liturgie, which prescribeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion to be ministred in both kindes.</p>
                  <p>The fift comparison: <hi>Saint Iames preached and set foorth the death of Christ: They in their Masse haue onely a number of dumbe gestures and ceremonies, which they themselues vnderstand not, and make no manner of mention of Christes death.</hi> M. Hes. complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the Bishops repetitions, imputing them to want of stuffe, when he himselfe moste absurdly repeateth his three vntruthes surmised to be in this assertion, which he set downe before in the 39. Chapter, whither I referre the Reader for the answere. Only this I wil note, that he can finde no other preaching to the people, but the Aulbe to signifie the white garment that Christe was sent in from Herode: the vestiment, the garment that he was mocked in, in the house of Pilate: the Crosse vpon the vestiment signifieth the crosse of Christe which he did beare, as the priest doth on his backe: the eleuation signifieth the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of Christe on the crosse: he might say by as good reason, the Priests hands signified the two theeues, &amp; the Priest himselfe the tormentors, that did lift him vp to the crosse. Beholde this is the preaching of Christes death in the Masse, whether it be an impudent vntruth, (as Maister Heskins tearmeth it) to call these dumbe gestures and ceremonies, or M. Heskins an impudent beast to defend
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:14727:241"/>
these dombe signes for preaching of Christes death, let the reader in Gods name consider and iudge. The sixth comparison: <hi>S. Iames Masse was full of knowledge: their Masse is full of ignorance.</hi> M. Heskins aunswereth, that there is as much knowledge in their Masse, as in S. Iames Masse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in substance it is all one: which if it were true, as it is most false, yet what knowledge can be, when al is done in a strange language, and no preaching, but by dombe signes, as we heard before? The seuenth: <hi>S. Iames Masse was full of consolation: their Masse is full of superstition.</hi> To this he aunswereth, they haue as much consolation, which cannot be when they haue no preaching of the Gospel: &amp; how can he say that they haue no superstition, when they haue an hundred idle ceremonies and gestures, which Christ neuer instituted, and therfore are meere will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and superstition. The eyghth comparison, he saith, is all one with the third: <hi>that the people resorted to receiue the communion, when S. Iames sayed Masse.</hi> Although it followe of the thirde, yet is it not all one with it, for as S. Iames was readie to minister, so the people ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were readie to receiue, which is not looked for of the popish priestes, because they reach them that it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse so to doe. The last comparison: <hi>Saint Iames in his Masse had Christes institution: they in their Masse haue well more nothing else but mans inuention.</hi> To this he aunswereth, that they haue Christes institution for their Masse, which is an impudent falshood, either for their carnall maner of presence, or for their sacrifice, or for their priuate recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or for their depriuing the people of all doctrine, but such as is by dombe signes, which he is not afrayde to ascribe to the inuention of the holy Ghost, as though the spirite of God in ceremonies, would be contrary to him selfe in the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>After this he reporteth the substantiall differences, betweene the Masse, and the newe communion as he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, which because they be all set foorth and aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before in the 34.35.36.

The solution of the first argument is, that the receipt of the sacrament is not a memoriall of Christes bodie, but of his death and passion. This is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble distinction, but when Christ sayeth: do this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of mee, whether is the remembrance of Christe, the remembrance of his bodie, or onely of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall act of his dying and suffering, which is past? I think all Christian men will confesse, that the communion is a memoriall of Christ that was crucified, and not of his crucifying onely. But when Saint Paul sayeth: <hi>vntill he come,</hi> how can he say that he is present in bodie, which is yet to come in bodie? To the seconde argument he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, that Saint Paule calleth it breade, as Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth bread his flesh, and therfore he calleth it, this bread, signifying a speciall bread. No man sayeth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but that it is a speciall bread (and as Saint Augustine sayeth) after a certeine manner the bodie of Christe. But if Maister Heskins in this place may denye breade to bee taken in the proper sence for breade, why doth hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame against them, that in these wordes: This is my body, denye the worde body, to be taken in the proper signification thereof, for a naturall bodie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:14727:242"/>But let vs take Maister Heskins interpretation of bread, to signifie the bodie of Christe, then the sense of Saint Paules wordes shalbe this: As often as ye eat of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, and drinke his bloud, you shall shewe the Lordes death vntil he come. How is he that is to come distinct from him that is present? for Saint Paule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an exposition of this breade &amp; this cuppe which are present, to shewe the Lordes death, that is to come. But let vs heare what Saint Ieronyme sayeth, that may helpe him <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Ideo hoc, &amp;c. Therefore our Sauiour hath deliuered this sacrament, that by it we might alwayes remember, that he dyed for vs. For therefore also when we receiue it, wee are warned of the priestes, that it is the bodie and bloud of Christ, that we might not be thought vnthankefull for his benefites.</hi> I like this saying verie well, which teacheth that the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is therefore called the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might be put in minde of the benefite of Christes death, to be thankfull for it. <q>And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his meaning is none otherwise, his owne wordes shal declare, going both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after. Vpon these wordes: <hi>Gratias egit, &amp;c. Hoc est benedicens etiam passurus vltimam nobis commemorationem sine memoriam dereliquit. Quemadmodum si quis peregre profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscens, aliquod pignus ei quem diligit derelinquat, vt quotiescun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que illud viderit, possit eius beneficia &amp; amicitias memorare: quod ille si perfectè dilexit, sine ingenti desiderio non potest videre vel fletu.</hi> That is blessing or giuing thankes, euen when hee was to suffer, he left to vs his last commemoration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. Euen as a man going into a farre countrey, doth leaue some pledge to him whome he loueth, that so often as he seeth it, he may remember his benefites and frendship, which pledge he (if he loued perfectly) cannot beholde without great desire or weeping.</q> In these words you see S. Hierom compareth the sacrament to a pledge, which is left in remembrance of loue &amp; benefites recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him, that in person is absent. <q>The same writer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same words of our text <hi>donec venerit</hi> vntill he come, thus writeth: <hi>Tam diu memoria opus est, donec ipse venire dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur</hi>: So long we haue neede of a remembraunce, vntill

he him selfe vouchesafe for to come. Nothing can bee more plaine to shewe his meaning, not to be of a carnall or bodilie presence:</q> although as Christ hath giuen vs the president, he call the bread and cuppe by the name of the bodie and bloud of Christe. The testimonie of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact being a Greeke Gentleman of the lower house, I haue hetherto refused to admitt, and therefore in this place also will not trouble the reader with him.

Maister Hesk. sayeth, in steede of that S.

But either Maister Heskins note booke serued him not, or els his malice against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth would not suffer him to see what the same Basil writeth not many lines before these wordes, which he citeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rehearsall of the wordes of Christ, of the institution

Heskins denyeth the sacrament to be a remembrance of Christe, for feare he shoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christ to be absent, affirming it is a remembrance only of the death of Christ. But Basil saith, that in eating and drinking we must remember Christe that is dead &amp; risen againe for vs, and so be transformed into his image by mortification and newnesse of life. This is all the profite that Basil gathereth of the institution of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lorde. Where is then the carnall presence, the sacrifice propitiatorie, the application of it according to the priestes intention, and such like monsters of the Masse? The testimonie of Rupertus a burgesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer house I will not stand vpon, notwithstanding it little helpeth Maister Heskins cause. For he doth not say, that the sacrament is so a remembrance of Christes death, that it is not a remembrance of Christ him selfe. But Maister Heskins sayeth, all the rable of sacramentaries cannot bring one couple of catholike authors, that saye Saint Paule spake here of materiall bread, neither can Maister Heskins bring one single auncient writer, within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the challenge, which is 600. yeres after Christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> denyeth that S.

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:14727:243"/>
Basil, but neither of them denie it, as for Theophylact &amp; Rupertus, although neyther of them also denye it, in the places by him cited, yet I knowe not why we might not as well produce Berengarius and Bertrame, as auncient as they, which affirme that Saint Paule spake here of bread. But that there is materiall bread in the sacrament, as the earthly part thereof, we haue already cited Irenaeus <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 34. Origen <hi>in</hi> 15. <hi>Matthaei.</hi> Cyrill <hi>in Ioan. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. and many other.</p>
                  <p>Toward the end of this Chapter, Maister Heskins ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him to aunswere an obiection of Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, who iustly chargeth the Papistes of wilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in that they make the body of Christ, both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, and the thing exemplified, the figure and the thing figured, the signe and the thing signified, whereas relation must be betwixt two thinges distincted, and not of one thing to it selfe, bycause euery relatiue must haue a correlatiue. For aunswere to this obiection, hee saith hee will not vse the quiddities of the schooles, but plaine examples: but hee pretendeth quiddities where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is plaine, &amp; his examples be mere sophistications. The first is, <hi>That in the diuine presence be sundrie relations, grounded vpon the one nature of God.</hi> Therefore relation must not be of necessitie betwixt two things distinct. A wise example, as though the persons betweene which there is relation, be not two distinct thinges, though they be one vndiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded GOD: There is relation betweene the person of the Father and the person of the Sonne, therefore the Father is not the Sonne, nor the Sonne is the Father, yet are they both with the holy Ghost one God.</p>
                  <p>The second example, <hi>Christ being transfigured in the mount, &amp; shewing him self in a glorious maner, was an exemplar or figure of him selfe nowe in glory, and of his glorious comming.</hi> It is well that he fleeth out of the schooles, before he vttereth these absurdities, for surely euery boy in Cambridge, that hath but once kept sophisme, would hisse at him for this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he confoundeth the substaunce with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. But to leaue the schoole termes which M. Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:14727:244"/>
can not nowe abide, bicause they bewray his follie: I deny that Christes body then, was a figure or exemplar of his body now, but the glory of his body then, was a figure of his glory now, and wherewith he shall come: and I am sure hee will confesse, that they be two distinct thinges, for his glory nowe, is greater then the brightnesse of the Sunne, wherevnto it was then compared. Likewise to his third example I answere, denying <hi>That his immortall body which he shewed to Thomas, with the signes and tokens of his woundes, was an exemplare of the same body both mortall and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> I say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, his immortall body was no exemplar of his mortall body, but euen the very same, chaunged in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not in substance, and the signes of his woundes, were signes of his passion, and they were two distinct things.</p>
                  <p>It is all one that hee citeth out of Chrysostome, that Christe shall come to iudgement with the signes of his passion: wherevpon he gathereth, <hi>That Christes body shall then be a signe memoriall or exemplar of it selfe.</hi> The scripture saith, they shall see him whome they haue perced, but whether with signes of woundes, I dare not say, sauing Chrysostomes authoritie, but admit he shall come with the same print of woundes, yet I deny that his body shall be a figure, exemplar, or memoriall of it selfe, but those signes should be an argument of their crueltie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse that crucified him. You see the plainnesse of these examples, howe they are plainely against him, and that it still remaineth vnremouable, that a signe and the thing signified, be distinct things. Therefore the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a signe, figure, exemplar, and memoriall of the body and bloud of Christ is not the same after a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall manner.</p>

bloud of the Lorde.</hi> M. Heskins requireth to the worthie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing two things, faith, and charitie, and therefore he concludeth, that neither heretikes nor scismatikes can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue worthily, which we confesse to be true. Afterward he chargeth vs with abusing this text in two points: The one, that we affirme material bread to remaine after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, the other that we deny that wicked men can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the body and bloud of Christ, and both these errors he promiseth to confute, but in the end you shal see they be so assured truthes, that all the smoake and mist of his confutation can not darken the light of their veritie. The first witnesse he citeth for interpretation of the text, is S. Cyprian, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 15. <hi>Illi contra Euangelij legem &amp;c. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lawe of the Gospell, and your honourable petition, before repentance shewed, before open confession made of a most grieuous and extreme offence, before hands laid on by the Bishop and the cleargie vnto repentance, are so bolde as to offer for them, and giue them the Eucharistie, that is, to prophane the holy body of our Lord, seeing it is written, Whosoeuer shall eate of the bread, and drinke of the cup of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> Of these wordes M. Heskins gathereth, that the body of Christe is deliuered, and not materiall bread, for if materiall bread, and not the body is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then the bread is prophaned, and not the body. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per collection. If the Kings seale for a benefite be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Kings enimie or a traitour, that receiueth it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently and vnthankfully, is not the King iniuried, and his fauour abused? I thinke al wise men wil graunt, and not say the waxe and parchment only is iniuried and abused, bicause the Kings body is not deliuered, but waxe and parchment. Moreouer, I maruell howe M. Heskins can auoyd blasphemie, when he saith in the literall sense, the body of Christe is prophaned or vnhallowed, for to speake properly, the body of Christe can not be propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or vnhallowed, but the sacrament of his body which beareth the name thereof may, and the abuse of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is iustly counted an iniurie vnto his body and bloud, whereof it is a sacrament, although his body in

For when the Lorde calleth bread, which is made one by the gathering together of many cornes, his body, hee declareth our people which he did beare to be vnited together. And when he calleth wine, which is pressed out of many clusters and grapes, and so gathered into one, his bloud, hee doth likewise signifie our flocke, coupled together by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of the multitude that is brought into one. Here you see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread which is now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, and is called the body of Christe, to be made of many graines: likewise the wine to be pressed out of many grapes, by which nothing can be vnderstoode, but materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bread and wine.</q>

Here bread made of meale and water, is called the body of Christ, therefore material bread.</q> The next autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie M.

How be it, no such thing followeth of these words, for though Chrysostome deliuer the body of Christ, it followeth not that they receiue it which receiue the sacrament vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, which is as much as to refuse it. Chrysostome in the same Homely, saith, this sacrament to be a symbole and signe of Christ crucified, and speaking of the cup, he saith: <q>
                        <hi>Sed cuius gratia non aquam sed vinum post resurrectionem bibit? Perniciosam quandam hęresim radicitus euellere voluit eorum, qui aqua in mysterijs vtuntur, ita vt ostenderet quia &amp; quando hoc my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterium traderet, vinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tradidit, &amp; iam post resurrectionem in nuda mysterij mensa, vino vsus est. Ex germine autem, ait, vitis, quae certè vinum non aquam producit.</hi> But wherefore did hee not drinke water but wine after his resurrection? Hee would plucke vppe by the rootes a certaine most pernicious heresie of them which vse water in the mysteries, so that he would shew, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both when he deliuered this mysterie, he deliuered wine, &amp; nowe after his resurrection in the bare table of the mysterie, he vsed wine. And he saith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vine, which truly bringeth foorth wine &amp; not water.</q> Now compare these two sayings of Chrysost. in one ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: Christ deliuered wine, Chrysost. would not deliuer the body &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; see whether the later proue any transubstantiation or carnall manner of presence. Besides this, it is good to note that Chrysostome saith, that Christ vsed wine in the sacrament after his resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contrarie to all the Papistes, which holde that he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to the two disciples at Emaus in bread only. And bicause M. Heskins vrgeth the deliuerie of Christes body to the wicked, and thereby will gather, that the wic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the very body of Christe, let him heare also what Chrysostome saith in the same place, speaking of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy comming to the sacrament: <q>
                        <hi>Illud enim pessimum est, ficus Paulus ait, Christum conculcare, &amp; testamenti sanguinem du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:14727:246"/>
communem, &amp; spiritus gratian contemnere.</hi> For this is the worst thing that can be, as Paule saith, to tread Christe vnder feete, and to esteeme the bloud of the couenaunt as vncleane, and to contemne the grace of the spirite.</q> Will he say that very body of Christe is troden vnder the feete of the vnworthie receiuer? <q>And bicause he standeth so much of the word, body and bloud, Chrysostome saith further. <hi>Nullus communicet, nisi ex discipulis sit: nullus impuro a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo sicut Iudas, panem assumat, ne similia patiatur. Corpus Christi etiam hęc multitudo est: quare cauendum tibi est qui hęc mysteria ministras, ne Dominum irrites, corpus hoc non purgando, ne acutum gladium pro cibo praebeas.</hi> Let none communicate except he be of the disciples: Let no man with an vnpure minde as Iudas, receiue the bread, least he suffer the like punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Euen this multitude also is the body of Christe: wherefore thou that doest minister these mysteries, must take heede, that thou prouoke not the Lorde, by not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this body, least thou deliuer a sharpe sword in steed of meat.</q> In this saying, let the indifferent reader obserue, that Iudas receiued bread, and wicked men receiue bread: that the multitude of Christians is the body of Christe, as the sacrament is: finally, that the minister to a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man deliuereth a sharpe sword in steede of spirituall meate: and let him iudge, howe honestly M. Heskins vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the deliuerie of the body and bloud of Christ to the wicked, to exclude bread, and to proue that they receiue the very body of Christ.</p>

Christe may be receiued of euill men. But all men will confesse, that this is an Alegoricall and figuratiue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking, that Origen vseth, and may be wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode according to the rule of sacraments: which beare the names of those things whereof they be sacramentes.

                     <hi>Quoniam Deus in lege &amp;c. For so much as God in the lawe hath ordained so great a paine against him, that in his vncleannesse dare touch the holy things, (for it is written to them figuratiuely, but for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement:) And the Lord saide vnto Moses, say to Aaron and his sonnes, that they take heede to the holy things of the children of Israel, and they shall not defile my name what so euer they sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to me, I am the Lorde. Say to them and to their families, Euery man that is of your seede, and commeth to the holy things, what so euer the children of Israel shall sanctifie vnto the Lord and his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse be vpon him, that soule shall be rooted out of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, I am the Lord. Such threatnings are set foorth against them, that only come to those thinges, that are sanctified by men. But what shall a man say against him, which dare be bolde against so greate and such a mysterie? For looke howe much greater a thing then the temple is here, according to the Lords saying, by so much the more greeuous and fearefull it is, in the filthinesse of his soule, to touch the body of Christ, then to touch Rammes or Bulles (for so the Apostle hath saide) wherefore he that eateth the bread, and drinketh the cup of the Lorde vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body and bloud
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:14727:247"/>
of the Lorde. But more vehemently and also more horribly, he doth set foorth and declare the condemnation by repetition, when hee saith: Let euery man examine him selfe, and so let him eat of this bread, and drinke of this cup. For he that eateth and drinketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh his condemnation, not discerning the Lordes body. If then he that is onely in vncleannesse, (and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of vncleannesse we learne figured in the lawe) hath so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a iudgement, howe much more he that is in sinne, and presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth against the body of Christ, shall draw vnto him selfe horrible iudgement</hi>?</p>
                  <p>First, I will note M. Heskins falsifications, which are two, the one as it seemeth, partly of ignoraunce of the Greeke tong, partly of greedinesse to drawe Basils wordes to his vnderstanding, for where the Greeke is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Heere is a thing, or one greater then the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he turneth it, looke howe much greater this is then the temple, as though <hi>hic</hi> which is an Aduerbe, were a Pronoune. The other is altogether of malitious corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he translateth his Latine, <hi>Contra corpus Christi audet:</hi> which is, He dareth presume against the body of Christe, hee translateth it, Hee dareth to presume vpon the body of Christ, as though he receiued the body of Christe. Nowe he noteth two differences in these wordes of Basil, the one of the sacrifices of the olde lawe which were Bulles and Rammes, the other of the newe lawe, which is the body of Christ. But in the wordes of Basil, there is no mention of any sacrifice of the newe lawe, onely he compareth the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the olde lawe, with the heauenly part of the sacrament of the newe Testament, which we confesse to be the body and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The second difference is, the vncleannesse of the lawe made vnworthie partakers of the sacrifices, but deadly sin maketh men vnworthie receiuers of the body of Christe. Yet hath Basil no such wordes of receiuing the body of Christ by wicked men. Onely he denounceth their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishment, that presume against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, when with vnreuerence and vnrepentance, they presume against such and so high a mysterie, as the blessed sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:14727:247"/>
is, and this is the plaine sense of his wordes without any cauilling. If M. Heskins will vrge their touching of the body of Christ, it is a very nice point, and must either be referred to a figuratiue speach, or else it will breede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite absurdities. Basils mind is plaine, the wicked ought not to presume to touch the blessed sacrament, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certaine manner of speaking, is the body of Christe. But he annexeth an other place of Basil: <hi>Dominꝰ dicens &amp;c. The Lorde saying: Here is one greater then the temple, teacheth vs that he is so much more vngodly, that dare handle the body of our Lorde, which hath giuen him selfe for vs, to be an oblation and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of sweete sauour, by howe much the body of the onely begotten sonne of God exceedeth Rammes and Bulles, not in reason of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, for the excellencie is incomparable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This place saith Maister Heskins proueth well, that the receiuer of the sacrament receiueth the body of the onely begotten sonne of God, and not a bare figure, for else howe should hee sinne incomparably, by receiuing vnworthily? I aunswere, hee sinneth incomparably, not bicause he receiueth the body of Christe vnworthily, but bicause the body of Christe being offered vnto him to be receiued, he doth contemne it, &amp; refuse it most vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and iniuriously. Againe, Basil doth here compare the outward signes or elements of the old sacrifices, with the thing represented and offered by our sacrament, the like speaches he hath of Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>But that you may heare him (saith Maister Heskins) by most plaine wordes teach that the body of Christe is receiued of euill men, hearken what he saith, <hi>de baptism. lib</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Si verò is qui &amp;c. If he that for meate offendeth his brother, falleth from charitie, without the which both the workes of great giftes, and iustification do nothing auayle: What shall a man say of him, which idly and vnprofitably dare eate the body, and drinke the bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>?</p>
                  <p>But M. Heskins to make it seeme more plaine on his side, hath cut off those wordes which doe plainly declare, that Basil speaketh not of wicked men that are voyde of the spirite of God, but of such as be not zealous and
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:14727:248"/>
earnest ynough, to practise mortification, &amp; reuocation, therefore it followeth immediatly: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: And thereby much more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the holy spirite: which wordes being added to the former, doe plainely testifie, that Basill speaketh not of wicked and vngodly persons, but of the faithful in whom the spirite of God was, and yet they had not so great care of profiting in newnesse of life as they ought to haue. For against the wordes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, idly and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he opposeth afterwarde <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, earnestly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, so that those Aduerbes idly and vnprofitably, are spoken in comparison, and not simply, as if he saide, they take nothing such paines in mortification as they should, they profite nothing in comparison that they might by the Lordes body, which labour not to be renewed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his spirite, and as he saith, they grieue the spirit of God, (whereby they are sealed to eternall life,) when they doe not with more earnestnesse and profite come to the Lordes table.</p>
                  <p>The second Authour Hierome, is cited <hi>in Psal.</hi> 77. <hi>Haec de his &amp;c. These wordes are spoken of them which forsooke GOD after they had receiued Manna, For nowe in the Church, if any man be fed with the flesh and bloud of Christ, and doth decline to vices, let him knowe that the iudgement of God doth hang ouer him: as Paule the Apostle saith, He that shall take the body and bloud of our Lorde vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body and bloud of our Lorde.</hi> 
                     <q>I maruell what Maister Heskins meaneth, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wordes of Hierome, for he citeth them thus: <hi>Qui acceperit corpus &amp; sanguinem Domini indigne, reus erit corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini.</hi> Wheras the words of Hierome be. <hi>Qui acceperit corpus &amp; sanguinem Christi indignè iudicium sibi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis &amp; bibit.</hi> Hee that shall receiue the body and bloud of Christe vnworthily, receiueth and drinketh iudgement to him selfe.</q> To aunswere to the iudgement of GOD, which hee saide did hang ouer him, that after hee is fed with the body and bloud of Christe, declineth to vices: not meaning wicked reprobates, but Gods elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whiche are sometimes ingratefull to GOD for

Impedumtur &amp; nunc electo Ecclesiae, si ne ipsi quoque sacerdotes innocenter haec sacramenta percipiunt.</hi> And hee hindered the elect of Israel. The elect of the Church are nowe also hindered, if the Priestes them selues doe not receiue these sacraments innocently. In which wordes he sheweth the cause, that many of the elect do decline to vices, after the sacrament receiued, euen by the euill example of the Priestes, and therefore worthily are to be awaked out of the sleepe of sinne and securitie, by this sentence of Paul.</q> Nowe whereas M. Hes. excuseth S. Hierome, for altering the words of Paule, and in steede of the bread and the cup, placing the body and bloud of Christe, it is nothing so needfull, as that he should render a reason why hee doth him selfe alter the words of Hierome: except hee thinke he may be as bold to chaunge the wordes of Hierome, as Hierome was to chaunge the words of Paule. Although M. Hes. is lesse to blame in this place, where he chaungeth the words without any great alteration of the sense, then in almost an hundreth places beside, where hee falsifieth the wordes, and peruerteth the meaning also.</p>

Hes. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of these words, one that the body of Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the sacrament, the other, that euill men receiue the sacrament. Concerning the first, there is no doubt, but that the bodie of Christ is receiued in the sacrament
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:14727:249"/>
after a spirituall manner of faith, and touching the latter, this place proueth not, that wicked men receiue the body of Christ with their mouthes wherin is the controuersie: for neither doth Chrysost. here speake of reprobates, but of the faithfull that were sinners, which receiued Christes bodie in an vncleane conscience, &amp; not carnally with their mouthes. But admitte he did speake of reprobates and wicked persons, yet he speaketh of the sacramentes, that are called the bodie and bloud of Christ, and not of the natural bodie and bloud of Christ, and therefore he vseth the similitude of the Kinges purple, whereunto he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the sacrament. For euen as he that abuseth by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or defyling the Kings purple robe, though he touch not his person, yet is he punished as a traitour: so he that abuseth the sacrament, either as an open contemner, or as a prophane receiuer, is guiltie of the bodie and bloud of Christ. And to put the matter out of question he faith, not three lines before, speaking of the bloud of Christ: <q>
                        <hi>Qui huius sanguinis sunt participes, cum Angelis, &amp; Archangelis, &amp; supernis virtutibus commorantur, ipsam regiam Christi stolam induti spiritualibus armis muniti (sed nihil dixi) immo ipsum induti sunt regem.</hi> They that are partakers of this bloud, do dwell with Angels, &amp; Archangels, and the high powers, hauing put on the very royall robe of Christ, being armed with spiritual armour (but I haue said nothing) yea they haue put on the King himselfe.</q> By these words it is plaine, that euerie one that is partaker of the sacrament, is not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Heskins will bring forth other places of Chrysostome wherein he doeth plainely affirme, that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das the traitour did receiue the bodie of Christ with the other Apostles.

They that be consecrated to the diuine mysteries, knowe what I speake. And againe he tooke the cup and saide, This is my bloud, and Iudas was present when Christ spake these wordes:
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:14727:249"/>
This is my bloud. Say Iudas, whom hast thou solde for thirty pence? Is this the bloud for which thou hast made a bargaine before with the Pharisees: O the mercie of Christ! O the madnesse of Iudas! He bargained that he might sell him for thirtie pence, and Christ offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him the bloud which he hath solde, that he might haue forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, if he would not haue bene vngodly. For Iudas was present, and was partaker of that sacrifice.</hi> Here we see plainely that Christ offered his bloud to Iudas, that he might haue remission of sinnes, but no worde that Iudas receiued the bloud of Christ. It is saide, that Iudas was partaker of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sacrifice, that is of the outwarde sacrament (for so Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome often calleth it) but not of the bodie and bloud of Christ. And whereas Maister Heskins noteth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ offred the same bloud that Iudas solde, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sacrament is the naturall bloud of Christ, it is a most friuolous reason. For euerie childe vnderstandeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> selling of Christes bloud is a figure of betraying Christ, euen as the bloud whiche he offered is a figure of that, which was betrayed, and so the reason maketh altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against him. But Chrysostome hath other wordes in the same sermon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nullus igitur fictus accedat &amp;c. Therefore let no feigned person come: Let none be so bolde with a counterfet mind to come neere so great mysteries least he be condemned, deserue sentence, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that which Iudas suffered. For after the partaking of the table, the diuell entred into him, not because he despised the Lordes bodie, but because the impudencie of Iudas and the maliciousnesse of his minde, caused that the aduersarie dwelled in him.</hi> By these words M.H. would proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords body had entred into Iudas, before the diuel, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie may more probably be gathered: for Chrysost. answereth a secret obiection, that might be made vpon the appellation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ. It might seeme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel contemned the body of Christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he entred immediatly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ receiued, but he saith, he contemned not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ (for Iudas was so full of wickednes, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ entred not into him) but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel before had posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him. <q>And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is more agreable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of Chryso.

But sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his authoritie, is not the baptisme, wherewith wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are baptised, an vnspekable mysterie? and yet no wicked man in baptisme, receiueth the spirite of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <q>But Chrysostome proceedeth in the sentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged: <hi>Maius enim peccatum vtra<expan>

Now iudge whether Chrysostome doth plainely affirme, that Iudas receiued the bodie of Christ, with the other Apostles, or whether M. Heskins doth lye, that so affirmeth of Chrysostome and can no better proue it then you haue heard. Now followeth S. Aug. <hi>In Ep. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Donatist. post Collat. Quisquis autem, &amp;c. Who so euer shall liue wel in this church, other mens sinnes do nothing hinder him: for in it euerie one shall beare his owne burthen, as the Apostle saith: and whosoeuer shall eate the bodie of Christ vnworthily, eateth and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:14727:250"/>
drinketh iudgement to himselfe: for the Apostle him selfe hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this.</hi> In these wordes Augustine calleth the sacrament of the bodie of Christe, the bodie of Christ, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth immediately after: <q>
                        <hi>Cum autem dicit, iudicium sibi mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, satis oftendit, quia non alteri iudicium manducat sed sibi. Hoc nos egimus &amp; ostendimus &amp; obtinuimus, quia communio malorum non maculat aliquem participatione sacramentorum, sed consensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne factorum.</hi> And when he saith, he eateth iudgement to himselfe, he sheweth sufficiently that he eateth not iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another but to himselfe. This haue we treated, &amp; shewed and proued, that the fellowship of euill men doth not defile any man by participation of the sacramentes with them, but by consent of their deedes.</q> Likewise he tearmeth the sacrament by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the bodie of Christ. <hi>Cont. Donat. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Sicut enim &amp;c. As Iudas to whom our Lord gaue the morsel, gaue place himselfe to the diuell, not by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an euill thing, but by receiuing is amisse: so any man receiuing vnworthily the Lordes sacrament, causeth not, because he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is euill, that it should be euil, or because he receiueth it not to saluation, that he receiueth nothing. For it was neuerthelesse the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of our Lord, euen to them whom the Apostle saide: He that eateth &amp; drinketh vnworthily, eateth &amp; drinketh iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himselfe.</hi> In these wordes, he reasoneth against the Donatistes, that saide, that baptisme ministred by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, was no sacrament, which he confuteth by example of the other sacrament of Christes bodie &amp; bloud, which Iudas and other wicked men receiued. So that in these wordes the bodie and bloud of the Lorde, are to be taken for the sacrament of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ. Which sacrament as Augu. saith, <hi>Tract.</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioan.</hi> is receyued of some to destruction: <q>
                        <hi>Res verò ipsa, cuius sacramentum est, omni homini ad vitam, nulli ad exitium quicun<expan>

                           </expan> eius particeps fuerit.</hi> But the thing it selfe whereof it is sacrament, is vnto life to euerie man &amp; to destruction to no man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall be partaker therof. But M. Heskins flyeth to his distinction of receiuing spiritually and corporally, as though Augustine euer saide, that the bodie of Christe was receiued corporally of any man.</q> But let vs heare his
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:14727:251"/>
owne wordes, whiche M. Heskins hath cited in the same treatise. <hi>Quantum pertinet ad illam mortem &amp;c. As touching that death, of which the Lorde saide that their fathers be dead: Moses also did eate Manna, &amp; Aaron did eate Manna, &amp; Phinees did eate Manna, &amp; many did eate, which pleased the Lord, &amp; died not. Wherfore? Because they vnderstoode the visible meate spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, they hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gred spiritually, they tasted spiritually, that they might be filled spiritually. For we also at this day haue receiued a visible meate. But the sacrament is one thing, the vertue of the sacrament another thing, which many do receiue of the altar &amp; doe die, &amp; in receiuing doe die. Wherefore the Apostle saith, he eateth &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his owne iudgement.</hi> In these words Augustine teacheth, that the visible (meate which is the sacrament) may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing we affirme, &amp; as for eating the body of Christe, otherwise then spiritually, he speaketh not one worde. But M. Heskins would learne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduersarie, what Augustine meaneth by this word Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which many do dye in receiuing it: and therefore it cannot be the vertue of his passion, so it must needs be his very bodie. So that by this conclusion, Christs bodie may be receiued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the vertue of his passion. But if it please him to learne what Aug. meaneth by this word Vertue in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, <q>I answere he meaneth force or efficacie, which is either to life or to death, as the receiuer is affected that taketh the sacrament, for immediatly after, he saith: <hi>Nam bucella Dominica venenum suit Iudae, &amp; tamen accepit.</hi> For the Lords morsel was poyson to Iudas, &amp; yet he receiued it.</q> You see therefore a double vertue in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, one to saluation, another to condemnation, &amp; no bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence necessarie for either of them. Another place he citeth <hi>In Ioan. Tr.</hi> 6. <hi>Recordamini vnde sit scriptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Remember fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it is written, Whoso euer shal eat the bread and drinke the cup of our Lord vnworthily, shalbe guiltie of the bodie and bloud of our Lorde. For when the Apostle saide this, he spake it of them which receiued the bodie of our Lord vndiscreetly and negligently, as they wold do any other meat.</hi> Whersoeuer he borowed these words they are not to be found in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> treatise of Aug. which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. But if they be August, in any place, they haue none
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:14727:251"/>
other sense then before is expressed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such men are said to eate the bodie of Christ, which eate the sacrament therof, whiche in some manner of speache is called the body of Christ. The words that I find in Augustine sounding any thing like, are these: <q>
                        <hi>Et sancta possunt obesse: in bonis enim sancta ad salutem insunt, in malis ad iudicium: Certè enim fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres nouimus quid accipiamus, &amp; vtique sanctum est quod accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; nemo dicit non esse sanctum. Et quid ait Apostolus? Qui autem manducat &amp; bibit indignè, iudicium sibi manducat &amp; bibit, Non ait quia illa res mala est, sed quod ille malus, malè accipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, ad iudicium accipit bonum, quod accipit. Non enim mala buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella erat quae tradita est Iudae à Domino. Absit: medicus non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret venenum: Salutem medicus dedit, sed indignè accipiendo ad perniciem accepit.</hi> Euen holy things may hurte. For in good men holy things are vnto saluation, in euill men vnto condemnation. For surely brethren, we know what we receiue, and no man sayeth that it is not holy. And what sayeth the Apostle? He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He sayeth it not because that thing is euill, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that euill man by euill receiuing receiueth vnto condemnation that good thing, which he receiueth. For the morsell was not euill which was deliuered by our Lorde to Iudas. God forbidde: the Phisition woulde not giue poyson: the Phisition gaue health, but hee by receiuing vnwoorthily, receiued to his destruction. To this iudgement of Augustine wee doe subscribe, that wicked men receiue a holye thing, namely the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for prophaning whereof, they heape vp damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them selues, besides their other sinnes.</q> But that the naturall bodie of Christe voyde of his quickening spirite, entreth into the mouth of any man, wee doe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denye: and of the same iudgement is Augustine, as we haue shewed in this Chapter, &amp; in many other places.</p>

The sacraments truely, as concerning them selues, cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their proper vertue. Neither doeth the Diuine maiestie by any meanes absent it selfe from the mysteries. But although the sacraments doe suffer them selues to bee taken or touched by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie persons: yet cannot those be partakers of the spirite, whose infidelitie or vnworthinesse gaynsayeth so great holinesse. And therefore those giftes are to some the sauour of life vnto life, vnto some the sauour of death vnto death. For it is altogether meete, that the contemners of grace should be depriued of so great a benefite, and that the puritie of so greate grace shoulde not
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:14727:253"/>
make a dwelling for it selfe in vnworthie persons.</hi> I am verie wel content, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this place shal determine the controuersie betweene vs. Cyprian sayeth, the maiestie of GOD doth neuer absent it selfe from the sacramentes, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee worketh saluation or damnation by them; as well in baptisme, as in the Lords supper, for hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of both in the plurall number. And seeing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and wicked persons cannot bee partakers of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christe, it followeth they cannot bee partakers of the bodie of Christe, for Christ his bodie is neuer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from his spirite.</p>

What shall wee saye euen of the bodie and bloude of our Lorde, the onely sacrifice for our health? Although the Lorde him selfe doeth saye: Except a man doe eate my fleshe and drinke my bloud he shall haue no life in him: doeth not the Apostle teache, that the same is made hurtfull to them, that vse it amisse? For he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: whosoeuer shall eate the breade and drinke the cuppe of the Lorde vnworthily, shalbee guiltie of the bodie and bloud of the Lorde.</hi>

                     <q>But it followeth imediately: <hi>Ecce quemadmodum obsint diuina &amp; sancta malè vtentibus. Cur non eodem modo baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>? Behold how diuine and holy things do hurte them that vse them amisse: why not baptisme after the same manner?</q> By which woordes it appeareth, that Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine speaketh of the sacrament, and not of the thing si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifyed by the sacrament. For he compareth baptisme ministred by heretikes, with the Lordes supper vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receiued, which comparison cannot stande, except you vnderstande the outwarde parte of the sacrament in bothe. Baptisme is ministred by heretikes, that is to say, the outwarde sacrament of baptisme, the bodie of Christe is receiued vnworthily to destruction, that is, the outwarde sacrament of the bodie of Christe: for as wee heard in the last Chapter, <hi>Res ipsa sacramenti,</hi> the thing it selfe of the sacrament is receiued of euery man to life, &amp; of no man to destruction whosoeuer doth receiue it.</p>

                  <p>This saying being directly contrarie, both to the corporall manner of eating and drinking the body and bloud of Christe, and also to that absurde opinion that the wicked receiue the body of Christe: Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins is not ashamed, not onely to alledge it as making for him, but also tryfleth off the nearnesse of the bloud of Christe, which hee sayeth wee denye, when wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Christe to bee alwayes in heauen. As though the bloude of Christe cannot purge and clense vs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it come downe from heauen, and bee powred in at our mouthes.

                  <p>But where Effrem sayeth, his bloud is so much the

But hee woulde haue the bloud of Christ to be as neere the wicked, as the godly. Againe when Ephrem saith: when wee eate and drinke his body and bloude, hee is in vs and wee in him: with what face can Maister Heskins or any papist in the worlde saye, that the wicked receiue the bodye and bloud of Christe, in whom Christe is not, nor they in him?</p>
                  <p>The like syncerity hee vseth, in racking the wordes of Primasius: Hee that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud abideth in mee and I in him: As though he should saye: they that so ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The latine text, he citeth thus. <hi>Qui edit meane carneus &amp; bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet &amp; ego in eo, pro eo ac si diceret: qui sic edent vs edenda est, &amp; sic bibent vs bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendus est sanguis meus.

For many when they are seene to receiue this sacrament, neither dwell they in God nor God in them, because they are witnessed to eate and drinke their owne damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let the reader, though hee bee but a meane La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinist, iudge whether he haue not corrupted Primasius in translation, especially where hee sayeth: <hi>Multi cùm hoc videantur accipere,</hi> whiche is, manye when they seeme to receiue this thing, namely the body and bloud
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:14727:254"/>
of Christe, of whiche hee spake, Maister Heskins turneth it into manye, when they are seene to receiue this sacrament. Many seeme to bee Christians, that are not: many seeme to bee baptized with the holy Ghoste, which are not: so many seeme to eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of Christe, which doe not, because God dwelleth not in them, nor they in God. Therefore, take awaye Maister Heskins false (translation, and this saying of Primasius is directly against him, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men receiue not the bodie and bloude of Christe. And wheras hee noteth that the sixte of Iohn and Saint Paule in this texte speake of one thing, it is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye: for Christe speaketh of that, which is testifyed and giuen in the sacrament to the faithfull, Paule of the sacrament receiued vnworthely. And Primasius ioyneth them to shewe the diuersitie of these textes, and not as though they signified one thing. For by Saint Paule hee prooueth, that not all eating and drinking, is the eating and drinking of the bodie and bloude of Christe, but the eating and drinking worthily.</p>

For where it is firste mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by Cassiodorus, that when Christe gaue the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his disciples, hee gaue foorth breade and wine, Maister Heskins translateth: <hi>Corpus &amp; sanguinem suum in panis &amp; vini erogatione salutariter consecrauit: In the giuing foorth of breade and wine to our health, hee consecrated his bodie and bloud:</hi> whereas euery litle boye, will teach him, that the Aduerbe must be ioyned with the Verbe in constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to declare his signification.

                     <hi>Let not the minde of man conceiue any thing grosse, any thing corruptible:</hi> whereas the mynde of the author is, seeing we must in this fleshe and bloud conceiue nothing bloudie, we must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the flesh of Christ to be present carnally, nor the bloud of Christ to be present bloudily, but spiritually,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:14727:255"/>
and as he addeth a quickening and healthfull substance, giuing forgiuenesse of sinnes and eternall life, to all that receiue it. And therefore impertinent is al that discourse that Maister Heskins maketh afterwarde, against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde heretikes, of which some denyed the humanitie, some the diuinitie of Christe, and ridiculous is that rayling of his, by which hee woulde charge vs with their heresies, for mainteining the trueth against their carnall manner of presence, which in deede sauoureth of the heresie of the Marcionistes, Mannyches, and Eutychians. Finally, where Cassiodorus sayeth, he that eateth the bodye of our Lorde vnworthily, eateth his owne damnation, it is manifest, that hee calleth the sacrament by the name of that which it signifieth, as many of the fathers doe. But where he sayeth, that forgiuenesse of sinnes and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life are giuen by the fleshe and bloud of Christe, it followeth, that the wicked which are not partakers of the one are not partakers of the other.</p>

And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the graine of wheate which is fallen into the earth do dye, it remaineth alone: but if it dye, it bringeth forth much fruit. Ortho. And in the deliuerie of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he called breade his body, and that which is powred in the cup and mingled, his bloud. Eranistes. He called it so in deede. Orthodoxus. Why then, that which is a naturall body, shall of right be called a body, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bloud. Eranistes. That is confessed. Orthodoxus. Certainely our Sauiour chaunged the names: and gaue that name to his body, which was the name of the token or signe: and to the token, that which was the name of his body. So when he called him selfe a vine, hee called his body that which was the token thereof. Eranistes. This thou hast saide truely. But I would knowe the cause of the chaunge of the names. Orthodoxus. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is manifest to them that are made partakers of the Diuine mysteries. For hee would haue them, which are partakers of the Diuine mysteries, not to regard the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of those things that are seene: but in respect of the chaunging of the names, to giue credite to that chaunge which is by grace. For hee which called his naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wheate and breade, and named him selfe againe a vine: euen hee hath honoured the tokens that are seene, with the name of his body and bloud: not chaunging their nature, but adding grace vnto the nature. Erani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes. Those mysticall things are both vttered mystically, and those things are openly declared, which are not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to all men. Orthodoxus. Therefore seeing it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that the Patriarch called the Lordes body a vesture and a garment, and we are entred to speake of the Diuine mysteries, tell truely, whereof doest thou thanke this most holy foode to be a token and figure? of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of our Lorde Christe, or of his body and bloud? Eranistes. It is cleare to be of them whose names they haue receiued. Orthodoxus. Thou saiest of his body and bloud. Eranistes. So I say. Orthodoxus. Thou hast saide
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:14727:257"/>
as becommeth a louer of the trueth. For when our Lord had taken the token or signe: he saide not, This is my Godhead: but, this is my body. And againe: This is my bloud: and in an other place: The breade which I will giue is my flesh, which I will giue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of the world. Eranistes. Those things are true. For they are the word of God. Orthodoxus. Then if they be true, our Lord had a body.</p>

If a man dare not put that thing into a soule cloth or vessell, howe much more in a defiled hart, which vncleannesse God aboue all things detesteth, and which is the only iniurie that can be done to his body? For euen therefore did Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph that righteous man burie the Lordes body? wrapped in a cleane linnen cloth, in a newe tombe, prefiguring that they which should receiue the Lords body, should haue both a cleane minde and a new.</hi> M. Heskins saith, these wordes make plaine for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ, in that Hierome saith, we receiue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christe. And who denyeth either the presence of Christ, or that we receiue the body of Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Only we differ, whether Christ be present bodily, and whether we receiue his body after a corporall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or after a spirituall or heauenly manner. It is pitie he
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:14727:258"/>
can not see in Hieromes wordes, that Christes body must be receiued in a cleane sort, as in a cleane vessell. And whereas Maister Heskins translateth <hi>mittere illud,</hi> to put that body into a foule cloth or vessell, it is maruell he considered not, that which aunswereth in similitude to a foule vessell, namely a foule heart. He thought by that translation, or rather falsification, to make it seeme, that wicked men receiue the body of Christe with the mouth, but his authour saith, with a filthie heart, which is the only iniurie that can be done to the body of Christe, therefore he speaketh of the wicked presuming to receiue the sacrament of his body and bloud, not affirming that they do it in deede. For vpon these wordes, He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, he saith: <q>
                        <hi>Dupliciter reus effectus, presumptionis sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet &amp; peccati</hi>: Being made twise guiltie, namely of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and sinne: and vpon those words:</q> He shall be guiltie of the body and bloud of our Lorde.] hee saith: <q>

                  <p>But Maister Heskins citeth another place of Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> licentious doctrine of Luther, as he saith, that would haue none other preparation but onely faith: also to maintaine his carnall presence: <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Apoll. contra Iouinian.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conscience must first be searched, if it doe in nothing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vs, and so we ought either to offer, or to communicate. There be some that say, he doth not here forbid an vnworthie person from the holy thing, but him that receiueth vnworthily. If therefore the worthie person comming vnworthily he drawne backe, howe much more the vnworthy person which can not receiue worthily? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoueth the idle person to cease from vices, that he may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily receiue the holy body of our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these wordes Maister Heskins noteth the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required, against Luthers onely faith, and the thing receiued to be the holy body of our Lorde. I haue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered before, that Luthers onely faith doth not exclude, but of necessitie drawe with it all things requisite to a due preparation. And that the holy body of our Lorde is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the faithfull, wee doe willingly confesse, but not of the vnfaithfull and wicked persons. For the same Hierome in the Chapter before cited, vpon this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apostle, This is my body, writeth thus: <q>
                        <hi>Qui manducat corpus meum, &amp; bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet &amp; ego in eo. Vnde agnoscere se debet quisquis Christi cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus edit, aut sanguinem bibit, ne quid indignum ei faciat cuius cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus effectus est.</hi> Hee that eateth my body and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. Wherefore hee ought to knowe him selfe, who so euer either ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the body of Christe, or drinketh his bloud, that hee doe nothing vnworthily, to him whose body hee is made.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This sentence plainely declareth, both howe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christe are eaten and dronken, and of whome, namely, they are so receiued, as hee that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them is made the body of Christe, that is of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie spiritually, and they are receiued of them, in whome Christe dwelleth, and they in him, therefore of no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</p>

Neither doe we come as full of compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction prepared to purge out our vices, but we consider that wee may bee at the solemnities when all men are presente. But Paule doeth not so commaunde, but he knewe one time in whiche we should come to the purenesse of communication and conscience. For if we would neuer communicate at a sensible table, if wee be sicke of an ague, and doe abounde with humours, least we should be caste away: muche more wickednesse it is to touche this table, being intangled with noysome lustes, which are more greeuous then feuers. And when I speake of noysome lustes, I speake of lustes of the bodie, and of money, and of anger, and of wrath, and plainely all lustes that be naught. All which he that commeth to receiue, must auoide, and so touche that pure sacrifice, not to be slouthfully disposed, nor miserably to be compelled for the solemnities sake to come. Neither againe beeing penitent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to be hindered because there is no solemnitie. For solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is an euident declaration of good workes, purenesse of soule, certeintie of life, whiche thinges if thou hast, thou mayest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes celebrate a solemnitie, and alwayes come, therefore (sayth he) let a man examine him selfe, and so let him eate.</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth immediately: <q>

Maister Heskins alledged the place to proue the necessitie of preparation, which no man denieth, but these last words of Chrysostome doe clearly ouerthrow auricular confession, which Maister Heskins comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for a necessarie parte of repentance.</q> He noteth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the sacrament is called of him a pure sacrifice, and the bodie of Christ. How it is called either a sacrifice,

                  <p>Of these wordes M. Heskins will needes gather both his carnall presence, and the presence of Christ vnto the wicked receiuer, but seeing Chrysostome expressely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the partaking of the mysteries, it is plaine in what sense, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Christ is said to be receiued vnworthily, namely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mysteries y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is his sacrament are receiued vnworthily. But our doctrine (he saith) is without all ground of scriptures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> only faith maketh Christe present in the sacrament: in deed meaning either such a presence as he fantasieth included in the sacrament, or suche an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, as he slandereth vs withal, neither do we affirme it, neither is it in the scriptures to be found, but that Christ dwelleth in our heartes by faith, both in the receiuing of the sacramentes, and in receiuing of the word of God, the Apostle teacheth vs, Eph. 3. and our sauiour Christ testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 6. that whosoeuer eateth his flesh and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his bloud hath life euerlasting, euen as he saide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that beleeueth in him hath life euerlasting, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Augustine <hi>In Ioan.

Consider now what great sobrietie of life those partakers of the olde sacrifice did vse. For what did they not? They were purified euerie time. And doest thou comming to this wholsome sacrifice, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels them selues doe receiue with trembling, measure so great a

thing with the compasse of times? With what face wilt thou appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ, which hast beene so bolde with vncleane handes and lippes so impudently to touch his bodie? Thou wouldst not choose to kisse the King if thou hast a stinking mouth: &amp; doest thou shamelesse man, kisse the King of heauen with thy soule so stinking of vices? Surely this maner of thing is a cruell reproche. Tell me wouldest thou take vpon thee to come to so honorable a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice with vnwashed handes? I thinke not, but as I coniecture, thou haddest rather altogether to refraine from comming, then to come with foule hands. And whylest thou art so religious in so small a thing, thou commest hauing thy soule defiled with the myre of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and darest thou touch it thou impudent man? Although a man for the vncleanenesse of his handes doe withholde himselfe for a time yet to cleanse his soule, from the filthie puddle of all vices, let him returne altogether.</hi> Maister Heskins noteth in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue speeche, three thinges, first the corporal presence of Christes bodie, that it may be touched with handes or lipps. And he is not ashamed to cite the saying of Christ: handle me and see that a spirite hath no fleshe and bones, as you see we haue: as though any man either by sight or feeling, could discerne Christe corporally present in the sacrament. But what a shamelesse man is this, to vrge the kissing of Christ with a foule mouth, which is a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and vnproper speech, when it followeth, that he is kissed of the wicked with a foule soule? Like impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie is in the second note, that the bodie of Christe may be touched and receiued of him, that hath a filthie soule, which Chrysostome saith not, but inueyeth vehemently against their presumption, that hauing a filthie soule, would presume to receiue the sacrament. The thirde, that it is an wholsome sacrifice, which the Angels do honour, doth no more proue the corporall presence of Christ on earth, then the same Authors wordes soone after do proue the corporal presence of the receiuers in heauen. <q>

This is in deede a great and wonderfull mysterie, which Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome doeth garnish with many figures (as he was an eloquent preacher) to make the people to haue due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereof.</p>
                  <p>Neither is Luthers doctrine one hayre breadth diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from Chrysostoms iudgement concerning the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration necessarie for all them, that shall receiue the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthily, howsoeuer it pleaseth Maister Heskins neuer to haue done railing and reuiling him, &amp; charging him with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which I thinke the holy man neuer thought, certeine I am he neuer did teach, but the contrarie. And because this is the last testimonie he citeth out of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, I thought good to set downe one place also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ouerthrowing his transubstantiation, for which he striueth so egerly. <q>It is written, <hi>Ad Caesa. monachum. Et Deus &amp; homo est Christus: Deus propter impassibilitatem: homo propter passionem: vnus filius, vnus Dominus: idem ipse procul dubio, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarum naturarum vnam dominationem, vnam potestatem possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, etiamsi non consubstantialiter existant &amp; vnaquaeque in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commixta proprietatis conseruas agnitionem, propter hoc quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confusa sunt duo.

For euen as the bread before it be sanctified is called of vs bread, but when the grace of God doth sanctifie it, by meanes of the priest, it is in deede deliuered from the name of bread, and is comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthie of the name of our Lordes bodie, although the nature of the bread hath remained in it, and it is not called two bodies but one body of the sonne, so both these, the diuine nature ouerflowing the body haue made one sonne, one person.</q>

                  <p>He citeth him <hi>Ad Iulianum Ep.</hi> 111. Whereas in deede ther is no such Epistle in any good edition of Augustine, and the treatise he speaketh of, may rather be called a Booke then an Epistle for the length of it. But the stile of it, is as like vnto the stile of Augustine, as our Asse is to a Lyon. It hath no inscription to whom it should be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and therefore some say to Iulianus, some to Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius. It beginneth <hi>O mi frater, &amp;c.</hi> and so continueth in such balde Latine that Erasmus hath not only reiected it out of the number of Augustines Epistles, but also out of his authenticall workes, such iudgement or honestie M. Heskins vseth in citing the fathers, all is fishe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to his nette. I will set downe the wordes: <hi>Ab ijs pietas, &amp;c. From them let the pietie of our Lorde Iesus Christe deliuer vs, and giue himselfe to be eaten, who saide I am the bread of life which came downe from heauen, he that eateth my flesh, &amp; drinketh my bloud hath euerlasting life in him.

For he that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily eateth the bodie and bloud of our Lord, eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his owne condemnation, making no difference of the bodie of our Lorde. Therefore when we shall receiue, we ought before to haue recourse to confession and repentance, and curiously to searche out all our actions, and if we finde in vs any punishable sinnes, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if we haue thought any euill or naughtie thing let vs repent vs of it, and let vs make hast to scrape that speedily out of our heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the saying of this counterfet and forged Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, out of which Maister Heskins gathereth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his manner of presence, to be such as the wicked receiue

the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, but also his auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
                  <p>But what the iudgement of the true Augustine is, you haue hearde before concerning the former: as for the later question is neuer touched in all his owne workes. <hi>De ciuit. Dei Lib.</hi> 21. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. <q>

And againe: <hi>Nec isti duo ergo dicendi sunt manducare corpus Christi, quoniam nec in membris computandi sunt Christi.

Sic enim hoc dixit tanquam diceret: qui non in me manet, &amp; in quo ego non maneo, non se dicat aut existimet manducare corpus meum, aut bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere sanguinem meum.</hi> Neither are those two sortes of men to be saide to eate of the bodie of Christe, because they are not to be accompted among the members of Christe.</q>

                     <q>For, that I say nothing of other matters, they can not be both the members of Christ, and the members of an harlot. Finally he himselfe saying: he that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud abideth in me and I in him, sheweth what it is (not in the sacrament only, but in very deede) to eate the bodie of Christ, &amp; to drinke his bloud. For this it is to abide in Christ, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christ may abide

As for the matter of Auricular confession which Maister Heskins without warrant of Gods worde, is so bolde to call Gods ordinaunce, vpon the authoritie of his forged Augustine, I thinke it not worthie any answere, if any man list to see the three properties of a Ghostly Father, and two commodities of confession, let him resorte to Maister Heskins booke for them. Other reason or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he bringeth none for them, but this Iewde foolishe and barbarous counterfet, whome he called moste falsely and iniuriously S. Augustine.</p>

Say then, the mysticall tokens which are offered to God by the Priestes of God, of what thinges sayest thou they are tokens? Eran. Of the body &amp; bloud of our Lorde. Orth. Of that bodie which truely is? Or of such a bodie as truely is not? Eran. Which truly is. Ortho. Very well. For it behoueth the patterne to be example of the image. For painters doe followe nature: and do paint the images of those thinges which are seene. Eran. It is true. Orth. Then if the Diuine mysteries doe represent that bodie which is a bodie in deede, therefore our Lordes bodie is euen nowe also a-bodie not beeing chaunged into his Diuine nature, but filled with Diuine glorie. Eran. It came well to passe that thou diddest speake of the Diuine mysteries. For euen out of the fame will I shewe vnto thee, that our Lordes bodie is chaunged into another nature. Therefore aunswere vnto my questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Orth. I will answere. Eran. What doest thou call the gifte, which is offered, before the inuocation of the Priest? Orth. I may not speake it openly, for it is like that some are present, that are not admitted to the mysteries. Eran. Then answere darkely. Orth. That meate which is made of such kinde of seedes. Eran. And how doe we cal the other signe? Ortho. That is also a common name which signifieth a kinde of drinke. Eran. But after sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication how doest thou call them? Ortho. The bodie and bloud of Christ. Eran. And doest thou beleeue that thou art made partaker of the bodie and bloud of Christ? Orth. So I beleeue. Eran. Therefore euen as the tokens
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:14727:266"/>
of the bodie and bloud of our Lord are other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inuocation of the priest, and after the inuocation are changed and made other thinges: euen so the Lordes bodie after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> assumption is changed into his Diuine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Orth. Thou art taken with thine owne nets which thou haste made. For the mysticall signes after sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, do not departe from their nature. For they remain in their former substance, figure, and shape: they may be both seene and handled, euen as before. But they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode to be those thinges, which they are made to be, &amp; are beleeued, &amp; reuerenced, as those which are the same thinges that they are beleeued to be. Compare therefore the image with the examples, and thou shalt see the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. For the figure ought to be like to the trueth. For that same bodie hath the former shape and fashion, &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription, and to speake at once the substance of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But it is made immortall after his resurrection, and more mightie, then that any corruption or destruction can befall vnto it, and it is made worthie to sit at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand of God: and is worshipped of euerie creature, as that which is called the naturall bodie of our Lorde. Eran. But yet the mysticall token changeth the former name. For it is no more called that it was called before: but it is called the bodie. Therefore the trueth also ought to be called, God, and not a bodie. Orth. Thou seemest vnto me to be ignorant. For it is not only called the body, but also the bread of life. For so our Lorde himselfe called it. But his very bodie, we call a Diuine bodie, &amp; a quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, and our Lordes bodie: teaching that it is not a common bodie of any man, but of our Lord Iesus Christ, which is both God and man. By this discourse of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doretus, you may see both howe syncerely Maister Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins hath cited his authoritie, and also what the writers minde was both concerning transubstantiation and the carnall manner of presence.</q> The authoritie of Anselmus Bishop of Canterburie, I passe ouer as I haue done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with Burgesses of the lower house. But Maister Heskins affirmeth that the preparation we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:14727:267"/>
to make for the receipt of the sacrament, &amp; the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of vnworthie receiuing, do argue the reall presence: for such preparation and perill should not be for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a peece of bread. And if we aunswere, that by faith we receiue Christs bodie &amp; bloud verily, but yet spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, he will confute vs by that wee affirme, the fathers to haue receiued Christ as verily as we doe, who yet had not like preparation, nor like punishment for vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie receiuing. For their preparation was onely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde things, their punishment onely bodily and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
                  <p>But who is so grosse of vnderstanding, as M. Heskins, that will not acknowledge that the fathers of the olde Testament by that purifying and preparation in bodily things, were admonished that inward &amp; spiritually pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was more necessarie? And wheras he sayeth, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie receiuers of those auncient sacraments were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished only with temporal death, how often doth those threatenings occurre in the lawe: That soule shalbe roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out from my face: that soule shall perish from his people, he hath broken my couenant &amp;c? Wil ye make vs beleeue that God threateneth onely a temporall and not an eternall death to the contemners of his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Finally, when the same punishment of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remaineth to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiue baptisme vnworthily, which abydeth them that receiue the Lordes supper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, how will hee proue a reall presence more in the one sacrament then in the other?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here Maister Heskins noteth, firste, that Origen calleth the sacrament in plaine wordes the bodye of Christe, therefore it is no breade, figure, or signe, of the bodie of Christ. Secondly, he calleth it mysteries, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is two sacraments, &amp; whole Christ bodie &amp; bloud, is vnder eche kind. Thirdly, sicke men sometimes will eate whole mens meate, therefore euil men receiue the bodie of Christ. These be all as good reasons as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comon iest: The staffe standeth in the corner, therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good man is not at home. As for the saying of Origen, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it willingly, for hee speaketh of such receiuers as Saint Paule doth, that is not wicked and reprobate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but such as for their offences were chastened of the Lord, that they might not be condemned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde. But he will presse vs with a more vehement place of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen: <hi>Hom.</hi> 13. <hi>in</hi> 25. <hi>Exod. Volo vos admonere, &amp;c. I will admonish you with the examples of our own religion. You that are wont to be present at the diuine mysteries doe knowe howe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Lords bodie, you giue heede with all warinesse and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that no little portion of it should fall downe, that no parte of the consecrated gift should fall away, for you beleeue your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be guiltie, and you beleeue rightly, if any of it should fall from you through negligence. If then you vse so great wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse about the conseruing of his bodie, and worthily do vse it, howe do you thinke it is lesse offence to haue neglected the worde of God then his bodie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maister Heskins noteth two things in this sentence: First, a playne saying for the proclaimer, that without mention of figure, signe or sacramentall bread, hee say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people receiued the bodie of Christe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:14727:268"/>Secondly, that he commendeth the reuerend vsage of the same. Concerning the first, there is expresse mention of the Diuine mysteries, and not that onely, but then in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he calleth the sacrament the bodie of Christe, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both that there is bread, and that it is not so his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as the Papistes do deeme. For whereof be those litle portions, that may fall away, partes? of the breade, or of the bodie of Christe? I thinke he is not so madde to say, that peeces may fall off from Christes holy and naturall bodie. Then it remaineth, that they bee peeces or crommes of breade that may fall away. And seeing that whereof peeces may fall away is called the bodye of Christe, it is manifest that hee meaneth not the naturall bodie of Christe to be corporally present, from which no peeces can fall away. Finally, seeing Origen maketh it as great a fault to neglect the worde of God, as to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the sacrament, it followeth that Christe is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise present in the sacrament, then in his worde, &amp; that is spiritually, and after an heauenly manner. As for the other matter, that Origen alloweth the reuerence of the people in handling the sacrament, we also do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the same, so farre as neither idolatrie nor supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be mainteined. And whereas he raileth against vs, for our vsage of that breade and wine, which remaineth after the ministration of the communion, he sheweth his wisedome and charitie. For that, which remaineth on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table when the ministration is ended, is no more the sacrament then it was before the ministration began: and therefore may be vsed as all other bread, whatsoeuer the Popes decrees are to the contrarie. Now let vs heare what he can say out of S. Ambrose against vs. He citeth him <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Vt verum probaret, &amp;c. That he might proue that there is a iudgement to come of them which receiue the Lords bodie, he doth nowe shewe a certeine image of the iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, which vnaduisedly had receiued the bodie of our Lord, while they were punished with feuers and infirmities, and many dyed, that by them the rest might learne, and being terrified by the example of a fewe, they might be reformed, knowing that to
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:14727:268"/>
receiue the bodie of our Lorde negligently, is not left vnpunished, but if his punishment be here deferred, that he shalbe more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously handled hereafter, because he hath contemned the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Here againe M. Heskins chargeth Ambrose to saye, that the sacrament is the naturall bodie of Christe, and that it hath bene receiued of euil men, when hee sayeth neither of both: for he speaketh of them that were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that might bee reformed, whereas the wicked reprobates be vncurable. And as for the carnal manner of presence, howe farre he was from it, let his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in the same place declare. Vppon this texte: You shewe the Lordes death vntill he come. <q>
                        <hi>Quia enim mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Domini liberati sumus, huius rei memores, in edendo &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando, carnem &amp; sanguinem, quę pro nobis oblata sunt, significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>: Because we are deliuered by the death of our Lord, being mindfull of this thing, in eating and drinking, we do signifie his fleshe and bloud, which were offered for vs: And in the same place a little after: <hi>Testamentum ergo sanguine constitutum est, quia beneficij Diuini sanguis testis est: in cuius typum nos calicem mysticum sanguinis, ad tuitionem corporis &amp; animae nostrę percipimus.</hi> The testament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is established by bloud, because his bloud is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the diuine benefite, in figure of whose bloude, wee doe receiue the mysticall cuppe to the preseruation both of our bodie and of our soule. These sentences are plaine to declare to any man that wilbe satisfied with reason, that this writer acknowledged, not a carnall, but a spirituall manner of presence.</q> But Maister Heskins will vrge vs with another place that followeth: <hi>Deuoto animo &amp; cum timore accedendum ad communionem docet, vt sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at mens reuerentiam se debere ei, ad cuius corpus sumendum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit: He teacheth vs to come to the communion with a deuoute minde and with feare, that the minde may knowe that it oweth reuerence to him, whose bodie it commeth to receiue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maister Heskins sayeth, here be plaine termes for the proclaimer: in deede, I woulde wish no playner for the spirituall manner of presence of Christes bodie in the sacrament, because this author sayeth, the minde must
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:14727:269"/>
yeeld reuerence to him whose body it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to receiue. If the minde receiue the body of Christ, it must needs be spiritually, for the minde can receiue nothing corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <q>And there followe as plaine termes in the next sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence immediatly: <hi>Hoc enim apud se debet iudicare, quia Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus est cuius in mysterio sanguinem petat, qui est testis beneficij Dei.</hi> For this it ought to consider with it selfe, that it is the Lorde whose blood it drinketh in a mysterie, which blood is a witnesse of the benefite of God.</q> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sentence the minde receiued the body of Christ, now in this it drinketh the blood of Christ in a mystery, which is a witnesse or assuraunce of the benefite of God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the redemption of the world by the blood of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sonne our Lorde Iesus Christ.</p>

                  <p>To fill vp the chapter, he citeth certaine miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Sainte Cyprian <hi>Sermone,</hi> 5. <hi>De lapsis</hi>: to shewe howe God punisheth the vnworthie receiuing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, although they doe not all shewe it, for the first example is of an infante that coulde not brooke the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall wyne, after it had tasted of breade and wine offred to Idolles, where the negligence of the parentes was rather punished then the vnworthinesse of the child. The whole story is at large set downe in the last chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the second booke.</p>
                  <p>The seconde example is of a woman, who receiuinge vnworthily, was striken with sodaine death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="523" facs="tcp:14727:269"/>The third of a woman who kept the sacrament in her coffer, <hi>and when she woulde with vnworthie handes open the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, in which was the holy thing of the Lorde, there sprange out a fire by which she was so terryfied, that she durst not touche it.</hi> A iust punishment for her reseruing of that, which should haue bene receiued. The fourth miracle is of a man who presuming to receiue the sacrament vnworthily, <hi>coulde neuer eate the holy thing of God nor handle it. For when he had opened his hand, he sawe nothing in it but ashes. This is a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing saith Master Heskins. Whereby is declared that God is not willing that his holy sacrament shoulde be receiued of a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie sinner, for so muche as sodeinly it pleaseth him to chaunge it into ashes, he himselfe departinge from it.</hi> In deede this is a straunge and miraculous transubstantiation. But if I might be so bolde to aske M. Heskins, what is that which is chaunged, if there be no bread in the sacrament? God he saieth is departed from it, there remaineth the acei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes onely of breade and wine, and so belike the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes are chaunged into ashes. O monstrous muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But why doeth not M.

By example of this one it is shewed, that the Lorde doeth depart when he is denyed, neither doeth that which is receiued profit to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the vnworthie persons, seeinge the wholsome giftes, the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse departing from it, is chaunged into ashes.</hi> Cyprian gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the chaunge of the outwarde sacramente, before it was receyued, that Christ departeth from them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> denye him, and is not receyued at all. But M. Hes. would learne forsoth, what one thing is in the sacrament receiued that profiteth &amp; hurteth, he aunswereth it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the bread &amp; wine (for they profit alike to al men) therfore it must needes be the body of Christ: a wholsome conlusion, by whiche the bodye of Christe is made a hurtefull thing:
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:14727:270"/>
but if it please him to vnderstand our aunswere, we deny that there is any thing included in the bread or wine, that either profiteth or hurteth to saluation. It is the grace and spirite of God, which worketh as well by this sacrament our spirituall nourishing, as by baptisme our spirituall regeneration. And that, which hurteth the wicked man, is in him selfe, and not in the sacrament, euen his owne wickednesse and detestable presumption, to defile the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacraments of God. Wherefore it is diuelish and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, that M. Heskins affirmeth the body of Christ to be hurtful to any, bicause the vnworthy receiuing of the sacrament, hurteth him that receiueth, by his owne acte, and not by any thing that is receiued.</p>

Howe doe they deny that the flesh is able to receiue the gift of God, that is, eternall life, which is nourished with the bloud and body of Christ, and is made a member of him, euen as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, in that Epistle which is to the Ephesians: Bicause we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, speaking this not of any spirituall and inuisible man (for a spirite hath neither flesh nor bones) but of that disposition which is after the nature of man, which consisteth of flesh, and sinewes, and bones, which is nourished of the cup, which is his bloud, and is increased of the bread, which is his body.</hi> That both our bodies and soules are nourished vnto eternall life, by eating and drinking the body and bloud of Christe, we doe most willingly confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. But withall we affirme, that as our bodyes are not naturally nourished and increased with the body of Christ, but spiritually after a diuine manner, so onely spiritually and after a diuine manner, we doe eate and drinke the body and bloud of Christ, and not after a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, naturall, or papisticall manner. And this is the plaine sense and meaning of Irenaeus his wordes. As our bodyes
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:14727:270"/>
are naturally nourished and increased with the bread and wine of the sacrament, so are our bodyes and soules spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually nourished and increased vnto eternall life. For M. Heskins him selfe denyeth, that our bodyes are naturally nourished and increased with the body and bloud of Christ, when he saith, <hi>The flesh of Christ is not turned into our flesh,</hi> which must needes be, if we vnderstand that Irenaeus saith, our flesh is nourished and increased of the body of Christ, but he saith, of the bread which is his body, and of the cup which is his bloud, our flesh is nourished and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased. Therefore there is naturall and very bread in the sacrament, for our flesh can not be nourished and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by accidentes, euen as certainely, as there is the body and bloud of Christe after a spirituall manner dispensed vnto the faithfull, which are the members of Christ, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. Therefore also the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked receiue not the body and bloud of Christe, bicause they are no members of his body. That I haue not in this interpretation varied from the mynde of Irenaeus, his plaine words shall testifie, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 34. <q>
                        <hi>Quemadmodum enim qui est à terra panis percipiens vocationem Dei, iam non communis est, sed Eucharistia, ex duabus rebus constans, terrena &amp; coelesti: sic &amp; corpora nostra percipientia Eucharistiam, iam non sunt corruptibilia, spem resurrectionis habentia.</hi> Euen as that bread which is of the earth receiuing the calling of God, is not now comon bread, but the Eucharistie or sacrament of thankesgiuing, consisting of two thinges, an earthly thing and an heauenly thing: so also our bodyes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Eucharistie, are not nowe corruptible, hauing the hope of resurrection.

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:14727:271"/>
Maister Heskins quote not the place: <hi>Eos qui inter patrem &amp; filium &amp;c. I aske them that bring in the vnitie of will betweene the Father and the Sonne, whether Christe be nowe in vs by veritie of nature, or by agreement of will? For if the worde was verily made flesh, and if we doe verily receiue the worde made flesh in the Lords meate, howe is he not to be thought to abide in vs naturally, who being borne man, did both take our nature nowe inseparable vpon him, and also hath admixed the nature of his flesh vnto the nature of eternitie vnder the sacrament of his flesh to be communicated vnto vs? For so we be all one, bicause the Father is in Christe, and Christ is in vs. Whosoeuer therfore shall deny the Father to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in Christ, let him first deny, that he himself is not naturally in Christ, as Christ in him, bicause the Father being in Christe, and Christe in vs, make vs to be one in them. Therefore if Christe haue truely taken vpon him the flesh of our body, and that man which was borne of Marie, was truely Christe, and we doe truely vnder a mysterie receiue the flesh of his body, and by this we shall be one, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Father is in him, and he in vs.</hi>

                     <q>Here Maister Heskins cutteth off the conclusion, which is this: <hi>Quomodo voluntatis vnitas asseritur, cum naturalis per sacramentum proprietas perfectae sacramentum sit vnitatis?</hi> Howe is the veritie of Will maintained, when the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propertie by the sacrament, is a sacrament of perfect vnitie?</q> Hilarie reasoneth against the Arrians that saide, God was not naturally or essentially in Christe, but by vnitie of wil, as God is in vs, but he proueth that Christe is naturally ioyned to vs by his incarnation, and doth also communicate his flesh vnto vs by the holy sacrament, which (as hee expoundeth him selfe in the last sentence, that M. Hes. hath cut off) is a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or mysterie of our perfect vnitie with Christ. Therefore he doth not simply say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do naturally eat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh of Christ, but vnder a my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sterie, vnder a sacrament, by which he meaneth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we doe not eate the flesh of Christ carnally, but spiritually, not after a corporall manner, but after a spirituall maner. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he saith, that Christe is so naturally in vs, as we are naturally in Christ, but we are onely spiritually in Christ, therefore Christ is onely spiritually in vs. For naturally
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:14727:271"/>
as he vseth it for essentially, is not contrarie to spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But he alledgeth another place of Hilarie, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that Christ is in vs both carnally and corporally: <hi>Haec idcirco a nobis commemorata sunt &amp;c. These thinges are for this cause spoken of vs, bicause the heretiques falsely affirming an vnitie of Will onely to be betweene the Father and the Sonne, did vse the example of our vnitie with GOD, as though we being vnited to the Sonne, and by the same to the Father, onely by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and will of religion, no propertie of naturall communion should be giuen by the sacrament of his naturall flesh and bloud, seing that both by the honor of the sonne of God giuen to vs; and by the sonne of God carnally abiding in vs, and we being corporally and inseparably vnited in him, the mysterie of the true and naturall vnitie is to be declared.</hi> By the words of corporally and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he meaneth essentially, as he did before by the word naturally, both bicause Christe tooke our nature verily vpon him, and also doth communicat vnto vs by the same, his eternitie. And that he meaneth not carnally and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally as the Papistes doe, it is manifest by that he saith, we are not onely corporally, but also inseparably vnited in him. For there, corporall coniunction maketh not an inseparable vnion, bicause they say, that Christ is as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; carnally, and corporally vnited to the wicked, from whome he is separated, as to the godly, wherefore it is left of necessitie, that this naturall, carnall, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or essentiall dwelling of Christe in vs, is not after a naturall manner, but after a wonderfull manner, not after a fleshly but after a spirituall manner, not after a bodily, but after a diuine and heauenly manner. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, howe plaine these places be for the proclamer, and plaine against Maister Heskins the exclamer, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders iudge.

For of that it is not lawful for the Iewes to eate</hi> M. Heskins would haue it plaine, that he meaneth the reall presence of Christes body in the sacrament, when neither the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, nor Isichius speake one worde of the sacrament, but of the spirituall participation of the sacrifice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes death, for he saith, Christ is the Priest, the sacrifice, and the altar. Therefore hee speaketh of that sacrifice that Christe him selfe did offer, not of that sacrifice, which the Papistes do imagine their blasphemous Priestes do offer. And whereas M. Heskins trifleth of M. Hoopers glose of <hi>edere</hi> and <hi>credere,</hi> that, to eate is to beleeue, although to eat the flesh of Christe be the effect of faith, bicause that by faith we eate Christ, yet may we more aptly say, to eate is to beleeue, then the Papistes say, that men may eat Christ which doe not beleeue at all. And it is a very childish so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisme, out of which M. Heskins woulde gather, that if to eate be to beleeue, and it be not lawfull for the Iewes to eate Christe, it is not lawfull for them to beleeue in Christ. For continuing in Iudaisme they can no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Christ, then they can eate the flesh of Christe. But contrariwise by their doctrine, if the sacrament be giuen
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:14727:272"/>
to a Iewe, that is no Christian, yet he eateth the body of Christ as he that beleeueth in Christe. The testimonie of Theophylact, although it make little for M. Hesk. yet as alwayes before, so nowe at the last I will refuse to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, bicause I will not yeeld to his authoritie, he being a late writer. But M. Hesk. noteth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles words, We haue an altar, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath but one altar, which is the body of Christ, and that is very true, of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church: but the hereticall and schismaticall Church of Rome hath many thousand altars, which they can not say are all one altar, although they cauill that their infinite multitudes of hostes, are one sacrifice of Christes body. Therefore the Church of Rome is not the Catholique Church of Christe, by his owne reason. And the saying of Hierome, which he citeth, <hi>Lib</hi> 2. <hi>in Hose. Cap.</hi> 8. and wresteth against vs, doth very aptly condemne him selfe and his felow Papistes for heretiques: <hi>Vnum esse altare &amp;c. The Apostle teacheth, that there is in the Church but one altar, and one faith, &amp; one baptisme, which the heretiques forsaking haue set vp to themselues many altars, not to appease God, but to increase the multitude of sinnes, therefore they are not worthie to receiue the lawes of God, seeing they haue despised them, which they haue receiued before. And if they shall speake any thing out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is not to be compared to the words of God, but to the senses of Ethnikes. These men do offer many sacrifices, and eate the flesh of them, forsaking the only sacrifice of Christ, nor eating his flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose flesh is the meat of the beleeuers, whatsoeuer they do counterfeting the order and custom of the sacrifices, whether they giue almes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they promise chastitie, whether they counterfet humilitie, and with feigned flatterings, deceiue simple persons, the Lord will receiue nothing of such sacrifices.</hi> We forsake not the only sacrifice of Christ once offred, but our whole trust is in the merits of that sacrifice, therefore we set vp no newe altars. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes set vp an other sacrifice, and therefore other altars. If our allegation &amp; interpretation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures may not be warranted by the spirite of God, iudging in the same scriptures by other textes, that are plaine and euident: we desire not that any man shall receiue them, as the Papistes
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14727:273"/>
doe, whatsoeuer the Popish Church doth define, though it be contrarie to the expresse word of God. And although wee admitte not that grosse and carnall manner of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body in that sacrament that they doe hold, yet do we eate the flesh of Christ verily after that maner, which the Papistes themselues do confesse to be the only profitable eating thereof, namely that which is spirituall. What our workes be, I referre them to the iudgement of God, wee boast not of them. And although fasting for merite bee iustly punishable by statute, yet godly and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian fasting is not cleane exiled out of our Church, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh not so often perhaps vsed, as meere it were it should. Our doctrine of fasting is sound and agreeable to the word of God, and therefore we dare iustifie it, our doing wee will not iustifie, nor excuse our faultes, but humbly submitte our selues to his iudgement, who knoweth our hearts, of whome we craue pardon for our offences, and grace to keepe his commandements. But now to conclude this matter, I will produce one testimonie of Gelasius an ancient Bishop of Rome, which I thinke shuld be of great weight with al Papists, if they giue in deed such reuerence either to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> See, or to antiquitie as they pretend. <q>And thus he writeth <hi>Cont.

            <p n="1">1 The first I graunt, that Christe hath alwayes had and alwayes shall haue a Church on earth, out of which there is no saluation. This Churche consisteth of men whiche beleeue in him, haue their faith sealed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by outward sacramentes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Church is the kindome of Christe, the Citie of God, and the kingdome of heauen, wherein Christ shall reigne for euer.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The kingdome is spread more largely, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more prudently, then any earthly kingdome euer was, euen to the endes of the worlde, &amp; to continue world without end.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Notwithstanding all this, to say that the Churche, or this kingdome of Christe was hidden any one houre from the eyes of the worlde, is not to make it more obscure then any earthly kingdome euer was as Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Sander doeth affirme: for the glorie of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome whiche is spirituall neuer did, nor shall appeare to the wicked of this worlde. The Churche is an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our faith, and faith is of those thinges whiche are not seene, Hebru. 11. but with spirituall eyes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the exaltation of the Lordes hill that Esaie 2. and Micheas 4. doe speake of, is of a spirituall aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a citie built vpon an hill, is euerie true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Gods worde.

A citie built vpon an hill can not be hidden. Neither do men light a candel and put it vnder a bushel, but vpon a candlestick, that it may giue light to al them, that are in the house. But this brightnesse is heauenly and spirituall, not worldly and carnall, to be seene of the children of light, not of the blind bussards of the worlde.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Churche dyed not when the Apostles dyed, for Bishops and Pastours succeeded in their place, as lightes set vpon the candlestickes, which are the seuerall Churches: Apoc. 1.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The light and glorie of Gods Churche, commeth chiefely from the Bishops and Pastours thereof, I meane from their heauenly doctrine, not from their persons, as Maister Sander perhaps would insinuate.

Finally although some Churches haue ben known by their Pastors and Bishops, yet haue there bene infinite Churches known to be in the worlde, whose Bishops &amp; Pastours are altogether vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. And although some heretical and Schismatical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, haue bene knowen by their heades, yet not all, for the Acephali were so called, because they had no head,

the Anthropomorphites also were rustical Monkes or Eremites in Aegypt, vnder no head of their owne, but the Bishop of Alexandria, which was a Catholike. Niceph. <hi>Lib.</hi> 13. <hi>Cap</hi> 10.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Although the Churche of Christ ceassed not at the end of the first fiue or sixe hundreth yeares, nor the glory of Christes kingdome was euer darkened: yet a greate number of the Bishops and pastors of the visible Church, began then to be dimme, and some altogether darke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they lighted not their candels at the word of God, the onely true light, shyning in the darke, but declined to the inuentions of men and doctrine of diuels according to the prophesie, of Saint Paule, 2. Thess. 2. of the aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and departing from the faith, 1. Tim. 4. towarde the comming &amp; reuelation of Antichrist. Neither is it true, that M. Sander saith, that after the first 600. yeares, the Church was spread into mo countries, then it was before, but the contrarie. For Mahomet soone after peruerted the greatest parte of the worlde, whereas Affrica, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ouerrunne, and Christianitie spoyled by the Vandales, which were either Heathens, or Arrians. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, some small countries haue beene since that time turned to the Christian profession. And as it is true that Pastors and Doctors must still be to the end of the worlde in the Church, and Christ neuer forsaketh the same: so is it false, that Popish Bishops, &amp; Priestes, which either were ignorant or altogether negligent in feeding and teaching the Churche with the foode and doctrine of Gods worde, whereof Saint Paule spake Ephesi. 4. or taught the doctrine of Diuels in steede thereof, be those Pastours, and Doctours by whome the preaching of the Gospell is continued, though they sitte in the same places, where sometime, the true teachers satt, euen as Antichrist their head, sitteth in the Temple of GOD, which is the proper place of Christe. Neither is the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of such late writers, as account them for successors of the Apostles and godly pastours and teachers, sufficient to authorise them for such in deed, when their whole life

and doctrine is contrarie to the writings of the Apostles, and those auncient godly Pastors &amp; Doctors.</p>
            <p n="9">9 We say not, that the Church of Christ was knowen for the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore it is sufficient ground for vs, to deny the later rout, that professeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same doctrine, to be the church of Christ. The succession of persons or places, without the continuance of the same true doctrine, can no more defende the Pope &amp; poperie, then it could defend Caiphas &amp; Sadduceisme. For Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas a Sadducei, which denyed the resurrection, coulde more certeinly declare his personall and locall successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Aaron, then the Pope can from Peter.</p>
            <p n="10">10 I haue proued before, that it is false, which Master Sander againe sayeth to be true, that Eusebius and other writers point foorth the church of 500. yeres, onely or chiefely by Bishops which ruled in Rome, Antioche, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, &amp;c.

And where he sayeth noting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, August. Ep. 165. that in olde time they were knowen to be heretikes, which departed from the knowen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Bishops &amp; Pastors, agreeing in one faith, &amp;c. it is verie true, but then this faith was proued to be true, not onely by successions of Bishops, but by the holye scriptures, as the same Augustine sayeth in the same place: <q>
                  <hi>Quanquam nos non tam de istis documentis praesumamus, quàm de scripturis sanctis.</hi> Although wee do not presume so much of those documentes, as of the holie scriptures.</q> To conclude, all practises and councels, that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holie Scriptures, were then refused,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Practises Councels.</hi>
               </note> euen as they be nowe. Cyprian refused the practise of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the communion with water, because it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:14727:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the scripture. Augustine refused the practise of Cyprian, and the Councell of Carthage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for rebaptizing them that were baptized by heretikes: and for the same cause, our church refuseth the Masse, the Laterane, and the Tridentin councels, without daunger of schisme or heresie.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The vniuersall church is a spiritual collection, of many members into one bodie, whereof Christe is the onely head, both in heauen and earth, as the Apostle sayeth Eph. 3. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The vnitie hereof is mainteyned by following the direction of his worde, and his holye spirite. The order of particuler churches, is maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the seuerall gouernement of them. But their whole church, although it be like an armie of men well sett in arraye, yet can it haue no one chiefe Capteine in earth to direct it, but hee that is omnipotent, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in heauen, not onely to ouerlooke it, but to rule and order it. For no mortall man can looke into all places, knowe all cases, prouide against all mischiefes, nor giue ayde in all dangers.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Therefore Peter was none such: and although <hi>Pascere</hi> be both to feede and rule, yet it is to rule like a Shepeheard, and not like an Emperour. Neither were the sheepe by Christe committed to Peter more then to the other, because hee loued more then the other, but Peter was charged as hee woulde by his forwardnesse shewe more zeale and loue then the rest, so to employe the same to the feeding of Christes flocke. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Maister Sanders quoteth Chrysostome in Ioan Hom. 87. I knowe not wherefore, except it were to shewe the prerogatiue of Peter aboue the rest. You shall heare what his iudgement was of Peters authoritie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his prerogatiue, <hi>in Act. Apost. Hom.</hi> 3. <hi>Iam &amp; illud considera, quòd &amp; Petrus agit omnia ex communi dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipulorum sententia, nihil authoritate sua, nihil cum imperio.</hi> Nowe consider this also howe euen Peter doth all things by the common decree of the disciples, nothing by his owne authoritie, nothing by commaundement, or
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:14727:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with rule.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Therefore it is false which Maister Sander affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the gouernement of the faithfull was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to one aboue all other: for it did as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to euery Apostle, as to Peter to feede the sheepe of Christe. And when distinction for orders sake was made in the ministerie by God, Peter acknowledged the Apostleship of the circumcision, which was neither the greatest nor the chiefest parte of the church, to be allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him Gal. 2. vers. 7. Therefore, although there be one flocke of Christ vpon earth, yet Christe is the onely one shepeheard thereof,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>One shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</hi>
               </note> as he affirmeth Iohn. 10. vers. 16 Although hee haue many seruauntes that ouersee his sheepe, as they bee scattered in many places, whose col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection into one flocke, as it is not locall, nor visible, so they must needes haue an almightie, and inuisible shepeheard to gather them together, and no mortal man were he neuer so excellent, least of all the Pope the vilest man aliue.</p>
            <p n="14">14 For which cause, although euery particuler flocke must haue one Pastour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar flock.</hi>
               </note> which is not necessarie, for some may haue more then one, yet cannot the whole church militant on earth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant.</hi>
               </note> haue one earthly man to be head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And albeit M. Sander woulde proue it particuler, in respect of the whole number of the elect, yet is it vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall in respect of all perticuler congregations on earth, at one time, and so vniuersall, as no singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man can possibly knowe it, much lesse gouerne it.</p>
            <p n="15">15 And therefore although Christe the vniuersall shepeheard wil suffer no particuler church to continue without a seruaunt to ouersee it vnder him, yet will hee committ to no seruaunt any charge, which is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to execute, as is the ouersight of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or vniuersall Church vppon earth. And here note the impudencie of the Papistes, which affirme that their particular Synagogue of Rome, is the Catholike or vniuersall Church, and yet denye, the whole church of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:14727:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ militant on earth, to be the Catholik churche.</p>
            <p n="16">16 It shall neuer be proued, that Peter was made by Christe the firste sheapheard ouer all the sheepe of Christ on the earth, otherwise then as all the Apostles were.</p>
            <p>And yet if that were true, and that which Maister San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inferreth also, that one chiefe sheapeheade shoulde be like Peter, as one that executeth the same office that Peter did: yet it followeth by no reason of consequence, that he concludeth, that all other bishops are excluded from this office, sauing, he that occupyeth his place at Rome, if euer he had any there. For he that were moste like to Peter in giftes, meete to execute such an office, were by all reason more meete to succeede Peter, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vnlearned asse, &amp; wicked helhound, that is aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into that chaire of Rome, where Peter is supposed to haue sitt.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Nowe seeing Peter is sayd, first to haue sit at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche, and afterward to haue remoued to Rome, what reason is there seeing his supremacie was personall, that his successoures of Antioche after his death shoulde not claime it, as well as they of Rome, if it went by right of succession? For change of place can make no change of right. And the title of Antioche is the elder, therfore the better. Except Master Sander will say, that Rome hath it by his legacie, and then he must shewe vs S. Peters last will and testament.</p>
            <p n="18">18 And whereas he sayeth, it is well knowen, that S. Peter dyed at Rome, it is not so well knowen, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ dyed at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop of Ierusalem should more reasonably claime this supremacie &amp; vicarship vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ. And that Peter writeth from Babylon, it is an argument he was not at Rome, but in Babylon of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, although S. Hierom thinketh he was at Rome, and calleth Rome Babylon as the seat of Antichrist, which M Sander is content to take, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might haue some colour of Scripture, to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Peter was at Rome. Although it be such, as may serue to proue Rome to be the seate of Antichrist, but not the chiefe seat of the Church of
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:14727:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ. Apoc. 19.</p>
            <p n="19">19 It is true that among al countries and cities, none was so notable as the citie and people of Rome, because of the seat of the Empire that was there, in which respecte also the churche of Rome was muche noted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced, so long as it continued in synceritie. But the bishops thereof, haue not bene so notable as many other of other cities. What one bishop of Rome like to Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius of Alexandria, Chrysostome of Constantinople, Ambrose of Millain? Yea poore Augustine of Hippo, or Osius of Corduba in their times, or before their times? And whereas hee saieth, no places so conuenient for the head of Christes churche to be setled in, it is altogether false, because it was not conuenient, that the heade of Christs churche should be setled there, where Antichrist shoulde sit, lest the one should be taken for the other.</p>
            <p n="20">20 And although it were graunted that Italie is the fittest place for worldly Empire, yet it foloweth not that it is aptest for spirituall gouernement. For in all worldly respects, the land of Promise far excelleth Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which now is the most slauishe countrie in Europe, being parted into so many seignories almost, as there be great cities, as Machiauill doth confesse.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Although at somtime, no citie in Italie was so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as Rome, yet was it not so alwayes, since Christes birth, for it hath bene diuers times taken and destroyed by the Gotthes, and for many yeares left vnhabited. And although it was most notable in worldly glory, yet that was most vnmeete for to set vp the kingdom of Christ, &amp; when it was in greatest glory it did alwaies withstand it. Therefore Ierusalem in the lande of promise, if God woulde haue chosen one citie for his vicare to sit in, had bene in all respectes the meetest place in the worlde.</p>
            <p n="22">22 That he saith no Apostle was more glorious then S. Peter, it is vntrue, for S. Paule affirmeth that he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with him, and the rest, &amp; laboured more then they all. 2. Cor. 11. vers. 5. &amp; 1. Cor. 15. vers. 10. But admit that Peter was the chiefe, yet it followeth not, which M.S. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:14727:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the bishop of Rome hath the most notable predecessor or founder of his chaire, that euer anye bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had. For the bishop of Antioche, hath the same by his owne confession, and the elder title.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Where he saith that the church of Rome, was also founded by S. Paule, it is a manifest vntruth: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church was there before S. Paule euer came there, as it is plaine by his Epistle to the Romaines, and before Peter also came thither, as it is plaine by the Epistle to the Galath. cap. 2. And therefore seeing the church of Rome was first founded, neither by Peter nor Paule, she hath nothing to brag of their preheminence, which many churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles, might with more equitie challenge. As for the bequething of Peter and Paule, that hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, when he can shew vs a copie of their Testament, we wil shape him an other answere.</p>
            <p n="24">24 That there were many martyrs and confessours at Rome in the primitiue churche, the cause was the great multitude of people in that church, by reason of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens of the imperial city. But this proueth no preroga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue of ancestrie ouer other churches. That so many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first bishops suffred death for Christs cause (although it may be doubted of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of 30. &amp; vpwarde, because no auncient writer doth testifie it) it was by reason they were neerest vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest persecutors, which were the emperors of Rome. But this proueth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supremacy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishop of Rome, before the bishops of other cities, who haue likewise suffred death for Christ.</p>
            <p n="25">25 It is vtterly false y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no faithful people of any citye had euer so notable witnes, as the church of Rome of S.

            <p n="27">27 The Papists liue vnder a visible head, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same is Antichrist, the protestants vnder an inuisible head, which is Christ. The Pope fitteth in Rome the mother of al ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, hauing nothing to brag of, but the vertues of such as haue dwelled there before him, and no good qualitie of his owne. Yet the title of vniuersall shepherd M.S. denieth vnto him, although he most arrogantly do vsurpe it. Howbeit properly M.S. saith, he ought not to haue it.</p>
            <p n="28">28 Therfore the bishops of Rome before Gregory the first, refused the same title as prophane &amp; proude, which belongeth onely to Christ.

            <p n="29">29 Gregorie the first in deede, tooke vppon him the humble style of the seruaunt of the seruaunts of God, as M.S. saith, but his successors, vsing that title for a forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, hauing bene content to be called Lord of Lords, and God aboue all gods, and our lord God the Pope, and the most holiest, and an hundreth more blasphemous titles, beside treading on the Emperours necke, &amp; such like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of prophane pride, as Nero, Heliogabalus, no Dioclesian euer shewed the like.</p>
            <p n="30">30 It is not to be proued that he saith, there were 4. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks at the beginning, nor that the Pope of Rome was chiefe. For the councell of Nice, Canon 6. doth make the patriarke of Alexandria, and the rest equall with the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome. Although afterward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishops of Rome, as they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ambitious, when persecution was staied, by prerogatiue of the imperiall citie, challenged a kinde of primacie, yet not of authoritie, but of order.
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:14727:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And whereas he sayeth, other Patriarches were preferred in respect of the affinitie they had with S. Peter, it is false: for the Patriarch of Constantinople was placed next to him of olde Rome, because Constantinople was newe Rome, &amp; the imperiall cittie <hi>Concil. Constantinop. Cap.</hi> 2. or after <hi>Garanza. Cap.</hi> 5. That the Pope did erect patriarchal Seas at Aquileia, &amp; at Senis, it was not for that the other were infected with heresie, but that they refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Antichristian authoritie, bought of Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas the murtherer, by Boniface the third: for if his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie had bene so great, as is pretended, he would haue deposed those hereticall bishops, and set vp Catholikes in their places, rather then to haue spoyled the seates of their dignities for euer, for the fault of the bishops.</p>
            <p n="31">31 It is false y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he sayeth, neuer any bishop was so much esteemed as the bishop of Rome, for Athanasius of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, was more esteemed of the godly, then any bishop of Rome, in his time. Likewise when the Sea of Rome vsurped prerogatiue, it was reiected by the Councell of Africa, which decreed that none should appeale thither &amp; discouered the counterfaiting of the bishops of Rome. <hi>Con. Mileuit. Cap.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp; Conc. Aphrican. Ep. ad Coelestin.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it was reiected of the church of Alexandria, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of great dissention arose, <hi>Con Affric. Cap.</hi> 68. That Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tertullian, Optatus, Hierom, Augustine, Eugenius, Theodoretus poynted to the church of Rome, as to a witnesse of trueth, it proueth her clearnesse from those heresies in their tymes, but giueth her none authoritie ouer other churches, nor yet maketh her a rule of trueth to all churches, for then there needed none other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against heretikes, but the authoritie of the church of Rome, whereas the testimonie of that church was one of the weakest reasons they vsed, and that least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.</p>
            <p n="32">32 That he affirmeth other cities to haue chosen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of their owne tongue, it is also true of Rome. For he cannot shewe one Pope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ignorant of the Latine tongue, while it was spoken in Rome. And not many,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:14727:281"/>
I thinke not one ignorant of the Italian tongue, since that time, although they were borne in other countries. Besides that it is the fondest reason that euer I heard, one or other alledge, that the Popes haue bene borne in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse countries, therefore they are supreme heade of the church, more then other bishops that were bishops in the countries where they were born: and yet more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish that speaking of Bishops of other tongues, hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth so manye places all of one tongue: As Syna, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche, Galile, Ierusalem, Bethelem, which are all of one tongue: Campania, Thuscia, Aquileia, Pisa, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, Bononia, Millaine, Parma, Rauenna, which are all Italian: Gascoyne, Lorayne, Sauoy, Burgundie, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Tholose, which are all frenche: Saxonie, Bauier, Hollande, Alsaria, Mastriche, which are all duche: Cappadocia, Thracia, Creta, Sicilia, Sardinia, Athens, Nicopolis, which are all Greeke. There remaineth Spaine, which is in a manner Italian, and last of all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande and Affrick. So that there are not past fiue or sixe diuerse tongues of so many places as hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to bleare the eyes of foolish Papistes: As if one shoulde saye, the Bishops of Caunterburie haue beene borne, some in Yorke shire, some in Durham, some in Chester, some in London, some in Norfolke, some in Cambridge, &amp;c.

            <p n="33">33 The See of Rome in deed was verie forward in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping authoritie of a chiefe iudge ouer other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as Victor in excommunicating the bishops of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, about the celebration of Easter. But they vtterly neglected his sentence, yea, and diuerse did not (as Maister Sanders sayeth) gently wish him not to deale so seuerely, but sharpely rebuked him for his presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contention, as Eusebius sayeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. <q>

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:14727:281"/>
which sharply reprehended Victor, of which number Irenaeus was one. And whereas hee sayeth that Saint Cypriane desyreth Pope Stephanus to depose Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus bishop of Arles in Fraunce, it is false, for hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth Stephanus beeing somewhat slacke, against the Nouatians, to write his letters vnto his fellowe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in Fraunce, as he him self oft had done, that they woulde depose Martianus the heretike, and suffer him no longer to insult ouer the churche, which argueth the remissenes of Stephanus, to doe that which was the charitable duetie of euerie bishop, as Cyprian sheweth, but proueth not his authoritie ouer all bishops.</q> That Felix the thirde deposed Aacarius bishop of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, hee shewed the time of the full reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriste to bee at hande, yet did hee it not of his owne authoritie, but by authoritie of a Synode, and afterwarde by a Synode restored him.</p>
            <p>But Iustinianus the Emperour deposed two bishoppes of Rome, Syluerius and Vigilius by his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p n="34">34 That the bishop of Rome hath beene made the Committie of diuerse Councels, to receiue the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as haue beene noted of heresies, after their repentance, it prooueth no superioritie in the worlde, but a good opinion that those Councels had of his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>

The Councell of Sardike which M.

Liberatus whom he citeth for the appeale of Athanasius, affirmeth that the Councel of Chalcedon confirmed by the Emperor, gaue no place to the contradiction of the Bishop of Rome, nor his legates. Cap. 13. which disproueth his suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, more then any appeale can proue it. As for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale of Athanasius, if any were, it was euer ruled by the Emperour, who appointed him a synode to iudge his cause at Tyre. Socrat. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28. &amp; Theodorete testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that after he was called to Rome by Iulius the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, by the Emperour Constantius his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his cause was referred to the councell of Sardica, when he had first appealed to the Emperour Constans, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. He citeth Chrys. <hi>Ep. ad Innocentium,</hi> to proue that he did appeale to the Bishop of Rome, where there is no such matter. Only he declareth how iniuriously he was dealt withal, by meanes of Theophilus Bishop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, from whome he appealed not to the Bishop of Rome, but to a Synode. Of the appeale of Flauianus, we haue spoken euen now by the confession of Leo himselfe <hi>Ep.</hi> 23. As for other appeales of later times, they proue the ambition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romish bishops that would receiue them, although of many they were misliked.</p>
            <p n="37">37 That Gelasius affirmed bishops condemned by prouincial councels were restored by the Pope alone, hee citeth his Epist. <hi>ad Faustum,</hi> in which is no such matter, &amp; yet if it were so, I say it proueth nothing, but the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that See, which before his time, began to encrease toward a supremacie, and not long after obteined, that it sought for. But from the beginning it was not so. The bishop of Rome bearing witnesse of him self for his
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:14727:282"/>
owne aduauntage is not to be credited. In that Epistle he sheweth that Acacius by Lyra was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned according to the Councell of Chalcedon, which was lawful not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him, but for any other Bishop to haue done, in as much as he inuented no newe heresie, but did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with an other heresie alreadie condemned in a Councell.</p>
            <p n="38">38 In the third generall Councell holden at Ephesus, there is mention that Cyrillus was President of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but not that hee was Lieuetenant of the Bishop of Rome, although Euasius a late writer in comparison, doth so suppose. But the wordes of the Councel are these: <q>
                  <hi>Deni<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Petrus &amp; Ioannes aequalis sunt ad alterutrum dignitatis, propter quod Apostoli &amp; sancti discipuli esse monstrantur.</hi> Peter and Iohn are of equall dignitie, one with the other, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are shewed to be Apostles and holy Disciples.</q> This confession of the Councel maketh more against the Popes supremacie, then the Lieuetenantship of Cyrillus to the Pope, if it were true, could proue for it.</p>
            <p n="39">39 Maister Sander saith (without proofe but of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining times almost 500. yeares after Christe, and later) that the See of Rome had Legates both ordinarie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, throughout all Christendome, which if it were true, proueth no more his supremacie, then that the King of Spaine hath dominion ouer all those countries, where he hath Legates ordinarie and extraordinarie. He citeth the seuenth Canon of the councel of Sardica, which was, that he might send a Priest from his side: Which in deede was a restraint of his vsurped authoritie, and not a confirmation or an enlargement thereof. For the Canon is this: That if any Bishop, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was deposed by the Bishops of his owne countrie, did appeale to the Bishoppe of the Church of Rome, the Bishop of Rome should write to the Bishops of the next prouince, to examine his cause, and if the partie by his opportunitie should moue the Bishop of Rome the second time to be heard againe, then he might send <hi>Presbyterum à latere,</hi> an elder from his side, one or more, which either with the Bishops aforesaid, should
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:14727:283"/>
iudge and determine the matter, or else leaue it wholy to the iudgment of the Bishops of the Prouince. By this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non the singular authoritie of the Romish Bishop is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly excluded.</p>
            <p n="40">40 The examples of Bishops Perigenes and Martinus translated by the Bishops of Rome, in the declining times, proueth not the perpetual supremacie of the Pope: seeing by generall Councels al such translations haue bene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in elder times. <hi>Nic. c.</hi> 15. <hi>chalc. c.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p n="41">41 The consent of the B. of Rome was not so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to generall Councels, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were held w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out his presence, or his sending. For concerning his personal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he was not at any of the 4. first approued generall Councels: neither any for him at the second of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was held at Constantinople, where Nectarius Bishop of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie was president. Also the fourth of Chalcedon, made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> See of Constantinople equal with the See of Rome, which although Leo Bishop of Rome disalowed, yet did it take place as Liberatus testifieth, Cap. 13.</p>
            <p n="42">42 Although the Bishop of Rome had his Legate in some prouinciall Councels, yet it is great impudencie to say, he had them in al. And such as then were present, they bare no rule or preheminence, but as the Legates of other Bishops. Philippus and Asellius were at the Councell of Aphrica, in which decrees were made against the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Bishop of Rome, and yet they subscribed, cap. 92</p>
            <p n="43">43 That the Pope hath procured a fewe nations to be conuerted within these thousand or 900. yeares, as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by Augustine, Saxoni by Bonifacius &amp;c: it can not excuse him from being Antichrist him selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although M. Sander saith, we account him to be but the forerunner of Antichrist. For though Gregorie otherwise a ceremoniall and superstitious man, was moued with zeale of Christes glorie, to seeke the conuersion of as many as he could, yet the Popes which followed after him, in procuring the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of some countries, rather by cruell warres, then by preaching of the Gospell, as Prusia, Liuonia, Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, &amp;c. sought their owne glorie and aduauntage, vnder
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:14727:283"/>
the colour of Christes religion, and therefore were not diuided against Satan, but ioyned with him in hypocrisie.</p>
            <p n="44">44 As for the conuersion of the Infidels in the newe found landes, is a newe found argument, to proue the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of the See of Rome. Like as the conuersion of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Iewe by Pius. 5. Many Iewes and some of greate learning as Emanuel Tremelius, haue bene conuerted to the Gospel. And one within this two yeares was baptized in London.</p>
            <p n="45">45 That the See of Rome hath so long flourished like a Queene in worldly pompe, it is the more like to the See and citie of Antichrist, Apoc. 18. verse. 7. And that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the other Patriarches, and their Bishops be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with Infidels, it letteth them not to be true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For Esaie 60. prophesieth not of worldly pompe, but of the spirituall glorie of the Church, which was as great before Constantius stayed the persecution, as euer since.</p>
            <p n="46">46 That no Bishop was euer so honoured of Princes, Kings, or Emperours, as the Pope &amp;c: it proueth him to be Antichrist, and his Church the whore of Babylon, Apo. 17. vers. 2. &amp;. 17. &amp;. cap. 13. &amp; 16.</p>
            <p n="47">47 That the Frenchmen deposed their King Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus by the Oracle of Pope Zacharie, which discharged them of their lawful othe of obedience, it proueth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily the Pope to be Antichrist. Peter saith, Feare God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King, 1. Pet. 2.</p>
            <p n="48">48 And much more that Pope Leo the third did trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Empire it selfe into the West. For Peter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded obedience to be giuen to euery ordinance of man, for the Lord, whether to the King, as to the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, or to those rulers that are sent of him. 1. Pet. 2.</p>
            <p n="49">49 That Pope Gregorie the fift gaue an order for the election of the Emperour, confirmeth our iudgement of the Pope to be Antichrist, as also that Nicholas the first, threatened the Emperour Michael the ouerthrowe of the Empire of the East, whereof hee by his proud rebellion and disobedience, and diuiding the West part from it, was a cause.</p>
            <p n="50">
               <pb n="552" facs="tcp:14727:284"/>50 That the succession of the Bishops of Rome hath ben continued in histories with the reigne of Emperours and Kings, it proueth in deede, that the Church of Rome hath ben either very famous, when it was gouerned of good Bishops, or infamous when it was degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Antichristian tyrannie, but this proueth no more the authoritie thereof to be lawfull, or the religion good, then the succession of Heathen tyrants, Emperours, Kings, &amp; great Turkes, proueth their religion true, or their vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation lawfull. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of worldly fame, that M.S. boasteth of, is spirituall darknesse, and not the light of the Gospell, which our Sauiour speaketh of, Luke 5. No man lighteth a candle, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="51">51 As it is true, that the Bishops of Rome in the first 300. yeares were greatly persecuted by tyrants, so is it false, that all heretiques agreed to resist that See. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Bishops were heretiques. Liberius was an Arrian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by Fortunatianus: Hierom. in Catalog. Vigilius was priuily an Eutychian, as appeareth by an Epistle of his, written to those heretiques at the procurement of the Empresse: <hi>Liberatus Cap.</hi> 22. Honorius was a Monothelite, condemned in the sixt generall Councell at Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople: Act. 13. Anastasius was a fauourer of Nestorians, as many Ecclesiastical histories do confesse: <hi>Garanza in Anast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="52">52 That the Church of Rome hath continued, although diuers Christian Princes haue opposed them selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it with the citizens of Rome, and the Cardinalls, and that neither the wicked life of the Popes, nor the schismes of many Popes at once haue subuerted it, doeth not proue it to be the rocke, against which the gates of hell shall not preuaile. For when Antichristian heresie, and diuelish wickednesse hath ouerflowed all the Church of Rome, it is manifest, the gates of hell haue mightily preuailed against that See, although the finall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of that Antichristian head with the body, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued vnto the almightie power of our Sauiour Christe toward the end of the world: 2. Thessa. 2. And it is false that Christian Princes, the Romane Citizens, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:14727:284"/>
or the factions of Diuers Popes haue assaulted the See of Rome, but rather the ambition, and tyrannie of some persons occupying the same.</p>
            <p n="53">53 It is false that all countries which forsooke the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Bishop of Rome, were shortly after pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by Infidels, for Affrica was none otherwise posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Vandales, then Italy by the Gothes &amp; other barbarous nations. The Graecians immediately before their oppression by the Turkes, were reconciled to the Church of Rome in the councell of Ferrar, and Florens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Before which time the Bohemians forsooke the Romish See, and yet remaine a nation at this day: howe many mightie nations haue forsaken the the Pope? which by Gods grace shall be kept as long from oppression of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, as they keep in obedience of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel, the contempt whereof, and not of the Pope was punished in the Asians, Africans and Graecians. And the prophecie of Esaie, 60. <hi>That nation and kingdome, which shall not serue thee shall perish,</hi> is to be vnderstoode, of finall and eternall perdition, and not of oppression by Infidels. For the nation of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Turkes, Saracens, and other which submit not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Church of Christ, shal perish, although they triumph in the worlde neuer so long.</p>
            <p n="54">54 Diuerse councels without the bishop of Rome, did with as great and greater credite, determine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Bookes of holie scripture, as Gelasius did with his 70. <hi>Bishops, Cap.</hi> 59. <hi>Carth.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 74. and others.</p>
            <p n="55">55 The Popes liberalitie toward forrein nations, was neuer so great by the hundreth parte, as his couetous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions and Antichristian exactions haue beene, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse Matth. Paris. Matth. West, Anno Reg. 1244. and in a manner all Popish Historiographers of late times. As for his liberalitie in these times, is but to his owne bondslaues, whom he hyreth with a litle exhibition, to blase his charitie, least hee should bee forsaken of all men.</p>
            <p n="56">56 The greatest archheretike that euer was, is the Pope of Rome, so farre passing the archheretikes that haue bene
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:14727:285"/>
in the other patriarchall Sees, as Antichrist the head of all heresies, passeth the members of that bodie. For other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes take away but some part of Christes person, or his office, but the Pope vnder pretence of honoring him, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him quite out of place, by his vsurped suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, false doctrine, blasphemous sacrifice of the Masse, and all other his abhominations. And that our Sauiour CHRISTE prayed for Peter, that his faith might not fayle, it perteined onely to his person, and to the temptation that immediately followed. For otherwise Peter erred, when he was reproued of God in vision Act. 10. and of Paule Gallath. 2. And that Bishops of Rome haue erred and beene heretiques, I haue proued in the 51. article, to which you may adde Iohn the 23. that was condemned in the councell of Constance for that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the immortalitie of the soule, the resurrection of the bodie, and the life euerlasting. Sess. 11.</p>
            <p n="57">57 That the See of Rome hath made so many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked decrees, so vniuersally obserued, with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many nations, it came not of the spirite of godly vnitie, but of the efficacie of errour, whiche God sent into the worlde for a iust plague of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the trueth. 2. Thessalonians 2. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of so many nations vnto her abhominable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, proueth Rome to be Babilon the mother of all abhominations, that hath made all nations dronke with the wine of the furie of her fornications, Apoc. 18. verse 3. The degrees of marriage prohibited, are of the Lawe of God, and not of the Pope: the celebration of Easter although it be an indifferent ceremonie, yet it is elder then the Antichristian authoritie of the Pope. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the mysterie of iniquitie beganne to worke in Victor about it. That many Bishops and priuate men haue written to suche Bishops of Rome as were lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, namely Leo, and Gregorie, for their resolution in diuerse questions, it proueth no supremacie: for as many haue written in like cases to Augustine a poore Bishop
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:14727:285"/>
of Hippo, and to Hieronyme but a Prieste of Rome, yea Damasus Bishop of Rome himselfe hath written to Hieronyme for his iudgement. Pope Sergius did write to Ceolfride Abbot of Woremouth in England, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued of certeine questions of Beda, one of his Monkes. Math. West. Ant. 734.</p>
            <p n="59">59 That this resorte to Rome for councell, was not onely of deuotion but of duetie, because the Pope had reserued the hardest cases to his owne iudgement as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses did, hee bringeth no proofe but the Popes owne decrees, whiche are of small credite in his owne case, and the corrupt practise of the later times, when men had submitted themselues vnto the beast.</p>
            <p n="60">60 That not onely the Bishoppes of Italie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of Sicilia, whiche is not farre off did come in person to Rome at certeine times, it prooueth not that all Bishoppes in the worlde were obedient to the Bishop of Rome, or were bound so to visite him, or that they did so visite him.</p>
            <p n="61">61 The primacie of the Bishoppe of Rome in olde times, was but of order, not of power, his presidence in councels was but honour, not of authoritie, and that by graunt or permission at the pleasure of the councell. <hi>Ioan.

            <p n="62">62 That Iustinian was content to permitte to the Pope of the Elder Rome to be <hi>Primus Sacerdotum,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the definition of the Canons, it proueth not his pretended supreame authoritie ouer all other men, but onely that he was first in Order. For hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe deposed two Popes Syluerius, and Vigilius. And
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:14727:286"/>
where Maister Sander interpreteth the definitions of the Cannon, to be all the foure first councells, he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacheth too much, for the Pope could neuer proue his primacie by the Councell of Nice, although he forged a decree thereof as is shewed before.</p>
            <p n="63">63 It is true, that Phocas the traytor and murderer of his M. Mauritius vsurping the Empire, for a great summe of monie receiued of Boniface the thirde, determined the controuersie between Constantinople and Rome, giuing Rome the title of Antichrist, which from such a holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it claimeth and vsurpeth vnto this day. But if the See of Rome, had beene the head of all churches by the word of God, what neede had the Bishop of Rome to buy it of Phocas, but onely to shewe himselfe the successor of Simon Magus, not of Simon Peter?</p>
            <p n="64">64 As it is true, that God vsed the peace and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Romane Empire, to spread abroade the doctrine of the Gospel, so is it altogether vntrue, that Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine resigned the citie of Rome, to Syluester the Bishop thereof, because he builded another imperiall citie in the East to keepe those partes of the Empire in peace and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. For it is well knowen, that many hundreth yeres after Constantine the great, his successors inioyed the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and pallaces of Rome, vntill they were defaced by the Gothes, and yet afterward the citie was restored to Iustinianus the Emperour out of the handes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gothes by Bellisarius and Narses. And whereas M. Sander saith that neuer any Emperour of the West had his seate at Rome after Constantinus, he sheweth either his great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, or ignorance in histories. For although some of them occupied in warres kept at Milliane, Treueres or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cities, yet is it vtterly false, that there was neuer any Emperour suffered to make his ordinarie mansion place at Rome. For Honorius, &amp; Valentinianus Iunior, dwelt at Rome, before the subuersion of it by the Gothes, &amp; many other, euen vnto Augustus. After which time, Italy being oppressed with barbarous nations, was no place for the Emperours safetie to dwell in. In which meane time, the

Pope grewe to such greatnesse, that he made challenge not onely to the citie, but euen to the Empire it selfe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vppon himselfe Antichrist, to remoue it from the East vnto the West, which was in deede a great miracle, but such a miracle as was more meete for Antichriste to make, then the successour of Peter.</p>
            <p n="65">65 It is true that Rome hath lost no preheminence by the departure of the Emperor, for as Chrysostome shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in 2. Thes. Antichrist was to succeed the Emperour in the seat of the Empire being made voide, and to vsurpe all auctoritie both of God and men: pretending the seat of Peter, but being in deede the seat of the beast: Apoca. 13. and of the Whore of Babylon, Apo. 17. as both Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine and Hieronym doe often times confesse.

            <p n="66">66 Although it be confessed by vs that the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of the first place was graunted to the bishoppes of Rome in many metings and councels, yet is it not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that it was so alwayes, nor in all generall councels. And therefore this our confession prooueth not the Pope to be suche a starre, candell, or light, as M. Sanders doeth imagine. Nor that hee shoulde bee heade of the church, because hee was first in place, no more then an archbishoppe is head of the churche of his prouince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is first in place, although his church be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the members of a body.

            <p n="67">67 It is a faint proofe, that the church of Rome is the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:14727:287"/>
head, rote and mother of all churches, because Ambrose and Hierome called the faith of the church of Rome the Catholike faith, at suche time as it was true and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in deede. As if a man shoulde say, the faith of the church of Englande, is all one with the Catholike fayth, therefore the churche of Englande is the head, roote and mother to all churches. Likewise that the Vandales which were barbarous people, and Arrians, calleth the Catholikes Romanes, differing from them in nation, as much as in religion.</p>
            <p n="68">68 The fathers neuer beleeued that the Romaine churche cannot erre in the profession of their faith. For <hi>Cyprian lib</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Romanos, &amp;c.</hi> Falshood canne haue no accesse to the Romanes, meaneth not (as M.S. saith) such Romaines as tarye in the vnitie of S.

Paule prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: therefore hee saith, <hi>Ad Romanos, quorum fides, &amp;c.</hi> The Romanes whose faith was praised by the Apostles. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he speaketh not of erringe in profession of fayth, but of falshood in winking at Scismatikes, which sought for a refuge in S. Peters Chaire, the principal churche, beinge iustly banished out of other Churches. And that Cyprian thought not, that the Churche of Rome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in profession of faith, it is most manifest by this, that if he had bin so perswaded, he woulde not haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the iudgement of the churche of Rome, decreed with his felow bishops, to adnihilate the sacraments mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred by heretikes. As for the decretall epistle of Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, we reiect it, as a counterfet with all the rest of that rable, in which these ancient bishops of Rome are faine to write so barbarously, as no Carter did speake Latine in their time when they liued, and alway extoll the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that See of Rome, as though in these great perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, they had nothing els to talke of, but their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues &amp; priuiledges. The testimonies of Leo which he citeth, sauour of a Romane stomake, drawing as neere to the Antichristian pride, as the man was to the time which wrote them. Barnarde was but a late writer, when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:14727:287"/>
was in the top of his pride, &amp; therefore his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment argueth the corruption of his time.

            <p n="69">69 To proue that the Emperours acknowledged the church of Rome to be the head of all churches, he citeth Iustinian which was almost 660. yeares after Christ. <hi>Cod. de summa trini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Likewise he citeth the saying of Eugenius, not long before bishop of Carthage, which called the Churche of Rome the head of all Churches, and yet he reposed not all his confidence in the bishoppe of Romes aucthoritie: but saide he woulde write to his brethren the other bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, that they might come to demonstrate the true faith against the Arrians, especially to the bishop of the Church of Rome, which is the head of all the Churches, meaning the principall Churche, <hi>Vict. lib.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="70">70 Thirdly hee citeth the words of the bishop of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara, intreatinge the Emperour Iustinian for Syluerius bishoppe of Rome, whom he had banished. There is not one king, as Syluerius is Pope ouer the church of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whol world. This bishoppe being 550. yeares after Christ, and a suter also, is not sufficient to make the Bishop of Rome so great a king. And whereas Maister Sander sayeth, that the Emperor yeelded to his saying, &amp; repented &amp; willed
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:14727:288"/>
him to be restored, and therfore chargeth M. Iewel with impudency for alledging the example of Iustinian bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Syluerius, and Vigilius, to proue that he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to doe in the churche of Rome, affirming that hee might as well alledge the homicide and adultery of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, to prooue that hee had somewhat to doe with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans wife: the trueth is, M. Sanders forgeth a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contrary to al histories, which affirme that Syluerius dyed in banishment. And how vnlike it is, that Iustinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus repented of the banishinge of Syluerius, vppon the words of the bishop of Patara, in respect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was Pope ouer the church of the whole worlde, appeareth by this, that he afterward banished Vigilius his next successor in the same sea. The wordes of Liberatus whom M.S. citeth cap. 22. bee these: <q>

To conclude the sayinges of Gregory bishop of Rome, in defence of his owne dignitie, are of small credit. And yet they are a great deale more modest, then the proude decrees of his successours. For he challengeth the hearing of such controuersies only, as arise in those dioces, which haue no Metropolitane or Patriarche of their owne to resort vnto, to determine them.

Neither did Eleutherius sende Fugatius and Damianus by him selfe, or as of authoritie, but being required by Lucius or Leuer Maure, one of the little Kinges of some shiere of Britaine, as Ninnius a Britaine doeth testifie. For that Lucius was King of all Britaine, it is proued false by all the Romaine histories, which testifie that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was then soueraigne of Britaine, vnder whome ruled certeine petie Kinges in some partes not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conquered.</p>
            <p n="72">72 Beda an English Saxon, more like to knowe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this lande, then Prosper a forreyne writer, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Britaines against the Pellagians heretiks, desired ayde of the Bishops of Fraunce, who by a Synod there gathered, sent Germanus and Lupus two Bishops to confute the Pelagians, without any sending to Rome, or from Coelestinus Bishop of Rome, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 17.

            <p n="73">73 The zeale of Gregorie the first is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he sent Augustine to conuert the Saxons to the faith of Christe, although the superstitions which hee
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:14727:289"/>
brought in with the Christian faith, cannot be defended. The diligence of Augustin in teaching according to his knowledge, deserueth praise, yet can it not make him an Apostle, because an Apostle hath his calling immediatly of God, Gal. 1. If we report his pride and crueltie as wee finde in our histories written by Papistes, let the worlde iudge, whether we or they do him iniurie.</p>

            <p n="76">76 King Henrie departed not out of the societie of the churche of Rome, onely for the vices of the men thereof, but for their false and Antichristian heresies which they obstinately mainteined, and ioyned him selfe to the true, auncient, and vniuersall Church of Christe, when hee departed out of that false newe sett vp, schismaticall, and particuler Synagogue of Rome, as Saint Augustine went from the Manichees to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke church. And as King Henrie the eyght knewe whence hee went, so knewe hee also whither he went, euen from Rome with seuen hilles, to Ierusalem which is aboue, and is the mother of vs all.</p>

               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:14727:289"/>77 Hee that goeth out of an hereticall church, as King Henrie did, must goe to the Catholike church of Christe, as hee did, without making any newe church, or being without a church. I knowe not the age of Maister Sander, but if hee bee not much aboue fourtie yeares olde, hee was borne and baptized as manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papistes were, in that which hee calleth a newe church, or no church, which howe hee will aunswere, let him and them aduise, which holde it necessarie, that a man must tarrie in that church, in which hee is baptized.</p>
            <p n="78">78 King Henrie the eight was not without a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, but in the church of Englande, a member of the Catholike church of Christe: neither did hee call him the supreme head of the church of Englande, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that title was giuen him by the Popish Clergie in their submission, after they were cast in the premunire: Edw.

            <p n="79">79 That hee receiued not fully the true doctrine of Christ, as he banished the false vsurped power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, is to bee imputed to the trayterous practises of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Clergie, which although they durste not withstande him in mainteining the Popes authoritie, yet they laboured all that they coulde, to reteine the Popes doctrine, in as many poyntes as they might: hereof came the lawe of the sixe articles, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the sacrifice of the Masse, transubstantiation, communion in one kynde, and such other heresies. Neuerthelesse, the authoritie of Antichrist, much Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, &amp; superstition, and false doctrine was abolished, Iustification by faith in Christe was preached, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was read in the vulgar tongue, which was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a reformation, and returning vnto the true church of Christe, and not a setting vp of a newe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: Except Maister Sander will saye, that those Kinges of Iuda, which refourmed some parte of religion, and yet left the hill altares &amp; other abuses, did set vp a newe
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:14727:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>
church, because they made not a perfect reformation. Finally, where he sayth, that King Henrie adioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to no companie of faithfull men in earth, which had from Christes time liued after that profession of faith which he allowed, proueth not, that hee set vp a newe church. For he ioyned to the Catholike church, in so many pointes of true doctrine as hee acknowledged, from which the Popish church was departed, although he was not rightly instructed in all.</p>
            <p n="80">80 The church of Englande in King Henries time, was a true church, although all the doctrine which was then mainteined by publique authoritie (through the subtile practises of popish hypocrites) was not true. And the church of England at this daye, is the same that it was then, but nowe by publike authoritie embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all true doctrine, which by the true members of the church in King Henries dayes was mainteined, and withstoode by hypocrites or other, not yet rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</p>
            <p n="81">81 The church vnto which King Henrie went, and brought the realme, when he departed from Rome, was the same church, which began at Ierusalem, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased into all nations, and continueth in the world for euer, though not among all nations.</p>
            <p n="82">82 King Henry went out of the Antichristian church of Rome into the Catholike church of Christe, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing some part of the doctrine therof, therefore hee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no reconciliation to the Romish church, but a more perfect information of the church of Christ.</p>
            <p n="83">83 In King Edwardes time, the reformation began and hindred in his fathers time, was perfected and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished for all pointes of Christian doctrine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any reconciliation vsed to the churche of Rome, but the Church of Englande by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, perfectly vnyted to the Catholike Churche of Christe ioyning in profession of faith, with the best refourmed Christian churches in the worlde.</p>
            <p n="84">84 The abolishing of forrein power, hindred not the

ioyning in faith and doctrine, with all the Churches of God, that were without the realme of England. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie sacrifices of the Masse, was in King Edwardes time abolished by publique authoritie out of the Church of England, as it was in King Henries time ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all true members of the Church, that were then rightly instructed, as much as the supremacie of the Pope.</p>
            <p n="85">85 The power of being the sonnes of God, the power of preaching and forgiuing of sinnes in the Church of Christe, is no forreigne power, neither was any such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer euer excluded, but the false and vsurped tyrannie of Antichrist of Rome.</p>
            <p n="86">86 We beleeue and professe a Catholique or vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church of Christe, whereof we are members, and therefore we detest the hereticall, schismaticall, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of Rome.</p>
            <p n="87">87 The Church of England vnder King Edward, did professe her selfe to be a member of the most auncient, Catholike, and Apostolique Church of Christe, which is the piller of trueth, to bee iudged by the worde of GOD, which is the trueth it selfe: Iohn. 17. being not so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, but that she could distinguish the worde of GOD, from the Church of GOD, as the lawe of GOD from the houshold of GOD, which is gouerned by that lawe: And not as Maister Sanders similitude is, as the statutes of England differ from the men of England, which make them, but the Church maketh not the worde of God, but contrariwise, the word of God maketh the Church.</p>
            <p n="88">88 It is not necessarie to shewe a companie of men in a peculiar place, as Geneua or any such like, for them that will ioyne them selues with the Catholike Church of all the world, although it were easie to name diuers companies of men in seuerall places, which continued in the true Church out of the Church of Rome, both in Fraunce and Italie, beside Bohemia, which long before was returned out of the Popish Church, into the Church of Christ: and all the East Churches, which neuer ioyned

            <p n="89">89 The Churches of Zurich and Saxonie be members of the Catholique Church of Christe, which is fifteene hundreth yeares olde and vpward, although the same Churches were gathered and returned in those places, within these three score yeares.</p>
            <p n="90">90 There needed no embassages to goe to and fro, to the Churches of God beyond the seas, for reconciliation, bicause there was no debate betweene the Church of England and them. Although for conference and aduise in reformation, no doubt but there were mutuall mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages betweene them. The vnion and communion of our Church, with other particular Churches of God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, is spirituall, made by the working of the holy Ghost, and not by embassages, or orders taken by men. But the same is declared and shewed by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our faith, fully agreeing in all necessarie Articles with them.</p>
            <p n="91">91 The publique protestations and confessions of our faith, doe shewe our reconciliation and coniunction with the Catholique Church of Christ, without that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs, to exhibite any billes of submission to any singular persons, as hath bene vsed in cases of particular discipline, as in reconciliation of Vrsarius and Valens to Iulius of Rome: Maximus, Vrbanus, &amp; other, to Cyprian of Carthage.</p>
            <p n="92">92 The realme did neuer submit it selfe to Luther, Zuinglius, or Caluine, but to Christe and his Church.

Sanders saith) these 1500. yeares, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in a manner chaunged from the faith of Peter, and of the Apostolike Church, therefore Queene Marie bringing the realme to that Church, did not reconcile it to the true Church of Christ, but restored it to the slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Antichristian tyrannie.</p>
            <p n="98">98 Seeing the realme is nowe againe returned to the embracing of the doctrine of the Gospell, set foorth in the holy scriptures, taught in the Primitiue Church, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreth yeares after Christe, continued in all times, though vnder persecution of Antichrist, and nowe openly and publiquely professed of many nations, it is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the true Catholike Church of Christe, whereof Christe onely is the head, and communicateth with the Church of Christ of all nations, in all pointes of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, necessarie to saluation, and therefore is no seis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Church, but a Catholique and Apostolique Church.</p>
            <p n="99">99 The Catholique Church of Christe, whereof the Church of England is a part, is an inuisible Church, and therefore an Article of our faith, which is of things inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Heb. 10. and no Church vnder a bushell. But Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem that is in heauen is the mother of vs all: Gala. 4.

            <p n="101">101 The Gospell of Christ hath beene preached vnto all nations. And the Church hath had Pastours and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christes time vnto Luthers age. Maister Sander asketh where they were, through all nations?

And although Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons, pay subsidies vnto their princes, yet are not their Princes, and their Courtiers nourished by the goodes of the Church, as Maister Sander moste slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously reporteth, otherwise then it is meete, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects should contribute to the maintenance of the state of the Prince, and their owne defence.</p>
            <p n="103">103 The worde of God written is in deede honorable and true, and conteineth all that doctrine, by whiche the Church of God was gouerned, two thousand yeres before any word of the Bible was written, when by reason of that long life of the Patriarches, the tradition might be certeine. The Gospell also was preached by the Apostles, before any of the foure Gospels was penned, but yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the scriptures of the olde Testament, and is the same that is written and none other: which written word of God, is able to make the man of God perfect, and is deliuered vnto the Church of Christe, as a moste certeine rule to followe, that it might not be deceiued by vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine traditions and inuentions of man, in steeede of the doctrine of God.</p>
            <p n="104">104 The Popishe Church hath not kept the worde of God faithfully, but in a corrupt and false Latine transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:14727:293"/>
The certeintie therfore of the scriptures was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from them, but from the Iewes, concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde Testament in Hebrue, and from the Gręcians, concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Testament in Greek. Although the very common Latine translation of the Bible, is sufficient to conuince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popish Church of horrible heresies, and blasphemies.</p>
            <p n="105">105 To refourme the Church according to the doctrine of the holie scripture, and the example of the Primitiue Church, is not like as if one reading of the olde lawes of England in an other Ilande, would say it were England, and that the countrie whiche is so called is departed from olde England. For chaunge of Lawes, cannot change pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and regions, but departing from the trueth of Gods worde, is a departing from the Churche of Christe, and the returning to that trueth is a returning to the Church of Christ, notwithstanding Maister Sanders wise simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The Prophetes in deede Esaie, Ieremie, &amp;c. by the lawe of Moses, shewed the errours of the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and by it sought the reformation thereof. But they renounced not the lawful gouernement of the high Priest, because it was established by the lawe, whereas the tyrannicall vsurpation of the Pope, is contrarie to the lawe of Christ, and therefore is moste iustly renounced.</p>
            <p n="106">106 It is graunted that the Church of Rome was once a principall parte of the Churche of Christe. But the successions of Popes since Popes were, hath not continued so without interruption, as the successions of the highe Priestes at Ierusalem, by meanes of so many Schismes &amp; Antipapes, and translation of the See from Rome to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinion with so many, and so long variations of the See. And the succession of Christians except in a fewe, hath vtterly failed, as Esaie saith of Ierusalem, how is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full citie become an harlot? Esaie. 1.</p>
            <p n="107">107 It is graunted that of olde time, the Romane faith was accounted the catholike faith, while it was so in deed, euen as the Britanne faith, the French faith, the Germane faith, was likewise. But that whiche he inferreth is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denied: namely, that the Pope and his citie haue

For the contrarie beeing proued, it is not onely the euill manners of the Pope, and that citie that haue moued vs to departe from the Churche, but the false religion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Although it is nothing like, that where suche a sinke of all abhominations is, and hath beene openly and generally seene aswel in the Popes, as in the people of his citie, there should be a true and sincere faith, and religion, whiche bringeth foorth wicked and vngodly fruites.</p>
            <p n="108">108 The glorie of Christes Church and kingdome, is not like to the kingdome and glorie of an earthly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but contrarie to it: namely, it is spirituall and not carnal, inwarde and not outwarde, in appearance of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, pouertie, &amp; foolishnesse, and not of strength, riches, and wisedome. 1.

                     <hi>Fulk.</hi>
                  </note> after he hath first sought to dasell mens eyes with the vaine glitering glorie of the Romish Church, now he goeth about to tickle their eares, with a plausible tale of some disorderly doinges, in breaking of Images in the lowe countries. As though the inconsiderate zeale of a fewe image breakers, or perhaps the licentious riot of some pilfering spoylers, beeing either Papistes or of no religion that were mixed with them, were sufficient to excuse such horrible Idolatrie, as the Papistes daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and M. Sander is not ashamed to defend. He preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as though his purpose were no more, but to answere an obiection of I cannot tell what Protestants, nor he him selfe is able to name any of credite, which affirmed, that the casting downe of idolatrie in the lowe countries, and liberty of preaching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel procured by a few naked &amp; base men, against an armed Prince, and so many wealthy persons as were enimies to it, must come of the mightie hand of God, and that it was a great miracle. Whiche thing might well and truely be saide, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing, that was done beside order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:14727:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>For there is no doubt, but God directed all things to his glory, although men sought not the same by lawfull &amp; ordinarie meanes. It was no miracle saith M. Sander, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not resisted in suche places where the spoyle was made. But so much the greater was the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that in so many places, the heartes of the magistrates with the people were so daunted, that they durst make no resistance.</p>
               <p>The storie as M. Sander reporteth it, is, that the Lordes of the low countries, dissenting from king Philip about the Spanish inquisition, the king lyke to be assaulted by the Turkes in Naples, and Malta, resorte was made to a certaine preacher, not called by anye auctoritie, in the woods and fieldes neere to Antwerpe. The first quarrell he picketh, is to the preachers callinge, whiche in suche times as religion is in a manner ouerthrowne and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Idolatrie, as now by the papistes, cannot bee but extraordinarie, and yet lawfull, as hauinge authoritie of God, and approbation of Gods Churche, mooued with chariti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to call men out of the blindnes of Idolatrie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of the Gospell. This I saye, as if he had not bin called thither to preach by the Church of God, which was in persecution in those places, which is an ordinarie &amp; a most lawfull calling. The seconde fault he findeth, is of their preaching in the woodes and fieldes, which hath not bene vsed in a Christian countrie, but in time of warre. As though he hath not reade that in Affrica, when the Arrians which are as good Christians as the papists, persecuted the true Catholikes, and draue them out of the cities, they were constrained to meete in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they could, in woods, or fieldes, or desert corners.</p>
               <p>That there were sectes amonge them, it was to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and yet not to bee marueiled, for there muste bee euen heresies amonge you, sayeth the Apostle, that they which are tryed may be made manifest: 1. Corinth. 11. verse 19.</p>
               <p>That the feast of the Assumption was chosen, wherein they began the spoile, I hope it was of no hatred to the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:14727:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Virgin Mary, whom they honour with such honour as is due to her, and called her blessed, because God hath chosen her to be a mother of Christ, although they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not the new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception of Christs body vnder forme of bread, by the popish priests, compared in dignitie by papistes vnto the blessed Virgine (as I remember) in fiue pointes. M. Sander is angry that the newe preachers hate that feast of the Assumption of Mary, &amp; yet keepe holy the day of the death of S. Paule and S. Thomas. They hate it, because of the popishe fable of the Assumption of the body of the virgin liuing, which yet M. Sander is ashamed of, and calleth it the daye of her death. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feastes which they keepe, they keepe not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor of men, but to the honour of God, they vse the dayes in which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people is accustomed to be assembled, as things indifferent, which except it be in cases of offence geuing, may well be vsed.</p>
               <p>The watche worde giuen by a boye, who striking the Image saide, Marye thou must come downe, is a vaine matter, and yet much more probably to bee defended, then the prayers of the Idolaters made to that deafe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole. Blessed Lady helpe me, &amp;c. <hi>Pater noster qui es in coelis, &amp;c.</hi> After the watche worde followed the spoyle of all Idoles, and monuments of Idolatrie, the magistrates for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding in vaine. I saide before the disordered doing of priuate men cannot bee defended, although where M.S. chargeth them with stealinge and caryinge away, I am perswaded he slaundereth them, as men of as good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as he do testifie, except some pilfering theeues thrust in amongst them, who as the report goeth, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, were iustly punished.</p>
               <p>The maner of their vtter defacing of al tables, and all that belonged to them, whiche Master Sander so muche misliked, if it had not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted lawful authoritie, had been verie commendable, yea euen the pissing vpon the foule Idoll of the altar, might haue bene defended by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Iehu, which turned the temple of Baall, into a lakes, if it had bene done by the commandement of a
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:14727:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
zelous Magistrate. For M.S. most impudently doth bely vs, when he saith, that by our doctrine, their Masse cake is a mysticall figure of Christes bodye, when it is rather a foule stinking and abhominable Idoll.</p>
               <p>If any Library was destroied by them, with the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, doctors works, &amp; maps of countries, it was very euil &amp; barbarously done of them, &amp; yet I am sure they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no booke of holy scriptures, knowing them to be such, as the papists doe, not by tumult of a few ignoraunt persons, but by consultation &amp; deliberation of the wisest of them, knowing them to be the holy scriptures, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defacing them, not more with flames of fire, then vilainous &amp; despightful words. It is wel known y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> D. Cole the papist, being visitor in Cambridge, when a Bible was brought to him to be defaced, called it bible bable.</p>
               <p>They defaced the Friers kitchin stuffe, spoyled and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away their vitailes &amp; stuffe, it was more then may be defended, &amp; I thinke more then was true, and especially that they shoulde bring strumpets into the Abbeyes to prouoke the yong Monkes and Fryers to lust, which was needlesse, for their chastitie is well inough knowne.</p>
               <p>But lest the fault should be laid vpon a disordered mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude without a head, M.S. saith, they had one Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus a preacher to their captaine, which had bin a theefe, and had lost one of his eares, if his report be true, he was like to be captaine of such a band. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praier of the Nuns y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stopped his mouth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was able to say no more to them, let them beleeue it, that thinke papistes cannot lye. There might be cause why Hermanus would geue ouer his perswasions, when hee sawe them obstinate, though his mouth were not stopped with their prayer. To conclude, although the defacing and destroying of Idolatrie be good, yet may it not be attempted without auctoritie and order, vnder pretence of zeale, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this fact of the lowe countrie men is not by anye wise man defended, howsoeuer their zeale may be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke of god in their inconsiderate doings may be considered.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The state of the question concerninge the adoration of holy Images, where also a reason is giuen of the order which is taken in the booke following.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>In this chapter, hee mooueth foure questions, 1. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Images may be made,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulke.</hi>
                  </note> 2. whether any Images may bee worshipped, 3. whether it bee expedient that anie shoulde be worshipped, 4 with what kinde of worship Images may be worshipped. To the first he aunswereth that Images may be made. To the seconde, that these I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages onely may be worshipped, in respect of Christian religion, which bring vs in minde either that there is a God, or that there are three persons of the Trinitie, or which represent Christ, or his holy Angels and Saints, by which he alloweth the making and worshippinge of the Images of god, or of the trinity, beside y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> images of Christ, men, and Angels.</p>
               <p>To the third, he answereth that it is expedient that Images should be worshipped. To the fourth, he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it for more probable, that the same degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is not due to the Image of Christ, of our Lady, or of other saintes, which is due to Christ, our Lady, &amp; other saintes themselues, but there is a certaine proper honour due to holy Images, which may be called a worship or honour due to a good remembraunce or monument. These be his owne wordes, by which hee sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe contrary to other Papistes, that defende that Images are to be worshipped with the same honour that is due to the thinges whereof they are Images. As that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God is to be worshipped, euen with the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is due to God himselfe.</p>
               <p>But going ouer his questions againe, hee saieth, it is graunted for the most part of all men, that Images may be made so they be not abused, which is vtterly false, for no Christian man will graunt, that it is lawfull in anye respect to make any Image of God, that is, to transforme the glorye of the immortall God into the image of a
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:14727:296" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mortal man, or to make that monstrous image of the Trinitie, with three faces or three bodies: of an old man, a yong man, and a doue. Rom. 1. vers. 23. The seconde and thirde, he sayeth are denyed by the Caluenistes and Lutherans. In the fourth, there hath been controuersie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Popish Catholikes, some thinking the honor dewe to the thing it selfe (by reason that the image is all one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, when it exerciseth the act of an image) might be giuen to the image therof. But other be of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other minde. Beside this controuersie among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes themselues confessed about the honour of God, which is one of the chiefest pointes of Christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, note that the former sort make dombe &amp; dead images, to exercise an act, which is a grosse &amp; monstrous absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. But of all those foure questions, M. Sanders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to intreate: first to proue the making of images lawful and commendable: 2. the worshipping of them to be lawfull &amp; commendable, as the signes of honorable verities for the verities sake, which is all one, as if you would saye, we must worship falsities for loue of veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for betweene veritie &amp; falsitie there is no meane, the creature in steede of the creator, Rom. 1. vers. 25. But how absurdly doth he confound images with the signes of all kinds? Or what kinde of argument is this? Iohn Baptist confessed him selfe vnworthie to loose the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet of Christes shooe, therefore he woulde worship his shooe or we must worship his image. Or these, a man embraceth a seruant or messenger sent from his friende, kisseth a ring that commeth from him, loueth to heare of his name, esteemeth his picture, therefore wee must embrase, kisse, loue, &amp; esteeme images of God, &amp;c. which hee hath not sent vnto vs, but expressely forbidden vs to make or haue in any vse of religion. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shoulde not be mistaken, in saying, images ought to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he doeth not as a learned man shoulde doe, make a lawfull diuision or distinction of honour, but like a blinde or craftie Sophister, he maketh a confusion and iumbling of diuerse names and kindes of honour, to
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:14727:297" rendition="simple:additions"/>
trouble the vnderstanding of a simple reader, as of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to God, to Saintes, to our prince, to his liuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to our parents, friends, fellowes, superiours, and to holy remembrance, and one of these kindes of honour he will proue due to images, and not that which is due to God alone. As though all honour of religion, were not dewe onely to God, Mat. 4. vers. 10. and honour of charitie, were not to be directed by Gods lawe, by which, honour of images is expressely forbidden. But with M. Sander the difference of honour commeth from the minde, and therefore falling downe before an image. Kissing, &amp;c. if he thinke it not to be God, nor any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, but an image of Christ. &amp;c. is no idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. As if God had not by expresse wordes forbidden, the falling downe before images, yea, although the minde knowe they be false idols. For else how are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, which haue not bowed their knees to Baal, nor kissed him with their mouth, among so many idolaters and dissemblers? But Abraham (saith M. Sander) adored the people of the land, yet was he no idolater. As though he could not put a difference betweene ciuile worship &amp; religious: yea, he giueth a rule how to auoide idolatrie: Giue God thy heart (saith he) and after be secure, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour which is giuen in any respect be for Gods sake, &amp; all is well. By this reason, we may worship not onely all idols, but we may make idols of all Gods creatures, &amp; worship them for Gods sake, as the Aegyptians did Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, crocodiles, cattes, apes &amp; onions, for they be al good monuments &amp; remembrances of God their creatour, and better then any forged idoll. To auoide which absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it were good not only to looke that you worship not any thing for Gods sake, but to be sure, what God hath commaunded you to worship, &amp; that to honor with such honour also as he hath appointed. So shall you worship God aright, &amp; honour his ministers ecclesiasticall or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, his friendes, and your brethren, and whatsoeuer else is worthie of any honour. But Maister Sander to auoide the offence that might be taken by the termes of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

But how false this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of M.

In the ende of this Chapter M.

The people that would haue made Christ a King, Ioh. 6. attempted a thing vnlawfull for them to doe, yet were they not for that, the ministers of the diuel. The euil was of the diuell, the persons for the moste parte sought to serue God, or else M. Sander how will you defend them that commit idolatrie vppon good intent, in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of an vnconsecrated hoste, or in worshipping the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in the likenesse of Angels? But to come to your reasons. The abuses of the images (you say) might haue bene taken away, and the images let alone, and that in deede was the iudgement of Gregorie, <hi>ad Seren. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Ep.</hi> 109. but his authoritie against the manifest worde of God, which forbiddeth all images in any vse of religion, is of small weight with vs: Ex. 20. The example of King Ezechias breaking the brasen serpent is vnfitly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to defende the breaking of images by priuate persons: but the two last reasons that M. Sander alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of the breaking thereof, are to be considered: the one that the brasen serpent was a figure, rather then an image, the other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was worshipped as the trueth it self. That it was both a figure &amp; an image, he might haue said truely, but so to make it a figure, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he denyeth it to be an image, is grosse impudencie: for first it was an image of a serpent, before it was a figure of Christ. And then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth hereof, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if such an image as was lawfully made &amp; was a figure of Christ, by lawfull authoritie was broken, when it was abused: howe much more images that were neuer lawfully made, and also haue beene abused to idolatrie, as all the famous images in Poperie haue beene, ought by like authoritie to be vtterly defaced &amp; destroyed?</p>
               <p>To the seconde reason, that the people did worship
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:14727:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the brasen serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as God, it is nothing credible, although they gaue vnto it the honour due vnto God. For that Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias called it Nechushtan, which is a lumpe of brasse, it shewed that God is not to be worshipped in any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all image, it proueth not what opinion the people had of it. M. San. saith, the Papistes worship not the mettall of their images, but they vse them as occasions to put them in remembrance of them whose images they are. It were an hard point for him to proue, that the Israelits did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the brasse of the serpent, but rather that image of the serpent, as a holy relique, by which their forefathers had deliuerance from the stinging of fierie serpents. But to the matter, it is needlesse for him to cite out of Augustin, that it is not lawfull to breake Idolls, but for them that haue authoritie, and lesse to proue that they which stale siluer crosses and challices &amp;c. if any such were, (as I thinke hee slaundereth them) did euill. But he will proue that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Church goods be Idolaters, bicause they be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. He may so proue a greater number of obstinate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes Idolaters, who both keepe Church goodes in their houses, and the very Churches or Abbeys, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all one, for their houses. And yet Augustine whome he citeth, alloweth the conuerting of idolatrous treasures to common vses, as was the giuing of Abbeys by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent of the realme into the Kings hand, of whome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers inioy them as bought or giuen. If any man vniustly got into his possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any such stuffe of couetousnes, I for my part will not excuse him of idolatrie, nor Sander of treason for cursing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, which is inriched by Abbey landes lawfully giuen, vnder colour of giuing offence. But the foundation of the newe Gospell is shamefull, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Protestants contemne this acte of spoyling, and yet their preachers and Doctours were the captaines of the spoyle. In the first Chapter, where he tolde vs the storie, he could name but one preacher, &amp; him an infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and yet perhaps he slandereth him in all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Now he seemeth as though al the preachers &amp; Doctours were captaines of this disorder, which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:14727:299" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and shamelesse lye: as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which followeth is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and foolish slander, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the inconstancie of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants is such, as there is no ground or assurance of our faith, bicause there be diuers opinions in some matters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are no articles of faith, or bicause Papistes may feigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie in their doctrine, where there is none at al. For albeit that some haue thought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men must not be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to profession of religion, and one or two haue written against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of women, as a French Papist also hath done in his Emblemes: yet generally we hold, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heretikes are to be punished, and all men compelled to serue God truly, and none suffred to commit idolatrie: likewise we hold the regiment of women lawful, as well in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est estate of a Queene, as in inferiour degrees of a mother or a mistresse. We always teach obedience vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince. And it is the Pope that armeth subiectes against their Prince, discharging them of their allegeance, as in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the North. The doings of Fraunce and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, are by publique instruments testified vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, by the Princes them selues, that they were good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and not done against them, but in their seruice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. For miracles and Doctours, we neuer taught di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly of them, but alwayes, that they were to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced according to the trueth, which they are brought to confirme, which trueth must be tryed onely by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of scriptures, neither by miracles, nor Doctours. And bicause he toucheth by name the miracle of Maister Lane of Westchester, although we make no great account of it, as a miracle, which might be a natural cure, yet it is more vnlike to be a fable, and more like to be a true miracle, then that which Maister Bristowe alledgeth of Margeret Iesop with the short leg. The decrees of the Pope, though hee bee Antichrist, are sufficient to beate downe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, which holde that he can not erre, the like I say of the gloses and late writers of their owne, to whome we owe no obedience, as they professe their faith to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by them. And seeing of custome some be good &amp; some be bad, why may we not receiue the good and refuse
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:14727:299" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the bad without M. San. frumpe, <hi>Let olde customes preuaile quoth M. Iewell.</hi> The old Latin translation of the Bible is in many places corrupt, but neuer to be preferred before the originall of the Greeke and Hebrue, although it may be cited where it differeth against the Papistes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it as only true. Old writers haue called the holy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an altar, and the Communion, a sacrifice or Masse, yet followeth it not, that Popish altars &amp; Popish Masse may not be condemned. But what slaunders are these, the body of Christe is the signe of his body, and the signe of the crosse, is the body it selfe crucified, who euer heard these monsters proceed out of our mouthes? Againe, The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is taught to be but holy bread. Priestes and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops need haue no temporal possessions, except they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues be Priestes and Bishops. Priestes and Bishops are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual by Gods law, therefore Popish Priestes, which be the diuels Priestes, must be equall with Christian Bishops, which for gouernment sake are preferred before Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ministers.</p>
               <p>Finally, if the Papistes burne oure malicious and false translations of the Bible, they are saide to burne the holy Bible of Iesus Christe. If the Protestants burne the Hebrue, Greeke, Latine, &amp; Duch text, as they did in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Low countries, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended as holy workers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords vine. No M. Sander, thy malicious eares neuer heard that, which thy slanderous pen hath set downe, that any man was of vs commended, for burning any text of the Bible: and if by disorder, and through ignorance, any texts were burned, yet thou feignest too impudently, in saying, they burned the Duch text. And whereas thou wouldest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the purposed malicious burning of English Bibles, by the falsenesse of their translations, beside that thou speakest absurdly in all learned mens eares, who knowe the trueth of them by conference of them with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall toungs, yet this bewrayeth your malice against the word of God, that hauing so long complained of our false translations, neuer a papist of you all will take the paines to translate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible truly, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people might be rightly

               <p>But let vs heare the rest of his examples.

               <p>But neerer to the matter, Iulian the Apostata with the paganes pulled downe the image of Christ, that was set vp in the streete of Caesarea Philippi in remembraunce of the miracle done vpon the woman that was healed of her issue of bloud, not in the Church to be worshipped. Wel: he shewed his malice, but he did no hurt to Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This example hurteth not them that lawfully pul downe, &amp; deface Images in the Church of Christ: for Epiphanius before Iulian, did so at Anablatha, Epiph. epi. 34.

Hereof M. Sander gathereth, that the Christians had a grauen image of Christe him selfe euen from his owne time, in Paneade, or Caesarea Philippi, as images of the crosse before their houses: for the image of Christe, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius testifieth, it was set vp by the Heathen men, and not by Christians, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. Although it is not like, that it was set vp in Christes time, when it is manifest by Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, that the Iewes could not abide so much as the image of the Emperour, or of his standerd the Eagle to be set vp among them. The images of the crosses set before their doores, declare they had not them, and much lesse any other of Christ and his saintes in Churches, which Iulian would not haue omitted, to proue them woode wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers and idolaters. Cyrillus in deede defendeth these signes of crosses as better memorials of Christ, and of his vertues, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Images of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles, yet he defendeth not setting vp of crosses, or any images in Churches, &amp; cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to them, which is the filthie idolatrie of the Papists.</p>
               <p>Iulian the vncle of this Apostata, did sit vpon the vessels vsed at the communion, in despight of our religion, and was iustely plagued therefore. Eustachius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretike kept his conuenticles in priuate places, he would not be ruled by his Bishop. The protestants kepe open assemblies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are not hindred by persecution, and are ordered by the Bishops &amp; Elders of their Church, though they will not be obedient to the Hereticall Bishops of the Popishe Church.

Therefore when I saw this thing, that the Image of a man did hang in the Church of Christ, contrarie to the authoritie of the scriptures, I rent it, and gaue councel to the keepers of that place, that they should rather wrappe some dead poore man in it &amp; carry him to buriall in it. And they contrariwise murmured &amp; said, if he would haue rent it, it had beene meete that he should haue giuen vs another vayle, and haue changed it. Which when I heard, I promised that I would giue them one, and send it shortly. Now there was some stay in the meane time, while I seeke to send them a very good vaile in steed of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. For I thought one should haue ben sent me out of Cypres. But now I haue sent such a one as I could get. And I pray you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you will commaunde the elders of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, to receiue this vale, which we haue sent by this bearer. And to charge them that here after no such vayles be hanged vp in the Church of Christ, which are against our religion.

                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:14727:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>These be the words of Epiphanius in his Epistle tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated by S. Hierom. For answere to this, first he will not affirme whether y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Epiphanius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> byshop of Cypres wrote this Epistle, or some other of that name, because Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scen that impudent corrupter of antiquitie, when he can not answere the Epistle, he moueth such suspition in his Apologie for the worshipping of Images. But let Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome himselfe testifie the matter, <hi>Contra errores Ioan Hierosol. ad Pampathiam,</hi> in the end of the Epistle. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he answereth that notwithstanding the iudgement of Epiphanius, it is not against the authoritie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to haue Images in the churches, for then shoulde not Theodorus the martyr, haue had his martyrdome painted on the walles, as Gregorius Nyssenus witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. In deede Gregorius Nyssenus, which liued some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after Epiphanius, speaking of the ornaments of the Churche, affirmeth that there was the history of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr painted on the wall, but so farre from anye spice of adoration, that the same was also expressed vppon the pauement which men did tread vppon. Like as for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, there were grauen also in woode the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of beastes. These were the beginnings and as it were the first budding vp of Idolatrie in the church, yet gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide by godly men, and forbidden in the councell of Eliberis.</p>
               <p>Another reason he hath, of those simple mens authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that hang vp the Image, and their murmuring, which was not for putting downe the Image, but for that he gaue them not another vail or curtaine first. That it was not his priuate opinion, it appeareth in this, that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth so confidently thereof to the bishop of Ierusalem, in whose dyocesse Anablatha was, and who was present whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the saide Image was defaced.</p>
               <p>But if he had thought (saith M. Sander) the hauing of Images to bee an heresie, he woulde haue noted it in his booke of Fourescore and more heresies, where he noteth no suche opinion of hauing Images in the Churche for hereticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:14727:303"/>This balde reason he learned out of the councell of Nice 2. <hi>act.</hi> 4. of one Epiphanius which taketh vpon him to reiecte and controll the authoritie of this ancient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius of Cypres. But howe falsely, they haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this of him, you may see in diuers places of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius booke against heresies. First <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the punishment of God against Tharra an Image maker, which ouer liued his sonne Aran, which no man (as he saith) did before him. Secondly, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. hee sheweth that Simon Magus the father of heretikes, made Images of him selfe and his harlot Helena to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: &amp; that Carpocrats the heretik made the Images of Iesus, and of S. Peter, and did cense them and worship them. Also <hi>Her.</hi> 27. he saith, <hi>Gnostici &amp; Carpocratitae, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>The Gnostikes and Carpocratites, haue Images painted in collours, some also of golde and siluer and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they say be the Images of Iesus, and that these Images of Iesus were made when hee liued among men vnder Pontius Pilate. Againe <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>her.</hi> 55. he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were some in Arabia, Robas and Edom, which worshipped the Image of Moses.</q> And <hi>Centra Cullyridianos, her.</hi> 79. which worshipped the Images of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessed virgin <q>Marye, he saith: <hi>Vnde non est, &amp;c.</hi> Howe is not this desire of making Images a diuelish attempt? <hi>Prętextu enim Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tię,</hi> for the deuil alwais entring into the mind of men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of righteousnes, deifying the mortal nature in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eres of men, by variety of arts, hath set forth stocks or statues, bearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of men.

               <p>By these places iudge howe true it is which Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scen writeth, that his owne church was decked with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

                     </gap> defended, men be so prone to Idolatrie.</q> But M.S. gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that seeing there might be no pictures in churches, ergo they might be in priuate houses, &amp; if they be lawful to be in priuate houses, much more they might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in churches.

                  </gap>n priuate houses, much more in churches. But yet he hath an other answer. This fact of Epiphanius was a priuate zeale, which is not to be folowed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholike church: but I reply, it was a godly zeal, because it was ruled by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scripture, against which no church hath authority to decree. But the last answere is as good as cake &amp; pudding, which yet he thinketh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a note in the margent. Images could not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before they were set vp, therfore the setters vp of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are ancienter &amp; neerer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles time then the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers down. That is out of questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Euen so heresies could not be confuted before they were inuented, therfore the inuenters of heresies, are ancienter &amp; neerer the Apostles times then the confuters. Note ye papistes for your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge or else note that this note of Master Sander is not worthye the notinge. But hee proceedeth and will prooue (as he sayeth) that as there were some Images in Churches in the time of Epiphanius, so straight after his
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:14727:304"/>
time, they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in all churches: but this straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way was almost 200. yeares after Epiphanius,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>rohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the distinction of adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they should not be worshipped as God: because Gregorie saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>epist.</hi> 53. <hi>Scio quod, &amp;c.</hi> I know that you desire not the Image of our Sauiour, to this purpose, to worshippe it as God. By which wordes he meaneth, that all worshippe is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and that by worshipping an Image, it is made a false God.</p>
               <p>But it foloweth in the same Epistle (saith M. Sander) which proueth that Gregorie acknowledged some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe due to Images. <hi>Nos non, quasi ante Diuinitatem, ante imaginem proster nimur, &amp;c.</hi> We fall not downe before an Image, as before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godhead, but we worship him whome by the Image we reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to haue ben borne, or to haue suffred, and also to sitte in the throne. But these wordes import no such matter, but rather the contrarye, except M. Sander can prooue, that it is all one to fall downe before an Image, and to fall downe vnto an Image. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he seemeth to say, that they falled not downe at all before anye Image, but onely vsed them for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce.</p>
               <p>M. Sander continuing his petegrue, sheweth that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicus the Emperour being a monothelite, anno. 710. threwe downe the Images of the fathers of the sixe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councels that were set in the Churche porche of Sophia: belike he was afraide they woulde come short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Church. Pope Constantine caused the like pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to be set vp in the Church porche of Saint Peter at
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:14727:304"/>
Rome. And what of this? Forsooth hee was an heretike that threwe downe images. So was Pope Honorius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a monotholite archeheretike in the seuenth generall councell, that mainteined images. After him An. 730. Leo, persuaded by two Iewes, saith the late ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous writers, threwe downe the images at Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople: and anno 740. Constantine his sonne, a wicked man, and an heretike followed him. But vnder Irene &amp; Constantine anno 796. by the seconde councell of Nice, images were restored and their worship established. Of these stories of pulling downe and setting vp of images, M. Sander noteth, that the mainteiners of images passed their aduersaries in foure things. The first, that they were quietly set vp, and broken downe with tumult, so were many heresies by the subtile serpent quietly setled, which without great tumult could not be rooted out, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an heresie, for example. But that images were vsed from the Apostles, and Christ him selfe, he promiseth to shewe afterward. The second, whereas they were set vp in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse countries, they were pulled downe only in Greece: a wise matter, whereas idols were worshipped in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> days of Ezechias, throughout all the worlde, they were pulled downe onely in Iewrie. And yet against this idolatrous councell of Nice Carolus Magnus Emperour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> West writ a booke, which is yet extant. The thirde preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, the idolaters haue had two generall councels of their side, the idoll breakers none: and yet hee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth they had one at Ephesus, another at Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but he sayeth, they had them by stealth, that is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile, when they were gathered by the Emperours, as all other generall councels were. And many of them (sayth he) recanted after: so did they of Nice when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which followed immediatly after the Nicen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, threwe downe the images, as their predecessours had done. Finally, where as hee alledgeth the sixte councell of Constantinople for images, there is not one worde in all that councell to defende them, but a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfect Canon foysted in by the idolatrous councell of
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:14727:305" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nice, which they say was made foure or fiue yeres after, vnder Iustinian to cloke their forgerie.</p>
               <p>The fourth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> notwithstanding so many Emperours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, yet images at length preuailed among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greekes, which haue them at this day painted, &amp; as he sayeth, doe reuerence them, but hee sayeth falsly, if hee meane they worship them, as the Papistes do theirs: and they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted on walles or tables, not carued or grauen, lest they shoulde be worshipped. They continue still also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Church of Rome, if continuance be any matter to iustifie their doings. But nowe he concludeth howe vaine a thing it is to oppose Epiphanius which was but one man, and a fewe hereticall Emperours against all the rest of the fathers, and the generall councels. As though because hee hath cited onely Epiphanius, there were none of the fathers against images but hee, beside that he skippeth ouer the Eliberin councell cited by him selfe. But what fathers and councels haue beene against images, I shall haue better occasion to shewe hereafter. Nowe he proceedeth in his peuish pelfe: there were heretikes called Bogomili anno 1180. which condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the worshipping of images. All is not good that heretikes condemne: the Arrians condemned the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees: the Pellagians condemned the Arrians. There was neuer any heresie but allowed some good thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and condemned some euill things. Next he adioyneth Anno Do. 1160. the Waldensies, whome hee calleth beggers of Lyons, yet <hi>Pauperes</hi> signifieth not beggers, but poore men, which were true Christians, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned not onely idolatrie, but also all Papistrie. The Sarazens also iustly condemne the Papistes for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whose idols being so contrarie to the manifest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, were a greate occasion to make so many nations to forsake Christianitie, and for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometists to continue in their wicked and false religion. Last of all hee commeth to Wickelefe, Hus. Luther, &amp;c. and them of the lowe countries, whome especially hee chargeth with sacriledge. But to omitt their fact which
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:14727:305" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I haue often shewed cannot be defended if it wanted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authoritie, all the stories that hee bringeth, or can bring of godly princes, and other persons erecting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, churches, colledges, &amp;c. and furnishing true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all ornamentes meete for the same, are nothing to the purpose to defende the temples of idols, with their idols and altars, and other their trumperie from destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by godly and lawfull authoritie. At length hee alledgeth the decrees of Arcadius, Honorius, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, and Valentinianus, which alloweth the erecting of their owne images, and of all notable men, as Iudges, Magistrates, &amp;c. which when it was a ciuile honour vsed among the Romanes, and nothing at all touched reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I marueile with what face hee can alledge it, for setting vp of images in churches to bee worshipped, and yet that honouring of the Emperours images is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Saint Ierome <hi>in Daniell, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Likewise, that they decreede, that such as fledd to the Emperours image, should be safe from violence, which was only a ciuil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, to bring the maiestie of the Emperour in estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the common people, &amp; therefore it followeth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much lesse they would haue commaunded the image of Christe to haue bene pulled downe, which could not be set vp, but to the dishonour of Christ, because he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it: And therfore they made a decree, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it was set vp, it should be taken downe. M. Sander sayeth, that M. Iewel alledging this edict, doth translate <hi>tolli</hi> to be taken downe, which signifieth to bee taken vp, as though the decree had been of crosses on the grounde to be taken vp lest they shoulde bee trodden vppon, but when M. Sander hath sayed his pleasure, <hi>tolli</hi> signifieth to be taken cleane awaye. And although in Iustinian Ti. 11. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. the signe of our sauiour Christ is forbidden to be grauen or painted on the grounde in flint or marble: yet it followeth not, but the edict cited by the bishop of Sarum, may be vnderstood of taking away all images, wheresoeuer they were.</p>
               <p>The conclusion of the Chapter is, that he findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:14727:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on Maister Iewels syde, but Infidels, Iewes, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, Idolaters, or else he maketh many lyes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, as though the lawe of God were nothing, but Paganisme, Epiphanius were an heretike, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the councell of Eliberis were rennagates or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, the edictes of the Christian Emperours, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined by Maister Sanders glose, because an image was made by the woman that was healed (saith he) but Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius sayeth by the Gentiles, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. and the Gospell reporteth that shee had consumed all her goods vppon Phisitions, and therefore was not able to set vp such a piller and two such images of brasse, one of Christe, the other of her selfe, as those were reported to bee. From which day forwarde (saith he) all Catholike fathers and Councels, and Christians, made and reuerenced holy images as it shall appeare afterward. Of all the lowde lyes that euer I heard, this may goe for the whetstone. What shall appeare afterward, we shall consider after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. But in the meane time, remember his lye suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted, euen by such testimonies as hee himselfe hath alledged, by way of obiection the Epistle of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, and the councell of Eliberis.</p>

Beside that, this interpretation is a confusion of two commaundements in one, the former shewing the matter or substance of Gods honour, the other the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme thereof to be spirituall, it is proued false by these reasons: diuers nations worshipped liuing creatures which were no images, as Cattes, Oxen, Crocodiles, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Apes, as Gods, therfore the interpretation of strange Gods can not be images. The Israelites worshipped the true God Iehoua, which brought them out of the land of Aegypt, in the image of a Calfe, Exo. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. So did the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites vnder Ieroboam: and euen those Gentiles that did worship images with godly honour, they did worship the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but as images of the Gods them selues, whome they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to dwel in heauen, earth, the sea, or hell, except some ignoraunt persons among them, euen as among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes the like haue bene, that did thinke the very Idols to be Saintes, and were moued thereto, by the falshood of the Popish Priestes, which would make their eyes to gogle &amp; water, their lippes to stirre, their noses to bleede; their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to sweat, euen as by pricking their finger they made their Masse cakes to bleede. The Gentiles also, though they worshipped many Gods, yet they honoured one Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter aboue all the rest of the inferiour Gods, whom they worshipped but euen as the Papistes worship the Saintes. And to that one God they did attribute as great praise, as the Papistes doe to the highest God. The Poet Horace saith, <hi>Quire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thing like him or second vnto him. Yet Pallas receiueth the next honour vnto him. Compare this confession of the Heathen Poet, with that the Papistes teach of the worshippe of GOD and our Ladie, and see howe like they be.</p>
               <p>But to returne to Maister Sanders interpretations, hee maketh a second restraint, vpon these wordes, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe, that is, by thine owne priuate iudgement, but such images as I shal appoint to be made, thou maist haue. This restraint is right, and according to the meaning of the worde of GOD. For by this are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the brasen serpent, the Cherubims, and what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beside GOD commaunded to be made, and had in any vse of religion. As for the images of the Lions about Salomons throne, the Oxen that bare vp the see of brasse, the Pomgranets, Date trees, and other flowers made for the ornament of the temple, were in no vse of religion, and without all daunger of worshipping, therefore not prohibited by this commaundement, no more then the images of beastes, fishes, birdes, trees, in bookes of Philosophie, or the painting of stories in clothes or galleries, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But whereas Maister Sander in this restriction, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the commaundement of God to be vnderstoode, not onely that which is deliuered by the speciall and certaine messingers of God, Moses, the Prophetes, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but also addeth their successours, of whose cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we haue no warrant of GOD, I may not therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him. For hee quoteth for successours of the Apostles, Paulinus, Gregorie, and the second Councell of Nice, yea, Eusebius, Basil, Ambrose, Augustine, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, which all erred from the Apostolique doctrine in some pointes, although none of the fiue last na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, allowed the hauing of images in Churches.

               </p>
               <p>But M. Sanders proceedeth to defend the makers of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, whome the scripture accurseth, saying, that it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth either makers of idols, or else makers of wanton i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, or at least, such as make them for an euill end and purpose. Concerning the first, hee findeth fault with the English translation, which euery where almost, turneth idols into images. As though the Hebrue wordes, which the English translation expresseth, had that ridiculous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of idols and images, yea, as though the very vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine translation Psalme 113. which he quoteth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them not <hi>Simulachra</hi> images, the makers whereof, are accursed. Concerning the second, it is plaine the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist speaketh not of wanton images, but of such as were worshipped of the Heathen. And to the thirde, I graunt it meaneth them that make them to an euill end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as all Popish image makers doe, which make them to the end they might be set vp in Churches, to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, contrarie to Gods commaundement.</p>
               <p>But the last reason for the defence of image making, would serue to perce a marble stone, with the subtiltie thereof, and yet when all is done, hath as much reason in it, as the blockes which it defendeth. Mans naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is, by conceiuing images, made and brought vnto it by the externall and inward senses, therefore it is lawfull to make carued images. We may conceiue in our mind an image of Christe nayled on the crosse, therefore we may make it of wood or stone, and worship it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="600" facs="tcp:14727:308"/>O subtile argument. But syr, you graunt the making of Idols to be forbidden, but those conceiued images of the minde are called Idolls by them, that teach you that they be such conceptions of things: therefore this argument <hi>a paribus,</hi> will serue you to defend Idolls as well as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Yet one question or two about this diffuse argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I would demaund. Doeth God forbid by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement naturall, or artificiall images? If artificiall, then they haue no comparison with naturall images.</p>
               <p>Againe syr, are our seeing and hearing from whome these images you speake of first doe come, by your Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie actions or passions? If they be passions, howe are they compared with making of grauen images, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are actions? Finally, where he saith, this prohibition was not immutable, but temporall to that people, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all bounds of reason and common vnderstanding, as by the iudgment of God is become like vnto those Idols whome he defendeth. For hauing graunted before that Idolatrie was forbidden by this precept, nowe he restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the forbidding of idolatrie, only to the Iewes of that time, as though it were lawfull for Christians, who more streightly then the Iewes, must worship God in spirit and trueth Iohn. 4. and are commaunded to keepe them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues pure from Idols. 1.

                  <pb n="601" facs="tcp:14727:308"/>As M.S. saith, images are forbidden to be worshipped, as they are forbidden to be made, so say I,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulk.</hi>
                  </note> but with a farre differing vnderstanding. They may not be made to any vse of religion, so they may not be worshipped w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any religious worship, which apperteineth to God. For our religion is a seruice of God onely. And where he saith as Images might be made by the authoritie of Moses, or of the gouernours of Gods people, so they wert not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Gods: so they may be likewise worshipped by the authoritie of Gods church, this only prouiso being made, that Gods owne honour be not giuen vnto them. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that as neither Moses, nor any gouernour, had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to make any images in any vse of religion, other then God commanded, no more hath the Church any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to allowe any worshipping of them whiche she hath none authoritie by God to make, but an expresse commandement forbidding both the making &amp; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of them, in the first table of the law, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth onely religion. Nowe we haue saide both, let vs consider M. Sanders reasons. First he saith, God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his owne honour to be giuen to images, left it to the lawe of nature, and to the gouernors of his Churche, what honour images should haue. Concerning the lawe of nature, he saith, that God perceiued that when images of honourable personages are made, honor was due vnto them. What lawe of nature is this M. Sander, that is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the law of God? Or what nature is that, whose lawe alloweth the worshipping of images? In deed the corruption of mans nature, is to worship falshode in steed of trueth, but the law of nature hath no such rule, beeing al one with the lawe of God, as nature is nothing else but the ordinaunce of God. And where find you one title in the lawe, that God hath leaft it to the gouernours of his Church to appoint a worship meete for images? Worde you haue none, letter you haue none, nor pricke of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sounding that way. But you haue collections.</p>
               <p>First of the signification of Latria, as though God had written his Lawe in Greeke, and not in Hebrue: and
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:14727:309"/>
yet <hi>Latria,</hi> according to the Graecians, hath no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to signifie the seruice of God only, but euerie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of men also, and is all one that <hi>Doulia,</hi> and so vsed of Greeke writers, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we will say that <hi>Doulia,</hi> which you will haue to be giuen to images, is a more slauish &amp; seruile worship, then that whiche you would haue vs to giue to God.</p>
               <p>But you will helpe your distinction, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the commandementes, because God saith in the 1. precept, Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me, and then saith immediately, Thou shalt not make nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship images, but these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes are distinct or else you shall neuer make tenne. And whereas you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he saith immediatly after: I the Lord thy God, am a iealous God, that maketh cleane against you. For by those wordes, the Lorde declareth that he can no more abide the vse of images in his religion, then a iealous man can abide, any toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of an adulterer to be about his wife, therefore idolatrie in the scriptures is often called forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So the circumstances helpe you nothing, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together against you. But what an horrible monster of idolatrie is this, that after you haue once confessed, that Gods incomprehensible nature cannot be represented by any artificiall image, you affirme that Christe by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation hath taken away idolatrie, that we should not lacke some corporall trueth, wherein we might worship the Diuine substance? Whereas Christ himselfe telleth vs, that nowe the time is come, that God shall not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as before in bodily seruice at Ierusalem, or in the mountaine, but in spirite and trueth, Ioan. 4. The image of Christe you say is a similitude of an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trueth, whereas no idol doth represent a trueth. A worshipfull trueth, I promise you. Christe you say was man, but I say he is both God and man, a person consisting of those two natures. Your image represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth onely a person consisting of one nature, but suche a one is not Christe, therefore your image represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:14727:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a falshoode, and is by your owne distinction an Idol.</p>
               <p>For the Diuine nature you confesse cannot be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an artificiall image. Againe, what an image is it of his humanitie? It can not expresse his soule, but his bodie onely. Last of all, why is it an image rather of Christ, then of an other man: Seeing in lineamentes and proportion of bodie, it hath no more similitude vnto Christes bodie, then to an other mans? But that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the caruer to say, it is an image of Christ. O honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blockes and stones.</p>
               <p>But Philo the Iewe was cited for a fauourer of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, that images are none otherwise forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be made or worshipped, then to be made or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as GODS. Howe vaine the authoritie of a Iewe is for a Christian man to leane vnto, I shall not neede to say, especially when it is well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that the Iewes also not considering in whether table this commandement is placed, vnderstand by it, that all images generally are forbidden. And Philo saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to helpe him. For first in Decal. he saith: when God had spoken of his owne substance and honour, order would that he should tell how his holy name was to be worshipped. <q>And againe <hi>De eo quis haer. rer. Diuin. Vt solus Deus, &amp;c.</hi> That God onely might be truely worshipped.</q> What can be reasonably gathered of these wordes but that al honour is due to God, and therfore none to idols, which are forbidden to be made.</p>
               <p>If Philo a Iewe, will not serue, Augustine a Christian is alledged who <hi>Super Exod.</hi> 9.71. allowing that diuision of the tenne commandementes, by which three onely are saide to apperteine to God, saith: <hi>Et reuera, &amp;c.</hi> And truely that which is saide. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me, is more perfectly expounded, when forged things are forbidden to be worshipped. First for the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, Aug. is not constant with him selfe. For <hi>In Quaesti. Nou. &amp; Vet. Test.

                  </hi> Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me: this is the first worde or commandement: and he addeth the second: Thou shalt not make to thy self any similitude. By which it is manifest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to worship images, is not all one with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing other Gods. But M. Sander will answer our obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God forbiddeth all honour of images, thou shalt not fall downe to them nor worship them. Adoration saith he is a doubtfull worde. For Abraham adored the people of the lande Gen. 23. Very true, but with a ciuill worship, whereof we speake not nowe. He made obeysans to them, or as we say, he made courtesie to them. And the Angel refused to be adored, saying adore God. Therefore there is an adoration proper to God, for Angels sometime haue beene adored. Nay M. Sander, therefore all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worshippe perteineth to God. For S. Iohn was not so madde to worship the Angel as God, but as the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, with a religious, and not a ciuill worshippe. And when you say Angels haue beene adored, as Gen. 18. and Iudicum 13. I answere in both places, they were ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ciuill worship supposed by Abraham, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nohah to be honourable men, and not to be Angels. But when you cite Augustine to fortifie your distinction of Latria, and Doulia, you hurt your cause by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more then you further it by his authoritie. For whereas he in Exod. 94. saith that Latria is due to God as he is God, Doulia is due to God, as he is our Lorde, it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that worship, which is called Doulia, as well as that which is called Latria, is due onely to God, who is our onely Lord, and wil not giue his glorie to grauen Images: Es. 42.8. 1. Cor. 8.6.</p>
               <p>Theodoret saying: that God calleth his people from the worshipping of diuels, euen as Saint Paule, 1. Cor. 10. sheweth that worshipping of images is the worshipping of diuels. And whereas Maister Sander saith, it can not possibly be saide, that Christes images is dedicated to the diuell, I say plainely with Theodoret and Paule, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the diuell, when it is worshipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="605" facs="tcp:14727:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>For the Images of the Gentiles were not by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente of the makers and worshippers dedicated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, but to God and godly men and women: but when they were honored with religious honour, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth onely to God, the spirit of God saith, they were dedicated to deuils. And euen the same reason is of the Image of christ, of the Trinitie, of Peter, or any other, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with religious worshippe. Thus Augustine and Theodoret cited by him, are both against him. Well, yet he will disproue the comparison that M. Iewell maketh betweene Gods wordes, and M. Hardings.</p>
               <p>Iewell. God saith, thou shalt make to thy selfe no grauen Images. M. Hardinge saieth, thou shalt make to thy selfe grauen Images. But M. Sander saieth, neither God nor M. Harding say so, that is, they do not meane so: for God expounding his meaning, added, thou shalt not adore them, nor giue them the honor due to God aboue: therefore M. Iewell did euill to deuide Gods saying, and by that diuision, hee is sure that hee hath condemned his owne conscience. So that by M. Sanders interpretation to make Images, and to adore them, is all one. But M. Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, seeinge them to be distincte matters, to make and to worshippe, without condemning his conscience, did speak first of making, and then of worshippinge of Images. And although M. Sander, be either so blind, or so wilful, that he cannot see, or will not acknowledge, the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the two tables of the Lawe, the matter of one being religion, the other charitie, yet M. Iewell did well inough consider, that the Queenes Maiesties Image gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in her coyne, and such like pictures, as nothing at all concerned religion, nor nothinge at all forbidden, were made by a commandement of the first table.</p>
               <p>Now followeth another comparison. Iewell. God saith, thou shalt not fall downe to them, nor worshippe them. M. Harding saith, thou shalt fall downe to them, and worshippe them. But M. Sander answereth, that M. Harding defendeth, that another degree of honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably inferiour to that which is due to God, may
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:14727:311"/>
be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to images, &amp; not that which is due to God. Wel, then is M. Hard. &amp; Sander to, contrary to other papists as great doctors as they. But yet M. Iewels comparison doth stand. For God forbiddeth al worship of Images, Master Hard. aloweth some worship of Images. Again, how wil you distinguish the falling downe to God, from falling downe to Images. And therfore M. Iewel is no wrangler: for meane Harding what he can meane, his saying and meaning is contradiction, to the saying and meaning of God. But you wil aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rme (saith M. Sander) that al maner of honour is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be giuen to any kind of Image. You haue against you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of the law of nature, the word of God, the iudgement of the ancient fathers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of general councels, the practise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church, as hereafter shalbe declared. Verily M. Sander if you can bring al these authorities to vphold the worshipping of Images, you shal do more then any man was euer able to do before you, but hitherto you haue brought nothing worth the hearing. But in the meane time, you wil proue that there are two kindes of honour, the one due to God alone, the other to his creatures &amp; so to Images. But you must proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be two kindes of religious honor, or els you proue nothing for your purpose. For ciuil honor wil not helpe you one iote for worshipping of Images, except you be of that minde as Boniface a gentleman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Stamford was, that would salute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament of the altar with curtesie &amp; these words. <hi>God giue you good morrow good Lord.</hi> And what haue you to proue this your distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Nothing in the world, but a saying of Augustine, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>De ciuit.

This other name is <hi>Doulia</hi> whereof S. Paule saith in another place. Serue ye one another, by charity. I pray you M. Sander, if you be not turned into such an Image, (whole worship you defend) tell me sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:14727:311"/>
whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difference of these honors be not as great as the distinction of the two tables, religion and charitie? but how prooue you that <hi>Doulia</hi> which is here taken for a ciuil worshippe, may be applyed to Images, whom you honour with a religious worshippe? Yes mary, saye you, by this it is prooued, that we may serue Sainte Paule, In deede if you had liued when Sainte Paule liued, it had bene your dutie to haue honoured him with ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or seruice of loue, but nowe he is dead, I say plainly, you ought not to serue him, nor worship him, with any religious honor. So saith Augustine, <hi>De vera religione cap.</hi> 55. <hi>Non sit nobis religio cultus hominum mortuorum.</hi> 
                  <q>Let it not be our religion, the worshipping of deade men: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Honoramus eos charitate non seruitute.</hi> We honour them with loue, not with seruice. Loe Master Sander, here is your <hi>Doulia</hi> or <hi>seruitus,</hi> denyed to Saintes that are dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The foundation of your argument being thus ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, we will suppose it doth stande, that Saint Paule is still to be serued, how prooue you that we must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe his Image? Forsothe we must thinke anye thinge that is his, to be aboue vs, at leaste in signification, for S. Paules owne excessiue honour. In deede Master Sander you doe well to call it an excessiue honour. But by this reason, I muste muche more worshippe all Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>For if I must thinke any thing of Sainte Paules to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mee, and to worshippe it, then much more must I thinke any thinge of Gods to be aboue mee, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I must worshippe it. Now the vilest creature in the worlde, yea, the deuill himselfe is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a thinge of Gods, then an Image is a thinge of Sainte Paules, therefore I muste thinke euerye one of Gods creatures to bee aboue mee, and worshippe it for his sake. O blockishe blindenesse of Idolatrous papists.</p>
               <p>But it vexeth you that Maister Iewell calleth your
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:14727:312"/>
worshippinge of Images Idolodoulia, because you will not haue it Idololatria, for the Images of Christ and S. Paule you saye be no Idoles, because Idoles are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to serue and honour the deuill withall. Verily such be your Images of Christ and Saint Paule, though not by your intention, yet by the holy ghostes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>Last of al, M. Iewell himself is proued to be a seruer of Images, if not with <hi>Latria,</hi> yet with <hi>Doulia Papae.</hi> A strange matter: but howe is it prooued so to be? Marye sir, hee confesseth himselfe to honour the sacrament of Christes Supper, which he teacheth to be an Image of Christes bodye and blood, but he will not giue Gods owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bread and wine, therefore it followeth inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that M. Iewell serueth, that is to say, he honoureth some Image. Ha ha he, M. Sander hath a pleasaunt witte, if he be in iest: but if he in earnest, as I am afraide he is, I will saye no more but that hee is a wrangler. If M. Iewel say the sacrament is an Image, doth he speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly or figuratiuely? If figuratiuely, then the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that which is not an Image properly, prooueth not, that he honoureth that which is an Image properly. Againe, when he speaketh of honouring doth he meane adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, worshipping, kneeling to the sacrament, which he condemneth: or els reuerent esteeming of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Christ? what hath this to doe with falling downe to stockes and stones? Finally doe we serue all thinges that wee honour (for M Sander maketh them all one) if wee doe, then men must serue their wiues whom they must honour, and men serue the weake partes of their body, which they honour most. These be the inuincible arguments for defence of Idolatrie.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>This Chapter conteineth a metaphysicall discourse of images, naturall and artificiall.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulke.</hi>
                  </note> The effecte whereof is this, that the nature of a thing cannot be expressed in an artificiall image, but by a naturall image onely, as the soone is the image of his father, expressing his fathers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But an artificiall image is the onely image of the person, or rather of the personall shape of him, that it representeth. And this being confessed, he sayeth it is an easie matter to aunswere the argument that is made, to proue the image of Christ to be a liuing image, because his Godhead cannot be represented in an image. For that image representeth such externall shape of Christ, as hee had in deede. But if he haue not forgotten him selfe, he sayed before, that an artificiall image is an image onely of the person or rather the personall shape of him whom it representeth. But neither the person, nor yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall shape of Christ is represented by such an image, therefore it is a lying image. For the externall shape of Christes bodie is not the personall shape of Christe. For as Christes person differeth from the person of euery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, so his image must differ from the person of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other man, or else it is a false image by Master Sanders owne groundes. But Master Sander sayeth, that as by his manhood the faithfull were ledd to his diuine nature when hee liued, so by his image wee are ledd to his humaine shape, from thence to his humanitie, and so vpwarde to his diuine nature. Here is an handsome ladder, but that the steppes stande too farre a sunder for any man to clymbe by it. For I denye that his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were ledd by his manhod to vnderstande or beleeue his Godhead, but onely by faith through his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite inwardly, and outwardly by his doctrine and the workes of his Godhead. Yet sayeth he, if wee paint as much as his Apostles sawe, it is no lying sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="610" facs="tcp:14727:313"/>What neede wee paint that which wee may more liuely see in our selues, and in any other liuing man, then in a deade image, namely the outwarde shape of a man?</p>
               <p>After this, he gathereth conclusions: firste, that it is neither possible nor lawfull to make an image, which may expresse the nature of God, of Angels, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature. Secondly it is possible and lawfull to make the image representing the personall propertie of any knowen creature. This is true in the second table of the lawe, but not in the first. Thirdly: The blessed Trinitie and infinite persons of Angels cannot properly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be expressed by any artificiall image. If this be true of the image of the Trinitie, why do you Papistes suffer and defende such horrible idols and monsters of a man with three faces, or with three bodies to expresse the blessed Trinitie? If Angels cannot bee represented by image, and if three persons be infinite, how doth your Idolatrous councell of Nice the seconde, not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that their images may bee made, but also that they haue bodies, and be circumscriptible? <hi>Actione.</hi> 5. But you will not long holde this conclusion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I woulde knowe what diuinitie, yea, or Phylosophie this is, that you saye, the persons of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are infinite? I thought there had beene nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually infinite, but God onely, and that all creatures are definite, though they be spirituall, inuisible, and incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscriptible. But to let you goe with that inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate terme, and not to vrge it so farre, as to make you an vpholder of tenne thousands of Gods, your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, that visions which were of bodily formes may as well be paynted as preached, whether they were of the Trinitie or of Angels, as the three Angels that appeared to Abraham in the shape of men. The vision of Daniel 7. of the sonne of man, that came to him was auncient of dayes. The historie of the father speaking to Christe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the holie Ghost appearing in the shape of a Doue. Admit that these visions may be painted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for so much as was seene, yet must they be painted as those visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:14727:313"/>
onely, and not otherwise: for if God to shewe the distinction of the persons in Trinitie, hath appeared in the shape of three men, yet is it not lawfull to paint the Trinitie so, and although the father in a vision ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like an olde man, and the holie Ghoste like a Doue, yet is it not lawfull to paint God the father so alwayes, nor the holie Ghoste, much lesse to make such monsters as neuer appeared in any vision. And therefore God him selfe warned the people to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he did not appeare to them in the mounteyne, when he gaue the lawe, in any forme or shape, because they shoulde not bee deceiued to make an image there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to represent him withall Deuteronom. 4. vers. 15.</p>
               <p>Also Saint Paule preaching to the Athenienses, sayeth, that seeing wee are the generation of God, wee ought not to thinke, that the Godhead is like to golde, siluer, or stone, grauen by arte, and the inuention of man. Act. 17. vers. 29.</p>
               <p>And if you should paint the storie of the baptisme of Christe, howe woulde you paint the person of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which appeared not in any shape, but onely a voice from him was hearde? But knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue to doe with wranglers, you say you would haue no image of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Trinitie, but only to shewe that there bee three seuerall persons in one godhead, &amp; this you thinke S. Augustine <hi>de fide &amp; symbolo</hi> would beare. Ca. 7. but you shal heare his words. <q>
                     <hi>Non ideo tamen quasi humana forma circumscriptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi> Yet must we not therefore thinke, that God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> father is circumscribed as it were with an humane shape, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we think of him, a right side or a left side shoulde come into our mind, or euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is sayde, that the father doth sit, we must not thinke to be done with bowing of his legges, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we fall not into that sacrilege wherewith the Apostle curseth them that haue changed the glorie of the incorruptible God, into the similitude of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man. For it is extreme wickednes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Christian man shoulde place such an image for God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple, much more is it wicked in his heart where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple of God is
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:14727:314"/>
in deede, if it be clensed from earthly desire and errour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This saying of Augustine woulde suffice any sober man to see, what is his iudgement, for such images of God, or the Trinitie, which yet Maister Sander, though not simply, yet in some respect wil defende. And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (he sayeth) may be painted or grauen with wings, as they were made in the tabernacle, or as they appeared to the Prophets and the Apostles. And so you may paint the diuels in such shape as they haue appeared to men, but what is this to make images of them for any vse of religion, which God hath forbidden?</p>
               <p>But now followeth another metaphysicall abstracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the image which is an accident, from the matter or substance thereof, being stone, wodde, &amp;c. which is a hard lesson for the common people to learne, and when it is learned, it is not worth a strawe, for any helpe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The grosse image of stone being made thus a subtile &amp; fantasticall image by abstraction, is ioyned with the trueth, when the fantasie considereth whose image it is, and then it is not possible, but that it must partake some parte of the honour of that whereof it is a signe, being an honourable thing. To passe ouer this fond ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting and ioyning, which is a toy to mocke with an ape, I will come to the conclusion of honour dewe to the signe. I pray you Maister Sander, what impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is this, that you talke of vs? Must euery signe of an honourable thing needes partake some of the honour dewe to the thing? The print of a mans foote in the snowe, is the signe of a man that hath trod there, which is an honourable thing, and perhaps was a King, is this signe worthie of any honour due to a King? Yea, the Kinges picture is on his coyne or else where to be seen, is that picture worthie of any parte of the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? You sayed before, you woulde not haue any parte of Gods honour giuen to his image, and howe agreeth that saying with this your principle, it is not possible, but euerie signe of an honorable thing, must partake some of the honour which is in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="613" facs="tcp:14727:314"/>But you will shewe vs the order, howe the image com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be partaker of honour, but it were more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, you should shew vs the reason why it should haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then the order howe it commeth. But let vs see the order. The painting of Christes death moueth the eye, the eye aduertiseth our common-sense, our common sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth our fantasie, reason draweth out of fantasie this deepe consideration y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this image is true, and profitable to saluation, and worthie of all honour. This may well be an idolaters reason, but surely a Christian man faith is instructed by hearing, and not by seeing, blessed are they (saith Christ) which haue beleeued and not seene. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20 A Christian man learneth of the Lord by his Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacuc, Cap.</hi> 2. vers. 18. &amp; 19. that a grauen image is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for nothing, that it is a teacher of lyes, and curseth him that saith, an image shall teach him: and much more him that shall say, it is worthie of all honour. By which saying you may see the impudencie of idolaters, which though at the first they seeme modest in giuing but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of honour to images, and not that which is giuen to God, afterward they come to giue images some of that honour which is due to God, and last of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all shame, to pronounce that an image of Christes death is worthie of all honour. And this must needes be (saith he) except Maister Iewell will say this image is not good, yea, no doubt but he would say, such an image as Maister Sander counteth worthie of all honour, is abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>M. Sander would haue ended this Chapter with this wholesome doctrine, but that M. Iewell after long dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, concludeth that the cognisaunces of the crosse, are barres laid a crosse, and no images, which seemeth strange to him, bicause he tooke an image to be the resemblance of any thing quicke or dead. I had thought such a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicall disputer of images, would haue added the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the image maker, to expresse such a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to make it an image of that thing, for else as the tale goeth, he may haue a great number of crosses on a
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:14727:315"/>
threed bare coate of some man, that hath neuer a crosse in his purse. But if by the intent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> makers, such crosses in flagges, banners, targets, and coynes, were made to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of Christes crosse, yet are they no images for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, bicause they be not in any vse of religion, and therefore this is a foolish quarell, not worth ten strawes laide a crosse.</p>

But Origen and Theodoret in deede make this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; that an idoll is of that thing that is not at all, nor euer was seene in the world, as a picture of a man with a dogges head, an image is of that thing that is or was, as an image of Cicero, of any other man that liueth. But that this distinction is false, it appeareth by the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, which being heads without bodies, and wings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, haue no resembrance to any thing that euer was seene in the world, yet are they called images
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:14727:315"/>
euen of the Papists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, &amp; not idols. Now he would proue that the images of the Gentiles were of things that neuer were, and therfore to be idolls, and the Popish images be of Christe, Peter, and Paule, &amp;c. which were, therefore they be similitudes, but no idols. But what helpeth this distinction of the name, although it were receiued, when God by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement forbad the making and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the one, as much as the other? So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this difference is as much able to defend Popish images, as when a lawe is made against robbers and theeues, a theefe would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour tooth and nayle, to shewe the difference of robberie and theft, and then hauing proued him self to be no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, would conclude he were no theefe. Yet seeing M. San. hath taken paines to gather the difference betweene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish idols and Popish images in tenne pointes, I will consider them in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> order. Some idols were feigned mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, all Popish images haue that essentiall truth in the world which they represent. This reddition is false, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of the Trinitie, like a man with three faces or thre bodies, hath no essentiall trueth. Likewise the image of a childe entering into the mouth of the Virgine Marie, in the storie of the Annunciation painted in diuers places, and namely in the cloyster or walking place of Alsoule Colledge in Oxenford, where I haue seene it, is an hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal falshood. And to omit the images of a thousand feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned miracles, as S. Francis preaching to the Geese, &amp;c. The image of S. Christopher the Giant, of S. George with his monstruous dragon, of S. Sunday, of S. Vncoulber a she Saint with a beard, and such like, proue that al Popish images haue not that essentiall trueth which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All their idolls were without trueth concerning to faith and religion, al Popish images containe such a truth as belongeth to Christes faith and religion. Beside the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere before confuteth this excuse the commaundement of God being against all similitudes in religion, proueth it vtterly false and abhominable.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Sacrifice was offered to their idolles, whereof it was
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:14727:316"/>
called idolatrie, and they idolaters, but no sacrifice is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Popish idolls, but to God alone, I say, they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no sacrifice to the stockes, but to the Gods whose ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they were. So do your Papistes, offer vp the sacrifice of prayer and thankesgiuing, the only sacrifice of Christians, as Iustinus saith, <hi>Decal. cum Tryph.</hi> and pay your vowes to your images, &amp; to the Saintes whose images you say they be, therefore by your owne definition you are idolaters.</p>

                     <hi>Sed existit nescio quis disputator, &amp;c.</hi> But there is a certeine disputer I wot not who, which thought himselfe to be learned and saith: I doe not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that stone, nor that image, which is without sense: for your prophet could not know that they haue eyes and see not, and to be ignorant that that image hath no life, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet neither seeth with eyes, nor heareth with eares. Therefore I doe not worship that, but I adore that which I see, and serue him whom I see not. Who is he? The God whiche being inuisible is president of that image. By this means yeelding a reason of their images, they seeme to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be eloquent, because they worship not idols, and worship diuels. They answere, we worship not euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, but euen the Angels whome you so call do we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the vertues of the great God, and the ministers of the great God. I would you would worship them, you should easily learne, of them not to worship them. Thus Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, in whiche saying, beside that he sheweth what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the Heathen had for their idolatrie, he sheweth that the true worship of Angels is not to worship them by images or otherwise, but onely to learne of them not to worship them, but God alone.</q> But howe can M. Sander say they adore no vnreasonable creature by their images, when they adore the image of the crosse, which was both an vnreasonable an insensible creature? And how doth he worship one God more then this Heathen man, whose feigned excuse S. Augustine reporteth?</p>
               <p n="8">8 The diuels ruled the images of the Gentiles, giuing oracles out of them, &amp;c. but the faith of Papistes whiche endeuouring to keepe Gods commandementes, do set vp images to a good end, so beautifieth their work and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that it is not possible for the diuel to abuse them. If we beleeue that the diuel gaue oracle out of the Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish idols, and not rather that they were feigned by the subtiltie of men: we may likewise thinke, that the diuell gaue answers out of Popish images, which are likewise

saide to haue spoken, as that Roode in Dunstones time to decide the controuersie for marriage of Priestes, &amp; many other feigned in the Bookes of Popish miracles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where heard the Papistes out of Gods wordes, this faith of setting vp Images? Thirdly how doe they inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to keepe Gods commaundement in setting vp of idols, when they breake a manifest commaundement of God, which forbiddeth images to be worshipped?</p>
               <p n="9">9 The diuels coueted to mainteine their idols. The same couet to ouerthrowe Popish images. No verily, they loue Popish images, by which God is dishonoured, as wel as they did loue Heathenish images. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tale of the diuels persuading Iulian the Apostata to breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of Christ at Paneade, which is not like to haue continued vnto his dayes, if we receiue it, which was written by no writer of his time, nor an hundreth yeares after, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no hatred that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel had of images, but of Christ, &amp; might be a subtile practise of his to bring the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with fonde emulation to esteeme such a thing more then it was worthie because their enemie hath defaced it.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Their idols were dedicated to an Heathenish purpose, Popish images to a vertuous intent. But how can that be a vertuous intent, which is contrarie to Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?</p>
               <p>Last of all he will aunswere our obiection, that Popish images haue been abused in making their eyes to moue, and their lippes to wagge, &amp;c. First he saith, these were but abuses of particular men, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop was a sleep, but not allowed in the Church, yea, the Gospel hath been abused. Gods curse light of that comparison, which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth images with the Gospell. But were al Bishops high and low in your Church so sound a sleepe, that not one could see these horrible abuses to punish them? For what one exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple can be brought, of any one among so many, that hath beene punished by the Papists, for such detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuse? Secondly he answereth, these abuses are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by men not yet euerlastingly condemned, &amp; not by diuels, which haue their torments increased, when they aproch to such holy things as they haue no power of. As
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:14727:317"/>
though wicked men could worke such things, but by the diuels procurement, who wil no more be afraide to abuse an image, then to persuade a man to abuse it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth both one punishment. Thirdly if suche practisers of abuse liued in Luthers time, they commonly became runnagates, with the first, if any such haue repented and confesseth their wicked facts, it is to your shame, M. Sa. &amp; not to ours, for they were yours, when they did suche things. To conclude, I wish the Reader to consider, howe vaine and foolish the whole scope of this Chapter of M. Sanders booke is, to shewe the difference of idols &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the second commandement, when God wrote not the same in Greeke, out of which tong this supposed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is deriued, but in Hebrue: &amp; euen the common La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine translation, which the Papistes doe followe, calleth that which the Greekes terme <gap reason="foreign">

               </argument>
               <p>M. Harding had confessed, that images by a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent might be worshipped, The Bish. of Sarum said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulk.</hi>
                  </note> An image is a creature and no God. And to honour a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that sorte (as it is set vp to the end to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped although not specially to that end) is idolatrie, therefore by Maister Hardings owne confession, images are set vp to be vsed to idolatrie. This is the argument, that hath foure as great faultes in it, as there be knots in a rush. The first fault is, that he putteth <hi>Idolum</hi> in steede of <hi>Imago.</hi> The second that he putteth <hi>Doulia</hi> in steede of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="620" facs="tcp:14727:318"/>
that we may set vp no creature to the intent that it may be any wayes honoured. The last faulte, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth an image to be a creature. The first and seconde faultes are falsly found, for he nameth neither <hi>Idolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> nor <hi>Latria,</hi> but this compound worde idolatrie, and maketh this proposition. To honour a creature in that forte, &amp;c. is idolatrie. Meaning whether the creature be an image, or no image, As to worship the Sunne, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moone is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie which be creatures, and so tearmed by all learned men, and euen by the Papistes themselues, which call the worshipping of an vnconsecrated host, idolatrie. The third fault is also a forged quarrell, for he doeth not presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that we may set vp no creature to be worshipped, but he saith, to honour a creature in that sorte, that is, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship as it is set vp to be worshipped is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. And therefore M. Sanders imagination of a king set vp in his throne, to be honoured, of certeine men that had rebelled against him, is foolishe and ridiculous. For the Bishop in his proposition, speaketh of religious worship which is proper onely to God, and not of ciuill honour. The fourth fault also, is a fonde quarrelling, or rather an vngodly denying of an image to be a creature. For by this meanes, he maketh a thirde thing existent in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. that is neither God the creator, nor a creature, but he saith it is a manufacture, and not a creature, like as he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that their worshipping of Images is not idolatrie but image douly, that is seruing of images, whiche is all one as if a man would say, a horse is a beast, therefore it is not a substance. So he may deny a man to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture because he is a geniture, that is a thing begotten. But perhaps he will allowe all thinges made of God or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be creatures, but nothing made of man, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or chaire, a sword, &amp;c. are no creatures, because they are made with mens handes. What then wil he cal a tree, that is graffed with mens handes, and groweth by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture also? Those he highe pointes of Diuinitie I promise you.</p>
               <p>But to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose, there is neither substance nor forme of
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:14727:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any thing in the worlde but it is a creature, therefore both in respect of the matter and fashion, an Image is a creature, except you will say with the Master of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>dist.</hi> 37. that the forme of an Image in that it is set vp to be worshipped, is no creature, but a peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a creature, as all sinne is. And least you shoulde take exceptions to my tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slating of <hi>Idolum</hi> for an Image, he speaketh of the forme of a man in <hi>Idolo,</hi> which is no faigned thing, but a thing of trueth.</p>
               <p>But to cut of all this vaine babling, that an Image is no creature, the Apostle S. Paule speaking of the Images of the Gentiles, by which they turned the glory of God into the similitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of a mortal man &amp;c. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Images creaturs, And they serued the creature more then the Creator, which is to be blessed for euer. Rom. 1. vers. 23. &amp; 25.</p>
               <p>But hee faineth an obiection of M. Iewelles, that an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is lesse then a creature, and therefore it deserueth lesse honour then a creature: Whereas M. Iewell said, an Image is a creature. But he answereth his owne obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that because an Image is able to stir vs vp to a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good remembraunce, and to prouoke vs to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it is worthie of greater honour then a creature. As though we ought not by any immediate creature of god, to be stirred vp to good remembraunces, and prouoked to vertue, rather then by an vnprofitable, dead, and dumbe Image. And who will graunt him, that an Image is able to stirre vs vp to goodnesse, or to prouoke vs to vertue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Image, (as the scripture saith) is good for nothing. Abacuc. 2. But admitte that men by the sight of an Image, take occasion of good remembraunce, the Image in this case is no agent, and therefore worthie of no honour. A man seeinge the gallowes, which is a signe of execution of Iustice, is mooued to remember Iustice, which is a good remembraunce, and is thereby prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to absteine from vice and to liue vertuously, is the gallowes therefore worthie of honour? I thinke not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the gallowes is no agent or doer in those good
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:14727:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things, but onely the minde of man that taketh occasion of that he seeth. No more doeth an image, and therefore no more worthy of honor. But Augustine saith, <hi>De verb. Dom. Ser.</hi> 58 <hi>Si quis nostrum, &amp;c.</hi> If anye of vs should finde the kings purple or crowne lying a side, woulde he go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to worship them? But when the king hath them on him, he runneth in danger of death, if any man contemne to worship them together with the king. So saieth M.S. the Image is to be honored in respect of the truth, whose similitude it beareth. A wise similitude. First he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ciuil worship with religious worshippe, as he doeth euery where. Secondly that which is reuerenced necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, because it is annexed with an honourable thinge, with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is not annexed, for God may be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped without images, the king ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be worshipped with out his robes reseruing humane &amp; naturall honestye. Thirdly, that which is accidentally worshipped, as the kings crowne, his purple, &amp;c. Because the king wearinge them is worshipped, is alledged to prooue that a proper worship is due to images, distinct from the worship due to the paterne or sampler. <q>But of religious worship, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine saith: <hi>Nihil omnino colendum est, totum<expan>

<pb n="626" facs="tcp:14727:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will let them passe also, and stande vppon the credite of their authors.</p>
               <p>But nowe we come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous image of the woman which had the bloudie issue, and of Christ set vp on high before her doore, on a piller, with an herbe that grewe vnder it, which when it touched the hemme of the garment of the image of Christ, it healed all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>This M. Iewel wil not call a fable (saith he) but he himselfe addeth fables to that which is written of Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, as first, that it was set vp by the woman, whiche is vnlike, that a poore woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which (as the Gospel teacheth) had wasted all her goods vppon phisitions Mark. 5. could be able to set vp such a costly image of Brasse vppon a piller. Secondly, it is not like, she woulde haue set vp her owne image. Thirdly Eusebius saith it was set vp by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. And therefore the reporte of Theophylact which lyued a thousand yeres after, is of small credit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he saith that Eusebius sawe this image, which is not to be proued by any worde he speaketh, although he saith that he had seen other images of Christ, of Peter &amp; of Paule. But nowe to examine these falsifications pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. First he chargeth the bishop with false Latining and worse Englishing of this greeke following, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The bishopps latine is: <q>

                  </gap>, <hi>Olim,</hi> in times past, is left out in the latine, which is false, for it is included in the word <hi>veteres.</hi> In deede in the english by the printers fault it is omitted. M. Sander woulde iustifie the bolde and false translation of Ruffinus, which turneth these wordes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>qui ex Gentilibus crediderant</hi>: Such of the Gentiles as had beleeued. Where he manifestly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the worde <hi>crediderant</hi> which is not in Eusebius.</p>

                  <pb n="627" facs="tcp:14727:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>Wherein you may see the equitie of Maister Sanders, which findeth faulte with Maister Iewell for leauing out that which he doth not omitte, and iustifieth Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus which doth openly adde to the text. But for all his trifling about wordes, hee sheweth him selfe ignorant of the phrase: for when hee hath wrangled as much as hee can, the Latine of the Greeke, worde for worde is this: <q>
                     <hi>Nec mirum est eos ex Gentibus qui olim beneficio affecti sunt a seruatore nostro ista fecisse.</hi> And it is no marueile that those of the Gentiles which of olde time were benefited by our Sauiour Christe, haue done these thinges.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now Maister Sander like a falsifier, rendeth these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des asunder, and will haue all that matter to stande in these wordes: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which hee sayeth must needes signifie those which in times past had beene Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but after had beleeued, which wordes if he wring vntill the bloud come foorth, yet can hee not make such a signification of them. For if Eusebius had meant so, hee woulde haue added <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or some wordes of like effecte. Secondly, hee would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue sayde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, those that sometime were Gentiles, then those that of olde time were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but that in the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of olde time, he had relation vnto the time of Christe. Thirdly as maister Sander himselfe afterwarde striuing for the Aduerbe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, vnchaungeablye, to be ioyned with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiple sheweth himselfe a good Grammarian: So here diuiding the Aduerbe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from the Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ioyning it with nothing, sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a malicious wrangler, and a shamelesse fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifier.</p>
               <p>Nowe where hee sayeth, it is not like to bee true, that Christe bestowed anye greate cure vppon those, who shoulde haue tarryed still Heathens, because hee more willingly cured the soule then the bodie: I aunswere, the chiefe ende of his cures, was not
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:14727:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the priuate benefite of them that were cured, but to shewe himselfe to all men, to be the sonne of God, the true phisition of body and soule. But M. Sander repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, though some were vnkind, as the 9. Lepers Luke. 17. yea, some were carelesse of him, as the man that had lyen 38. yeares in the porche, and the blinde man, vntill he instucted them by his worde, Iohn. 5. &amp; 9. yet those which did set vp images in his honour, were not vnkind. I aunswere, they thought to satisfye them selues with a vaine, superstitious, and heathenishe kinde of remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly hee sayeth, with Theophylact a late writer, that this woman which was faithfull did set vp this image, but that I haue proued before to bee neither true, nor like to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But this is not all Master Iewels falshod (sayeth hee) for hee sayeth moreouer: <hi>Nam &amp; Apostolorum Pauli &amp; Petri, &amp; ipsius Christi imagines coloribus ductas &amp; seruatas vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus.</hi> For wee haue seene the images of Paule and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of Christe drawen in coulours and preserued.</q> Here first beside the lacke of <hi>eius,</hi> his, which he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to be of no importance, he misseth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> et, which he wil needes haue to signifie also. What quarrelling mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant is this? here is <hi>et</hi> thrise, yet none of them wil serue his turne, because the firste is not translated, also, that it might be thought that Eusebius had seene the former image of brasse. But seeing <hi>et</hi> is twise put, once before <hi>Apostolorum,</hi> and then before <hi>ipsius Christi,</hi> by iudgement of all English Grammarians it may truely be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus: For wee haue seene the images drawen in colours and preserued, both of his Apostles Paule and Peter, and also of Christ him selfe. Againe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be translated euen of his Apostles Paule and Peter.</p>
               <p>What Empyre hath Master Sander in Grammer, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may signifye nothing but also: when it hath three significations beside, and, both, euen. But it pleaseth Master Sander, that Eusebius which liued about three hundreth yeares after Christe, sawe painted images of
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:14727:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ himselfe &amp; of his Apostles, yea, but in the hands of Heathen men, or men of Heathenish superstition, or else perhaps among the Gnostikes &amp; Carpocratites heretikes. For what one worde of commendation doth he bestowe vpon them? He sawe them in deede, but if they had bene profitable for Christianitie, why did he not make the like, or cause them to be made in his church of Caesarea? What cause haue you hitherto (M. Sander) to cry out, O the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of M. Iewell? seeing for any thing you haue shewed, it is true which he saith: The Phaeniciens being Heathens, made these images in the honour of Christe, and of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, onely of their heathenish and vaine superstition. But you will shewe a further falshoode in M. Iewell, and that still in one storie, for he proceedeth: <q>
                     <hi>Et credibile est, pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos illos homines nondum relicta auita superstition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That M. Iewell meant no fraud in, this translation, it is manifest by that which M. Sander confesseth, that he set the Greeke wordes by the side of his booke, which are these, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. that is, as it is like, that those auncient men vnchangably after this maner were accustomed to honour them as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours by an heathenish custome vsed among them. This I haue translated worde for worde, and what difference is there in sense from M. Iewels translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that nothing of his can please M. San. for first he maketh one quarell, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifieth vnchangably, or without change, which M. Iewel hath turned, not yet being remoued from the superstition of their fathers.</q> But Ruffinus also transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, <hi>ex gentili consuetudine indifferenter,</hi> of an heathenish custome indifferently, and M. San. himself afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that it is an heathenish custome to honour men with setting vp their images. And if it was superstitious in the heathen, therefore it was superstitious in these Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:14727:323"/>
which folowed the heathenish custome, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> without any change. Secondly he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Englished, their sauiours. And why so, I pray you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What other thing doth the worde signifie, but a Sauiour of whole or part, of body or soule. Except you will say, that among the Heathen, Castor &amp; Pollux were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the plural number, but it was for that they were supposed to be sauiours or preseruers of Mariners, which declareth in what sense Eusebius saith, these men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped them without chaunge, by an heathenish custome <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> euen as they worshippe sauiours for example, such and so as they called Castor and Pollux. I will not therefore sticke with you, but that those men of whome Eusebius speaketh in this last sentence, were such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed some l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alexander the Emperour wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the image of Christe in his Chappell among his other idols.

such professours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christian name, as either know, not or shewe not the vertue of their profession. Seeke not vp the multitude of vnskilfull men, which euen in true religion it selfe are superstitious, or else so giuen to filthie lustes, that they haue forgotten what they haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to God. I knowe there be many worshippers of tombs and pictures: I know there be many which most riotous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinke ouer the dead, &amp; making banquets for the dead bodies, burie them selues vpon the buried bodies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their gluttonies and dronkennesse to be religion.</q> Such Christians they might be, of whome Eusebius spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. But M. San. confessing this maner of honouring by images, to be an heathenish custom, doth also affirme, that it was a laudable custome, saying, that it was but pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, &amp; scrupulositie in the Iewes, that they durst make no images. So that to obey the commandement of God, is counted of him for a vice, and it is a great vertue of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, to be bolde to do that which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But what reason hath he? Forsooth, all things that the heathens vsed, were not euill. Sacrifice was not euill, though the heathen did offer sacrifice to diuels. Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Nuns, for so it pleaseth him to translate <hi>Sanctiomoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alium</hi> in Augustine, although there were no Popish names in his time, is not euill, bicause the heathen had their vestall Virgines. So that by his Logike, there is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of things good and lawfull, if they be well vsed, as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and virginitie, and things simply forbidden, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and worshipping of images in religion.</p>
               <p>But nowe we are come to S.

               <p>To that which the Bishop saith this image beeing in the streete, proueth not the setting vppe of Images in the Churche, he aunswereth, there were other images whiche Eusebius sawe, and where should he see them, but in the Churche in Constantine his time? I haue shewed before where he might see them, among the Heathens and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes. And that he sawe none in the Church, appeareth in the <hi>Panaegynt ad Paulin. Tyr. Epu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. where a godly Church is described in euerie small parte and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of it, yet no image at all spoken of, which should not haue beene omitted if it had beene seene there, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beeing such necessarie ornamentes of Churches as the Papistes account them.</p>
               <p>But Iulianus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> runnagate (saith he) out of the tripertite historie. <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 41. brake that Image, and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans afterwarde gathered vp the peeces and laide them in a Churche. If this be not giuing of honour to Christes images, he cannot tell what is honouring of Images. Yes M. Sander, to set candels before them, to kneele to them, to pray to them, to kisse them, to offer to them, to make vowes to them, to ascribe health to them, &amp;c. These are honouring of images vsed of Papistes, other maner of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring then those Christians are saide to haue vsed. For if it be credible, that the peeces of brasse lay in the streete vntill Iulianus was dead, that they might be gathered vp of the Christians, and were not molten to none other vse by the Paganes, yet why did not the Christians rather melt them &amp; make them a new image, then lay them vp in the Church? But M. Iewell is charged to speake if he dare, what he would do, if he chaunced to come into the same Church, where the image of Christ were kept, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would follow Iulianus in breaking it, rather then the Christians in reseruing it.</p>

He wold neither followe the spightfull malice of Iulian, nor the superstitious emulation of those Christians, but do with it as it became a Christian man according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and his calling. And for my parte, M. Sander I dare speake vnto you what I thinke. I am one which es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme monuments, as much as any one poore man of my degree. In so muche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a wise man perhaps might say vnto me. <hi>Insanis veteres statuas Damasippus emendè.</hi> And therfore if I had in my priuate possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such images of Christ, Peter and Paul, as Eusebius did see, and that I were assured they were the true counterfets of their bodies or countenances as those which he did see were supposed to be. I would so esteeme them, as I do the Images of Caesar, Pompeius, Tulla, and such like, and peraduenture for the rarenesse, much more, but not a pinne the more in respect of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For I do so honour auncient images, that I make as great account of a peece of Nero, or Heliogabalus, as I do of Constantius, and Theodosius. But if I had authority of a Church, in which were an image of pure gold represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole stature, countenance, &amp; apparell of Christ as he walked vpon the earth, which were abused to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as your Popish images haue beene, and are in some places vnto this day, I would rather breake it in peeces by the example of Ezechias, &amp; cast it into the deepe sea, then either I would suffer idolatrie to be committed vnto it, or preserue it to be a snare to them that liued after me to runne a whoring after it. But as for your euill fauoured blockes and stones, which haue none other shape or name but such as the idol of the workemans brayne hath giuen them, and being set vp to be worshipped, I would no more esteeme them, then the myre in the streete, or that

By which rule when we examine this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Maister Sanders booke, swelling with suche a proude title, of the Lawe of nature, we doe plainely perceiue, that it is nothing else but a deceiptful vanitie: with vaine sounde of wordes and friuolous reasons, to goe about to make vs thinke, that God hath written one law in nature, and a cleane contrarie to that, in his worde and holie scriptures.</p>
               <p>The honouring of images in case of religion, beeing expressely forbidden by the lawe of God written, and the same an hundreth times repeated by the Prophetes and Apostles, is the eternall wil of God, and hath nothing
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:14727:326"/>
in nature vncorrupted, which is the ordinaunce of God contrarie vnto it. And therefore I maruell what nature is, in Maister Sanders iudgement, whose lawe he defendeth to be neuer changed, although God hath ruled his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in diuers manners, sometime by inspiration, somtime by outward voice, custome and tradition, sometime by written letter of the Lawe, last of all by writing his own lawe of grace and spirite in their hearts. I passe ouer that he calleth the last, Gods owne lawe, as though the rest were but borrowed, but what is that vnchaungeable law of nature, but Gods eternall lawe: if that be not changed by the lawe written in letters, then surely the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhorreth worshipping of images in religion, which the lawe written forbiddeth. Thus his first exposition o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth all the purpose of his Chapter. Now to the second. He hath two speciall grounds to helpe vs to finde out what the lawe of nature is in any case. The one is the iudgement of right and sound reason, the other is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of all nations. But where shall we finde sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in any natural man? When the light shineth in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the darkenesse comprehendeth it not <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1. and the natural man vnderstandeth not those things that be of the spirite of God. 1. Cor. 2. ver. 14. and where shal we finde the practise of all nations according to the lawe of nature, when they haue all declined and gone astray, there is not one that doth good, no not one. Ro. 3. Psal. 13. Wherefore there are other two most certeine infallible rules, wherby the law of nature in any case may be found out and knowen, namely the word of God, and the spirite of God, whiche giue mutuall testimonie one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the worde and spirite of God beeing contrarie to the worshipping of Images: The Lord saying in the first table of religion, Thou shalt not fall downe to them nor worship them: it is manifest, that worshipping of images, is contrarie to the Lawe of nature. So that you see the foundation of this building already subuerted, by which you may coniecture, how long it is possible for the house to stande after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="637" facs="tcp:14727:326"/>For what soeuer he iangleth of the internall concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde, vnproperly and metaphorically called images, and comparing artificiall images vnto them, it is nothing els, but vain deceiptfulnesse to be contemned and hissed out, not onely of all Christian Churches of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery faithfull man, but also out of all schooles of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by all them that are learned as well in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, as in humaine phylosophie. But that you may see what soundnesse there is in his doctrine, thus he weaueth his copwebbe. One telleth him that Christ died onely to saue man from euerlastinge paines: he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and beleeuing this, straight conceiueth Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, and is mooued to loue him. Secondly he is much delighted with the Image which he conceiued in his minde of Christ dying for him, and loueth that also. Thirdly, he loueth and honoureth him that tolde him this matter, as a bringer of good tydinges. So here bee three kindes of honour, the cheefe to Christe the thinge it selfe, the second to the inward conception or Image of him in his minde, the last is to the reporter.</p>
               <p>And here you haue a paterne of popishe prophane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, for here is no loue nor honour due to the spirite of God, who onely must open his heart, to receiue suche tydings profitably: nor to the worde of God, which must be the warrant of this tydinges to be true: nor to fayth, which applying these tydinges to his owne saluation, is the roote of all vertuous obedience, loue, honour and thankefulnesse in him. But euen as he considereth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prophane report, so doeth he consider of this glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the gospell and not otherwise. But to proceede of this wise distribution of three fold honour, hee infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth seuen causes of honouring artificiall Images. The first is, that it beareth the office of a reporter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needes haue a rewarde of honour. A slowe messenger, &amp; a dumbe reporter, which can neither go of this errande, nor tell his tale. But what skilleth it (saieth Master Sander) whether I learne by hearing or by seeing? For Basill sayeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both eloquent orators and cunninge

Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it skilleth papists, &amp; howsoeuer all other things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; faith may be learned. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reporter of the glad tydings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel, he is in deed worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, if he do his message truly, willingly &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, but it is honor of the second table &amp; not of the first, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to him. And except there be in him loue to God &amp; his neighbor, he is worthy of no honor, althogh he do the message. Therefore if the Image were as a reporter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could haue but honor of the second table, which is of charity &amp; not of religion. But seeing there is in an image neither loue, will, diligence, truth, for which causes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter is loued &amp; cherished, neither is an image cause of anye thinge, there is no loue honour or worshippe due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto it.</p>
               <p>The second cause of honoring artificial images is, for that it doth speedily, and most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently informe our inward imagination, and therefore is more to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any orator. For the eye being the principal sense, is most ready to instruct the minde, and therfore a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted image is a more easie and liuely way to enstruct vs, then any orator. In deed if faith were a register of visible things, as it is of inuisible thinges, Heb. 11. vers. 1.7. the sense of seing, were a more easie, speedy &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient way of instructing, then by hearing, but yet images were no more to be honored, then the sound of words is nowe to be worshipped, when we heare the gospell preached. But God (saith he) hath ioyned visible signes to his worde, as in the proclaiming of the lawe, yea sir, but God shewed not there the image of any thing, to teach them thereby, but expressely forbad the vse of them, in his religion and seruice. But if God gaue visible wordes, as he doeth his sacramentes, it is not therefore lawfull for men to
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:14727:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make images, as visible teachers, which God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. There is therefore hitherto no naturall cause of the honouring of images.</p>
               <p>The thirde cause of honouring of Images, is, because they be naturally knit and ioyned to the trueth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their shape and representation: as the reporter, if he be an Ethnike or Iewe, he is ioyned to Christ in morall honestie and naturall loue of trueth: if he be baptized, much more as a member of Christ: if he be a bishop, &amp;c. as a minister of Gods worde: if he be a Prophete, by a more special grace: if an Apostle, as one nerest to Christ: if it be Christ himselfe, as the chiefe and God himselfe. So Images as they be neerer to Christ, they are more to be honoured, and Christs Image most of all, which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth alwayes (and yet saith neuer a worde) to them that haue spirituall eares of vnderstanding: Nay carnall eyes of blinded and hardened heartes. But this difference he maketh, the former reporters deserue honour, beeing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures, freely and voluntarily reportinge the trueth, but letters and Images deserue no honour, and yet it is due to them, whiche is a straunge matter: a due without desert, yea necessarily due to them in respect of that whose image it beareth. But admitte that the image were a true reporter, as he is nothing but a false &amp; dumb stocke without any action, yet seeinge he compareth an image to the written letters of the gospell, which be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of that trueth which is represented and learned by them, I pray you what honour is due to the written let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Byble, more then to the written letters of any other booke, and yet they are necessary for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine thereof, yea they are true &amp; natural figures of the sense that is contained in the booke, if no man be so madde, as to put of his cap to those letters, or to that booke, or to set it vp to kneele to it, to sense it, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>What monstruous madnesse is it, to defende the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippinge of Images, which if they were graunted to be
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:14727:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lawfull meanes to bring men to spirituall knowledge, yet were they nothing comparable to the written letter and sillables of the scriptures?</p>
               <p>The fourth cause of honouring of Images is, that all nations haue honoured them in respect of their vertue whose Images they are.</p>
               <p>I haue shewed before in a worde, that this prooueth it not to be a lawe of nature, that Images are to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because all nations haue bene ignorant of God, haue committed Idolatrie, haue committed whoredome, &amp;c. And although the art of making of Images be good, yet it prooueth not that all Images may be made, or anye worshipped. The art of making swordes is good, yet it neither proueth that all swordes are well vsed, nor that any is to be worshipped. But Master Sander saith, seeinge that all nations haue made and worshipped Images, it is against the lawe of all nations, and of nature, to forbid the worshippe of them. For he would better like of that lawe, which forbadde Images of Christ to be made, then of that which forbiddeth them to be worshipped, which he calleth a filthie decree, and yet it was a decree of Pope Gregorie the first to the bishoppe of Massilia, as we haue shewed before.</p>
               <p>But concerning the example of all nations, thus I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere briefely, what Images they made out of religion, and how they worshipped them, it toucheth our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie nothing in the worlde. But such as they made and worshipped in religion were abhominable Idoles, and contrarie to the lawe of nature. For Sainte Paule in the first to the Romaines, and in the 17. of the Actes, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Gentiles for making and worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by the lawe of nature.</p>
               <p>But whereas he saith the Iewes worshipped the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Cherubins which Salomon had made to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the walles of the temple, with the figures of palme trees, and other flowers, quoting, 3. Reg. 6. &amp; 2. Par. 3. he is a most impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; shameful liar. For there is no word in those chapters, nor in all the Bible sounding that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="641" facs="tcp:14727:328"/>Neither doth Hieronyme <hi>ad Marcellam</hi> say, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the holy place, but they reuerenced it in respecte of the great mysterie thereof, as they did the temple it selfe. For all reuerent estimation of a thing, is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring or worshipping of it, as Master Sander alwayes dreameth.</p>
               <p>Of the image in Pauende, made (as he sayeth (by the woman, and preserued by Christians vntill the dayes of Iulian, wee haue sayed ynough in the Chapter nexte before this. Hitherto the wicked custome of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contrarie to the worde of God, proueth not the worshipping of images to bee necessarily good by the lawe of nature.</p>
               <p>The fifth cause is, that the relation of honour is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily betweene the image and the thing meant to bee honoured by it, that if the image be not honoured, the thing cannot be honoured thereby. Nay by your leaue Master Sander, the relation of honour is between them that meant to giue honour, and the thing meant to bee honoured, <hi>inter honorantem &amp; honoran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and not between the image and the thing meant to bee honoured by an image, so that if the image be not honoured, his foolish meaning is disapointed, that meant to honour a thing by an image. But admit it were as you say, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience is in the conclusion? If the image be not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, the thing cannot bee honoured by the image. For if the thing be worthie honour, it needeth not the vaine honour of an image. But you saye, it is the lawe of nature and right reason, that if an image be made of an honourable personage, it may also be honoured, that is, honourably regarded and esteemed, according to the vertue of the man more or lesse. As if it be the image of Cato, you thinke his worldly wisedome well worthie of an image, but you wil not think it to be an holie image, as you thinke the image of Christ or his mother to bee, But if you thinke the image of a holie person to bee a holie image, why do you not by the same reason thinke the image of Cato a wise man to be a wise image? and
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:14727:329"/>
the image of Socrates a vertuous man to bee a vertuous image, and the image of Cicero an eloquent man to bee an eloquent image, if the images of these men bee not wise, vertuous, nor eloquent, no more be the images of Christ, his mother, or his Apostles, diuine, holy or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable. And if it be the lawe of nature that the image of an honourable person shoulde be made and honoured as his vertue is more or lesse, then by the contrary, the image of a wicked man shoulde be made and dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as his wickednesse is more or lesse. So that as we must haue a religion of images of good men made and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to stirre vs vnto vertue, so wee must haue a religion of making and dishonouring the images of wicked men to diswade vs from wickednes. If this later be a fond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination: so vndoubtedly is the former.</p>
               <p>The sixt cause is because the name of Christ is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to his image, for it is called Christ, so the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to his name is in the same degree to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his image also. For the name of God is to be blessed, and the name of his sainctes shall liue in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for euer. Yea sir, but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Christ is falsely, wickedly, and blasphemously communicated to a deade image, so is his honour falsely, wickedly and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously communicated to the same.</p>
               <p>And where as hee saith, wee are ashamed to confesse that we breake the images of Christ, he lyeth falsely &amp; impudently. For if we sawe the true images of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Christ abused to idolatrie, wee woulde no more doubt or feare to breake them, then Ezechias did to breake the Brasen serpent, which was a figure of Christe, and commaunded by God himselfe to be made. But as for their ridiculous images, which are no more the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Christ, then of Iudas Iscarioth, but that it please<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h them to call them so, wee may iustly denye them to bee the images of Christ, which haue no proper resemblance vnto his bodie, more then to any other man.</p>
               <p>The last reason is, that if it be a contumelye to the Prince to haue his image broken, and an honour to haue
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:14727:329"/>
it regarded, the like must needes come to passe in Christ. And here M. Iewell is bidden to breake if he dare the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Queenes maiestie, or the armes of the realm, or any noble mans banner. But if the prince had as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely forbidden any image of her to be made, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the same to bee broken if it were made, as Christ hath forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> images to be made &amp; honoured in any religious worship, and commaunded such as were so made and worshipped to be broken, Maister Iewell durst execute his princes commandement. And maister Sander sheweth himselfe a wise man to compare a thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, with a thing forbidden, a thing of one nature that is ciuil, with a thing of an other nature that is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And these be the seuen wise reasons of one man, not so wise as the seuen wise men of Greece. But yet to knitte vp the matter, we must haue a comparison of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Catholikes with maister Iewels doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning images.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Christ is as worthy to haue an image as any noble man.</p>
               <p>To this maister Iewell must aunswere, this is no good faith, therefore this is his doctrine, Christ is lesse hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then Iulius Caesar. A wittie conclusion, Christe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth a vaine heathenish honour &amp; forbidden by God, therefore hee is lesse honourable then Iulius Caesar: Nay maister Sander the honour of Christe and Iulius Cęsar are not meete to bee matched together, the one the sonne of GOD, the other a dampned spirite.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Christes image, is set vp in the Church that wee might remember him, loue him, and followe him. This ende being good maketh the acte of setting vp the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage good. Maister Iewell must say it is not well done to set vp such remembrance and to honour it. And so I warrant you he sayeth because God hath forbidden it, for if your reason be good, the good ende maketh the acte to be good, the acte of them that killed the Apostles was good, because they thought to do God good seruice

               </argument>
               <p>Pope Adrian writing to the Emperour concerning the second Nicen Councel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulk. Con. Nic.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> alledgeth for the making and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring of images, that saying of Genesis: God made man according to his owne image and similitude: which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth to consist in free wil, and in calling all creatures by their proper names. M. Iewel not vnderstanding how these places of scripture cited in that Councel, ought to be applied to making and honouring of images, mocketh at all those Fathers learning &amp;c. And so he might right well, being a companie of vnlearned asses and flattering parasites, who to currie fauour with that idolatrous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Irene, abused the scriptures most shamefully and absurdly, to the maintenance of the making and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images. But Maister Sander hath chosen a fewe of those places, thinking to wring out some fore matter of them, leauing out the rest (which hee was ashamed to name) for breuities sake. And first he bringeth in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Damascene, a worshipfull Doctour, aboue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hundreth yeares past, which bringeth many of the same places for the same purpose, making a comparison betweene him and Maister Iewell, and both their books. Well, let the iudgement be among learned men. But Damascene. <hi>De Ortho. fid. cap.</hi> 17. frameth an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus. GOD made man to his owne image. For whose cause therefore doe wee worship one an other, but bicause we are made after the image of GOD? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Basil, which faith, The honour of the image is transferred into the honour of the paterne.</p>
               <p>Cyrillus likewise reasoneth <hi>in Cat.</hi> 12. The woodden image of an earthly King is honoured, howe much more the reasonable image of GOD. But these reasons, that serue for the honouring and reuerencing of man, which is Gods true image, for Gods sake serue nothing in the
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:14727:331"/>
worlde for honouring of false images artificiall, which containe nothing in them of that which is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped or honoured in the patterne. And therefore Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iewel may well mocke such a bald reason, as hath no good consequence in it. Man being the true image of God, made by God him selfe, and hauing in him a true similitude of those things which are honourable in God, as wisdome, holinesse, righteousnesse, &amp;c. is to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Gods sake: therefore a stocke which is a false or counterfet image of Christe made by a cursed man, and hath no true resemblance in it of those things that are honourable in Christ, is to be honored for Christes sake. For what wit, sense, or shame hath he, that maketh such an argument? But (saith he) we must marke the proportion betwene the image and the thing whereof it is an image, to see the weight of this reason. But what proportion is there betweene truth and falshood? euen such there is betwene man the image of God, and a blocke the image of man. But it beareth mans shape, &amp; also his name (saith he) but it beareth it falsely say I. For mans shape is not a dead or insensible shape, no more then a dead carcase is a man, and much lesse it deserueth the name of a man. Yet continuing this proportion, hee saith: Among all men, none is so truely honourable, as those who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the end of their life according to that image of GOD wherevnto they were first made, such are all the Saintes. Setting the question of images aside, see howe he honoureth the Saintes with the dishonour of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Christ, which was needlesse to them, if they continued in the image of God, in which they were first made. The Apostle witnesseth, that by Christe we are restored vnto the image of God, from whom by sinne we are fallen <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. For to say, that any man hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued according to the image of God to his liues end, is to say that he neuer sinned.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he saith, their images are made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of Gods church. A wholsome faith, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to Gods word, yea, he concludeth there is no doubt, but by the
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:14727:331"/>
force of Gods word we are bound to honour Saints ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, bicause thei are made according to the shape of them in that behalfe as they were most like vnto God. First, where is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worde of God (M. San) by whose force we are bound? You seeme to be an anthropomorphite, when you say that Saintes images are made according to the shape of them in that behalfe, as they were most like vnto God. For the images of Saints, when they are best made, are made but according to the shape of their bodies. And were the Saints most like to God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shape of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? O brutish heretique! But let vs see an other conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Popish proportion. Our Ladies image appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth neerer to hir in nature, then she doth approch to God, therefore her image must be more honored for her sake, then she her selfe for Gods sake. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition we must learne, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man which made our Ladies image is able to make a truer image the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, who made our Ladie to his image. For to compare the substances of the images, is nothing to the purpose, to shew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the images, as you your selfe (M. San.) in your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicall abstractions haue taught vs. For an image of stone being like to a man, is a better image then one of golde being not like to him. I say a better image, &amp; not a better matter. And will you now compare the matter of our Ladies image (for so you cal her) as liker in nature to her substance, then her substance is to God, to proue her image in it more to be honoured, then the image of God in her? Truly if you be so insensible, that you see not that grosnesse of this falshod, I am ashamed in respect of that Vniuersitie which gaue you the title of a Doctour, not worthie with these arguments to step out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> schooles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sophisters. Last of al you reason thus, the image of God in vs may be dimned &amp; darkned, insomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men haue ben worshipped, as Gods, but our Ladies artificial image being onely knowne or called by the name of her shape and image, can neuer be principally worshipped as our Lady her selfe. You play the sophister too foolishly, for no more can a man so long as hee is knowne and

called by the name of the image &amp; similitude of God, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> principally worshipped as God him selfe. But that name forgotten, man hath bene worshipped as God, so hath the image of our Ladie bearing the name of our Ladie, bene worshipped, as her selfe, or rather as GOd him selfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the insensiblenesse of images, defended them from daunger of being worshipped as God.</p>
               <p>An other testimonie of scripture y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pope Adrian citeth, is Gen. 28. of the stone which Iacob set vp right, for a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or standing image (saith M. San.) and powred oyle vpon it, and called the name of the place Bethel, that is, the house of God. Therefore we may set vp images, and honour them: a substantial reason. For make as mysticall interpretations as you can, of the stone to signifie Christe, &amp; the oyle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirituall vnction of the holy Ghost: yet was it no image, but a signe or monument erected in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the vision, by a speciall instinct of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which when the Israelites would drawe into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of wilworship, erecting a temple there, and setting vp an image thereon, the place was called of the Prophetes Bethauen, that is, the house of vanitie, and not Bethel, the house of God. O see the 4.5. &amp;. 10. Chapter.</p>
               <p>And whereas Augustine noteth, that although he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the stone,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest. in Her.</hi> 8.</note> Gods house, yet hee worshipped not the stone, neither sacrificed to the stone, nor called it God: You thinke to escape by aunswering, that no more doe you adore images of stone with godly honour, or with any honour for the stones sake. But Augustine denyeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he resorted afterward to it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he adored the stone with any honor at al, or in any respect, or that he did any thing like to idolatrie, but you adore the image of Christ &amp; cal it Christe, and goe a pilgrimage to it, therefore Iacobs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample can not shrowd you from idolatrie. For although the annoynting of the stone were a consecration of it to be a holy monument by a speciall direction of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, yet it followeth not, that it was any adoration of the stone, or that euery man may set vp, and annoynt stones after that manner, which hath no such warrant
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:14727:332"/>
of Gods worde or his spirite. And that God chose one place aboue another for his honour, it proueth not, that men may choose one stocke aboue another to make an idoll thereof or an image to worship, as you had rather call it.</p>
               <p>The thirde text of scripture is, that Iacob adored the toppe of Iosephs rodde, or scepter: Heb. 11. Which Sedulius saith did mystically betoken the kingdome of Christ, to be honoured in the end of the worlde, as he adored the rodde or scepter of his sonne. Yet is there here no image honoured. Nay here is not the toppe of Iosephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> scepter honoured out of the scripture. For the Hebrue text is, He worshipped toward the bedshead. Gene. 47. vers. 31. And the Greeke text. Heb. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and he worshipped toward the end of his staffe, or leaning vppon the end of his staffe, So that neither in the Hebrue, nor Greeke, there is any worshipping of the staffe or scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ioseph.</p>

O blinde beast, or rather blocke that seest no reason, why that faith which was neuer heard out of Gods worde, should not saue a man. But the heretikes you say tye all thinges to his person, and nothing to his other instrumentes. The word of God teacheth vs to tie al things to Christ, and to acknowledge none other instrumentes, then he hath prouided and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for vs. For images be the instruments of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, and not of Christe to worke by.</p>

Also the materiall word of Christes crosse is holy, as a signe and as a relique. A miracle wrought by the woode of Christes crosse. The bishop of Ierusalem brought forth the crosse to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euerye Easter. The Emperours Theodosius and Valentinian made a lawe in the honour of the crosse. By M. Iewels confession the signe of the crosse was had in great regarde among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. S.

                  </note> he meaneth either the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall crosse whereon Christ suffred, or els the signe and image thereof. The material crosse, he saith is not onely holy, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> died on it, but also as sanctified with the blood of Christ. As though the blood of Christ was a sanctification vnto an vnsensible blocke of wood. It was the aulter whereon the sacrifice of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was offred. Although it be sometimes so called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, because it seemed so in the eyes of men, yet our Sauiour Christ himselfe, was both the priest and the sacrifice, the temple &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar of our redemption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Augustine saith, <hi>De fide ad Petrum Dia. ca.</hi> 2. <hi>Iste igitur est, qui in se vno totum exhibuit quod esse necessarium ad redemptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:14727:335"/>
nostrae sciebat effectum, idem scilicet sacerdos &amp;. sacrificium, idem Deus &amp; templum.</hi> This is he that in himselfe onely exhibited all whatsoeuer he knewe to be necessarie for the effecte of our redemption, the same being both the prieste and the sacrifice, the same beeinge God and his temple. But a temple he could not be, except an altar were within him, and not without him. Christ is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy altar, and not the cursed crosse. But he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that it is an holy relique and not onely an Image, If there were so great holinesse in that materiall crosse, it is maruaile none of the Apostles made any acounte of it, nor any of the faithfull, not Ioseph and Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, which with muche lesse suite might haue obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it of Pilate, then the body of Iesus. Nor the church by the space of three hundreth yeares, vntill the time that Helena is saide to haue founde it with the two crosses of the two theeues: whiche I take to bee but a fable and an imposture of some that after Helena was dead, forged a crosse &amp; nailes, affirminge that they were founde by Helena.</p>
               <p>For it soundeth like no trueth, that Eusebius whiche knewe the same Helena the mother of Constantine the great, and writeth of her deuotion and of her doinges in the holy lande, woulde haue omitted suche a noble inuention of the crosse, with so manie miracles about the same, eyther in his storie, or in the life of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
               <p>I knowe there is a shorte note of it in his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but that seemeth to be added by some other since his time, whiche he would not haue omitted to declare at large in his storie, where hee setteth out in many words, matter of muche lesse importaunce then that supposed inuention was. Againe they that in latter times write of it, as Ambrose, Ruffinus, Socrates, Theodoretus, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenus seeme to haue receyued that matter onely of reporte and of no written monument, for scarce one of them agreeth with another. For to omitte how incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that the Iewes woulde haue buried that crosse
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:14727:335"/>
to keepe it from the Christians; whiche they more safely might haue burned. Wherefore should they burie with it the two other crosses of the theeues? And admitte there were suche holinesse in Christes crosse, that it coulde not corrupt, yet howe were not the other two crosses rotten in three hundreth yeares lyinge in the earth?</p>
               <p>But admitting that storie to be true (as I promise you, it is no article of my beliefe) what meaneth M. Sander to saye the materiall crosse is not onely an Image, by which he meaneth that it is an Image? whereof I praye you shoulde it bee an Image? Will you nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde the thinge with the image thereof, as you doe offer the Image with the thing? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f that materiall crosse were an image, then the images thereof be images of an Image, which is nothinge of it selfe, and then by your owne rule they be Idoles. But you saye it was an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our redemption and therefore holy. If that be a good reason, Pilate, Annas, Cayphas, Iudas, the souldiers which crucified Christ, were holy, for they were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our redemption. But Ambrose, <hi>De obitu Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> calleth it the standerde of saluation, the worde of trueth, yea life it selfe.</p>
               <p>I praye you giue Ambrose in his eloquente oration leaue to vse rethoricall figures of amplification, and let him expounde him selfe in the same. <q>
                     <hi>Habeat Helena quae legat, vnde crucem domini recognoscat; inuenit ergo titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, regem adorauit non lignum vtique, quia hic gentilis est er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror &amp; vanitas impiorum, sed adorauit illum qui pependit in lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>o.</hi> Let Helena haue somewhat that shee may reade, whereby she may know the lordes crosse. Therefore she founde the title, shee worshipped the kinge, not the wood verilye, for this is an heathnishe errour, and a vanitie of vngodly men, but shee worshipped him that hath hanged on the wood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Ambrose although he credited this inuention, yet he affirmeth it is an heathnishe errour, and a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of wicked menne to woorshippe the tree that
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:14727:336"/>
Christ dyed on, much more the signe or Image thereof, seeing al worshippe belongeth to God. <q>But Master San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der replyeth, that he saieth, <hi>Non insolentia ista sed pietas est, cum defertur sacrae redemptioni</hi>: this is no insolencie but godlinesse, when honour is giuen to the holy redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> Speakinge of honour due to the woode in respect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that it belongeth to Christ. But Ambrose speaketh not one worde of honour due to the wood of the crosse, but defendeth the estimation of the crosse of Christ, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our redemption. For speaking of the nayle which Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na caused to bee forged into the diademe of her sonne the Emperour, he saith: <hi>Sapienter Helenę egis quae crucem in capite regum leuauit, &amp; locauit, vt crux Christi in regibus adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Non insolentia ista, &amp;c.</hi> Helena did wisely, that lifted vp the crosse in the heade of kinges and so placed it, that the crosse of Christ might be worshipped in the kinges. This is no insolencie, &amp;c. as aboue. So that he speaketh not of the woode of the crosse, but of the iron of the nayle.</p>
               <p>Beside we see a great difference betweene the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent offering of a thing, and the honouring or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereof, which yet Master Sander euery where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth. <q>But Ambrose speaketh further in the person of the Iewes. <hi>Ecce &amp; clauus in honore est.</hi> Beholde euen the nayle is in estimation, and that which we knocked in to death, is a remedy of health, and with a certaine inuisible power tormenteth the deuils: Kinges are bowed to the iron of his feete.</q> Here saith Master Sander, we haue the adoration of iron. Is this like that Ambrose, who before condemned the adoration of the wood for an heathnish error, doeth now commende the bowinge to iron? why Master Sander, doe you not confesse, that the Iewes spake this and not Ambrose, or Ambrose spake this in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Iewes? And who knoweth not in such fictions of persons speaking, the Orator must frame his talke as they, whome he supposeth to speake are like to say. The Iewes then in sport do say, kings bow down to a piece of iron: meaning to the Emperour, in whose creste this iron
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:14727:336"/>
nayle was, is it then the iudgement of Ambrose to allow the bowing to yron in any respect? O vaine &amp; friuolous argumentes of the Papistes, that must borrowe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the complaint of the perfidious Iewes. But you may knowe what honour was done to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yron, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one nayle was placed in an honourable place, namely in the Emperours Diademe, so an other was placed in his horse mouth, for so saith Ambrose <hi>De vno clauo frenos fieri prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis:</hi> she commaunded his bridle to be made of one nayle. This was no great honouring of that holy yron, to put it to bee champed and slaboured in an horse mouth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Ambrose make a misterie of it. And the thirde nayle other writers say, was cast into the Sea to staye a tempest. All three being thus bestowed by auncient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists haue fourteene more in diuers places of Fraunce, Italy &amp; Germany, beside y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fifteenth that was shewed at Paules crosse by maister Iewell since the Queenes reigne.</p>
               <p>But Ruffinus calleth it blessed. And Cyrillus health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and precious, because it leadeth vs to the memory of Christs death. So woulde an image of Iudas Iscarioth doe. It was the best reason those auncient writers had to defende that supersticious estimation, which they had of the signe of the crosse.</p>
               <p>As for the report of Paulinus, that the same crosse had a Church and a secreate place made at Ierusalem where it might be honourably reserued, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop brought forth at Easter to be worshipped of the people, if it be true, yet proueth it not the worshiping of images, for the crosse was no image.</p>
               <p>But that it is not like that any church was erected to the Crosse, Saint Augustine sheweth, that it was counted sacriledge in his time to make a Church vnto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <q>

Sander will say the crosse was no creature, wee must say with Augustine, it ought to haue no temple. What superstition and Idolatrie hath done, is not the question, but what should be done and what is wel done, is all the controuersie.</p>
               <p>The feastes of the inuention of the crosse which hee maketh of 1200. yeares olde, and the exaltation of nine hundreth, (beside that the antiquitie of the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is not proued,) yet argue not any worshippe of the crosse, more then the feastes of the Apostles and martirs. which were kept onely in remembrance of them, and not to adore or worship them.</p>
               <p>That maister Iewell graunteth the signe of the crosse to haue beene had in great regard among the Christians, what helpeth it your cause, seeing hee alloweth not the superstitious abuse thereof?

But I pray you let vs see how sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancially

M. Sander proueth the signe of the crosse to haue ben in estimation with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole primitiue church.</p>
               <p>His first authour is Tertulian, almost 200. yeares from Christ. And from him he desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to Cyprian, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill, Augustine, Chrisostome, &amp;c. Tertulian sheweth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sining of mens foreheades therewith, whethersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they went. The later age brought in that signe into baptisme, confirmation, the Lords supper, and almost in to euery ceremony. So superstition crepeth like a ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme, at the first as a tollerable indifferent matter, then as a holye thing, nexte as a necessarie thing, and last of all into open and grosse Idolatrie, as in the times following those six hundreth years.</p>
               <p>But before all those whom M. Sander nameth, Irenaeus <hi>lib.</hi> 1. testifieth that the Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiniane heretiks brought the signe of the crosse in great estimation, calling it <hi>Oron confirmatiuam crucem</hi> the limit and terme of all things, &amp; the confirming crosse, abusing euen the same testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of scripture for the proofe thereof, which the Papists doe, and namely maister Sander in this Chapter. <q>

GOD forbid that I should boast in any thing, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse of Christ.

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:14727:338"/>And if this lawe were to be vnderstood as M. San. would haue it, yet here is no worshipping of the crosse spoken of. But touching the vnderstanding of this lawe, M. Iewel is reproued, first in citing it out of Petrus Crinitus, who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out these wordes, <hi>humi positis,</hi> lying on the ground, which Iustinians Code addeth, then in false translation, wherof he wil speake afterward. But concerning the first, for as much as Petrus Crinitus was a learned man, about that time when bookes beganne to be printed, before this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie of images was moued, his report is more to bee credited then the Printers presse, for the auncient reading of this lawe, how so euer M. Sander fondly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth him with Iustinian corrupted. Moreouer, to proue this corruption probable, those wordes <hi>humi positis,</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together superfluous, for when he had saide before <hi>in solo</hi> on the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what neede he add afterward lying on the ground? Also the disiunctiue, <hi>vel,</hi> or, set before these words <hi>in solo,</hi> (which M. Sander hath cleane left out in his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation) doth sufficiently declare, that the Emperours mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, to prohibite all grauing and painting of the signe of Christe, whether it were of the crosse or of the image of Christ, either on the ground, or else where, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is against the religion of the high God, to make any images or signes of him to any purpose. As for the daunger of treading vpon the signe of the crosse, is not in any one word of this lawe touched. Neither was it a thing regarded in the deepest dungeon of Poperie, for crosses &amp; images of Christ and of the Trinitie, are yet to be seene of their making, vpon a great number of graue stones in England to this day, which argue, that either the Papistes did against this lawe, or else that this lawe had no such meaning as M. Sander feigneth it to haue.</p>
               <p>But M. Iewell confesseth, that the signe of the crosse was had in great regard among the Christians, for that most worthie price that was offered vpon it: and yet hee confesseth not, that either they worshipped the signe of the crosse, or that their regard was no greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ought to haue bene. For if any such regard had bene due to the
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:14727:339"/>
signe of the crosse by Gods ordinaunce, the Apostles that deliuered to vs all the counsell of God, would not haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited it in their writings. <hi>Eph.</hi> 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27. And M. Sander him selfe, after he hath iangled a while confusely, of regarding and worshipping, at length confesseth, that euery regard is not commonly taken for a worshipping, but some is, as the couetous mans regarding of money. So that his argument and his conclusion is nothing else, but a sophisticall conuersion of particulars, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toucheth the matter in controuersie: Some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping is a regarding, therefore some regarding is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping. Both these are true, and yet the regarding of the signe of the crosse, is not thereby proued a worshipping thereof. And yet he is not ashamed to proceede, as though he had proued all regarding to be worshipping. For hee saith, If M. Iewell had a piece of that crosse that Christe dyed on, he would preferre it before golde and siluer &amp;c. and this regard should be a worshipping or honouring of it. I beleeue if M. Iewell had a piece that had bene wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, hee would haue burned it, and so would I. And yet if I had but a pibble stone, that came out of the land of promise, I would keepe it, and make much of it, so would I doe of the crosse, if it were free from idolatrie, but I would worshippe the one, no more then the other. How long will this sophisticall Doctour walke vnder a cloud of ambiguitie of words? Let him either proue such honoring &amp; worshipping as the Papistes vse vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse or signe therof (which is the thing we impugne) to haue bene vsed in the eldest Primitiue Church, or else let him striue about termes and words among sophisters &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But if M. Iewel should take the crosse for no better then a common piece of wood, hee should (saith hee) be blasphemous against the death of Christ. O grieuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation. Ezechias tooke the brasen Serpent for no better then a piece of brasse, which was a figure of Christe, and yet he was not blasphemous against the death of Christe. But heare his reason, Christe vouchsafed to segregate it from other wood, to make it the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his passion.
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:14727:339" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Where find you that Christ did choose his crosse? I thinke it was rather appointed to him by the Iews, then prouided by him selfe: if you say, he did segregate it in his secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, I answere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so he did segregate Iudas, Annas, Caiphas, Pilate, the Iewes and souldiers, to be instruments of his passion. And yet none of them therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded or worshipped, except of those detestable heretikes that thinke they were profitable instruments of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But O holy swords &amp; axes of tyrants, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentours, that were embrued with the bloud of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, O holy fire that burned them, O holy water that drowned them, O holy gallowes and ropes that hanged them! For why should not these also haue their regard and worship according to the proportion of their deserts, whose eternal felicity they were instruments to procure?</p>
               <p>Yet once againe M. Iewell is challenged, for denying the cognisances of the crosse, in flags, banners, or targets, to be images. Also the letter that Ezechiel sawe in vision, the crosse that Constantine sawe in the ayre, the marks in mens garments, and the mysticall letters in the temple of Serapis. First touching the mark which Ezechiel saw, it is not described of what figure it was, onely that a marke was set, for <hi>Tau,</hi> signifieth a marke, and not onely the name of a letter, which in that time perhaps it had not, &amp; so did S. Cyprian read it, <hi>Contra Demetrianum, transi mediam Ierusalem &amp; notabis signum super frontes virorum.</hi> Go through the middest of Hierusalem, and thou shalt marke a signe vpon the foreheads of the men. The signe that Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine sawe, was the character of the name of Christ, in two letters X &amp; P after this maner, as both Euseb. witnesseth, and his coynes yet remaining do shew. ☧ <hi>Eu. de vit. Con. lib.</hi> 1. and therefore no crosse nor signe therof. The marks that haue appeared in mens garments, perhaps were ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> images, as children imagine dragons, &amp; Gryphons in the clouds. The mystical letters in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple of the idol Serapis, could haue no relation to the crosse of Christ, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idolaters knew not. Therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> follie of those ecclesiastical writers is bewraied, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoght christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:14727:340"/>
much helped by such heathenish &amp; superstitious fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies: as for the rest, I answere as M. Iewell, that they are but barres laide one ouer an other, and no images. Yet M. San. maruelleth what blind ignoraunce this is, so to say. But to make the matter more plaine on his side, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the shape of Christe hanging with his armes abroad, all one with these signes or characters aforesaid, which is no blinde ignorance, but wilfull abusing of his readers, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all shame or shape of honestie. And yet, he will baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vs with a doutie definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an image (as he saith out of Gregorie Nazianzen) that euery similitude, likenesse, or shape of one thing taken out according to the samplar of an other thing, is an image, &amp; then he runneth out into his old co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place of inward imaginations. But I pray you syr, who euer in those days or in ours, sawe the crosse that Christ dyed on, to make an image thereof according to the samplar? If none, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> painter or grauer hath ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it, then is it an image of an imagination, which is the samplar thereof, and not of the crosse of Christ, and so it is counterfet, and consequently by your own distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an idoll. And in very deed, so many diuers figures and formes therof as we see to be made, argue that there is no certaine truth knowne vnto men, of what forme or figure it was: for some make it headlesse, thus <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> some draw one barre through the other thus <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> some drawe this barre at the vpper end, some through the middest, some make cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, some squares, some triangles at the foure endes, some make them blunt, some make them sharp, &amp;c. some make the crosse ragged, some euen, so that there is no certentie, and if al these be images of Christes crosse, it skilleth not what proportion be kept in making of images according to the paterne. Hitherto therfore M. San. fond argument to proue worshipping of images by M. Iewels confession, hath no force to enter into any reasonable mans credite, bicause hee hath neither proued these signes of the crosse to be images, nor such regard as M. Iewel confesseth, to haue bene a worshipping of them, in that sense that the controuersie is betweene vs for worshipping of images.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="665" facs="tcp:14727:340"/>But whearas maister Iewell saith, the same crosses were not set vp in any Temple, maister Sander confesseth not the same, but other such as they were, for proofe wherof he citeth a new found old Doctor called Euodius Bishop of Vzal in Affrike, writing about S. August. time, a book of the miracles of S. Stephen, in which he saith, S. Stephens image was painted with a crosse on his shoulder &amp;c: this old Doctor was firste painted at Louan anno, 1564. but he cometh too late, to claime his antiquitie after so many hundred yeares, in which neither he nor his writing was euer harde off.</p>
               <p>That the people were taught to kneele down to cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which Maister Iewel denieth, he proueth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Probianus,<note place="margin">

But he wolde not adore the cause of all our health, that is, the moste holy crosse. Hee beeing of this minde, the diuine power apeared to him, and shewed him the signe of the crosse set on the aulter of that church. And did manifestly declare that since Christ was crucified, all thinges that were done for the vtilitie of mankinde, had not been done by any meanes without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue of the reuerend crosse, neither of holy Angels nor of godly men.</p>
               <p>Here saith maister Sander, it is euident, that the signe of the crosse was set vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alter of S. Michaels church in Constantinople. Yea sir in that vision if it were true. But it is small euidence to proue that it stoode in the churche in deede. For if it had stoode on the alter in such honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estimation, Probianus wolde not haue contemned it before. But where you say, he was compted no perfect Christian, because he wolde not adore the holy crosse of Christ: you walke still vnder your cloude of ambiguitie. For how proue you that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adoration here spoken of, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kneeling to the crosse, which the Bishop denieth to haue been taught? it seemeth that Probianus newly conuerted from paganisme, had not yet that honorable estimation
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:14727:341" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the reprochefull signe of the crosse, which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of that time had. But whereas M. Iewell vpbraideth them with that blasphemous prayer, which they make to the crosse, kneeling on their knees, <hi>O crux aue, spes vnica,</hi> Alhaile O crosse, our onely hope, M. Sander saith, those wordes doe so conuince his blasphemous doctrine, that he shall neuer be able to auoide the argument, whiche is grounded vpon them. You haue need M. Sa. to set a good face on those wordes, euen of the same metall that your crosse to whom you speak is oftentimes made. But what Herculian argument I pray you do you bring forth? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth S. Paul vsed the same phrase, when he said, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I should glorie but only in the crosse of Christe. But good sir, S. Paul speaketh neither to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wodden crosse, nor of the signe thereof, but of the death of Christ. And you would make men beleeue, that you do so. Namely, that you say not those wordes to the crosse, but to Christ crucified. Thus you would couer your shame with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie. But you cannot so escape: for Thomas Aquinas a great Saint and Doctour of your Church. 3. <hi>Sen. di.</hi> 9.91. ar. 2 <hi>q.</hi> 4. affirmeth that the crosse of Christ is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>He that worketh or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenceth (M.

First I note the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Master Sanders translation, that turneth <hi>Veneratur</hi> worshippeth, after the popishe meaninge.</q> For God did neuer institute any signe to be worshipped, in that sense which Master Sander de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth worshippinge of Images. But all signes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of God are to be reuerently esteemed &amp; regarded, as baptisme, which we do reuerently esteeme, &amp; yet we worship not either the water, or the action of baptizing.</p>
               <p>Secondly we haue to consider, how Master Sander can proue images to be profitable signes instituted by gods authoritie. They be profitable (saith hee) because they bring vs in remembraunce of good thinges. I denie this argument, because nothing is profitable in religion but that which is instituted by God, for otherwise we might bring the gallowes into the Church, whiche bringeth vs in remembraunce of Gods Iustice, &amp;c. as I haue shewed before. Likewise the Prophet Abacuc vtterly denyeth I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to be profitable: <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. But let vs see how he proueth popishe images to be instituted by Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:14727:343"/>
which is al in al, for if that be proued we wil not doubt of the profitablenesse of them. First he alledgeth the imitation of nature, and of nations, the institution of some images in the law of Moses, last of all, the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left to his Church freely to make images of good things.</p>
               <p>The former reasons are answered before in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chapters, namely the lawe of nature and nations, cap. 11. the making of some images in Moyses lawe, cap 12. also the example of practise of this supposed tradition out of Eusebius cap. 10. And they are all three wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the expresse commaundement of God in his lawe of religion: Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, or the likenesse of any thing, &amp;c. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse let vs see how by tradition left to the Churche, images are prooued to be instituted by God. We reade (saith hee) in S. Augustine as well of the Ethnikes, as of the Christians. There is first one falshood, for Augustine in the place by him cited speaketh onely of Ethnikes. <hi>De consen. Euang. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. which because they had seene Christes image pictured with Peter and Paule, imagined that Christ had written bookes to Peter and Paule. <q>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he citeth the wordes thus. <hi>Pluribus locis simul Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum et Paulum cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christo pictos viderunt, quiae merita Petri &amp; Pauli etiam propter cundem passionis diem celebrius ac solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Roma commendat.</hi> They sawe in verie many places Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; Paule painted together with Christ, because Rome doeth set foorth the merites of Peter and Paule the more famously and solemnly, euen for that they suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both vppon one day.</q> In this allegation, hee addeth wordes that are not in Augustine. Although not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his meaning, yet shewing thereby that he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed this place, as manye of our Englishe papistes doe commonly, of some other mans noting, rather then of his owne reading. But the greatest fault of all is, that he doth deceiptfully suppresse the words following im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, which declare howe profitable Sainte Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine esteemed the doctrine of Images to be. His whole
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:14727:343"/>
sentence is this: <q>
                     <hi>Credo quod pluribus locis simul eos cum illo pictos viderunt, quia merita Petri &amp; Pauli etiam propter cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem passionis diem celebrius &amp; solemniter Roma commendat. Sic omnino errare meruerunt, qui Christum &amp; Apostolos eius, non in sanctis codicibus sed in pictis parietibus quaesierunt.</hi> I beleeue that they haue seene them painted with him in manye places, because Rome doeth more notably and solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth the worthinesse of Peter and Paule, euen because of the same day of their suffering. So they were altogether worthy to be deceiued, whiche haue sought Christ and his Apostles not in the holy bookes, but in painted walles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now see with what honestie, Master Sander hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this place of Augustine to prooue that images are of Gods institution. But you will saye perhappes, this place doeth prooue, that Images of Christe and his Apostles were then made by Christians, I graunte, but not in the Churches, for then the Ethnikes coulde not haue seene them, because they were neuer suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter into the Churches of the Christians.</p>
               <p>But Gregorie Nyssen in his Oration <hi>De Theod. martyr. laud.</hi> testyfieth, that the paynter had set foorth the whole storie of Theodorus the martyr in his Churche. And yet the Image of the martyr was none otherwise pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then the fierce and cruell formes of the tyrauntes, neyther otherwise on the walles, then on the pauemente. For he saith, <hi>Capillorum item concinnator, historiae par opu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Also the pauier hath made the lyke woorke of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie vppon the pauemente, whiche is trodden vnder feete.</p>
               <p>These deuises of painters and pauiers Master Sander is faine to take holde of, in steede of the holy scriptures and aunciente writers. But if hee saye that Gregorius doeth also allowe these, I answere as ornamentes of the Churche, not as matter of Gods religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, whiche yet he shoulde rather haue defaced with

               <p>This report of Gregorie sheweth the errour of that time, rather then prooueth images to be instituted by God. That Paulinus caused images to bee painted on the Church walles, as it is confessed to be done, so it is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be well done. The like I say of the images painted in Saint Martins Church in Towers in Fraunce, witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Gregorius Turonensis,</hi> although it was long after the time of Paulinus, in which Satan beganne to lay the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme for his Idolatrie, whiche afterwarde he brought into the worlde. And these be all the arguments, that he hath to prooue that images are profitable signes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods authoritie. Except he meane the text of Paul to the Galat. 5. to be an argument, whiche he citeth to prooue that we are made free in Christ, both to knowe our signes and images to be images and signes, and also to knowe whereof they are signes, which the Iewes (saith he) did not. So that the libertie of Christ is by M. Sanders doctrine, not from a yoke of bondage and seruitude vnto ceremonies, but from ignorance and want of know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of the vse of them. And whereas by the lawe we are vtterly discharged of Images, this mans freedome is to binde vs to the seruice of Images. O blasphemous &amp; absurde doctrine! Againe, howe falsely doeth he affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the godly Iewes knewe not whereunto their signes were referred, as though Messias was not preached to them by those signes. Likewise as vntruely he saith, that the signes of the Gentiles ended in the onely honour of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not of God, when they did neuer honour any creature, but their finall ende was thereby to honour God, and not a creature.</p>
               <p>Againe, what beastly doctrine is this, that he affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes are not vtterly abolished, but changed into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacraments directly instituted by Christ, but also into signes made with faithfull mens handes, as Altars, vestments, Chalices, lightes and images, whereby he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Christian liberty but a chaunge from one bondage
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:14727:344"/>
into an other, and yet worse then that of the Iewes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were subiect to the yoke of God, wee must be vnder the yoke of mens institutions and traditions.</p>
               <p>But hee procedeth and will proue that images may be profitably and freely worshipped, and that in practise it was so done within the first sixe hundreth yeares, by the testimony of Chrisostome, Paulinus, and Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Chrisostome is alledged in his Liturgie, where it is said that the priest turning to the image of Christ, betweene the two doores, bowing his heade, saith a prayer.</p>
               <p>But because this liturgie is proued to be false, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet by maister Iewell, for that therein is conteined a prayer for Pope Nicholas which lyued not 500. yeares after Chrisostome, and for the Emperour Alexius which liued neere 700. yeares after Chrisostome, maister San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taketh vppon him the defense of it to bee written by Chrisostome, which was written seuen hundreth yeares after his death. His first reason is, that it beareth his name, which is a good reason to proue all forgeries to bee true writings. Secondly other Grecians which haue written since that time, do make mention of it, as Proclus, Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selas Methenencis, and M. Ephesius. But of these, some onely make mention that Chrisostome did write a liturgie, they doe not iustifie that this which is nowe seene is that, the other being of late dayes, are not to bee credited. Thirdly he saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Greeke church doth allow it for Chrisostomes, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> latine doth those Psalmes <hi>Quicun<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> vult</hi> to be written by Athanasius, and <hi>Te deum</hi> by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose and Augustine. And yet the best learned in these dayes, cannot be perswaded of those authors although the Psalmes be good and Godly. Fourthly hee woulde faine disproue M. Iewells reason, touching those prayers for Pope Nicolas and the Emperour Alexius, saying that in all publike seruice &amp; formes of prayers there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon places, which must be left voide for names according to the times and persons.</p>
               <p>But these places are not left voide, but filled with the
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:14727:345"/>
names of the princes and prelats of that time, in which it was first written, as the publike seruice in king Henries dayes, in king Edwardes time, yea prayers made in Queene Maries time, and in Queene Elizabeths time, do proue and shewe in what time they were first made. But in some copyes (saith he) the places are left voide. Hee must proue those copies to be auncienter then the time of Alexius, or else they helpe not his cause. But seeing there is no copie that hath any other names but these, it is manifest that this liturgie was first composed in the dayes of the Emperour Alexius, and Pope Nicholas. And where as maister Sander vseth many wordes and reasons to proue, that this Pope Nicholas was not Bishoppe of Rome, as maister Iewell saith, but Patriarch of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople in the reigne of Alexius, I yeelde vnto him: for thereby it is more certeine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this liturgie was made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Alexius, then if it had beene Nicholas of Rome, which was neere 200. yeares before Alexius. Last of all where as Claudius <hi>de Sanctis</hi> that brauling Sorbonist, woulde proue by conferring it with diuerse places taken out of Chrisostomes owne works, the saide liturgie to be his, hee hath laboured in vaine. For as it may be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that diuerse things in this liturgie are taken out of that, which perhaps Chrisostome did write, yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth not that the whole forme thereof is his, but that the same was corrupted and altered, with additions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions in the dayes of Alexius, and especially in this matter of the images, which I proue by two reasons. First among so many counterfet and falsified authorities as were alledged out of old writers in the idolatours coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of Nice the second for the vse and worship of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, this liturgie was neuer alledged, though other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Chrisostome was cited which could not haue beene omitted seeing nothing is so notorius as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like seruice of the Church. Whereby it is manifest that the liturgie which went vnder the name of Chrisostome in that time, had in it no mention of images or the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:14727:345"/>
of them.</p>
               <p>My seconde reason is, that Chrisostome himselfe in his owne vndoubted writings, coumpteth the art of painting to be altogether superfluous, and such as might well be spared out of the worlde, which he would not haue done, if he had appointed in the publike seruice of the Church, the vse of an image as necessarie or profitable. For thus he writeth in Math <hi>Hom.</hi> 50. <q>
                     <hi>Ne<expan>
                           <am>

               </p>
               <p>Nowe as concerning the image of S. Martine painted in the Baptistery by Seuerus, and allowed by Paulinus bishop of <hi>Nola,</hi> I haue aunswered before, that his errour proueth not Gods institution. But whereas he citeth his verse to proue the worshipping of images, he doth him wronge. <hi>Martinum veneranda viri testatur imago.</hi> The reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende image of the man doth shew forth Martin: for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres haue euer had licence of all figures in their verses, wherefore he doth none otherwise call the image reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende, or to be reuerenced, then Virgill calleth the image of his father Anchises troubled: <hi>Admonet in somnis &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bida terret imago:</hi> Meaning not that the image, but that Anchises was troubled, so doth Paulinus meane that S. Martine, and not his image was to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>Finally where as maister Iewell saith that Gregorie speaketh not one worde of the adoration of images, maister Sander obiecteth this saying <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Ep.</hi> 53. <hi>Non qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si ante diuinitatem, ante illam imaginem prosternimur</hi>: whiche he englisheth thus, we ly prostrate before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image, not as before god. And then he triumpheth like a crow in a gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, saying, is not lying flat downe before an image, one word spoken of adoration of images? yea, it is cleere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:14727:346"/>
was the vse in Saint Gregories time, to lye prostrate or to fall downe before holy images. What say you maister Sander will you abide by it? Haue you either forgotten the grammer you taught vs before of ioyning the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe with the verbe, or thinke you that we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so little either grammer or logike, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see a difference betweene a proposition affirmatiue and negatiue? If a boy should construe Gregories latine as you haue englished it, hee were worthie of a dosen strips, though he had gon to gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer schoole but two or three yeres. <hi>Non quasi ante diuinitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ante illam imagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimur.</hi> We fall not downe before that image as before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuinitie: thus would I english it &amp; conster it if it were for my life. And that which you make affirmatiue, I must make negatiue, for I haue learned fiue or sixe &amp; twentie yeare agoe, that it is a negatiue proposition, when the principall Verbe is denyed. But perhaps you will gather that though he fell not downe before an image, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet he fell downe before it, as before an image.</p>
               <p>Howe certeine this collection is, you may see by an hundreth examples if you list to consider them. If I saye, <hi>Non quasi ante diuinitatem, ante diabolum prosternimur</hi>: woulde you translate it we fall downe before the deuill, but not as before God, or rather thus, we fal not down before the diuell as we do before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non quasi panem, lapides commedimus,</hi> would you turne it thus? we eate stones, but not as bread: or rather we eate not stones as we eate breade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non quasi ante regem, ante mendicum prosternimur,</hi> woulde you translate it thus? we fall downe before a begger but not as before a king, or else wee fall not downe before a begger as before a King. Such examples might bee multiplied infinitely, by which you may see, what pith there is in maister Sanders argument, to proue that Saint Gregory lay prostrate before an image, where as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise he denyeth it, and maketh such prostration and falling downe with affection of religion to be dewe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to GOD, euen as the Angell infinitly more excellent

               <p>The Bishop of Salisburie reiecting the authoritie of this Councell of Nice the second, saith,<note place="margin">

                  </note> it was holden wel neere eight hundreth yeares after Christe, and therefore was out of the compasse of those sixe hundred yeares, of which he made his challenge. Maister Sander answereth, it was seuen hundreth yeares before Maister Iewell, as though the controuersie were of antiquitie of the men, and not of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>The Bishop saide, it would require a long treatise, to open the whole follie and fondnesse of that Councell. M. Sander answereth, it is more like, that M. Iewell is a fond foole, then 350. Bishops of such wit, vertue, and learning: as though their multitude could proue their wit, vertue, and learning, when their words and deeds plainly declare their follie, ignorance, and vngodlinesse.</p>
               <p>The B. saide, Irene the Empresse which gathered this Councell, was a wicked woman. M. Sander citing diuers writers to and fro in the end concludeth, that by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance she was made a good woman, and her zeale towards holy images did make her the better, so he bringeth that
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:14727:347"/>
for an argument, which is the matter in controuersie.</p>
               <p>The Bishop said. She was the kings daughter of Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, an Heathen borne. So was Constantine the great, saith M. Sander, yet was she Christened before she procured that Councell, whereas hee doubteth whether Maister Iewell thinke that Constantine was baptized, when hee gathered and confirmed the first Councell of Nice. The Bishop doth not for that cause onely reiect the second Councel at Nice, bicause Irene was an Heathen borne, but thereby sheweth, that she sauoured of Gentilitie, in being earnest to set forward idolatrie. And whereas Maister San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doubteth, whether Maister Iewell thinke Constantine were baptized before he gathered the Councel, he neede not at al, seeing Eusebius which knewe Constantine very well, affirmeth that he was not baptized, but euen imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before his death. Contrarie to that fond fable, which among other is auouched by Pope Adrian in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that Constantine was cured of a leapresie, &amp; baptized by Siluester Bishop of Rome. And whereas he thinketh it a daungerous matter, to take the authorizing of that Councel from Siluester, and to ascribe it to one that was not baptized, there is no perill at all in it, for Constantine did then beleeue in Christ, and was certainly determined to be baptized in Iordan, if he had not bene preuented by death. Yea, although hee had beene an Heathen man, seeing he gaue no sentence, but assented to the sentence of the Bishoppes, it had beene none inconuenience at all.</p>
               <p>The Bishop saide. She caused that Councell to be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned in despight of the Councell of Constantinople, that had decreed against images. Maister Sander, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he confesse there was such a Councell, yet bicause the whole processe of the actes thereof is not extant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defaced by the idolaters, he quarelleth that it was an obscure Councell, and asketh by what Emperour it was gathered: as though it were not testified that it was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by Leo the third, but it lacked (saith he) the Bishop of Romes authoritie, and therefore was no general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:14727:347"/>
so did the Chalcedonense, and the sixt of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople in some partes, and yet it went forward with the decree, which had bene in vaine if the Romish Bishop had a negatiue voyce in all Councels.</p>
               <p>The Bishop sayde. She tooke her owne sonne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus and pulled out his eyes. The Councell is not therefore naught, saith Maister Sander. But she is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by proued to bee a cruell woman, which was the Bishops meaning.</p>
               <p>The Bishop saith, She did it onely, bycause he would not consent to the idolatrous hauing of images. Maister Sander denyeth this, but proofe hee bringeth none, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that hee sheweth there was an other cause why shee might doe it, namely bicause hee deposed her of her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, wherein hee did well, after the example of Asa, which is commended in the scripture, for that hee did put downe his mother Maachah from her estate, bycause she had made an idoll in a groue, and destroyed her idolles, and burned them by the brooke Elledron. 1. Reg. 15. verse. 13. But Maister Sander will defend her ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of succession, bicause she was elder then her sonne, and to bee honoured of him. O cunning Lawyer, that will make the wife inheritour to her husband, and that in the Empire before her sonne begotten by her husband, which had the Empire by discent. Concerning the diuorcement of Constantinus from his first wife Marie, and marrying of an other, as I knowe not the cause, so I will not take vpon me the defence.</p>
               <p>The Bishop saide: the Bishops and Doctours of that Councell manifestly corrupted the Scriptures. Maister Sander sayth, it is not so, as hee hath proued in parte, what he hath proued you may reade in the twefth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but bicause he is so impudent to defend those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and deprauations, I will set downe some of them. <q>Theodosius Amorij citeth this text for images, What thinges so eueer are written, they are written for our learning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioannes</hi> Legate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> East citeth this, Shew me thy face, for"
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:14727:348"/>
it is beautifull. Theodorus alledgeth this saying, God is maruellous in his Saintes. An other, to proue that images must be set on the altar, vseth this text. No man lighteth a candle and putteth it vnder a bushell &amp;c. An other this text to proue images necessarie to knowe God by them. As wee haue heard, so wee haue seene, in the citie of our God. These are not the one halfe of those beastly applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the scripture vsed in that blasphemous Councel, but these are sufficient to shewe, what learned bewclearks they were in the holy word of God, and the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
               <p>The B. saide, They falsified the holy Fathers without shame. Maister Sander saith nothing, but that hee doeth belye them. What shall we say of the falsifying of Basil <hi>in Oratione</hi> 40. <hi>Martyres:</hi> for the worshipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which Oration is extant, and no such matter found in it? Shall we beleeue the forged Oration in the name of Athanasius, of the image of Christe in Beritus, which being stricken by a Iewe, bloud issued out of the side of it? Howe impudently doe they deny the authoritie and writings of Epiphanius, Amphilochius, Theodotus, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, which were brought against the irreligious vse and honouring of images, by the Councels of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople and Ephesus, slaundering also Eusebius of Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</p>
               <p>The B. saide, They sayde <hi>Imago melior est quàm oratio.</hi> An image is better then a prayer. Here are three faultes found in citing fiue wordes. Great faultes I warrant you. The first, he writeth they saide: which one onely Bishop did say, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of that fourth action all the Bishops and Legates subscribed and allowed all that had bene saide in defence of images, and no man reclamed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee might well write: they saide. The second fault is, he said not <hi>melior est imago,</hi> but <hi>maior est imago,</hi> greater i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an image, for a thing may bee greater which is not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is no great fault, but an ouersight, and the sense is not altered, for in this case he meaneth by grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="681" facs="tcp:14727:348"/>The thirde fault that he translateth <hi>Oratio</hi> for prayer, which signifieth an oration or speech. Yet doeth it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a prayer also. But if the circumstance of this place would haue it to be taken for speeche or an oration, or sermon, the absurditie is nothing lesse to say, there is greater force to teache in an image, then in a sermon, oration, or speeche.</p>
               <p>But seeing you finde so many faultes in the citing of that saying to excuse it from absurditie, I pray you see if you can finde as many in this, which I cite, spoken by <hi>Ioannes</hi> the Monke, Priest and deputie or vicar of the East, to defend it from blasphemie. <q>
                     <hi>Nisi fuissent necessariae imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, eas propter stabilitionem factorum non fuissent osculati, vt eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am meo iuditio cum sanctis Euangelijs &amp; veneranda cruce aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeant.</hi> Except images had bene necessarie, he would not haue kissed them for the establishing of deeds, so that in my iudgement they are of equall worthines with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Gospels and the reuerend crosse. Act. 4.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The B. said: And againe whosoeuer wil not adore the godly images, accursed be he. This M. Sander confesseth to be written in deed, and to be true, sauing that he cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at the translation of <hi>Diuinas imagines,</hi> into godly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which he saith should be diuine images. But how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he the saying of Constantine Bishop of Constantia in Cypres? which affirmeth that he will worship images with that honour which is due to the blessed Trinitie, &amp; accurseth him that, refuseth with the Manichees and Marcionites, vnto which sentence al the rest agree. Where is nowe the distinction of <hi>Doulia</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> when they will worship the image of Christ, with the same honour that is due to the Trinitie? What saith he to the zeale of Ihon the deputie of the East, which affirmeth that it is better to admitte all stewes of whores and brothels into the citie, then to deny the worshipping of images? If these be not beastly and blasphemous absurdities, worse then childish sayinges, whiche he can not abide the Bishop to tearme them, let the world iudge.</p>
               <p>Hitherto M. Sander hath made no defence for this ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:14727:349"/>
rablement, which he calleth the seuenth generall councell. But he will answere all the Bishops arguments against it with these 4. reasons. First he saith, there is no impietie or falshoode approued or decreed in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. A substantial reason, which concludeth vpon that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is in controuersie. But yet to lay open his shamelesse impudencie, I will proue that to haue beene decreed and approued in that councell, which he him selfe will not denie to be impietie and falshood. <hi>Action.</hi> 5. We read thus, out of the booke of one Ihon Bishop of Thessalonica. <hi>De</hi>

                     <hi>Angelis, &amp; Archangelis &amp; eorum potestatibus, quibus &amp; nostras animas adiungo, ipsa Catholica Ecclesia sic sentis, esse quidem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibiles sed non omnino corporis expertes &amp; inuisibiles, vt vos gentiles dicitis, verum tenui corpore preditos, &amp; aereo siue igneo, vt scriptum est: Qui facit Angelos suos spiritus, &amp; ministros eius, ignem vrentem, &amp;c.</hi> Of Angels &amp; Archangels and of their powers, vnto which also I adioyne our soules, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Churche doth so thinke, that they are in deede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, but not altogether voide of body and inuisible as you Gentiles say, but that they haue a thinne body &amp; that either of ayer or of fire, as it is writen: which maketh his Agels spirites, and his ministers a burning fire, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Herevpon Thorasius the Patriarke saide: <q>
                     <hi>Ostendit autem pater quod &amp; Angelos pingere oporteat, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do circumscribi possunt, &amp; vt &amp; homines apparnerunt.

The holie synode said, Yea forsoth my Lord. Here is an open falshood decreed and approued that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and soules of men haue bodies of ayer or fire and be circumscriptible.</q> But if M. Sander will stand in the defence of it, because it is so decreed by this general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: at least let him heare the greatest councell for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that is read of, namely. The Laterane <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <q>
                     <hi>Vnus est Deus indiuisus in essentia &amp; discretus in personis, creator om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, &amp;c: is ab initio temporis vtram<expan>

                     <pb n="683" facs="tcp:14727:349"/>
There is one God vndiuided in essence, &amp; distinct in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the creator of all thinges, &amp;c. He in the beginning of time created both the creatures of nothing, the bodily creature and the spirituall, namely the Angels and the world. Afterward the humane creature as common, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting both of a spirite and of a bodie. Now let M. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der aduise himselfe, whether he will iustifie the Nicene councel with condemning the Laterane, for their decrees be directly contrarie one to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other.</q> For impietie beside that which we haue already shewed, Iohn deputie of the East to whome al the synode agreed vttered these wordes out of Sophionius. <q>
                     <hi>Praestat iurantem peierare, quam planè iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramentum in destructionem venerandarum imaginum seruare.</hi> It is beter for him that sweareth to be forsworne, then in deed to keep his oth to the destruction of reuerend ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</q> If this also may be excused from impietie, what say you to that conclusion? <q>
                     <hi>Gaudeant &amp; exultant qui Christi habentes imaginem, sacrificium illi offerunt.</hi> Let them reioyce and be glad which hauing the image of Christ doe offer sacrifice to it. In this conclusion, sacrifice whiche is the honor properly due to GOD alone euen by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes confession, is giuen to an image.</q> If none of al these be impietie, yet to condemne the Pope of Rome for an heretike, (I answere with M. Sander) is counted great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and a pernicious errour. But Honorius sometime Pope of Rome, was in this councell condemned for an heretike <hi>Action.</hi> 6. <hi>To.</hi> 2. and <hi>Actione.</hi> 7. in the definition.</p>
               <p>His second reason in defence of this councel is, that euerie word vttered by any father, is not the determination of the whole councel, no more then the voyce of euerie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse, is an act of Parleament. This granted, we haue shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the consent of the synode to moste of the speeches we haue recited which maketh a full determination.</p>
               <p>His third reason is, that the scriptures are better applied for honouring of images, then they are impugned by Maister Iewell, as he hath partely shewed. What he hath shewed, and how wel he hath applied them, we haue seene already.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="684" facs="tcp:14727:350"/>His fourth reason is, that the miracles there tolde are not against the faith, and therefore not to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but credited. If all that be against the faith, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is against the worde of God, those miracles that are brought to confirme the worshipping of images, must needes bee againste the faith. That I speake not of so many dreames, as be there alledged to proue the same. But M. Sander thinketh images might as wel worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as the shadowe of Peter did heale diseases, Saint Paules girdle or napkins did heale diseases, and driue out diuels. But Peter him selfe confesseth, that not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, much lesse his shadowe, or any vertue in him did heale diseases, but onely Iesus Christ. Ye men of Israel saith he, why maruel you at this, or why look ye vpon vs, as though by our owne power &amp; godlines we had made this man to walke? If Peters owne person may not be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto to haue any prayse of the miracle, muche lesse his shadowe, or Paules girdle and napkins, and least of all his image: for God vsed those as meanes by whiche he wrought, but their images he neuer vsed. Againe, no man was so madde to worship Peters shadowe, or Paules napkins, or Elizaeus staffe, for that he hath vp also, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it wrought no miracle. As for the hearbe which was reported to grow vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image in Paneade, it tooke no vertue of the image, if any such hearbe were, but of God. Although in that point, Eusebius as I thinke was more credulous then a wise man shold haue ben, to write such a strange matter vpon reporte, which he might haue seene himselfe, within a fewe dayes iourney.</p>
               <p>After these generall answers, he promiseth to bring a most euident reason, why euerie man ought to beleeue &amp; obey the same generall councel, vnder paine of euerlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting damnation. And what is that I pray you? Forsooth, they that defended honouring of images, were in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honouring of images, because it had beene impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that images had beene ouerthrowen, if they had not beene first set vppe and honoured. A lawlike reason in deede.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="685" facs="tcp:14727:350"/>Why Master Sander, will you defende a possession without a title. The setting vp and worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when it first entered into the Churche, was but a Disseisure of the true and spirituall worshippe of God, &amp; therefore by diuers assises holden at Constantinople &amp; Ephesus was dispossessed, and the true worshippe of God restored, vntill this packed Iurie of Nice, put her out of possession againe. And where you reiect the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Constantinople and Ephesus, as priuate conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as holden in the darke, &amp; hating the light, because the whole processe of their calling and actes, is by your false Idolatrous Councell of Nice defaced, you shewe your selfe both voide of reason and honestie. Of reason, because many councels were helde, and thinges in them decreed &amp; obserued, although the recordes of them are not to be found at large. Of honesty, because you would take aduauntage of your owne wronge, who haue burned the recordes, and then vrge your aduersarie to shew them.</p>
               <p>You say they folowed in this councell the vse of their forefathers. The councell of Constantinople also folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vse of their elder fathers, whose writings they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against images. As Epiphanius: <q>
                     <hi>Estote memores di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecti filij ne in ecclesiam imagines inferatis, nec in sanctorum cę<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miterijs eas statuite, sed perpetuò circumferte deum in cordibus vestris. Quia etiam nec in domo communi tolerentur. Non enim fas est Christianum per oculos suspensum teneri, sed per occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem mentis.</hi> Be mindefull beloued children, that you bring no images into the Churche, neither set ye them vp in the buriall places of the saintes, but alwayes carye about God in your heartes. But neither in a common house let them be tollerated. For it is not lawfull for a Christian man to be held in suspense by the eyes, but by occupying of the minde.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Againe they cited Chrisostomes, saying. <hi>Nos perscripta sanctorum fruimur presentia, non sanè corporum ipsorum, sed ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum imagines habentes. Non quae ab ipsis dicta sunt, animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum illorum imagines sunt.</hi> Wee enioye the presence of the
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:14727:351"/>
saintes by their writinges, verilye not hauing the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their bodies, but of their mindes. For those thinges whiche are saide by them, are the images of their mindes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Likewise they cited the saying of Amphilochus some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time bishoppe of Iconium. <hi>Non enim nobis sanctorum corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales vultus in tabulis, coloribus effigiare curae est, quoniam hijs opus non habemus, sed politicè illorum virtutum memores esse debemus.</hi> We haue no regarde to counterfet the corporall faces of the saintes in tables with coloures, because we haue no need of them, but we ought to be wisely mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their vertues.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer they rehearsed the sayinge of Theodotus bishop of Ancyn. <q>
                     <hi>Sanctorum formas &amp; species ex materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus coloribus formari minimè decorum putamus: horum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem virtutes quae per scripta traditae sunt, veluti viuas quasdam imagines reficere subinde oportet.

                        </expan> recordatio eos habeat ex tali specie &amp; contemplatione? sed mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festum est, quòd vana sit eiuscemodi cogitatio, &amp; diabolicae decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis inuentum.</hi> We thinke it nothing at al seemely, that the formes and shapes of the saintes shoulde be fashioned in materiall collours: but their vertues whiche are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their writings as certain liuing images, we ought often times to renue. For by them we may come to the like imitation and zeale. For let those which set vp ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges tell vs, what profite commeth vnto them by them? is it that a certaine remembrance come to them by such shape and sight? But it is manifest, that such cogitation is vaine, and an inuention of diuelishe deceipte. What shall here rehearse the testimony of Eusebius, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Empresse Constantia required to haue an image of Christ, answered that no such images were to be made? with many other sayings of Basil, Gregorie, Athanasius, and other, cited in that Councell, which M.S. maketh so obscure, as though they had mett by candle light, and
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:14727:351"/>
whispered in corners, that they durst not be a knowne of.</q> But if it deserued not the credit of a councell, what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Irene to haue gathered this worshipfull councel of Nice against it? And where M.S. for further allowance of it, saith it was confirmed &amp; registred for a knowne law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful general councel throughout al christendom, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out of al compasse of the trueth. For the Emperour Charles the great would not receiue it, but write, or at the leastwise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded Albinus or Alcuinus his teacher to write a booke against it in his name, which booke is yet extant. <q>How it was receiued in Britaine, <hi>Matheus Westm.</hi> testifieth in these words. <hi>Eodem anno Carolus rex Francorum, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same yeare Charles the king of Fraunce sent a synodall booke into Britane, in whiche manye thinges were founde contrary to the true faith, and especially this, that it was defined by the consent of almost all the doctors of the East, that images ought to be worshipped, which doctrine the Catholike Church doeth altogether accurse. Against which Albinus wrote an Epistle, beinge marueilously well indighted by the authoritie of holy scriptures, and the fame brought vnto the Frenche king, with that synodall booke in the presence of the bishops and noble men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These thinges considered, the conference that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth betweene this councell and the first helde at the same place, is chyldishe and ridiculous, for though they were both helde in one place, called by Emperours or Popes, equall in number, disputation in both, 4. Patriarks in both, custome obserued, the decree put in execution, &amp;c. yet they disagreed in that which is the onely autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of councels. The first decreed according to the word of God, the later cleane contrary to it. The first confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Catholike faith which alwayes was held, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a newe heresie of Idolatrie, of which the Churche was cleare more then sixe hundreth yeares. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what soeuer hee talketh of the authoritie of
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:14727:352"/>
general councels is vaine &amp; wicked, for a general councel of Angels is not to be beleeued against the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; what is more plaine in the scriptures, then the forbidding of Idolatrie and worshippinge of Images?</p>
               <p>The great prerogatiue that Master Sander findeth in this councell, that so many bishops recanted in it, as in none other, is a fonde matter to authorize it. Rather it sheweth what turne coates they were, which changed as euerie prince was affected.</p>
               <p>Finally the nomber of names, that he rehearseth of them that beleeued, as this councell decreed, maketh it not of sufficient credit, beside that he is not able to proue it of many, whom he nameth, as <hi>Beda, Theophylacte, Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, &amp;c.</hi> It were an easie matter to proue as many mo of more antiquitie, which beleeued the contrary. As Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus, Origines, Irenaeus, Iustinus, Cypria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Lactantius, Epiphanius, Arnobius, Tertulianus, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus, Chrysostomus, Hieronymus, Ambrosus, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius, Basilius, Gregorius Naza.

Amphylochius Iconiensis, Theodorus, Ancyramus, Serenus Massiliensis, Claudius Taurinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, Albinus, Carolus magnus, yea Gregorie 1, of Rome, and Ionas of Orleance against the worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. If I woulde descende to later times as Master Sander doth, I might add a great number more, as Waldo, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silus, Henricus de Gandauo, Iohn Wiclef, Iohn Hus, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome of Praga, and many other. So that there remaineth in recorde foure to one, that M. Sander can name for the vse and worshippinge of images, against either one or both. And the greatest part more ancient then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond councell of Nice, which he woulde maintaine by rehearsing so many names of men that allowed it, the most part were since it was holden, &amp; scarse two or three before it was helde.</p>

If the sacrament being an image, a signe &amp;c, of Christs bodie &amp; not his owne bodie, may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped and reuerenced, therefore it doth follow, that an image of an holy thing being absent, as of Christ or saint Laurence, may be worshipped of the newe Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Who will say the Papistes lacke learning, that make such wittie arguments? An image or signe instituted by God may be reuerenced, therefore an image forbidden by God may be honoured. That which is vnproperlye called an image may be worshiped, <hi>ergo</hi> that which is properly called so, may be worshiped. Christ is the image of his father, Christ is God, therfore euery image is God. A signe or sacrament of Christs institution ought to be reuerently esteemed, therefore a stocke or a stone in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of an image, ought to be senced, kneeled too, kissed, prayed to &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But maister Iewell proceedeth further saying, we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the worde of God according to this counsell of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius.
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:14727:353"/>

               </p>
               <p>Let them diligently heare and faithfully worship the worde of God. Briefely we worship other thinges in such religious wise vnto Christ belonging. Of these wordes, Maister Sander argueth thus. But Christs owne image belongeth to him, in a religious wise instructing the eye, the more worthy sence, better then the worde doth the eare, therefore Christs image is to be worshipped by the force of master Iewels doctrine. I deny that your image belongeth to Christ, which he abhorreth, or that faith is to be instructed by the eye, but onely by the hearing of the worde. Rom. 10.</p>
               <p>Further maister Iewell saith, doubtlesse it is our duetie to adore the body of Christ in the worde of God, in the Sacrament of baptisme, in the misteries of Christs bodye and bloude, and wheresoeuer we see any steppe or token of it. Hereof maister Sander resoneth thus, a steppe is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a token of the foote, an image of the whole bodilie shape, a step must be adored, <hi>ergo,</hi> much more an image. I deny that an image is any steppe of the body of Christ, but a false, lying, and deceiptfull counterfet: beside that it is a wise reason that is drawne from a Metaphore, to a proper speach.</p>
               <p>Moreouer maister Iewell saith in an other place: the sacraments in this sort are the flesh of Christ, and are so vnderstanded and beleued, and adored. But the whole honor resteth not in them, but is passed ouer from them, to the things that be signified.</p>
               <p>Here saith maister Sander, he giueth to the sacraments the honor due to an image, and as he worshipeth the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament without daunger of idolatrie, so do we honour holy images without feare of committing idolatrie. A sounde conclusion. The sacramentes are to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, as signes ordeined of God to represent the body of Christ without idolatrie, therefore images forbidden by God, may be worshipped without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of idolatrie.</p>
               <p>And yet againe maister Iewell saith: The very names of the old fathers are worthie of much honour. M. Sander
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:14727:353"/>
addeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old godly fathers are attributed to the images. For the images of S. Augustin &amp; S. Hierome are called S. Austen and Ieronime, therefore their images are by M. Iewels owne confession, worthie of much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Shal I say a doctor hath framed this argument, or a goose hath hissed it? In effect it is this, the olde doctours names are falsely attributed to images, therfore the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are to be honoured. But (saith he) these names be not giuen them by chaunce, but of purpose. Verily of such purpose, as the Poet Horace saith of the image of Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</p>

               <p>Againe he saith, these names are not giuen them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause for the lyknesse of the shape, that is in them. A worthie cause if there were any liknesse in Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines image more to him, then to any other man.</p>
               <p>But leauing maister Iewels wordes, we must come to his deeds. What shall we say, if euen in that reply against Harding touching grauen images, maister Iewell hath oftentimes grauen images, yea besides Gorgons and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques heades, which are Idolles? There is a filthie image of a desperate naked boye, set forth in such sort, that an honest man woulde go backwarde, and couer it with his cloake. I am sory the printer hath troubled your chaste eyes with such a picture, but why is maister Iewell char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the printers, or grauers fault? Forsooth you say, hee had the ouersight and correction of his booke, paraduenture you are deceiued. But what if he had, howe proue you that this picture was pressed when that leafe came to correction? for commonly such superfluous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites (I trowe they call them) bee not set to, vntill they presse the whole leafe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="692" facs="tcp:14727:354"/>But what if it were pressed, and he not regarded it? you say if it had beene the picture of the Crucifixe, he would haue espied it at the first, and caused the printer to haue corrected it. Peraduenture he woulde not haue regarded it, perhaps he shoulde not haue espied it. But seeing you are such a narrowe vewer of such idle pictures maister Sander, I meruaile you coulde not see a dronkerd bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in the first letter of your owne booke of images, nor euen such an impudent naked boye as you speake of in the first letter of your Epistle before your booke of the rocke of the church, and the same againe in the rocke of the church. Nowe see whereto your lewde hipocriticall outcries do tend: O the iudgements of God, is it so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a matter in maister Iewell which toke no heede to such toyes, and yet M.

               <p>The best remedie in this behalfe and most agreeable with Gods worde, is vtterly to abolish the cause of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil.
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:14727:354"/>
So Ezechias brake in pieces the brasen Serpent, Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us rent in sunder the painted-vaile, Theodosius comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the image of our sauiour to be taken downe, where so euer it should be found.</p>
               <p>This sentence of M. Iewels he will confute. And first concerning the examples of Ezechias and Epiphanius, he will not say one word more, then he hath said before <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 4. Sauing that hee affirmeth Ezechias brake downe but one image that was abused, and left the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, the altar, &amp; the temple, which were obscure ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Christ. And therfore he thinketh, if som one image of theirs, that hath chanced to be abused, were broken by this example, yet all the rest should stand. But if it please his wisedome to read the historie better, he shall find that Ezechias destroyed all images that were forbidden of God. As for the Cherubims were made by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the altar and the temple were no images. Finally, what image is there in the Popish Church, but it hath bene abused to grosse idolatrie?</p>
               <p>To the lawe of Theodosius he saith, it is both misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and misse Englished. Misreported, bicause the Emperour ment such honour to the crosse, that he would not haue it lye on the ground, whereof how true or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, we haue spoken before in the 13. Chapter, whither also M. Sander referreth vs.</p>
               <p>It is misse Englished (he saith) in translating <hi>tolli</hi> to be taken downe, which signifieth to be taken vp. I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered before, that <hi>tolli</hi> signifieth generally to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without respect of vp or downe. And yet bicause M. Sander and his fellowe Papistes, thinke they haue taken Maister Iewell in such a great fault for Englishing <hi>tolli</hi> to be taken downe, they shewe I can not tell whether more spightfull malice, or grosse ignorance, or ridiculous cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse. For <hi>tolli</hi> doth signifie as wel to be taken downe as to be taken vp. For else howe shall we English these words in the nineteene of Saint Iohns Gospel? <hi>Rogauerunt Pilatum vt frangerentur eorum crura &amp; tollerentur.</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Pilate, that their legges might bee broken, and that

they might be taken downe. Likewise Ioseph desired Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Vt tolleres corpus Iesu,</hi> that hee might take downe the body of Iesus.</p>
               <p>But the 73. Canon of the sixt Councell of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, doth confirme this interpretation of M. Sander, as he supposeth, and the reading of this lawe in Iustinian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that shall doe otherwise, we decree that he be excommunicated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the authoritie of this 73. Canon, first I must say the trueth, that it was not made by the sixt Councell, which either made but nine Canons or none at all. The second Councell of Nice liking some of these 102. Canons saith, they met againe foure or fiue yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the time of Iustinian, and made these Canons. But how so euer it was, it was not of that Councel, nor of that authoritie, but of a later time, when imagerie beganne to be more esteemed. Nowe to the purpose. I say this Canon doth not helpe the vnderstanding of that auncient lawe, which was made almost three hundreth yeares before,
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:14727:355"/>
to be meant of crosses on the ground only, which needed not to haue bene forbidden in this Canon, if the former lawe of Theodosius, and afterward registred by Iustinian, had bene made onely against crosses on the ground, but the execution of that lawe might haue beene required. Nowe touching the sense of this Canon, it is this: they did so much honour the death of Christe, which they call the quickening crosse, that they would not haue the figure of the woodden crosse to be troden vnder foote. This was their iudgement about 700. yeares after Christ. The later age was more superstitious, and brake out into open ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
               <p>And whereas M. Sander cauelleth at M. Iewels transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Signum saluatoris,</hi> for the image of our Sauiour, which saith he, is the signe of the crosse, he affecteth too great a tyrannie in the Latine tong, that wil haue no mans translation stand but his owne. I am sure <hi>signum</hi> is often taken for an image, and in this place none but a froward quareller would take it otherwise, and for the signe of the crosse there is no probable coniecture, that it should be so taken in this place.</p>
               <p>Hee misliketh not the order taken by the Councell of Mentz, that images abused should be altered or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: but he will haue the question generall, whether it be expedient to permit images to be honoured or no, in which question the daunger of idolatrie must be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the profite of images, the daunger hee counteth small, the profite great. And considering the question at this day, hee counteth there is no daunger at all, neither was there euer any great daunger, and this he will proue by nine reasons.</p>
               <p>The first, the newe Gospellers haue preuailed so much with their doctrine of images, that it is not lightly possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they should be honoured too much. The diuell yet confesseth, that the doctrine of the Gospell, hath chased away idolatrie in most places, I would to GOD it had in all.</p>
               <p>The 2. in the most Popish times the people seeing the
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:14727:356"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> crosse so homely vnder his cloake, might see a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the reuerence giuen to images, and the honour giuen, and due to the sacrament of the altar. As though the Priest also, did not sometimes carrie the Pixe in his bosome, with the consecrated cake in it, and sometime they might as well see him burne his breaden Gods, as the Sextan sweeping copwebs from the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den idolls, and yet none of these were euer able to keepe the people from idolatrie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is lesse euill to suffer some one to doe amisse, then to falsifie the whole lawe, and right it selfe. And here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he opposeth the lawe of idolatrous nations against the lawe of God, which forbiddeth worshipping of any image or similitude of any thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4 When the faith and intent of him that worshippeth the image is good, as to worship one God and his Saintes, what so euer is done with this mind (so that sacrifice be not made to images) it can be no idolatrie. What faith is that, which is contrarie to Gods commaundement? And what call you sacrifice, if prayers, thanksgiuing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses bee none, which are offered by the people to images? namely to our Ladie of Walsingham, of Ipswich, &amp;c. which can bee none other but those idols that bee set vp in those places, wee haue also shewed before, that the Councel of Nice 2. wil haue sacrifice offered to the image of Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Christians must not be considered as weake &amp; fraile like the Iewes and Paynims, but strong and full of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, according to the prophesies and promises: They shall all knowe me &amp;c. Iere. 31. and he doth them wrong that iudgeth Gods people proue to idolatrie, for images were forbidden the Iewes, but as the libell of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was winked at in them. O monstruous impudencie that maketh one of the tenne commandements, that hath such a seuere threatening annexed vnto it, that the Lorde will punish the transgressours of it vnto the thirde and fourth g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eration, like a permission of that, whereof
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:14727:356"/>
there was no commaundement! But what so euer was promised of the knowledge and faith of Christe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth not to all that vnworthily beare the name of Christe, but onely to perfect and well instructed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If the people be weake and apt to idolatrie, yet it is the best way to keep them from it, to suffer them to haue, and honour conueniently the images of honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as God permitted the Iewes to offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oxen, Calues, &amp;c. because they would needes offer some external sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. As though God learned of them to make his lawes of sacrifices, or if that had ben the best way, he would not rather haue permitted images, then forbidden them.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Because the people haue not so many sacrifices as the Iewes, therfore it is good they haue the remembrances of the martyrs in images, whiche sacrificed their owne bodies. It is great maruell the Apostles coulde not finde suche a profitable supplie of the Iewish sacrifices, by images, but onely the sacrifice of Christes death, and the spirituall sacrifices of our selues, which if we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diligently, we shall finde matter inough to keepe vs exercised, that we neede not spend our time in gaping vpon idols.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Images are not so much permitted to Christians for their weaknesse, as for their strength, that they may now haue them &amp; worship them without committing spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fornication, as in times past: for to haue none, is pusil lanimity. In deed it is a Popish magnanimity to contemn the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, and it were belike no daunger of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue a whore to kisse her, to lie with her, for Popish Christians are strong ynough.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The text of Iohn. 4. that the true worshippers must worship God in spirite and veritie, must not be applyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst worshipping of God by images, but against idols and bondage of praying after one corporall fashion, for godly images leade vs to spirituall deuotion. The Diuel they doe. But if they did, yet not more then the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the olde law; the abolishing of which our Sauiour

Christe in that sentence doeth promise: not to set vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a spirituall worship in spirite and trueth, (but as Maister Sander would beare vs in hand,) to chaunge the shadowes and ceremonies from such as were instituted by God, to as many other ordeined by men, and moreouer to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping by images, which before was altogether forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Note also that he calleth them godly images, which terme he reproued in Maister Iewell. As for the Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he carpeth, which can abide to see their concubynes after their vowe of chastetie, and yet cannot abide to see popish images, let them aunswere for themselues if any such keep harlots, as for them that are married, they shal better defend their marrying, out of the scriptures, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popish Votaries their filthie &amp; abhominable liues, vnder the hypocriticall title of chastitie.</p>
               <p>Now followeth 12. commodities y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come by images.</p>
               <p n="1">1 We learne something by them that we knewe not before. The Prophet Abacuc faith, an image can teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lies. Cap. 2. vers. 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They bring vs in remembrance of the thinges that we know. Theodotus of Ancira saith, such cogitation is vaine, and the deceitfull inuention of the deuil.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They bring vs in remembrance, not as by reading, and repeating, but by the most speedie twinckling of an eye. But faith without the which it is impossible to please God, commeth by hearing of Gods word. Rom. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4 By seeing and knowing we are prouoked to become like them whose images we worship. Nay rather we are made like them whom we worship, that is, without, sense and vnderstanding. Psal. 115.</p>
               <p n="5">5 We are confirmed in our faith, perceiuing those things that are painted, be so true, that they are euerie where set forth and honored. <hi>Pictoribus atque poetis quidli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas.</hi> Because Painters and Poets haue alwaies had libertie to setforth what they list.

               <p>Augustine <hi>Ad Deogratias Epi.</hi> 49. <q>
                     <hi>Et idola quidem omnè sensu carere quis dubitat? Veruntamen cum his locantur sedibus honorabili sublimitate, vt a precantibus atque immolantibus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendantur, ipsa similitudine animatorum membrorum atque sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quamuis insensata atque exanima, afficiunt infirmos animos, vt viuere ac spirare videantur, accedente praesertim veneratione multitudinis, quae tantus eis Dei cultus impenditur.</hi> And who doubteth but that idolles are voide of all sense? Yet when they are sette vppe in those places, in honorable height, so that they bee looked vppon by them that pray and sacrifice, by the very similitude of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and senses of liuing creatures, although they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible and without life, they affecte the weak mindes of men, so that they seeme to liue and breathe, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the worshipping of the multitude com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to them, by which so great honor of God is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon them.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The same Augustine in Leuit. <hi>Qu.</hi> 68. writeth thus. <hi>Nam quid isto praecepto absolutius, non mentiemini.

Thou shalt not make to thy self any graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> image, which fact can neuer bee righteous, and euen as it is saide, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. If M. Sander cauill at the worde Idoll, yet the commandement is generall, for all images and similitudes to be made by mans deuise, as he himselfe confesseth.</q> Therefore it is as, lawfull to haue images in religion, as to lye, or to commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by Saint Augustines iudgement.

                  </note> But yet he saith it is a question of phylosophie rather then of diuinitie, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church hath not determined. As though the churche had any thing to do to determine questions of phylosophie: or as though a question about the true worship of God, were not a question of diuinitie. His sophisticall reasons on both sides are superfluous to repeat, seeinge we take neither of both parts, but denie that any kinde of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous honour is to be giuen to images, yet briefely I will runne ouer the contentes of the chapter. Three things (he saith) are to be considered in an artificial image, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the forme, and the representation. The two former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue no honour in religion, but the representation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The image as a representation, is considered either as a part from the trueth, and then it hath a lesse honour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trueth, or els together with the trueth, and then it must haue all one honour with the trueth.</p>
               <p>And then he maketh the question this, whether as his minde is in one instant mooued and caried by the meane of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image to the remembrance of the trueth, so the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of both be all one or no? But if he were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> schooles at Cambridge, the boyes would tell him, that there can bee no mouinge in one instant, because in euerie moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge there must bee the marke from whence, and the marke whereunto the moouinge is. Neuerthelesse hee aunswereth this question, with a doughtie distinction, that the honour giuen to the image, and to Christe, is
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:14727:360"/>
either the same in number, or the same in kinde or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And his opinion is, that it is the same in number, but not in degree. And of this aunswere he maketh the seuenth generall councell auctor, <hi>Actione,</hi> 4. <q>Where Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes vicegerent of the East, saith, <hi>Non sunt duae adoratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sed vna adoratio imaginis &amp; primi exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaris cuius est imago.</hi> There are not two adorations, but one adoration of the image, and of the first examplar whereof it is an image.</q> And here he raileth against M. Iewel, for falsifying and forging in translating <hi>duae adorationes:</hi> two sortes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping and exemplifyinge his doctrine by <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Doulia</hi> whereof Iohannes meant not, but the contrarie is taught before in the same Action. How impudent and shamelesse the cauill of Master Sander is, I haue shewed before, when I rehearsed howe Constantius bishoppe of Constantia in Cypres, affirmeth that he woulde giue the same honour to images, that he did to the holy trinitie that giueth life, vnto whome al the rest did assent. So that M. Sanders opinion is contrary to the determination of the councel. For he holdeth that not <hi>Latria,</hi> but <hi>Doulia</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commeth to Christ by his images. By which opinion, you see how greatly Christ is promoted, that in steed of <hi>Latria,</hi> a Diuine honour, which they confesse to be due to him, he must be content with the lower degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor by his image, because the image can receiue nor cary no greater. But if the image be neither a receiuer, nor a carier, Christ must lose all his honour, as he doth indeed, which is that way offered. Yet (saith Master Sander) doth not his image any more hinder his honour, then Sainte Paule doth. For when I honour S. Paule for Christs sake, no greater honour then <hi>Doulia</hi> commeth to Christ Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Master Sander, how it is when you honour S. Paule, I knowe not, but when I honour him for Christes sake, I honour not him, but Christ with Diuine honour, as the onely author of those giftes of his spirite, by whiche he is preferred before other men. And where you say M. Iewel alledgeth wordes out of a book of Carolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, written against that Idolatrous synode of Nice,
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:14727:360"/>
which is forged, you speake not more peremtorily then falsly and perniciously. For what reason haue you to prooue that booke to be forged: forsooth, you aske howe could Carolus Magnus write such a book, which built so many churches and monasteries? As though Churches and monasteries could not bee builded but by an idolater. <hi>Yea, which so diligently obeyed the B. of Rome which crowned him.</hi> As though the bishop of Rome crowned him Emperour, to be his slaue and an Idolater, <hi>who left so many reliques at Aquisgraine and a little image of our Ladie with other Iewels</hi>: Paraduenture as truely as the image of Diana came to the Ephesians from Iupiter. <hi>Who caused the French men to conforme themselues in their Church song to the Romanes.</hi> But where finde you that hee caused them to conforme themselues in image worshipping to the Grecians? <hi>Finally a booke of such smal credit that neither the librarie whence it was taken, nor towne where it is printed, nor the man who printed it, is named.</hi> These be weightie reasons to discredit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke, as though it were necessarie that euery booke must come out of a librarie, some haue ben preserued in priuate stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, some haue beene closed vp in walles. The place and name of the printer is not expressed, for that it is like to haue bee printed, where it might not be suffered to be solde. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very stile argueth it is not forged in our time and I haue before it a testimony of Mattheus West-monasteriensis which was writen about 200. yeares agoe, that such a booke was written against that councell by Albinus or Alcuinus, and presented to the French King Carolus, whose name it beareth, not perhappes written by him, but by his commaundement and authority pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
               <p>After this he discourseth vpon Thomas of Aquines o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which holdeth that diuine honour which they cal <hi>datria,</hi> is due to the image of Christ, which if it be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, (saith maister Sander;) it is an errour in Phisophie, which to affirme is a most shamelesse absurditie. Last of all he concludeth against S. Thomas that a lesse degree of honour is dewe to images, then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paterne: affirming
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:14727:361" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church honoreth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image for his own sake, for no man is taught to beleeue in images, or to cal them his gods, or to do sacrifice to them. What say you M. Sander, who teacheth pilgrimage to images, doth not your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che? And how can they pray to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they do not beleeue in them? Who teacheth them to cal an image Christ, that is their lord and God, but euen you which defend images to be honoured by the names that they haue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things whereof they be images. Therefore when you call an y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Christ, you call it God, and Lord, sauiour, and redee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer. The image of the Trinitie, what call you it but the trinitie? Fie vppon this horrible idolatrie which is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with such a sleueles excuse, that you honour not the image for his owne sake, no more did the Gentiles their images. <q>Chrisostom in <hi>Homi.</hi> 18. <hi>in Ep. ad Eph.</hi> writeth thus of them, <hi>Cum illi dicimus quòd simulachru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adoret, non inquit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulacrum, sed Venerem sed Martem. Et cum rogamui quae est ista Venus? Qui grauiores inter eos sunt, respondent, voluptas. &amp; quis est Mars? Animus masculus &amp; vehemens.</hi> When we say vnto him that he worshippeth an image. No saith he, not the image but Venus or Mars. And when we aske, what is this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus? the grauer sort among them aunswere, pleasure. And who is Mars?</q> A manlike and valiant corage. Augustine in Psal. 96. which place I haue cited before sheweth that the Gentiles affirmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they worshipped not the images for their owne sake, but for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine powers which they did represent, euen the same which the Christians called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Papists are all one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles in their excuse, as they agree with them in Idolatrie, &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images.</p>

Then he will knowe, where we finde this saying in scriptures, or if it be not in the scripture of god, why we wil vse a sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Nice, which was but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mens Verily if we found not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of this sentence in Gods worde, we durst not auouch it to be true that was vttered by men, being applied to any point of doctrine. But we finde the same doctrine in the sixt of Ieremy, where the Lord saith, Stand in the wayes, and beholde, and aske for the olde way, which is the good way, and walke therein, and you shall finde rest for your soules. Nowe this saying of the councell of Nice, <hi>let olde customes preuaile,</hi> being the same in effect and meaning, though somewhat differing in sounde of wordes, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as the worde of God, and the holy scripture, which we do not restraine vnto the letters and sillables, but vnto the plaine and manifest sence and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them. The seconde quarrell he picketh to the placing of this sentence before the bishoppes sermon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is vttered by the Councell of Nice in a particuler case concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iurisdiction of the bishops of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria and Antioch, and therefore cannot serue for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sentence. For all olde customes (saith he) must not be preferred before new customes, example of washing of feete, &amp; abstaining from eating of bloud, which were olde customes. But if the councell meant, that olde cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes should preuaile against newe writinges, then all books of Luther &amp; such like are striken through which one foine. Wherefore hee concludeth that the councell meant, that olde customes shoulde preuaile, against the pretensed alledging of the verye scripture it selfe, and newe doctrine of men. And so this sentence doth at once ouerthrow all maister Iewels religion. But hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared this sentence to the text of scripture, by which the true meaning therof may appeare, I will not stand about this trifling cauils. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of antiquitie this it is.

Patriarches, Prophetes, and Apostles for the witnesses, and all learning, doctrine, and religion, which is vnder the age of these yeares, we reiect as newe, false, and diuelish. As for customes, ceremonies, and manners, which are subiect to mutation, we receiue them, or refuse them, as they be approuable or disprouable by the saide old aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Catholike doctrine. And bicause M. Rastel hath not only touched the sixt Canon of the Councell of Nice, where this sentence is written, but also charged M. Iewell with ouerthrowe of his religion thereby, I must let the reader vnderstand, that he suppresseth one point thereof, that vtterly ouerthroweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> piller of all Popish religion, &amp; that is, the Popes supremacie. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Canon maketh the Bishop of Alexandria, equall in iurisdiction to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome.

Bicause Arrius was such a proude heretique, that he despised all the interpretations of the auncient Fathers that were before his time, as Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Bishop of Alexandria writeth of him. Yea, he is not ashamed to say, that although the Fathers of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had scriptures against Arrius, yet their chiefe stay was not in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> scriptures, but in the receiued tradition. But this is a most impudent lye, for although the consent of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike writers of all ages, with the word of God, is not to be contemned, yet the only authoritie in determining of controuersies of faith, in all Councels, is and ought to be by the authoritie of the holy scriptures.

Rastel saith, the Bishop can not tell where of he speaketh. For whereas he affirmed, that S. Paule had appointed an order touching the ministration of the sacramentes vnto the Corinthians, M. Rastell will not simplie graunt that this order was appointed by God, although S. Paule him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self say, he receiued it of christ, which he deliuered to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this difference hee maketh. That an order giuen by God must be obserued without exception, and yet he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an exception of reuelation, and especial licence from God. But what so euer order S. Paule did giue, (he saith) is subiect vnto the Church, to remoue or pull vp, as it shall please her. Thus the blasphemous dog barketh against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of God. But I trust al sober Christian minds will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleue S. Paul then Rastel, who saith of such orders as were giuen by him. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.

And not to reforme any abuse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by reducing it to the first institution. This iudgement of M. Rastell is partly by him proued, by the authoritie of Theophylact, but chiefly it standeth vpon his owne authoritie, without further reason. Howbeit, it is manifest by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture, that
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:14727:364" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Paule reproued that mingling of prophane suppers, with the Lordes supper, appointing their priuate houses for their bodily refreshings of eating and drinking. Haue you not houses (saith he) to eate and drinke in? By which saying it is manifest, he would haue no eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church (as M. Rastell dreameth) but onely the eating and drinking of the Lordes supper. And therefore that abuse of mingling their bodily suppers, with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall supper of the Lorde whereof came so many abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and especiall the seuering and sundering of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation into diuers partes, which ought to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued altogether, he laboureth to reforme, by bringing it to the first institution of the Lord him selfe. But M. Rast. following his owne dreame, asketh what there was in the institution, for sitting together or a sunder: for eating at Church, or at home? Yes forsooth: Christe did institute his supper to be a foode of the soule, and not of the body, and therefore to be celebrated in the congregation, and in common, as the saluation is common, and not to bee mingled with prophane banquets of bellie cheare, for which priuat houses and companies are meet, and not the Church of God. And wheras M. Rastel chargeth M. Iewel with not vnderstanding this place which he alledgeth, namely (therefore when you come together to eate, tarie one for an other:) which he saith pertaineth no more to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of the sacrament, then a pot full of plumbs doth to the highway to London, he sheweth all his wit &amp; honestie at once. For he denyeth that any thing that Saint Paule there rehearseth, namely these wordes, take, eate, this is my body &amp;c. is the institution of the sacrament, or the originall paterne of reforming the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians disorder, bicause time, place, vesture, number of communicants, and such other accidentall and variable circumstànces, be not therein expressed. So that by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of the sacrament is not at all contained in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures, or else there is an other first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to reforme abuses by, then this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is set downe in the scriptures. I would maruel at these monstrous assertions,
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:14727:364"/>
but that I see, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obstinate Papists cannot otherwise defend their Popish Masse, except they denied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of the sacrament &amp; patterne of reformation, to be conteyned in the scriptures. But if it be granted (saith M. Rast.) whiche is to farre absurde, that S. Paule did reduce the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the first originall and institution, Why doe not rich men now bring meate to the Church, and receiue the sacrament after they haue filled their bellies? Forsooth because Christe instituted no such maner of suppers. And why (saith he) do you not washe one anothers feete, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a commandement so to do? But if this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be litterally to be vnderstanded, why doe you Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes breake it? If it be not, why do you require that of vs, which you confesse is not required, to be done of any? Humilitie is commaunded whereof our Sauiour Christe gaue vs example in that fact, &amp; that God graunt we may obserue: the outwarde ceremonie he commanded not to be obserued of any, but that which was signified thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whereas Maister Rastell compareth the receiuing of both kindes by the lay people, with that ceremonie of washing of feete, to make it seeme that the iustitution of Christ might be altered in the one, aswell as in the other, he declareth what reuerence or estimation he hath of the institution of Christe. For as that ceremonie of washing of feete is and may be altogether omitted (as he fantasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the authoritie of the Church) so not only one kind of the sacrament, but both kindes also may be likewise taken away, both from the people &amp; the priest, if it please the Churche of Rome. If he denie the conclusion, what hath he gayned by the argument of that example? Or what hath he proued against this our assertion, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to beleeued without the expresse worde of God conteined in the scriptures?</p>

Although it were easie to proue, that protestantes also haue planted some Churches in those newe founde landes, as in Gallia Antartica, but what follie were it to boast of that? How far and wide the Gospel is spread in Europe, he that is so blind that he will not see, who can make him acknowledge it? Euen Italy &amp; Spaine, haue yeelded great numbers of Martyrs &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors. Al other regions of Europe in a maner at this day haue either vtterly banished Papistry, or at lest by publik authoritie giuen libertie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel: as England, Ireland, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, France, Germanie, Denmark, Bohemia, Polonia, Hungaria, Suetia, Gothia, &amp;c. But M. R. seeing he cannot shewe his Popishe light abroade, he wil shewe it in corners of mens harts, because (as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth) there is neuer a citie, in which there is not some Papistes, and therefore he wil conclude, that the Gospel is not mightily and farre spread abroade. By which reason he may proue, that it neuer was; nor shall be mightily spread abroade; for euer there haue beene, and shalbe eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that will not imbrace it. Another reason he would seeme to bring of sixe diuers kindes of Gospellers, wheras
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:14727:365"/>
therere is but one Gospel, which is a fond &amp; malicious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, for I can bring more then 16. kinds of Papists, which differ in some opinions and ceremonies, wheras al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he can assigne amongst them that be truly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted professors of the Gospell, is either in one article of the sacrament, or else in outward rites and ceremonies, which cannot exclude any of them from the possession of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, so long as they al agree in the doctrine of eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

And whereas he saith we haue no one vndouted true iudge, teacher, or faith, because we read Luther, &amp; the Doctors old &amp; new w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudgement, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, because we builde not our faith vppon any one man, as they do vpon their proude Pope, but vpon Christ &amp; his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall word. I answer we haue a most certein faith grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the teaching of a most holie maister, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christ in his word, who is a most vndouted iudge, both for wisdome &amp; authoritie to determine all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies. Wheras the Papists building altogether vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, haue no vndouted iudge, teacher, or faith, not only because al men are liers &amp; vnconstant by corrupt nature, but also because they cannot agree among themselues, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope or the councel is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> superior iudge, teacher, or rule of faith. But M.

But we vtterly denie, that we haue receiued the Gospell from the Pope, but rather from the Greeke Churche, neither doe we acknowledge any fidelitie of the Pope in keeping of the Gospel, whome we accuse of shamefull corrupting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latine text therof, and as for burning of the Books, either he could not, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same being dispersed into so many copies, or he needed not, when he persuaded al men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Gospell
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:14727:366"/>
had none other sence, but that it pleased him to frame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Finally when Pope Leo the tenth accounted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel nothing else but a fable of Christe, whiche brought them so great honor and wealth, as who seeth not either how reuerently the Pope preserued the Gospell, or for what cause he kept it vndestroied. Finally M. Rastels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane iesting of riding post to heauen, declareth himselfe to be a right Papist, that is to say an Atheist, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a scorne of religion, and of the hope of the life to come, euen as the same Pope Leo saide at his death, that this one thing he should gayne by dying, that he shoulde be resolued concerning the question of the immortalitie of the soule. Wherein all the learned men in the worlde before could not satisfie him. Last of all what an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lyer Maister Rastell is, you may plainely perceiue, when he chargeth the Bishop with this confession: That these nine hundreth yeres and more, none did euer take this way which he doth follow. For although the Bishop made his chalenge of sixe hundreth yeares after Christe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet did he neuer confesse that in the nine hundreth yeres following; none did euer reteine or imbrace the Gospell whiche he teacheth, when God be praised, there was a number euen in the moste blindest times that sawe the light thereof, although they were fewe, and persecuted by Antichriste.</p>

To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same order y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was deliuered &amp; appointed by Christ, 3. and after practised by the Apostles, 4. and continued by the holy doctours and fathers, by the space of fiue or sixe hundreth yeares, throughout all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Churche of Christ, 5. without exception or anye sufficient example to be shewed to the contrarie. Al these Master Rast. saith be lyes, which is his short aunswere. And I coulde aunswere as shortly, that then they be lyes of Master Rastells forging. For the bishoppe affirmed no such thing of the ceremoniall forme of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of the doctrine thereof. But let vs see his answere at large.</p>
               <p>He woulde know how this Communion of ours doth agree with that, which Christ deliuered, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of Christ, beginning at the eating of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pascall Lambe, and the washing of his disciples feete, as though either of these perteined to the sacrament, and forsoothe we must tell him, how many thinges more, &amp; how many things lesse, our order in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion booke hath. And firste what scripture we haue for the linnen clothe: for the priestes standing on the North side of the table, for our prayers, confessions, collects, &amp; other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and seeing wee haue no scripture for these, the Communion is not restored to the order appointed by Christ. I aunswere, that forasmuch as those matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to order and decencie, we haue scripture sufficient to authorize them, although as I saide before, the bishop speaketh not of the ceremoniall forme of ministration, but of the substaunce and doctrine, which is the essential forme of the Communion: concerning which we haue neyther more nor lesse, then Christ vsed and deliuered.</p>
               <p>Yet (saith Master Rast.) we haue many pointes lesse then was done by Christ at his last supper. First he will not presse vs with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> question, why we do not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate after supper, which peraduenture yet some doth with the sicke, as a thing not vnlawfull, nor tyed to any time, but by the generall rule of order and decencie: but he demandeth, why we take not the bread into our handes,
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:14727:367"/>
before we consecrate it, as Christ did? A profounde que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. As though we doe not both take it, breake it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, and deliuer it with our handes, as Christ did. Or as though Christ appointed at what moment we should touch it, or that M. Rastel is able to say, that Christ spake nothing of his institution before he touched the breade: or as though we did not vse ordinarily before we make the exhortation vnto the Communion, to take the bread and breake it, and with the cup to set it before vs, &amp; not to let it stand at the ende of the table, as he belyeth vs, as though we wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ashamed to folow Christ.</p>
               <p>The seconde thing that we haue lesse then Christ did (as he saith) is blessinge of the breade, which is vtterly false, for we blesse it as Christ did, not with the signe of the crosse as ye would haue vs, but with thanksgiuinge and prayer, as the Euangelistes doe testifie that Christe did, and as the primitiue and Apostolike Church did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. <q>And therefore Iustinus marty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishement for which thankes is giuen by the worde of prayer, receiued of him.</q> And touching the reuerende ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures vsed by Christ at his supper, as we doubt nothing, but that he vsed them alwayes, so can M. Rastell with all his prating prooue none other, then the Euangelists haue set downe. And therefore for his loking on the bread, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating it from the rest of the bread on the table, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it by some special signe, as the signe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, &amp;c. when he can prooue out of the scriptures, we shall bee content to refourme our Communion accordinge to those supposed gestures. In the meane time, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ruffian like raylinge, our order of celebration, hath all things instituted and deliuered by Christ, to be obserued in the reuerent ministration of this most holy sacrament.</p>
               <p>The seconde lye he chargeth Master Iewell with all is, that he saith we haue the same order, that was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

practised by them. For Actes the 2. we read (saith he) that they did breake breade in houses. And yet it may be doubted whether that was the communion, and actes 13. saith he when the Apostles had fasted and sacrificed, they sent forth Paule and Barnabas. But where finde you that translation, Master Rastell, that they sacrificed? will you now forsake your owne Latine translation? <hi>Ministranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus illis Domino,</hi> when they ministred vnto the Lorde, and so wilfully runne into the curse of the Tridentine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell? or will you appeale to the Greeke text <gap reason="foreign">

Well, then I see that papists iangle of general councels and catholike interpretations vnto other, but they themselues will be holden of none, anye longer then they liste. But to the matter, he saith that S. Paule 1. Cor. 11. testifieth of the veritie of the sacrament, but not of the order, referringe that to his owne comming. As though he doeth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly reforme a disorder, or as though other thinges which he saith he woulde set in order at his comminge. could be taken for the same thinges that he wrote of in his Epistle. But what of al this? we obserue the same essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall order that the Apostles practised by Christs institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which S. Paule in that place reduced, &amp; otherwise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishop neither said nor ment, therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foule lyes come onely out of M.

First he bringeth in Iustine, Athanasius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill, and Agustine, to shewe that they vsed to praye to the East, as though that were anye parte of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>And he will know of vs wherefore we appoint the priest to stand on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Northside.

Namely to auoide the superstition of the Iewes, that prayed towarde the West, as we doe to auoid the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of the papistes that vse to pray toward the East, otherwise all quarters of heauen, of their own nature, are indifferent for vs, to turne our selues vnto in our praiers, either publike or priuate.</p>
               <p>The seconde exception is, of mingling of water with the wine, which is also a pointe nothinge materiall, as their owne schoole doctours doe confesse, the vsage of this he prooueth by a counterfett decree of Alexander bishoppe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But all his reasoninge is for wine, and not for water, against water alone, and not against wine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the vse of water being not of Christes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as many other thinges practised of the fathers at the first as indifferent, or profitable ceremonies, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne after with superstition and opinion of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, our Churche hath done verie well to curse them of, and leaue nothinge but the pure institution of Christ.</p>
               <p>The third exception is of the signe of the crosse, which he saith, ought to be vsed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he proueth by the counterfet liturgies ascribed to S.

action, which they did, to shewe themselues to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> against the Heathens. Likewise he citeth the sayings of Chrisostome and Augustine, to proue that they vsed the signe of the crosse at the celebration of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is not denyed, yet cannot he proue, that the vse of that signe is necessarie to the ministration: and the first that we reade of, that had it in estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian heretikes Ireneus <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. By fond emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whome, the Catholikes also began to vsurpe the same signe. Therefore our communion which lacketh that signe, lacketh nothing that is either necessary or pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable, or (considering the abuse of it) meete to be retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>The fourth exception is of Altars, which we haue not, neither in deed had the primitiue church, but tables made of bords, which although they called altars, as they did also cal them tables, yet were they neither in forme, nor matter like those which the Papists haue, as I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large in the aunswere to M. Hesk. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 31. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I remit the reader. As for maister Rastels proofe out of that saying of the Apostle to the Hebrues: we haue an Aultar of which they may not eate, which communicate with Idols: declareth what a wel exercised man in the scriptures he is for neither be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of the apostle Heb. 12. as he doth falsifie them, neither doth he speake of any materiall altar, but of our spirituall Altar Christ. The words be these we haue an Aultar of which it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eat, which serue in the tabernacle. His next proofe is for hallowing of aultars, and oyle, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priests blessing, out of the prouinciall councel of Agatha, which he citeth Cap. 14. in steede of 10. which was a new decree made by 35. Bishoppes in Fraunce, almost fiue hundreth yeares after. Christe, and therefore not Catholike, either for time or place. The saying of Opratus which he citeth last, you shal finde at large in the aunswere vnto Hesknis before named.</p>
               <p>The fifth exception is of incense, which hee proueth by a prayer of the counterfet masse of S. Iames, which yet
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:14727:369"/>
may be otherwise taken figuratiuely. Also by a saying of Dennys, who was not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church fiue hundreth yeres after Christ for a writer, neither of Eusebius, Iero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, nor Gennadius. <q>

                  </gap> he meaneth nothing else but prayers, which are figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, both in the psalmes &amp; in the reuelation called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense or sacrifice. Wherefore popish sensing is not of such antiquitie as he pretendeth.</p>
               <p>The sixt exception is of lightes and tapers, vsed in the primitiue Church, which is false, except it were in the night season, to giue them light. For profes he citeth a counterfet sermon of Augustine <hi>de tempore,</hi> which for all that speaketh but of oyle &amp; wax for the vse of the night. Neither is the verse of Paulinus otherwise to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, <hi>Of the Aultars bright, that were rounde ydight, with lampes thicke set and light.</hi> 
                  <q>Finally where he citeth Hierom against Vigilantius, excusing the superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that lighted candles at day time, partly by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, partely by the example of the East Churches, which onely at the reading of the gospell vsed to light their candels in signe of ioye, you shall see by his owne wordes in the same place, that neither it was the custome of the latine church to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Quod si aliqui propter imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam vel simplicitatem saecularium hominum, vel certe religiosarum faeminarum de quibus verè dicere possumus, confiteor zelum Dei habens sed non secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dum scientiam, hoc pro honore martyrum faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, quid inde perdis</hi>? We do not light wax ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dels in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brod day light as thou dost slander vs in vaine, but that we may temper the darknesse of the night with this comforte, &amp; may watch by a light, least we should sleepe with thee in the darke like blinde men. And if any lay men, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:14727:369"/>
deuout we men, through ignorance or simplicitye doe so for the honour of the Martyrs, of whome we may truly say: I confesse they haue a zeale but not according to knowledge, what leesest thou thereby? By these words you may see howe this custome came vp, namelye of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and ignorance, by Hieromes owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, although hee was more readie to excuse it, then to reforme it, as his duetie had beene.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After some rayling against our grosse, vnreasonable, and vnnaturall heresies (as he calleth them,) hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to two other exceptions, the one of prayers made to saintes, vsed at the communion, the other of prayer for the deade. For proofe of the first, hee citeth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies falsely intituled to Basill and Chrisostom, which the worlde knoweth are of a much later stampe, the one being vnknowen to Gregorie Nazianzen, that wrote Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils life, and commended his actes, the other praying for Pope Nicholas and the Emperour Alexius, whiche were sixe hundreth yeares after Chrisostome was deade.</p>
               <p>After these he citeth the authorities of Chrisostome &amp; Augustine, that mention was made of the saintes and martires at the celebration of the communion in their time, which wee confesse, and so there is in our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, but no prayer was in their time offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, more then is nowe: as euen that place of Augustine which hee citeth, sufficiently doth proue. <hi>De ciuit dei lib.</hi> 22. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. although he cite it falsely and by patches. <q>
                     <hi>Suo loco &amp; ordine nominantur, non tamen à sacerdote qui sacrificat inuocantur</hi>? they are named in their order and place, yet are they not called vppon by the priest that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth: &amp; what can be more plaine against inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of saintes, then this testimonie of Augustine?</q> But hee citeth another place of Augustine, <hi>Contra Faust. Manich. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, where hee saith, the Christians did solemnelye frequent the memories of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, both to stirre vp themselues to a following of them,
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:14727:370"/>
and also to be made companions of their merites, and to be helped by their prayers. <q>This was Augustines iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in deede, but yet in the same place, he denyeth that any Aultars were set vp vnto them, or that any prayers were euer offered vnto them. <hi>Quis enim Antistitum &amp;c.</hi> for what bishoppe standing at the aultar in the places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Martyrs, euer saide? We offer vnto thee O Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Paule, or Cyprian.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for prayer for the deade, wee confesse it was vsed at the communion in the time of Chrisostome and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, but not as any part of the communion, or as the institution of Christ, or the practise of the Church for two hundreth yeares after Christ, but onely as a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious errour, crept into the Church and not espied, while the fathers were busily occupied in fighting against mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>struous heresies of greater importance. Wherefore these exceptions notwithstanding, our celebration of the Communion hath the whole institution of Christe, the practise of the Apostles, and the obseruation of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church for fiue or sixe hundreth yeares, so farre as it agreeth with the saide institution and practise, which was in all substantiall and essentiall partes, although the later age had added diuers superfluous and superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vsages: and otherwise we boast not of the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our ministration, with the auncient obseruaton, as maister Rastel, like a malicious cauiller, doth charge the Bishop, I cannot say whether more lewdely then fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly.</p>

But (saith Maister Rastell) in the seuenteene Canon of that Councel, strange women are forbidden to dwel with the Cleargie, whereas nowe (saith he) they doe not onely receiue them to their seruantes, but also to their bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. And I pray you syr, haue not some Popish Priestes such seruants and bedfellowes also? Of seruants he will not deny, but bedfellowes if they haue, hee will say they haue them not as wiues, but as Concubines: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it is better to haue Concubines then wiues. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, the Canon which forbiddeth straunge women, forbiddeth not their wiues, as it is most manifest, nor yet their sonnes wiues, to dwell with any of the Cleargie, wherby you see he is taken tardie in his owne trip. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he neuer read the Councel, or else he is a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent reporter of that he readeth: As for the 27.

                     <hi>Vt in sacramentis corporis &amp; sanguinis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, nihil amplius offeratur quàm ipse Dominus tradidit, hóc est panis &amp; vinum, aqua mixtum. Nec amplius in sacrificijs offeratur quàm de vuis &amp; frumentis.</hi> That in the sacramentes of the body and bloud of our Lorde, nothing more be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered then our Lord himselfe deliuered, that is, bread and wine mixed with water. And let nothing more be offered in the sacrifices, but that which commeth of grapes and of corne. This last clause then excludeth water as any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie part.</q> But yet he will presse vs with the 36. Can which forbiddeth a Priest to consecrate the Chrisme, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate virgins. And we (as he saith) haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away oyle, consecration, and virgines. In deed in such matters of ceremonies and externall discipline, we do not deny, but that we varie from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vpon good grounds: otherwise we are not bound to the determination of any Councels, but as they agree with Gods word.

Papistes glorie, that al their doctrine, ceremonies, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, are of Catholike or vniuersall antiquitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, wee may iustly presse them, with euery Canon of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny auncient Councell, which they affirme can not erre. <q>Namely with the 26. Can. of this present Councel, which forbiddeth, that the Bishop of Rome or any other Bishop of any principal See, should be called Princes of the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, or the highest Priest, or by any like title: but only, the Bishop of the principall See.</q> I might alledge many other Canons, wherein order is taken for the modest behauiour of the sonnes and daughters of Bishops, which proueth their mariages lawful, but for shortnes I passe them ouer. Another abuse the Bishop noteth, that in the time of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, and Cyprians time, the people tooke the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment home with them. This M. Rast. denieth to haue ben an abuse, &amp; here he craketh of his equalitie with M. Iewel (howe wisely let other iudge) that his nay is as good as the Bishops yee.

                  </note>The Bishop alledged the example of a woman out of Cyprian, which opening her chest with vnworthie handes, in which was the holy thing of the Lord, by fire breaking out, she was terrified that she durst not touch it. This mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (saith M.

But why may it not serue to proue both, seeing Christe gaue not his sacrament to be locked vp in Chestes, but to be receiued? Take, eate (saith he:) but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the breach of Christes commandment, nor of the end of his institution can persuade M.

And there is no colour in the world to make vs thinke, that they caryed not as wel of the sanctified wine, as of the sanctified bread, home to their houses. But it is a sport to see, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would proue it to be the body of Christ, by the fire that came out of the chest. The same Cyprian sheweth an other miracle of an vnworthie receiuer, in whose hand the sacrament was turned into ashes, will hee say the body of Christ was turned into ashes also? But to be short, he would knowe what Doctour or Councell we can shew, to proue this carying home of the sacrament to be an abuse.

Finally, if it bee no abuse, why do not the Papistes suffer it to be done?</q> specially of their Popish brethren whome they take to liue in persecution, vnder princes that professe the Gospell of Christ.</p>
               <p>An other abuse the Bishop rehearseth within Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and Saint Augustines time, the Communion was giuen to young babes, contrarie to the commaundement of the holy Ghoste. Let a man examine him selfe, and so let him eat &amp;c. whereas infantes are not able to examine them selues. This will not Maister Rastell acknowledge to be an abuse, neither that, a reason of the abolishing thereof, but onely the bare authoritie of the Church, which belike hath abolished a good custome. But hee faith, infants might as well communicate as be baptized, wherein hee playeth the Anabaptist, requiring instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Againe he saith, they may as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the faith of the Church, as they may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the faith of their Godfathers. But I answere, they are baptized in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith which their Godfathers confesse, &amp; not in that faith which they beleue, for perhaps they may be hypocrites, and so voyde of faith, or heretiques, and holde a false faith. But seeing Christ said, Drinke ye all of this, he will knowe why infants may not also drinke, and if they may not drinke, then by all, are meant none, but al that were present, that is, all Priests. But I answere, drinke ye all of this, is saide to all them, to whome, take ye, eat ye, &amp;c. is saide, that is, to all that are able to vnderstande the mysterie, or else none might take and eate, but all Priestes, bicause onely Priestes (as they say) were present, which yet they are not able to proue.

                  </note> as that some hang it before their brest for a protection, some take the sacrament for a purgation against slander, S. Benet ministred the communion to a woman that was dead. M. Rastell confesseth the sacrament may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Coniurers and other, but he will not graunt that S. Benet did amisse, because he was a Saint, as though Saintes could not do amisse. And he counteth it no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, against S. Benets fact, that Christ gaue not the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to dead folke, for that he saith is no reason: because Christ forbad no communion, that three be not present, neither badde the chalice to be filled when all is supped vp, nor bad vs kneele and say, we do not presume to come to this thy table, nor carrie home the cantels of bread that are left. But notwithstanding his fonde quarrelling whatsoeuer apperteineth to the decent and reuerent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the communion, Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, though not euerie particular thing by name. And Maister Rastell sheweth himselfe to be an ignoraunt Asse, that compareth substances and accidentes, the essential causes &amp; variable circumstances together, whereas the one must haue the expresse worde of God, or else it can haue no being, the other for the manner of the being, hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules to order it by, but no particulars expressed.</p>
               <p>But Maister Rastell, will not condemne the fact of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, because Saint Augustine dare not condemne the fact of those virgins that drowned themselues contrarie to the commandement, Thou shalt not kil, because they might haue an extraordinarie spirite, as Sampson had, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause S. Ambrose commendeth the fact of his brother Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus, one that was not baptised, and therefore might not receiue the sacrament, which hanged it about his necke in a tempest and escaped.

But before he answere the Bishops obiections, he wil make no lesse then fiue obiections him selfe against him, out of the same place of Saint Paule, wherein he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Why all the Psalter of Dauid is read in the English Church, when all the Psalmes be not vnderstoode of all English men? Forsooth syr there is no Psalme, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be vnderstoode of euerie Englishe man that hath capacitie of vnderstanding, and the rest, that they may learne to vnderstand them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How many people be there that vnderstand not the easiest Chapter of the Gospell, muche lesse the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:14727:374"/>
and Psalmes? But sir they are often read that they may the better be vnderstoode, or at least so much of them, as is necessarie for them to knowe for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Where singing is vsed, howe can they vnderstande any thing? Such singing as taketh away vnderstanding is forbidden in our Church, both by the booke and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction.</p>
               <p n="4">4 How can a thousand people vnderstande him that hath a small voice, or Cornishe men, or Northerne men, a fine Londoners speech? &amp;c. The Bishop should haue care to prouide a man, as well for voyce, as for other qualities, able to edifie the people, and suche nations of the Queens obedience as vnderstande not the English tongue, haue their prayers in their owne tongue, whiche he saith, he had forgotten, I thinke he saith as it is, for a lyer should haue a good remembraunce.</p>
               <p n="5">5 He saith we haue one Chapter for the better learned of the Parishe, another for the poorer, which is a flam fiue of his owne deuising. Yet he saith, there would be no end of confusion, if nothing should be read in the congregation, but that which should be vnderstoode of all that are present: as though he were wiser then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoste, which in expresse wordes hath so commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that al may learne, that all may be comforted, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the congregation, not a man of a straunge language comming in chaunceably or curiously, beeing none of that flocke.</p>
               <p>But what answere hath he to Saint Paule? euen a most shamefull shifte and impudent lie. Namely, that Saint Paule speaketh onely of preaching, which he graunteth must be in the vulgar tongue, and the Gospell and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle he could be content should be also, if it pleased the Popes holinesse. But Saint Paule nameth expressely, not onely preaching, but also praying, giuing of thankes, and singing of Psalmes or Hymnes. But he obiecteth that Saint Paule saith, he that speaketh with tongues edifieth himselfe, and he that giueth thankes in
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:14727:374"/>
a strange tongue, doeth giue thankes well: It is true, if his prayer and speeche be godly and priuate, but in the congregation, the Apostle by no meanes alloweth any man to vse a strange tongue. Yes saith M. Rast. if there be an interpreter. In deede S. Paule speaketh of them which had a miraculous gifte of strange tongues, which might be vsed to set forth Gods glorie, so that there were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, that the Churche might be profited, otherwise he would haue Gods gift to be silent in the Churche. To be short, M. Rast. affirmeth preaching it selfe to be so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie, that pictures may not onely supplye the wante thereof, but also are necessarie for the faithfull people, and more profitable then a most eloquent and learned sermon of M.

Christ in heauen, or of worshipping and adoring, that is, reuerently handling and honouring of the mysteries of Christ, and no more of this sacrament, then of the other, namely baptisme.

Maister Rastel is angrie, that three hundreth yeares should be counted a little while agoe, when it is not three score yeares since Luther sprang vp. But if Luther haue taught any doctrine that was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the Church a thousand and fiue hundreth yeares ago, we are content it be accounted newe, but whatsoeuer may be proued to haue bene taught 1500. yeares agoe, must needes be old, though Luther be newe, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that age. Honorius and Vrbanus are but yong children. But remitting the antiquitie, Maister Rastell will stande for the veritie; bicause the Popes lacked no

counsell. Neither by your doctrine needed they any. 2. The Vniuersities were not without great schollers. Such as those blinde and hereticall times affoorded. 3. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houses and orders were not destroyed. Yea, they swarmed with Locustes to maintaine the kingdome of Absaddon. 4. The holy Ghost in true Catholikes was inuincible. Yea, but there were fewe true Catholikes in those days. 5. The wicked spirit in heretiques would haue bene venterous. Yea, the Pope, the Archheretique of the world was venterous ynough, when he set vp such ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. 6. A good man with the daunger of his life, would haue spoken the trueth. So did many good men, which cost them their liues. 7. An heretique for fame would not haue passed vpon death: what neede an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique feare death, when heresie was so generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the true Catholikes were condemned and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for heretiques, by the name of Albigenses, Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Pauperes de Lugduno, and such like, which from time to time were persecuted, imprisoned, and burned, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing and disalowing such idolatrie, and false worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>These be the worshipfull reasons he hath to proue the veritie of this bread worship, which after he hath dilated more at large, hee commeth at length to admiration of the seruice of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day, made by Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas, which hee thinkeh to be so excellent, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sound and sense of the Anthemnes, Respondes, and Versicles, declare whence they proceeded. And I am of the same opinion, for the comparing of such thinges to the sacrament, as pertaine nothing vnto it, declareth, that such comparison came from the spirit of man, &amp; not from the spirite of God.

                  </note>The Bishop saide, that for the space of twelue hundreth yeares after Christ, this worshipping of the sacrament was neuer knowne nor practised in any place. M. Rastel after his courteous manner saith, he lyeth, for he hath alledged S. Ambrose and S. Augustine before, to proue that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is to be worshipped: and now citeth Therdoret, Euthymius, Emissenus, Iames, Basil, and Chrisostome in their Liturgies for the same purpose. But the aunswere is easie to be made, none of all these speake of that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or adoration of the sacrament which Pope Honorius commaunded, but of honouring, reuerencing, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or adoring of the sacrament as diuine mysteries, which honouring, worshipping, or adoring, we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be due to the blessed sacramentes, not onely to the Lordes supper, but also to the sacrament of baptisme. For none of all these writers beleeued the carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christe in the sacrament, which the Papistes hold. Saint Augustine denyeth the sacrament to be that body which was crucified, <hi>in Psal.</hi> 98. Saint Ambrose calleth the sacrament the figure of the body and bloud of Christe. <hi>De sacra. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Theodorete (whose saying hee citeth) being flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst transubstantiation, as you may read more at large in mine aunswere to Heskins <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 56. calleth in the same Dialogue the sacrament, the tokens or signes of the body of Christe. And in his first Dialogue, he saith: The tokens which are seene, hee hath honoured with the name of his body and bloud, not chaunging their nature, but adding grace to their nature. His discourse at large is set downe in mine answer to Hes. <hi>li.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 52.

               <p>The very wordes of Emissenus which M. Rastel ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:14727:380"/>
expresse his minde to be of a spirituall presence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde with thy faith, saith he, honour and wonder at the holie bodie and bloud of Christ. The very name of the gift which is vsed in the liturgie falsely ascribed to Saint Iames, declareth that the Author of that liturgie did not beleue it to be the naturall bodie of Christe, but a gifte or token in remembraunce thereof. The prayer whiche is made in those liturgies falsely ascribed to Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and Basil, at the lifting of the sacrament, proueth that they did not beleeue the bread to be chaunged into the bodie of Christ, after the wordes of consecration. For then they would not haue prayed, that God would giue to them the bodie and bloud of his sonne, and by them to the people, if they had them present before. And whereas they all cried, <hi>Sancta sanctis,</hi> holy thinges belong to holie men, it was not to call the people to worshippe the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they lifted a little, but not ouer their heades to be seene, but to charge them that were not baptised to departe, and to prepare the rest to the worthie receiuing of the sacrament. Maister Rastell so great a Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus and Aristotle of Logike, neuerthelesse vseth these argumentes to proue adoration. But leauing these, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth if any within that compasse of 1200. yeares beleeued the sacrament to be the very bodie of Christ: and if that be graunted, whether the very bodie and bloud of Christ be not to be worshipped, and then bringeth in Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scen, and Lanfrancus. Of the former it may be doubted, but very grossely he writeth, the other was an enimie of Berengarius, 200. yeares before Honorius the Author of this adoration. I answere breefely, although the carnall presence was receiued two or three hundreth yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pope Honorius, yet there can no adoration be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for at this day the Lutheranes admitte the carnall presence, yet they abhorre adoration, saying the very bodie of Christe is present to be eaten, but not to be worshipped.</p>

                  </note>The Bishop sayde, that the schoolemen perceiuing the daunger of idolatrie that was vnto the ignorant people, in worshipping the cake if it were not consecrated, gaue warning to the people to worship it vnder this condition, if it were consecrated. M. Ra. like a Doctor determiner, cutteth of al the reasons of the schoolemen, and saith they were not the best learned, that so decide the controuersie. For there is no daunger at all vnto the people, so long as their intent is to worship God and the bodie of Christ. Example also he bringeth, that if a man honour him which is not his father, in steede of his father, because all the parishe saith he is his father, he doeth not amisse. In deede, if that man doe the duetie of a father to his supposed sonne, I thinke the errour is not greatly hurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him that honoureth him as his Father. Agayne sayeth Maister Rastell, suppose that one were so like thine owne Father (whiche is possible ynough) that it could not be discerned, whiche of the two were thy true father, thou werest not to be blamed, if thou honour the one in steede of the other. I aunswere, suppose it were so, which is vnlikely ynough, I would thinke he were an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised child, which would not inquire which of the two were his true father, before he chose to honour either of them. But Maister Rastel asketh, if he should honour no father, because he could not discerne the one from the other. And I likewise aske him whether hee should honour two men for his father, or two fathers in steede of one, because he knoweth nor which is his right Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Finally, I would aske suche a not profound learned Maister of Arte, as Rastel is, but such a simple fellowe as Maister Rastell talketh withall in this discourse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an vnconsecrated cake bee as like the bodie of Christe, as one man may be to an other? I weene he would say no. But then M. Rastel would take the tale
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:14727:381"/>
out of his mouth, and reply that an vnconsecrated cake, and a consecrated, be as like as any two men can be. But then I would aske him, whether any thing wherein they may be counted like, is either the thing or the cause, or the signe and marke of the thing that is worshipped? If not, his two cases are as like to these of the sacrament, as an aple is like to an oyster.</p>

                  </note> that the Bishop should ascribe that opinion to Dunce and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande, which is not theirs, but proper to Thomas of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine, against which they reason. But for al his impudent &amp; shamelesse rayling &amp; charging the Bishop with lying, it is Rastel himselfe which is the lyer and the slaunderer, for that whiche the Bishoppe speaketh generally of the schoolemen, he draweth maliciously vnto Dunce and Durande. Thomas holdeth that transubstantiation is necessarie, or else the Churche should committe idolatrie in falling downe before bread. Dunce holdeth that if there were no transubstantiation graunted, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence might well stande, and the adoration to, as Maister Rastel saith, but he taketh parte with Thomas.

               <p>To the saying of Augustine <hi>In sermo ad Infantes,</hi> That whiche you see on the table is breade, Maister Rastel sayeth, it is a reason of Tinkers, Taylers, and Coblers, (O learned Clearke) and not of learned Schollers, to say it is bread, because it is called bread. But learned Maister Rastel, Saint Augustine doeth not say it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led breade, but he saith it is bread, and moreouer he maketh their senses Iudges thereof, <hi>Quid-etiam oculi
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:14727:382"/>
vestri renunciant.</hi> Which also your eyes do tell you. And that your learned penne hath set downe out of Prosper, which is not to be found in Augustines workes, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it nothing against the remayning of bread, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, that vnder the visible kindes of breade and wine, we honour the bodie and bloud of Christ.</p>
               <p>To the saying of Gelasius, that the substance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread and wine doth not ceasse to be, he aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that Gelasius doth expound him selfe straight after, where he saith: But they remaine in the propertie of their nature, as though nothing remained, but whitensse, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c. O impudent falsifier. Is substance and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature all one? Againe I aske what are they that remaine in their propertie of nature, but the breade and wine? Finally the very argument whiche he vseth against Eutiches most plainely confuteth Rastell, for a moste shamefull and shamelesse peruerter of this Doctours meaning, for he concludeth, that as the substance of bread &amp; wine remaine in the sacrament, so the bodie in Christ, after the assumption of the Diuine nature.</p>
               <p>The like beastly racking he vseth of the wordes of Theodoret, which vseth the same argument against the Eutichians.</p>
               <p>But in the end he saith, it must not be considered what one or two haue saide, but what the whole consent of the Church is, and if it were graunted that Gelasius and Theodoret denied transubstantiation, yet they graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the carnall presence, it were a small matter, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all against the Catholikes, which hold of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell of Laterane. What say you learned M. Rastel: is it not to be regarded, nor maketh it any thing against you, what Gelasius the Bishop of Rome hath written, whiche you holde can not erre? But where he sayeth, that they bothe graunt the carnall presence, I must sende the Reader to mine aunswere vnto the 60. Chapter of the 3. booke of Hesk. Parlea. for Gelasius, and to the 52. and 56. chapters of the same booke, for The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret. How vnlearnedly he affirmeth Cyprians errour

And to say the trueth, if the papistes coulde be content with such modest termes as the scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that the bodie of Christ is receiued of the faithfull in the sacrament after a wonderfull and mysticall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there needed neither these fond questions, nor any so bitter contention about the sacrament of vnitie. But that they will make an idoll of the Lords supper, and a bayte to satisfie their ambition, couetousnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; licentiousnesse, by the sale of their masses, &amp; applying of their merites: these grosse and monstrous absurdities had neuer beene defended. The contentions of the schoole doctours he forceth not vpon, so long as the Church agreeth. But can your church agree (M. Rast.) when the doctours thereof dissent? If any difference of opinion be betweene Luther and Zuinglius, you crye out of our dissention.

                  </note> the Sunne and the Moone, therefore the Pope is so much aboue the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as the Sunne is aboue the Moone, Maister Rastell being angrie at this discouery, saith it is no mystery nor argument of strength, yet was it vsed by the Popes holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which cannot erre. But the Church hath stronger arguments for proofe of this conclusion. First saith Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Rastell that there be two states, spirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perall it is proued by other reasons, and the first reason he vseth to proue the state spirituall, is much like that of the Popes whiche hee excuseth, Psal. 44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and In steede of thy fathers there are sonnes borne vnto thee (meaning saith he the Apostles, and bishopps, and their successours) them shalt thou appoint princes, and rulers ouer all the whole earth. As though none were the sonnes of the Church, but the Apostles, Bishoppes, and their successors, and as though the Prophete spake of temperall rule in this life, and not of a spiritual kingdome and inheritance
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:14727:385"/>
of all the worlde, which is common to all the faithfull after this life.</p>
               <p>But to omitte that which is not in controuersie of two states in the worlde, and the excellencye in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thinges, of the ministery of the Churche aboue the office of princes, yet who will either graunt that the ministery is simply superiour to the King or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour so that the ministers are not his subiectes, or that the Pope in any respect ought to haue any dignitie as a minister of the gospell, whiche hee disdaineth to preach?</p>
               <p>Another defence of this pontificall argument, is, that it was a sweete and misticall allusion in his familiare letters to the Emperour: In deede greate familyaritie hee had with the Emperours of his time, with whome hee was in continuall discorde. Last of all like a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dogge hee compareth it with the argument vsed by S. Paule for the couering of womens heades, taken of nature it selfe, whiche though it will not satisfie a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious person whome nothing will satisfie, yet is it sufficient and stronge ynough to proue what naturall comlynesse requireth in that case, where as this of the Pope hath no shadowe of reason in it. For all the rest of those argumentes rehearsed by the Bishop, he maketh that generall reason, that their Church hath no custome to contende for them, yet haue they a custome to burne men for refusing such thinges, as they are not able to contende in argument to defende. And as for shauen crownes, and purple sandales, holy water, or praying in one tongue, hee sayeth, they were neuer taken for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat mysteries in the Church, and if the scriptures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to them do not proue them, they take no harme, for by like they are good ynough without the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Sauing that the saying of Ezechiell Chap. 36. I will sprinkle you with cleane water, hee seeth not, but that it may bee applyed to holy water, though it bee meant of baptisme, because holy water putteth vs in mynde of our baptisme. Where fynde you that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:14727:385"/>
of holy water in all the exorcising or coniuring thereof? A poore shift God wott to defende a begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonie.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ecce duo gladij hic,</hi> to prooue that the Pope hath power of both swordes, hee defendeth it to bee good and sufficient. Firste, because Christe had power of both, although hee vsed but one. But what hath the Pope to doe with Christe? Forsooth hee made Peter his lieutenaunt and ruler of all Christians, when hee had him feede his sheepe and lambes, Euen as good a reason as <hi>Ecce duo gladij hic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what hath the Pope to doe with Peter, if Peter had beene such a one? Forsooth, because hee sitteth at Rome. So did Nero, and was <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> to as good as the Pope. But Barnarde vseth the same texte so. What if Barnarde was disposed to iest with the Pope in his owne interpretations? or if hee were in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, can Barnarde make that good which is starke naught?</p>
               <p>Last of all, the shamelesse and blasphemous beast, is not afrayde to compare this argument with the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vsed by the holie Ghoste, Gal. 4. of the two wiues in Abrahams house, that were figures of two Testaments, which the Apostle vsed not to proue, but to declare and shewe plainly, as it were by example, that which hee had before moste substantially proued.</p>

               <p>Whereas the Bishop proueth the priuate Masse to be contrarie to the institution of Christe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulk</hi>
                  </note> which ordeined a communion. First M. Rastell will not vnderstand what is meant by this word, priuate Masse, for al Masses (he saith) are common, which if it be true, to vse his own examples of an open houshold and a common of pasture, they be fooles that will pay any money for them. Afterward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding a priuate Masse to be when no man receiueth with the Priest, he asketh whether the Masse saide on Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster day be good, bicause there be a number of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, or whether any other Masse be good, at which be many y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest? I answer him, those Masses in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> point are lesse euil then the priuate Masses, in which there is no communion, bicause they erre not in that one point, although they are abhominable in many other. But now let vs heare how M. Rast. looketh the Doctours in the faces, which were cited by the Bishop against pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse, as he promiseth to doe. First to Clemens and Dionysius he aunswereth nothing, but cauilleth at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops manner of citing them, not for writings of such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie as they are said to be, but yet sufficient to choake the Papistes which boast of their authoritie. And trifleth of the oyle, salt, singing, and in Dionysius which ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as we haue not in our Church, no more haue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes in such order as he rehearseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To Iustine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he aunswereth nothing, but cauilleth of the water vsed to be mixed with the wine in his time, which was no ceremonie, but a custome of sobrietie: and of sending the communion to them that were absent, which we vsed not, neither is he able to proue that they vsed to send it, as the communion, but as almes rather, of the great plentie of breade and wine that was accustomed to be offred. And if it were proued to bee the communion, it maketh more
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:14727:387"/>
strongly against the priuate Masse, that they would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none that were absent not to communicate, much lesse would they suffer them which were present, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with the minister. The sayings of Ambrose, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Augustine, Leo, he passeth ouer with confession, that the people in their dayes vsed to receiue with the Priest commonly, but hee denyeth they did so alway. Which hee weeneth to proue, by that Chrysostome saith, they did offer daily, and Ambrose saith, that in Greece they were accustomed to receiue but once a yeare. And he thinketh it were absurde, that there should be but one Communion in a yeare in Greece. But hee is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for Saint Chrysostome as he confesseth, speaketh of often receiuing, <hi>ad Ephe. Hom.</hi> 3. and would haue all that receiued not to depart, euen as the Canons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Gregorie in his Dialogues doe shewe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of the people were negligent in comming to the Lordes table, yet was there no priuate Masse, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in those great Churches, there were always a great number of the Clergie, which receiued with the Bishop, vpon paine of excommunication.</p>
               <p>To the prayers of the Masse, which being in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number suppose a number present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a number of communicants, hee saith, they argue the antiquitie of the Masse to bee aboue sixe hundreth yeares after Christe: which is not so: in deede they argue the forme of those prayers to be ancienter then the priuate Masse, and more they argue not. But they may be vsed (saith Maister Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) bicause at euery Masse be more present, then any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eye can see. O absurde Asse, that so arrogantly brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of learning, and so proudly despiseth so learned a Fathers arguments. Admit, that in steede of legions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels that be present at euery Masse, whose seruice it is, there were so many legions of Angels present as he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasieth: doeth the Priest saying <hi>Oremus,</hi> Let vs pray, speake to the Angels that are present to pray with him yea, why not? will some froward Papist say. But to whome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:14727:387"/>
he when he turneth about and sayth, <hi>Orate pro me fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres &amp; sorores,</hi> pray for me brethren and sisters. Be there hee Angels and she Angels also? And when he prayeth that the oblation which they haue offered be saluation to all that haue receiued it, doeth he meane that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels haue taken their rytes of the Priest, though none of the people be present, but perhaps one sorie boy that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him to say Masse? But the Prieste (he saith) is no priuate person, but a common officer, euen as when hee baptizeth. But is hee such a Magistrate to altar and chaunge the institution and ordinaunce of GOD? Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme may bee ministred to one alone according to the institution thereof, but the Communion which is a feast of the Church, ought not to bee kept without a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of guestes. To all the rest of the authorities cited by the Bishop out of the Canons of the Apostles, the decree of Calixtus, the Dialogues of Gregorie, hee saith they proue nothing, but that the people vsed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and there be diuers thinges in those writings, which wee doe not obserue, as though wee haue bound our selues to the obseruing of mens decrees as the Papistes haue. But what so euer they haue agreeable to the worde of GOD wee obserue and willingly, although hee slaunder our Church to suffer them to be present at the Communion, which doe not communicate, which is a most impudent and shamelesse lye: and yet easily to bee borne in comparison of their blasphemies, which he bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out against the Priesthoode of our Sauiour Christe, saying, the order of Melchisedech should haue an end, if their stinking Masse were omitted, and that their Priestes must daily enter into <hi>Sancta sanctorum.</hi> O Antichristian Helhoundes, that challenge vnto your selues the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Priesthoode of Christe, who onely is a Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedech, and hath no succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours in his Priesthoode. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>O blasphemous dogges, that will haue your hedge Priests to enter into <hi>Sancta sanctorum</hi> the most holy places

euery day, whither Christ hath once for all entered, and found eternall redemption. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>And these blasphemies he had rather defend, then giue ouer the blasphemie of the priuate Masse, which with neither learning, modestie, nor conscience, he or any of al the rout of them is able to defend, either as lawfull or as auncient.</p>

                  </note>To the Bishops challenge, that the Communion was neuer ministred in one kinde to any man in the space of 600. yeres after Christes: he answereth first, that if it were not, yet their Church is out of dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, bicause it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indifferent for the Lay people to receiue in one kind, or in both, alledging for proofe a saying of Luther, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before hee was throughly conuerted from Papistrie. Secondly, hee will proue that it was receiued vnder one kind, first bicause in <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. and <hi>Act.</hi> 20. there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but of bread. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christe and Paule gaue them the communion in one kind, a good consequent. By the same I may proue, that Christe and Paule receiued them selues but bread, bicause there is no mention of wine. And yet the Papistes holde it necessarie, that the Priest which ministreth, should of necessitie receiue in both kindes. And whereas he is ashamed of this negatiue consequence, he chargeth vs with like reasoning, out of some place of Augustine, or Irenaeus, &amp;c. Wheras he slandreth vs falsly, except it be vpon such an affirmatiue as excludeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="761" facs="tcp:14727:388"/>With like impudence he saieth, we doe not deny, but that in Tertullians time the sacrament in one kinde was carried home to their houses, which we doe vtterly deny, neither is he euer able to proue. As false it is, that he saith in Cyprians time it was carried to mens houses in one kinde, for Cyprian saith no such thing, nor any worde sounding to such end. And concerning the custome of sending the sacrament to Bishops that were straungers, which came to Rome, cited by Irenaeus <hi>Ad victor,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would proue it was sent vnder one kinde, because wine would soone waxe sower, I say he vnderstandeth not what the custome was, but imagineth that the sacrament was sent a thousand myle of to those Bishops, whereas it was onely from the Table to the places where they did sitte in the Churche, or at the worste, to their lodging where they soiourned at Rome. But passing ouer as he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, all reportes of carrying and sending the sacrament, whiche prooueth nothing at all the communion in one kinde, for both might as well be carried and sent as one, he commeth to a fragment of an Epistle of Basilius <hi>Ad Caesariam Pratriciam,</hi> which also he falsifieth in translation, as the rest of the Papistes, Harding, and Heskins doe. For where he saith, that such as ledde a solitary life in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, where no Priest is, keeping the communion at home, receiue of themselues, <hi>Communionem domi seruantes à seipsis communicant,</hi> meaning they receiued one of an other, which he translateth, They communicate by themselues, Gathering that a priest may as well receiue by himselfe in the churche, as the people at home, whiche doth not followe, although neither of both be wel done. And here againe he wil haue no wine for feare of sauoring, whereas their is no dout, but such strong wine as groweth in those countries, will be preserued as long from sauoring, as the bread fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moulding. Like is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of Serapion being at the point of death to whom the priest being sicke also, sent by a boye the sacrament. Vppon which example he vrgeth reseruation, which though it be not necessarie, yet is it not the matter in controuersie, secondly the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:14727:389"/>
in one kind, which is false, for he sent both and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to dippe the bread in the wine which he sent, and not in any thing else, as M. Rastell saith, which were an absurditie, that the bodie of Christe should be dipped in prophane licour, or sent by a boy, either if the Priest had ben so persuaded of it, as Rastel would beare vs in hand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all olde fathers were. That he receiued alone, proueth no priuate Masse nor alloweth sole receiuing as ordinarie, which was done in a case of extreame necessitie in one which was excommunicated, and could not departe this life, before he had receiued the sacrament.</p>
               <p>The last example is the superstitious fact of Satyrus the brother of Ambrose, which beeing not baptised, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christians y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in a ship with him in daunger of shipwracke, which because he might not receiue, he caused it to be wrapped, in <hi>Orario</hi> a linnen garment, which Maister Rastell calleth a stole, &amp; wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that linnen garment about his necke, and without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe escaped by swimming. Here M. Rastel thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he hath great aduauntage. First that the Christians had the sacrament out of the Church. As though the ship might not be their Church for that time, to minister the communion in the time of that great daunger. Secondly that it was in one kind, except we can deuise how to wrap wine in a stole. No M. Rastel, this proueth not that the Christians receiued in one kinde, though they had wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one kinde in the stole (as you call it) for Satyrus, as yet no Christian. But why might they not either soake the bread in wine, as some did in those days, or else dippe a corner of that linnen cloth as some also vsed to doe, and wrappe it vp in that great linnen garment? And the words of Ambrose <hi>Fusum in viscera</hi> powred into his bowels wold not agree to drie bread. Last of all, whereas you say it was no fantastical figuratiue memorie which saued him from daunger, I agree with you: but it was not the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he carried, whatsoeuer you will call it, but his faith (as S. Ambrose saith,) that preserued him.</p>

                  </gap>at came with him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode no parte of the English tongue, as our stories doe testifie. And that he planted not the Romane seruice, it may appeare by the aunswere of Gregorie to his thirde demaunde of the diuersitie of the Romane Churche, and the French Church, in which answere he bindeth him not to the Romane Church, but willeth him to choose out of all Churches, what he thinketh most conuenient and profitable for the Englishe Churche. And seeing the Scriptures and diuerse Homelyes, and Prayers remaine still in the Saxon or old English tongue, I do not see but he might haue made a newe English seruice, although by reason of so many mutations &amp; troubles as happened in this land by meanes of ciuil and externe warres, &amp; in the
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:14727:390"/>
meane time Antichrist daily more and more incroching, the same might growe out of vse, and latine onely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, which perhaps at the first was but vsuall vnto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries or clarkes. But how soeuer it was, this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible argument that Augustine planted not the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane seruice in this land, bicause there were so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities of customes as there were diuerse Bishops sees, and al they differing from the vse of the Romane church.</p>
               <p>But hauing none authoritie, he hath reasons perhaps to defend latine seruice. First latine seruice is as meete for Englishmen, as English seruice is for Welshme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he saith we finde no faulte, wherin he lieth. For the Welshmen that vnderstand not english, haue their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon praier in their Welshe tongue.</p>
               <p>The second reason he vseth that Sainct Paule did write in greeke to the Romanes, ergo the seruice must be in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to Englishmen. He saith himselfe there be many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betweene an epistle &amp; a common forme of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which is verie true. But will he proue therby, that the Romanes had their common praiers in greeke? The cause why the Apostle did write in greeke, was bicause he wrote not only to the Romanes, but to the whole churche vnto which the greeke tongue was more familiar then the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and was of many vnderstoode in Rome. And also because the holy Ghoste <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad consecrated the Greek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> tongue, beeing the principall tongue of the gentiles, vnto the writinges of the newe Testament, auoyding to vse the Latine tongue, euen to the Romanes, for the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the name of Antichriste Latinos conteined in the nomber of the beastes name 666. as Irenaeus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth testifie. His thirde reason is, that there be many thinges to be saide in publique praier, which ought to be saide in secrete, therefore an vnknowne tongue is best to vtter them. His antecedent he proueth not out of scripture or any auncient authenticall writer, but out of the liturgies falsely ascribed to Saint Basil, and Saint Chrysostome, and yet the argument hath no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the world, for then those prayers in the Latine
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:14727:390"/>
seruice to the Romanes, shoulde bee in an vnknowen tongue, and all the rest in a knowne tongue to euerie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Finally, where he saith, there needeth no diuersitie of seruice according to the diuersitie of languages, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth directly contrarye to the decree of the councell of Laterane, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. which commanded the bishoppes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that the sacraments and other diuine seruice, should be ministred to all people in their diocesse, according to the diuersitie of their languages and customes.

<pb n="768" facs="tcp:14727:392"/>
these termes be not founde, yet that which is signified by them is found. For thus he vseth in euery matter to trifle about termes, as though the bishop did striue for wordes and sylables, and not for the matter. And he would haue the bishop to bring out of any antiquitie, that the people were taught to beleeue, that the bodie of Christ is onely figuratiuely, sacramentally, significatiuely, tropically, imaginatiuely in the sacrament, to the denyal of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and reallitie, as though a sacramental presence were not a presence and a reall presence also, if by reall you meane that whiche is in deede, and not counterfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though it bee not after a grosse and carnall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>For that Christ is present, and truely receyued in his sacramentes, wee doe gladly confesse, whiche is all that any aunciente writers speaketh of his presence, Hierome, Isychius, Cyrillus, Origen, Augustine or Chrysostome: whose names he citeth, or any other within 600. yers after Christ. But to maintein that grosse &amp; corporall maner of presence or receiuing, which the papistes doe now holde, there is none of the olde writers that saith any thing to the purpose. As for Damascen is far out of the compasse, a corrupt writer, and yet more grosse in termes, then his iudgement was, as it were easie to prooue, if his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were of any weight.</p>
               <p>But Master Rastel asketh if these words be not plaine inough. This is my bodie which shall bee deliuered for you, Luk. 22. Hee maketh them somewhat plainer by chaunging the pretertence into the future, for Luke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the words: which is giuen for you. I againe aske him whether these wordes bee not as plaine. This cuppe is the Newe Testament in my blood, which is shedde for you? Wee doubt not but that it is the sacrament of his true and naturall body, for we make not two bodies of Christ as the papistes doe, a naturall bodie, and a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodie, which true and naturall bodie of Christ being in heauen, is giuen vnto vs in those holy mysteries after a wonderfull and vnspeakeable manner, not carnally nor
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:14727:392"/>
corporally, but spiritually and diuinelye. And where as Maister Rastell citeth a longe saying of Cyrillus against an Arrian, whiche denyed,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that wee haue any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall coniunction with Christe, and proueth the same by the strength and power of the misticall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which maketh Christ to dwell corporally in vs, it is nothing in the worlde to his corporall and carnall manner of presence. For we also do graunt, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the mistical benediction is such, as maketh Christ to dwel corporally in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull, which is nothing else (as he doth immediately expounde himselfe,) but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are made members of Christes bodie and members one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which is not after any carnall or naturall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but after an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; diuine manner of vnion.

Euery high Priest taken of men is appointed for men, in those things that perteine to God, to offer vp gifts and sacrifices for sinnes, which the Apostle speaketh expreslye of the priests of the old lawe, and proueth the excellency of Christ aboue them.</p>
               <p>Secondly admitting hee shoulde speake of Pristes of the newe Testament, which is false, he saith their sacrifice must be after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Melchisedech, as it is written, thou art a priest for euer after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Melchisedech: of which order Christ is a priest, in respect of Popish priestes that be nowe a dayes; or else Gods oth should be broken. Surely I merueile at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great clemency of god which stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not such blasphemous mouthes with thunderbolts. that make the eternall priesthoode of Christ, which hee hath without succession, to depende vppon their greasie order, which hath not beene but of late erected, neither shall continue for euer, where as our sauiour Christe worlde without ende shal bee both a king and a priest, which is the order of Melchisedech, and consisteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in offering of breade and wine, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Apostle to the Hebrewes, who sheweth in what respect Christ is a priest after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</p>
               <p>As impudent as this is blasphemous, is his next argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by verye expresse commaundement of Christ in his last supper, they must offer him vp: saying, Do this in rememberance of me.

                  <pb n="773" facs="tcp:14727:394"/>As for the testimonies of the Fathers which he citeth, are easily answered, that they spake of sacrificing Christe figuratiuely and vnproperly, as some of them confesse, namely Chrysostome, whome hee citeth, <hi>ad Heb.

in 600. yeares of Christ, and M. Rastell will bring proofe without those 600. yeares, the Bishop requireth antiquitie whereof the Papistes haue so impudently bragged, and Rastel will bring foorth noueltie. But he hath a proper similitude, to shewe that these Articles, though they were not knowne to the auncient Church, for 600. yeares after Christe, yet are they not to be refused, no more then the fruites of Autumne, bicause they appeared not on the trees in Aprill, are to be reiected. Thus you see by this delicate similitude he denyeth the Church of Christe, his Apostles, Euangelistes, Martyrs, Confessours, Pastours &amp; teachers, for 600. yeares together to haue beene a season fruitfull of matters of trueth, hauing nothing but greene ornaments and gay flowers, promising the wholesome fruites of Poperie, that haue appeared and waxed ripe in the latter time of the Church, as in the Haruest or moneth of September. If this similitude can be defended without contumely of Christ and the Primitiue Church, let al the Papistes clap their hands at it, and say. O learned M. Rast. that with so short an answere, hath satisfied all M. Iewels demaunds. But he will choake the Bishop and vs all with the last question: Where is it read (saith he) within 600. yeares after Christ, that our blessed Lady was preached or named the mother of mercy, the handmaiden of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the spouse of the holy Ghost, the Queene of heauen, the Empresse of hell? and yet if you beleeue in deed that she is the mother of God, all these Articles do follow, like as the rest of that veritie which saith, this is my body. It is well that M. Rastell confesseth these titles neuer to haue ben giuen to the Virgine Marie, neither by Christ, nor by his Apostles, nor by any in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church for 600. yeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ. Nowe syr, I will answere your question. I do as constantly beleeue with my heart, and more effectually then I can expresse with wordes, that the holy and blessed Virgine Marie is the mother of hers and our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the sonne of God, very God and very man. Yet all those titles which you confesse to be neither read in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny antiquitie of 600. ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by the like reason and more probable, I might argue, the mother of a man is a woman therefore the mother of God is a Goddesse, from which blasphemie Saint Bonauenture a Popish Saint, is of no force, if he doe not farre exceede it, when he saith to the Virgine Marie. <hi>Iure matris impera filio,</hi> and againe, <hi>Coge Deum &amp;c.</hi> By the authoritie of a mother commaunde thy sonne, and compel God to be merciful to sinners. &amp;c.</p>

But hee vnderstandeth not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops argument, or at least, he will not vnderstand it. For the sophistrie of the Popish argument resteth in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie of this worde, Communicate, which signifieth to receiue the Lordes supper at one time and in one place, with others of their Church, which the Papistes take for receiuing generally, so that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest in Louaine receiuing at his Masse alone communicateth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> likewise receiueth at his Masse alone in Calicut.

                  </note> will now conclude with onely confuting these conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of M. Iewels comparison. S. Iames Masse had Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes institution, they in their Masse haue well neere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but mans inuention. To disproue this he saith, the epistle and Gospell, the collets of the Sunday, the Hymne of the Angell, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confession of faith, the saying of <hi>Agnus Dei, &amp;c.</hi> are translated out of their Masse into our communion, therefore we take them for parte of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes institution. I answere we take them as Christes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and not as commended by the Masse, and yet are they no parte of the communion, though they be vsed in our liturgie, some before, and some after the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Secondly he would seeme to confute the Bishops say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Saint Iames Masse had Christes institution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if we had thought so in deede, we would haue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated it into English, and so haue vsed it in steede of the Popish Masse, and then it would haue seemed more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, and full of ceremonies then the Popish Masse. And so he rehearseth a number of superstitious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, gestures, and prayers that are in it. I answere, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop said truely as he thought, that the liturgie falsely ascribed to Saint Iames, hath Christes institution concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lorde Supper, notwithstanding it be ful fraught with idle ceremonies, and some superstitious and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious prayers, whereas the Popish Masse hath cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturned the institution of Christ, touching the ende of the Lordes supper, reteyning well neere nothing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes institution, except you will say it hath bread and wine, which it most horribly abuseth to the prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christes death, and most filthie idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Finally, the saluation of the virgine Marie whiche was then aliue, although it were more meere to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to her person beeing aliue, then after she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:14727:397"/>
out of this worlde) the prayer made for them that liued in monasteries, the tearme of consubstantiall not heard of in the Church before the Nicene councell, and many other argumentes doe sufficiently proue, that the saide liturgie was not written by Saint Iames the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, nor by any that liued many hundreth yeares after him to the iudgements of al men that haue either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to discerne trueth from falshoode, or conscience to acknowledge that which they can not choose but know. And euen Bartholomew Garanza a Papist, that gathered the abridgement of councels, affirmeth that the liturgie which Saint Iames vsed, is not extant at this day. O Lord bring into the way of trueth all such as erre of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, and be not mercifull to those that sinne of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wickednesse.</p>
               <p>After this clearkly confutation, followeth a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet challenge (as he pretendeth) to shew the Bishops fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but in deede to shewe his owne follie, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his cause, which he learned not, (as he saith) of Salomon, to answere a foole according to his follie, but of Menalcas one of Virgils sheepheardes, in his thirde Eglogue, which when he could not answer the ridle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him by his aduersarie, he putteth for than other as harde as he thinketh: <hi>Dic quibus in terris, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His first section conteineth 21. articles, whereof the greatest parte are not helde at all by any of vs, therefore there is no cause why we should proue them, the rest be matters of meere indifferencie, which may be vsed or left vndon without any hurt of our religion, &amp; some perhaps may be proued (which he litle thinketh of) to his shame.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are these 1. that there was no drie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and we say there ought to be none, although the Papistes make a drie communion, when they robbe the people of the cuppe of the Lordes bloud. The thirde that Bishops did not sweare by their honour: we affirme they ought not to sweare, nor yet by God, as I heard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sweare, being conuented before the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester his Chauncelour, and a great number of persons
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:14727:397"/>
beeing present.</p>
               <p>The 4. that bagpipers, horscoursers, gailers, alebasters, were not admitted into the Cleargie without sufficient triall. We affirme they ought not, nor yet any of the scullerie or blacke garde, as some yet liuing were made Priestes in Queene Maries time.</p>
               <p>The 6. that no Bishoppe not content with prisoning his aduersaries, call vppon Princes to put them to cruell death. We holde that no Bishop should imprison his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary, much lesse procure his death, but if the challenge had beene of Gods aduersaries, I would haue aunswered otherwise. For if in 600. yeares none of Gods aduersaries was, or ought to haue beene put to death, by procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bishops, by what ground of antiquitie doe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops procure so many to be put to death, yea murther them selues in their prisons and inquisitions, vnder pretence, that they be Gods aduersaries?</p>
               <p>The 17. that no Bishoppe did gather beneuolence of his Cleargie to marrie his daughter, &amp;c. We aunswere, this no way concerneth religion, no more then putting of the ring on the womans left hande, which is the 18. or calling the people by ringing of a bell whiche is the 21. Now concerning the rest, as the seconde, that there should be no celebration of the Lordes supper except there be a good number to communicate, three or foure at the least, &amp;c. is proued by the Canons of the Apostles, that Excommunicate all Christians that be present, and doe not communicate Can. 9. Also the first Epistle of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacletus (which is good authoritie against a Papist) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the priest or Bishop to sacrifice alone, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all the ministers that are present, to receiue with him in paine of excommunication. And appointeth what number shall be present. of deacons, namely on solemne dayes seuen, on other dayes fiue or three, beside Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons &amp; other ministers. These decrees do proue, that there should be no celebration of the Lordes supper, but when there be a good number to communicate.</p>

               <p>To the 12. for the ministers wearing of a Cope or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plesse, which hold it to be no part of religion, and that the communion hath bene ministred in common apparell, we will go no further then our Sauiour Christ himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. and there is no question, but his Apostles and the primitiue Churche many hundreth yeares followed his example.</p>

               <p>To the 15. that the curses of Gods law, should be redd vpon Ashwednesday, we hold it not as a thing necessarie, but an order of indifferencie, vntill a better discipline be restored.</p>

               <p>The 22. that the bishoppe of Rome was not called Antichriste the cause was, that vntill after sixe hundreth yeare, the bishoppe of Rome was not Antichriste.

not holden of vs, and therefore wee are not to prooue it.</p>
               <p>To the 24. that the residue of the sacramentall bread, which was not receyued by any olde custome of the Church of Constantinople was giuen to young children that went to schoole, is prooued by Euagrius, <hi>libr.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 36. whether to spredde their butter, as hee requireth is to shewe, or to eate it with cheese, or fleshe, &amp;c.

               <p>To the 25. that no man was conuented for affirminge the carnall maner of presence of Christes bodie in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I aunswere, it was because there was no man founde which held that grosse heresie al that space of 600 yeres after Christ.</p>
               <p>To the 26. that it was lawfull to haue but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one Churche in one daye, I aunswere it was a custome of the Churche before Leo the firste, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his 79. Epistle, who appointed that when the Communion woulde not serue all that came to the Churche, there might bee another celebrated, and that so often in one daye, as the people filled the Churche: and otherwise wee saye not of one Communion in a daye.</p>
               <p>To the 27. that an Image of Christe, or of a Sainte was defaced and iudged vnlawfull to bee in the Churche of Christian men, is prooued by the Epistle of Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, who reporteth that he him selfe did reade such a one paynted on a vayle at Anablatha, which Epistle was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated out of Greeke by S. Hierome, and is in the 2. Tome of his workes.</p>
               <p>The 28. of Bishoppes settinge vppe their owne, their wiues, or their childrens pictures, in their parlours and chambers, is a vaine matter, not touchinge religion anye thing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="784" facs="tcp:14727:400"/>The 29, that Christ deliuered his body to many more then his twelue Apostles, is no article of faith, neither greatly material, whether he did or did not, yet it is most probable, that seeing he did eate the olde sacrament of the Pascall lambe with the whole housholde that were his disciples, he did vnto them also giue the newe sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his bodie and blood.</p>
               <p>The 30. that Iudas Machabaeus in offeringe for the dead, added to the lawe, it is manifest by the scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no suche oblation appointed by the lawe. And yet his oblation helpeth not the papistes, because those for whom he offered, dyed in mortall sinne, beinge defiled with Idolatrie as the storie doth report.</p>
               <p>To the 31. and 32. that a bishoppe did marrie after he was a bishoppe, or married the seconde or thirde wife, the first being dead, it is not vnlike, seeinge the scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no more abstinence from marriage in a bishop, then in any other man. Clemens as Eusebius testifieth, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. saith, <hi>Petrus &amp; Philippus liberis procreandia ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram dederunt.</hi> Peter the Apostle, and Philippe did beget childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Socrates lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 22 saith, <hi>Multi illorum episcopatus te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pore etiam liberos ex legitimis vxoribus sustulerint.</hi> Manie of them, euen in the time that they were bishops, begat chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their lawfull wiues. As for M. Rastell termes of harlot and fyery passion, &amp;c. I omit to speake of, as more meet for such a ruffian like railer, then worthy of any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. The councell of Gangra in their Epistle to the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Armenia, report it, as one of the heresies of the Eustachians, that priestes which haue contracted matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony should be despised, and the sacramentes ministred by them should not be receiued. <hi>Praesbiteros qui matrimonia contraxerunt, sperni debere dicunt.</hi> Which wordes prooue that bishops married as well as priestes. The same councell <hi>Can.</hi> 4. accurseth them that make a difference betweene a married prieste and another, in respecte of his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>To the 33. that preachers mooued not yong men and women not to be ashamed of lust, I saye, it is no parte of
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:14727:400"/>
our doctrin, but a lewde slander imputed to Luther most vniustly, who speaketh of the desire of marriage &amp; not otherwise.</p>
               <p>To the 34. that euery man should reade the scriptures &amp; not giue eare to mans traditions it is the very counsell &amp; words of Basil in his short definitions, quest. 65. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome doth often exhort al lay men to reade the Bible, in a great number of places.</p>
               <p>To the 35 that Lent and Friday shoulde be fasted for polycie, and not for deuotion, we doe not hold, but that abstinence of flesh shoulde be vsed at such times, which is a matter of meere policie, as for abstinence of flesh for religions sake, was condempned in the counsell of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra. And Montanus the heretike was the first that made lawes of fasting. Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 18.</p>
               <p>To the 36. that Palme sonday was solemnised without bearing of bowes, it is proued at the least for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares after Christ, in which time all stories testifie, that the Church was for the most parte vnder persecution, and had no such processions about the streates, but rather kept them in secrete corners, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like I say for can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels on Candelmas day, which coulde not be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 600. yeares of Christe, because Pope Sergius was the first that appointed them to be borne, whiche was seuen hundreth yeares after Christ. As for Masse on Christmasse day, I answere the same, the Masse was not all made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 600. years, if he speake of the popish Masse: if he speake of the communion, it is a thing indifferent whether it be celebrated that day or no.</p>
               <p>To the 37. although the celebration of the natiuitie of Iohn baptist, be but a variable &amp; indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ceremony, yet may it be proued by many auncient homilyes, that it was kept within the compasse of 600, yeres. As for the feast of the natiuitie of the blessed Virgin Marye, or of her assumption, that they were not celebrated within that time, it is manifest, because they were not instituted many hundreth yeares after. As Durande confesseth the feast of the natiuitie, not to haue beene kept of old time.
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:14727:401"/>
And touching the assumption, the verye lessons read in the popish mattyns on that day doe affirme, that manye doubted of her assumption, <hi>lect.</hi> 3. and also affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she dyed and was buried, and that her sepulcher was shewed in the vale of Iosophat. lect. 2.</p>
               <p>To 38. they that pray to God to bee defended by the ministery of Angels, whether it bee vppon the feast of S. Michaell, or any other day, haue the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which declareth that they be ministring spirites ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the defence of them that shalbe saued. <hi>Psa.</hi> 34 <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. Neither do they seeke helpe at any other creatures handes but of God, onely by the mediation of Christe, who desire God for Christes sake to helpe them by such spirituall or bodily ministers, or means, as hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. For they worship God, and not the Angels, they pray to God, and not to Angles.</p>
               <p>To the 39. for vsing the signe of the crosse in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and not in the communion, I aunswer, we count it not needefull either in the one sacrament, or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>To the 40. of throwing downe Aultars erected vnto Christe, I aunswere: Ezechias is commended in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for throwing downe the hill aultars erected vnto GOD, and in which the people did offer sacrifice one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lorde, because they were not erected according to Gods commaundent, and yet was not hee accounted an heretike. 2. <hi>Regum.</hi> 18. Much lesse are they to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heretikes, that throwe downe the Popishe aultars whiche were set vp against the onelye Aulter and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ and his passion, to the most blasphemous defacing of the same.</p>

                  <p>To the first, that it is vnlawful to make a vowe to God of chastitie, obedience, or pouertie. I answere, it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make a vowe of that which is not in a mans power to performe, as is the vowe of Virginitie, which is a gift not giuen to all, as our sauiour Christ testifieth. <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.

                  <p>To the second, that it was abhominable to make any sacrifice to God, beside the sacrifice of thankesgiuing in words, &amp; the figures for his benefites, with remembrance of his passion, &amp;c.

                  <head>The second part containeth 12. Articles in which he falsly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Caluine in his institutions with diuers Articles, which neither he nor any of vs doe holde.</head>
                  <p>The first, that the sacrament of baptisme instituted by Christ, is no better then the circumcision of the old lawe, is proued by Saint Augustine, which saith, <hi>in Ioan. Tr.</hi> 26. speaking of the sacraments of the old law, that they were <hi>in fignis diuersa in re quae significatur, paria,</hi> diuers in signes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in the thing signified.</p>
                  <p>The second, that baptisme is a signe onely of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and that our sinnes are not truly forgiuen in it, is no doctrine of ours, but of the Anabaptistes, mightily confuted by Caluine, whome he slaundereth to hold it.</p>
                  <p>The 3. that confirmation ought to be a sacrament is an inuention of man plaine, for that it is not taught in the scriptures to be an institution of Christ. Irenęus testifieth, that the annointing with sweete oyle came first of the Valentinian heretiques. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. Also in S.

                  <p>The fourth, that Christ deliuered in his last supper a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure only of his body to be eaten of his Apostles, is none of our assertions, for we affirme that he deliuered breade and wine, not as a figure onely, but as his very body and bloud spiritually to be eaten and dronken.</p>

                     <pb n="793" facs="tcp:14727:404"/>The 5. that the power of forgiuing and reteyning sinnes which Christ gaue to his Apostles, is nothing else but a comforting or fearing of mens consciences by the promises or menaces of the scripture, &amp;c. is not affirmed of vs, but that Christ hath giuen power to his ministers to assure the penitent of forgiuenesse in his name, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his iudgment to the vnrepentant: so that man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the sentence of God, and not God of man.</p>

                     </gap>. that to confesse a mans sinnes to the priest, is a vaine and superstitious trauell, is proued by Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome <hi>In Psalmo.</hi> 50. <hi>Non dico vt confitearis conseruo tuo vt exprobret, dicito Deo, qui curat ea.</hi> I bidde thee not confesse thy sinnes to thy fellowe seruaunt, that he may vpbraide thee, tell them to God which healeth them. That to seek to make vp a ful and perfect satisfaction by fasting, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, almesdeedes, &amp;c. is iniurious to the passion and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christ, is proued by that saying of S.

The bloud of Iesus Christ doth purge vs from all sinnes, and if we confesse our sinnes he is faithful and righteous, that he will forgiue our sinnes and purge vs from all vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The 7. that the knowledge of the scriptures is a sufficient licence for a man to be a publike teacher in the Church, we denie: likewise, that there is no difference betweene the ministerie of the Churche and the people, althoughe that to speake properly of the terme priesthoode, all true Christians are alike Priestes to God, as it is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. 1.

That Christian Princes had the auhoritie of supream head ouer the church in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sense, which it is giuen to our souereigne, is proued by Constantine, Theodosius, Martianus &amp;c. who called the generall councels, made lawes for establishment of religion, punished Bishoppes and other of the Cleargie offenders, and not onely the Emperours, but also many other Kinges of Spaine and Fraunce, who had the like authoritie in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as appeareth in all histories, and in the actes of the councels generall and prouinciall.</p>

                  <p>The 10. that all the iustice and holinesse of good men is but an imputatiue iustice &amp;c. is not saide of vs which affirme, that faith onely is imputed for righteousnesse and not the holines or iustice of any man. But we affirme that all the workes of men, be they neuer so holie and righteous, are imperfect, and therefore deserue not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of Iustice promised in the lawe to the perfect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers thereof, and to none other.</p>

And Augustine plainely sayeth, <hi>Quibus autem diebus non oportet ieiunare, &amp; quibus oporteat, pręcepto Domini vel Apostolorum non inuenio definitum.</hi> What dayes we ought not to fast, or what dayes we ought to fast.

                  <p>To the 12. that aneiling of Christians, hath ben abhorred of Christians, it is hard to proue, because y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Popish aneiling by the Priests with oyle consecrated by the Bishop, was not in vse in that time.

Whom haue I in the heauen but thee: and I haue desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red none in the earth with thee. Psal. 73.</p>
                  <p>To the second, that the setting vp of images of Christe in Churches was counted idolatrie, it is manifest by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, who as he testifieth in his epistle vnto Iohn bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Ierusalem, did rend a vaile in which such an image was painted: <hi>Cum ergo hoc vidissem, in Ecclesia Christi contra authoritatem scripturarum hominis pendere imaginem, scidi illud, &amp;c.</hi> When I had seene this thing, that in the Churche of Christ, contrarie to the authoritie of scriptures, an image of a man did hang, I rent it in peeces, &amp;c. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe of the crosse I haue shewed before out of Irenaeus, that the Valentinian heretikes were the first that had it in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although afterward it grew to be esteemed of good Christians, by a corrupt emulation.</p>
                  <p>To the 3. that visiting of Saints tombes, and kissing their reliques after the Popish manner, was thought to be a superstitious vanitie, is proued by the Epistle of the Smyrnenses to the Phylomilienses Euseb. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. Wherein they shew, that the Gentiles and Iewes thought best to burne the bodie of Policarpus, least the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should leaue Christ and begin to worship him, and therefore they watched the Christians, least they should, take his bodie out of the fire, <hi>Ignorantes nos nec vnquam &amp;c.</hi> beeing ignorant (say they) that we can neuer forsake Christ, which suffered for all them that shall be saued of the worlde, nor worship any other. For him truly we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore as the sonne of God, but the Martyrs we loue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily as the Disciples and followers of our Lord, for their inuincible loue towardes their King and Maister, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we wish our selfes to be made companions and Disciples.

                  <p>To the first, that to praye for the soules departed, was thought repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the scriptures, is proued by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for that although it be an ancient errour, yet was it not vsed of the Churche almost for 200. yeares after Christ, and the first that we reade of in any authenticall writer that maketh mention of prayer for the deade, was Tertulian, when he was an heretike, whiche learned it of Martianus who laide the firste foundation of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, as appeareth in his booke <hi>De anima cap de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>To the seconde, that to offer sacrifice and giue almes for their soules health, was accompted impietie, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere as to the first, vppon which it dependeth. <hi>Origenes in Iob. lib.</hi> 3. sayeth that the Christians did celebrate the day of death, <hi>Vtpote omnium dolorum depositionem,</hi> as the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge aside of all paine. Likewise that they did keepe the memorie of their friendes departed, as well reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe in their rest, as prayinge for the lyke godly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge in faith.</p>
                  <p>Also they called together the people with the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and especially the poore to their buriall feastes, <hi>vt fiat festiuitas nostra in memoriam requiei defunctis animabus, quarum memoriam celebramus, nobis autem efficiatur in odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem suauitatis in conspectu aeterni Dei,</hi> that our feastiuitie may bee made in remembraunce of the reste, whiche is vnto the soules of them that are departed, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie we celebrate and to our selues into a sauoure of sweete smellinge in the sight of the eternall God. This was the iudgement of the Greeke Churche in his time, of suche assemblies, prayers, and almes, as was vsed at the buryall of the deade, or in remembraunce of them.</p>
                  <p>To the thirde, that the last willes of founders of almes houses, Colledges, and monasteries, were broken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:14727:407"/>
their temporall goodes, and legacies, and that no part thereof did come to their owne blood and familie, concerning almes houses and Colledges of learninge, it neede not bee prooued, for they are maintained by our doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Concerninge Monasteries there were none then, but of suche as liued with their owne labours. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse if anye legacie of anye founder were to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Idolatrie and false religion, as there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of the Paganes whiche were founders of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous temples and Colledges, lyke to the popishe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, it is certeine that either they were destroyed, or else conuerted to better vses.</p>
                  <p>Now if Master Rastell thinke it to bee necessarie, that their legacies shoulde be restored to their owne blood and familie, vppon the dissolution of such houses, hee might doe well to perswade a nomber of popishe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in Englande that enioye abbeies and their lands, to make such restitution, and when hee hath brought to passe that all which they haue is so restored, wee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne likewise to exhort godly gentlemen to doe the like, or rather to applye some part of them to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of learning and religion, and to the sustentation of the poore.</p>
                  <p>After Maister Rastell hath earnestlye required the aunswere of these questions, whiche haue bene so often aunswered in speciall treatises, (I meane so manye of them as wee maintaine) with promise of submission if they be proued, he desireth licence to rehearse the saying of Tertulian in his booke <hi>De praescriptionibus aduersus haereticos,</hi> which is such (as hee saieth) that euen religion muste agree to it, if with anye reason it will bee credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>But in deed it is suche, as while Tertulian followed too muche, hee fell from the Catholike Church to be an heretike. The summe of that saying which M. Rast. hath shamefully gesded, &amp; falsely translated, so that it seemeth
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:14727:408"/>
he hath not red it in Tertulians booke, but in some mans notes, that hath ioyned together as it were cantles or patches of Tertulians saying: the effecte (I saie) is this. That because some heretikes of his time receiued not all the scriptures, and those which they did receiue, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not whole, but by additions and detractions, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and wrong expositions, they peruerted them to their purpose, his iudgement was, that against such here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, the triall was not to bee made by scriptures, by which the victorie should either be none, or vncertaine, or not sure: and therefore in as much as they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed what was scripture, and how great was the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof, he thought that the order of disputinge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that these questions shoulde first be decided. Vnto whom the Christian faith pertaineth: whose are the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: of whom: and by whom: and when: and to whom the learning is deliuered, by which men are made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>For where it shall appeare, that the trueth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian learning and faith is, there shalbe the trueth of the scriptures and of the expositions, and of all Christian tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. This is the iudgement of Tertulian, But seeinge we receiue all the scriptures Canonicall, without additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or detraction, yea and for the principal articles of our religion, wherein we differ from the papistes, we receiue the exposition of the most auncient writers, both of the Greeke and Latine Churche: not bringinge in any newe doctrine, but requiring that the olde doctrine may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, this rule of Tertulian doth not concerne vs. Yet are we able to aunswere to all his demaundes without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taryinge, and so as it shall satisfie Tertulian or anye man that vnderstandeth him. We say that Christian faith pertaineth to true Christians, and that the scriptures are theirs also.</p>
                  <p>We say also, that the learning by which men are made Christians, was deliuered of Christ, by his Apostles, and Euangelistes, in the time of the raigne of Tiberius the Emperour, first vnto the Iewes, and after vnto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:14727:408"/>
making one vniuersall Chruch dispersed ouer the whole worlde. And the trueth of this Christian learning and faith thus and then deliuered, we do hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, therefore by Tertullians rule, the truth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and expositions &amp; all Christian traditions are with vs, &amp; the rather because it cannot be proued that we hold any one article of beliefe, but the same is conteined in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifest wordes of the scriptures, by which onely it may be tryed, what learning Christ deliuered to his Apostles, and they to the churches. For seeing the memory of man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ascende vnto so many hundreth yeares, the certeine remembrance must be had out of Records of writings, &amp; for so much as no writings are either so auncient, or so credible as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scriptures, the trial must be onely by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures, notwithstanding Tertullians opinion, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine teacheth in many places of his writings against the Donatistes.</p>
                  <p>After this discourse vpon Tertullian, he addeth sixe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles more, falsely pretending that they are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes of Tertullian, but altering them into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a challenge, where as I haue both set forth and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Tertullians demaundes, according to his owne words and meaning.</p>
                  <p>The first is, if we can proue by any sufficient and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argument that we haue any true Christian faith at all among vs, for faith (saith hee) cleaueth vnto authoritie which they can neuer shewe for themselues &amp;c: In deede suche faith as cleaueth vnto mennes authoritie, wee haue none, but suche as cleaueth vnto the worde of God: as saint Paule saith, faith commeth by hearing of the worde of God, which is onely true Christian faith, wee haue the whole faith of Christians, as we do dayly proue, not onely by the auctoritie of scriptures, but also by the testimony of auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writers agreeable to the same. And because he is so impudent to deny that we haue any true Christian faith at all, I demaunde of him, why hee doth not then rebaptise those that are baptised of vs, seing he is persuaded, that neither the minister nor the godfathers,
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:14727:409"/>
(whose faith according to their doctrin, maketh much fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> baptisme) haue any true Christian faith at all?</p>
                  <p>The seconde, that the scriptures are deliuered vnto vs, that we be the right keepers of them, is proued by this argument, that we be the church of God vnto whome the scriptures and the custodie of them perteineth. That wee are the church of God we proue by this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we beleeue and teach all that and nothing else but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which God by his holy scriptures hath appointed to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and taught for Christian faith.</p>
                  <p>The thirde, we knowe from whome wee haue receiued the gospel, not from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists. Namely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of god and his holy spirite, from such ministers as were stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp of God and lightened with his spirite according to the scriptures, and from the books of the Greekes and Hebrues, and not of the papists.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, we knowe by what successours the gospell came vnto vs from God the authour of it, euen from the prophets and Apostles, Euangelistes, pastours and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the church of all ages, florishing in sight of the worlde vntill the comming and tyrany of Antichrist had ouerwhelmed all the worlde with darkenesse, by whom they were persecuted and driuen into corners, according to the prophecie of Christe in the Apocalipse cap. 12. but yet so as they alwayes continued and testified the trueth, oftentimes openly protesting against Antichrist, vntill nowe at the length the time being come in which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ must be consumed, they are againe brought into the sight of the worlde, and the kingdome of Antichrist is made obscure, ignominious, &amp; contemptible.</p>
                  <p>The fift. we knowe at what time the Gospell was first delyuered vnto the Church of the gentiles, namely in the reigne of Tiberius, in whose time Christ suffered, since which time it hath alwayes continued, and shall do to the end of the worlde.</p>
                  <p>To the sixt. wherein he requireth vs to shew the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some Church, house, communion table, or booke &amp;c. by which it may bee gathered that a true apostolike
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:14727:409"/>
religion was within the 600. yeares as void of orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ceremonies, reuerence, distinction of places and dignities, sacraments and solemnities perteining to sacraments as ours is. I answere, our religion hath all sacraments, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, ceremonies, distinction, solemnities, reuerence, necessarie vnto eternall life, and therfore to shewe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of a religion voide of these, it perteineth not to vs. Beside that it is a foolishe and vnreasonable demaund, for vs to shewe any such monument remaining aboue 900. yeares, when by so often inuasion of enemies and mutation of states, as hath fallen in the worlde, other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents could not remain, but learned writings out of which we haue often proued our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the same, that was in the most auncient and purest times of those 600. yeares after Christ.</p>
                  <p>In the conclusion Maister Rastell protesteth, vntil the aunswere be deuised, that he will continue in that faith which Augustine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monke receiued of Gregory y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great, and he of Pelagius, &amp; Pelagius of Benedictus, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishops names of Rome vnto Peter who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his doctrine of Christ: whiche is nothing else but a popish bragge. For neither is he nor al the rablement of them able to proue, that Christ deliuered to Peter, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Clemens a greate number of articles of doctrine, that Augustine deliuered to the Saxons, neither that he and his fellow Papists, do hold all that doctrine &amp; faith, which Augustine receiued of Gregory, &amp; Gregory of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius &amp;c. ascending to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heighest. For a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of errours and corruptions haue since that time crept into the Church, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Augustine nor Gregory euer heard off.</p>
