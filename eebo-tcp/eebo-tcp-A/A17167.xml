            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Arthur Golding wisheth health, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and abundaunce of Gods grace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat mischiefe hath of late yeares bene attempted against this Realme, and how great a flame hath bene kindled against the walles of the Church, thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh the great Treasons that haue bene practised to confound the whole state, by reason of the Popes most pestilent Bull: your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship right well knoweth: yea and it is euen yet still so apparant (or rather present) in all mens eyes, as there is no wise man but he trembleth at the dreadfull remembraunce, nor simple &amp; godly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, but he wondreth at the marueilous disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the daungers, which were sundry times ready to haue ouerwhelmed vs, euen in one moment, had not God reached out his mercifull hand from heauen in the open face of the world to defend vs. For it can not be denied, but that therby, open defiance hath bene made to faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and allegeance: honestie and vertue were shamefully defaced: Religion and Iustice were openly assaulted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borod and charitie were trecherously despised: God and godlinesse were wickedly impugned: our most vertuous and renoumed Princes Maiestie was traiterously impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
<pb facs="tcp:7244:3"/>
her rightfull preheminence diuersly assailed, her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable doinges causelesse diffamed, her gracious cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie scornfully abused, her noble person priuily pricked at, the welfare of the whole Realme daungerously hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the state thereof either intitled to inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, or profered as a pray to forreine enemies. Is it not a straunge case, that a Romishe Bull (or to speake more rightly, a childishe bable) should be able to worke such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, euen where the Gospell shineth most light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely? And yet we see, that not onely some of the rude and witlesse sort, but also many of the greater sort, which thought: them selues no small fooles, ne were in deede no young babes, were contented to become such Calues, as to runne out of Gods blissing, into the warme Sunne, and to turne their weapons into their owne bowells, at the bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of an outlandishe Bull, which notwithstanding was but a Leaden Bull, a paper Bull, a painted Bull, and had neither breath, mouing, nor voyce of it own, till the Calues them selues had breathed into it. But righteous art thou O Lord God, and rightfull are thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. They dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a pit for others, &amp; are fallen into it them selues. They layd a snare for thine elected, and their own feete be snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it. Yea thou hast turned their purposed mischief vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne heades. Let the Papistes still feele, and let all the world still see, how it is thou onely that fightest for vs O Lord God of Hostes. Now albeit that the brunt of that abhominable Bull, were bent directly at our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious soueraigne Lady Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; at her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Realme and faythfull subiectes: yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding forasmuch as the matter doth implyingly concerne the whole state of Christes Church, which the Romishe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ laboureth to draw away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience &amp; loue of her true husband Christ, to the adulterous imbracing of Sathan: <hi>Henry Bullinger</hi> the Elder, that godly &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:7244:3"/>
minister of Christes Gospell in the Church of Zurike, being by nation a mere strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, but by Christen Religion a deare brother vnto vs, hath (as it appeareth by his owne Epistle) written this present confutation therof in Latin, at the request or motion of certeine of our right reuerend &amp; godly Bishops. By meanes wherof, the case which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had bene more peculiar to our selues, is now become co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the true worshippers of Christ. For such is the nature &amp; bond of holy Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whatsoeuer happeneth to any seuerall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christes Church, the feeling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of disperseth it self into the whole body, so as they ioy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; sorow together, &amp; also lay all their forces together, to withstand their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enemy, &amp; to put him to flight by the power of the word, &amp; of the spirite, wherwith they be led &amp; gouerned. Therfore to the end that such as haue any where ben bewitched by the sorceries of the Romish <hi>Circe</hi> and her Idolatrous hypocrites, may returne to their right wits, &amp; ceasse to be deceaued: and that the simple &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may not be seduced by such fond toyes heerafter: He learnedly, pithely, &amp; breefly confuteth the vnhonest and shamefull slaunders of that rayling and reprochfull libell, defendeth the innocencie of our most vertuous souereigne Lady, maintaineth the Religion now stablished by publike authoritie of this Realme, disproueth the false vsurped su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of the Romane Prelates, sheweth the right vse of the keyes which Christ hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth the weaknes of the Romish Iupiters thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dercracks, and discouereth the horrible crueltie and outrage of the Popes, in maintaining their wrongfull &amp; vnmeasurable power. And heerwithall, his desire is, that the same his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may turne to the profit &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of as many as may be. For the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishment wherof, &amp; that our nation (in whose behalfe it was chiefly writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) may the more largely &amp; plenteously enioy the benefit, wherof the first cause hath

For doubtlesse, if there be any whom the present experience of our owne times can not moue: they shall see it euidently proued by this booke, that the fruite which the crediting or receauing of Popishe Buls, &amp; such other pedlary trash of Rome yeeldeth, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but horrible murther, Rebellion, slaughter, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp; all maner of diuelish &amp; mischieuous wickednesse, matched with most extreme calamitie, hartgreef, &amp; mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and in the end (vnlesse Gods wrath be pacified by time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repentance) acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with vneschewable losse both of body &amp; of soule. Wherfore, as well in consideration of the premisses, as also presuming vpon the apparant signes of your Lordships former fauour &amp; great good will towardes me: but specially forasmuch as you are of that most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, vpon whose wisedome, foresight, trustinesse, pollicie, &amp; stoutnes, God hath ordained the securitie of our most gracious soueraigne Lady, &amp; of her Maiesties Realme &amp; subiectes, &amp; (which more is) of his owne Religion and holy word to rest &amp; depend: I haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boldnes to dedicate this my trauell vnto you, assuring my selfe that your good liking &amp; well accepting of the same, shall cause it to be the more readily receaued, &amp; willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced of all others, which thing I most humbly and hartily desire.

            <head>¶The summe of the Romish Bull published against the most vertuous Queene of England, and the whole noble Realme of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst and formest it séemeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to heare the very effect of the Romish Bull. For the Bull it selfe is not worthy to be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at large, and in forme of words as they terme it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in notwithstanding we will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerslip nothing that is to any purpose, and which may séeme worth the confuting. In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of it, the Pope in most ample wordes blazeth and boasteth that vnmeasurable power of his, which he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the fulnesse of power, receiued (as he would beare men in hand) from the gouernour of all thinges our Lord Iesu Christ, which committed the catholicke and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church to one alone vpon earth, euen to Peter the prince of the Apostles, and to Peters successor the Bishop of Rome, with fulnesse of power to gouerne it, ordeining him alone to be souerein ouer all nations and all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to plucke vp, throw downe, disperse and destroy: and againe to plant, and build vp, that he might hold the Christian people together in vnitie of the spirite, and yelde them vp safe and sound to their Sauiour.</p>
            <p>Out of this fulnesse of power, mounting vp into his high throne, which he termeth the souerein seate of iustice: and taking vpon him to be both iudge and accuser, he thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringly readeth forth from thence the articles of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation which he hath to alledge against the most vertuous Quéene of England, whom euen at the first chop with a slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous mouth (vtterly proper to him self) he termeth a bondslaue of most hainous euil doings, which hath brought backe into miserable destruction, the Realme of England,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:7"/>
sometime turned away from the Church of Rome by that prince of blessed memory Henry the 8. (whom the Bull termeth a reuolted runneaway) and now of late brought againe to the Catholicke faith by Quéene Mary: and to be short, he sayth she is become the refuge of all runnegates and naughtipackes: who also willeth her selfe to be taken for onely souerein Lady in all cases both temporall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, monstruously vsurping the place of supreme head: and finally which hath presumed to dispose of Bishops, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Churches, and other Catholicke priestes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of ecclesiasticall cases, deposing and oppressing the catholicke Bishops, and aduauncing and putting in their roomes leawd preachers, and ministers of vngodlinesse. Moreouer (sayth the Bull) she hath abolished the sacrifice of the Masse, prayers, fasting, choice of meates, single life, and all catholicke rites, and commaunded bookes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine open heresie, to be set forth to the whole Realme, and wicked mysteries and ordinances receiued and obserued by her selfe according to the appointment of <hi>Caluine,</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so obserued of her subiectes. She hath forbidden the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and laitie to acknowledge the Romane Church, or to obey the commaundementes therof: yea and she hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to renounce by othe the authoritie and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Bishop of Rome: She hath layd penalties and punishmentes vpon such as shall disobey, and hath executed the same vpon such as haue continued in the vnitie of faith and obedience aforesayd: and therwithall also she hath cast the catholicke bishops in prison, where they haue ended their daies miserably, pyned in much and long languishing and dayly sorow. All which thinges are so notorious, as there is no roome left for any excuse, defence, or shift to serue in the matter.</p>
            <p>Wherfore rising now out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of his with sword drawen, and pronouncing the extremest sentence against the most vertuous Quéene, yea and against all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices through the whole Realme: he denounceth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7244:7"/>
her an hereticke, and a fauourer of heretickes, and therfore most proudly determineth her to be stricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through with his curse, and cut of from the vnitie of Christes body, and moreouer to be depriued of her kingdome, and of all right of her crowne, &amp; of all maner of other preheminence, dignitie, and priuiledge. And not content with this, he procéedeth yet further, and geueth charge to all and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the Quéenes Nobilitie, and other her subiectes, that vnder paine of the sayd curse they obey not hereafter the lawes and commaundementes of their pretensed or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Quéene, as he termeth her. Yea and in what sort soeuer they were sworne vnto the Quéene, he assoileth them all of such othe, and vtterly dischargeth them of all duetie of subiection, fealtie, and allegeance.</p>
            <p>Upon all which thinges it followeth most manifestly, that by setting that most vertuous Quéene and the noble Realme of England and other nations at oddes among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, he doth most cruelly and wickedly put her in hazard both of her foes, and of her frendes: yea and (which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to be heard) of her owne subiectes to be trayterously torne in péeces through ciuill warres and most outragious seditions, if there were any so mad, and so voyde of all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and manhood, as to suffer such (that is to wit, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilishe and hellish) furie to be so inspired into them by the inchauntmentes of this venemous beast.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I haue declared what thinges are conteined and set forth in that wicked, slaunderous, seditious, and bloudy Bull. Of which thinges, if any man be desirous to haue a more compendious abridgment, and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as fully presumptuous and shamelesse as that which hath béen shewed already: let him heare what maner of title the Bull hath set before it to the face of the world. <hi>The sentence declaratorie of our most holy father Pope Pius the fifth, against Elizabeth the pretensed Queene of England, and the heretickes that cleaue vnto her. Wherby also all her subiectes are declared
<pb facs="tcp:7244:8"/>
assoiled of their othe of allegeance, and of all other duties whatsoeuer, and those that obey her heerafter are wrapped in the same curse.</hi>

               <head>¶That the foresayd vnmeasurable power of the Romish Bishop, is not proued by these wordes of the Lord vnto Peter: <hi>Peter louest thou me? feede my sheepe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HItherto you haue patiently heard the Popes sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or declaration by his Bull, against the most vertuous Quéene of England. &amp;c. and now I pray you be so good as gently to heare me also. I will bréefly and plainly shew, how there is no truth, substance, or soundnesse in this Bull, and that the cause which the Hope maintaineth and pleadeth against the most noble Quéene, is euill and vniust: but the case on the Quéenes side very good and rightfull. And I will begin at that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable power of the Pope, which he boasteth of, and by force whereof he taketh vpon him to be iudge in this case. For that being once ouerthrowen: all the whole Bull falleth to the ground, together with the iudgement builded vpon this ruinous foundation, and so shall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope sit in that seate of his, not a terrible or iust iudge, but an Idoll, to be despised, yea and to be spit at of all good men, and his sentences shall be no more the thunderboltes of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but counterfait flashes glistering out of a basen, in no wise worthy to be regarded.<note place="margin">What y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes beare men in hand concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power.</note> Then let that most holy or rather most prophane father tell vs, where or by what wordes, <hi>our Lord deliuered vnto Peter alone, and vnto Peters successor the Bishop of Rome, that his fulnesse of power:</hi> that is to say, his supreme and most absolute power, <hi>as well in spirituall as in temporall matters.</hi> Let him tell vs where or by what wordes, <hi>the Lord crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Bishop of Rome prince ouer all nations and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all kingdomes.</hi> I am not ignorant of your stincking
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7244:8"/>
and vnsauerie fables in this behalfe. I am not ignorant what Decretalls haue béene put forth by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ix. <hi>Boniface</hi> the viij. <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. <hi>Clement</hi> the v. <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxij. and such other like to these, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spirators &amp; <hi>Catilines</hi> companions. As for me, I will not heare those decrées or Decretalls, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous Lawyer <hi>Marsilius</hi> of Padwa, no lesse aptly than truely sayd to be neither Gods lawes nor mans lawes, but proclamations of plaine vniuersall souereintie. You say that without any parable at all, Christ our Lord gaue the fulnesse of power which ye brag of, to Peter, and to Peters successor the Pope. Bring forth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some euident record of this your allegation, out of the new Testament. Truely ye be not able to bring forth one tittle, or one iote of this your allegation. And therfore with most wicked lyes, and forgeries haue both you and your predecessors now certaine hundred yeares, scared and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced good men, that leaned too much vnto you through too light beléef, and ouermuch fearfulnesse.</p>
               <p>For where as they haue alledged the wordes which our Lord after his Resurrection did thrise repeate and vrge vpon Peter, namely, <hi>Peter louest thou me? feede my sheepe:</hi> Certes I wonder that both they, and you are so past all shame, that ye dare bring these thinges for the stablishing of your kingdome, or rather your tyranny. As who would say, we be all of vs blind, or blockes, voyde of common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not able to perceaue how those wordes perteine not to souereintie, but to seruice. Peter was by this meane to be comforted by the Lord, and to be restored to the name and office of Apostle, which he séemed to haue lost at the Lordes passion, chéefly in this respect, because he had a fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fall then the rest of the Apostles, insomuch as he had thrée times denied, yea and also forsworne his Lorde and Master. Therefore least by his thrise denying he might séeme put out of his office of Apostleship: the Lord on the other side by his thrise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing of his loue, and enioyning him his charge, receaueth him againe and admitteth him
<pb facs="tcp:7244:9"/>
to the office of Apostleship, to féede the Lordes flocke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the rest of the Lordes Apostles. For who can say, that the féeding of the Lordes shéepe was committed to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely, and not to the other Apostles also?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An obiection.</note>But Peter was inflamed with singular loue, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Lord, and toward his Church. The same loue doth the Lord require of euery shepheard of the flocke.<note place="margin">The answere.</note> But what (I pray you) perteineth that to the Bishop of Rome, who (to speake no worse of him) burneth in desire of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, riches, &amp; voluptuousnesse? The Lord bad Peter féede the Lordes flocke. He hath also committed the charge of his flocke, to all faythfull ministers that loue him vnfainedly.</p>
               <p>Againe, what maketh this to the ratifying of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Romish Bishop? To féede, is not to aduance mans selfe aboue all power, to make kinges and princes subiecte to him, and to vsurpe fulnesse of power ouer all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and all things: but to féede,<note place="margin">To feede.</note> is to teach, to exhort, to rebuke, to comfort, and to gouerne Christes flocke according to Gods word.<note place="margin">Shepeheards, Pastors, or Feeders.</note> Shepeheardes therfore are the teachers in the Church, which féede the Lordes flock by preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For the foode of Christes shéepe is his word.<note place="margin">Foode.</note> And the shéepe, are Christes chosen, and the people of God.

                  <hi>I which am also an elder &amp; a witnesse of Christes afflictions, and also a partener of the glory that shall be reuealed, beseech the elders that are among you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Harken to this ye Romish Monarkes.</note> 
                  <hi>feede Christes flocke as much as in you is, playing the Bishops, or taking care of it, not constrainedly, but willingly, not seeking filthely after gaine, but of an earnestly affected mind: not as though ye were Lordes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the parishes, but so as ye may be patterns to the flocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lift vp your eares here ye Romish Monarkes, harken,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7244:9"/>
and marke what your owne Peter sayth. He nameth not him selfe Lord, head, or prince, but fellowe elder: yea and as for the Lordlinesse and other fowle vices wherwith you be so bespotted, or rather allberayed: he forbiddeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of them. And Christ he hath set forth the high shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in singular humilitie, and faith to be looked at, and him to be serued. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After the same maner speaketh also the Apostle Paule in the Actes of the Apostles, to the shepeheardes that were assembled in the Synod of <hi>Miletum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.</note> saying: <hi>Take heede to your selues, and to the whole flocke wherein the holy Ghost hath made you Bishops</hi> (whom Luke a little before called priestes or elders) <hi>to feede the congregation of God, which he hath purchased with his bloud.</hi> Againe, the same Paule a little afore in the same oration of his, declareth after what sort he him selfe had hitherto in that vocation of his fed the Lordes flocke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him, and sayth: <hi>I haue shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned none of those things that were for your profit, but haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto you, and taught you openly and priuately, witnessing both to the Iewes and to the Grekes, the repentaunce towardes God, and the fayth toward our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth then by this plaine expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apostle,<note place="margin">What y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sheepe or flocke be.</note> more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the light, that (according as I haue sayd a litle erst, and now againe am glad in repeating the same do gather it out of the Apostles wordes, to the end I may the better beate the truth into all mens heades, against most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full leasinges) the flocke or shéepe are the Lordes people or Church. For the Apostle sayd: <hi>Take heede to your selues, and to the whole flocke, wherin the holy Ghost hath made you Bishops, to feede the Church of God.</hi> And so the shepeheardes are the teachers,<note place="margin">Teachers.</note> ministers that féede the flocke by teaching and preaching openly and priuately. And so the foode is rightly sayd to be doctrine:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> and yet not euery doctrine, but the doctrine which (as Paul sayth) <hi>teacheth repentaunce to Godward, and beleefe in Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I say is the sound, simple, and not any strange,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:10"/>
racked, or wrested exposition of Christes wordes [<hi>feede my sheepe:</hi>] but taken out of the very own wordes of the Lord him selfe and of his Apostles, and therefore to be preferred before all other interpretations, and none other that disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth with this (what interpreter soeuer be the author therof, be he olde or be he new) is to be admitted or recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Therfore no man néede now to dout that it is out of all dout, that by these the Lordes wordes, <hi>feede my sheepe,</hi> there is not graunted neither to Peter, nor to the Bishop of Rome, that fulnesse of power which these men boast of, and which they beare the world in hand to be geuen by those wordes.</p>
               <p>I could also alledge other testimonies for our side con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this maner of féeding out of the Prophets, as out of the iii. chapt. of Ieremy, and the xxxiiii. of Ezechiell, but that I labour to be short.<note place="margin">The maner of the Bishop of Romes fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> Yet, because I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblingly skippe ouer any thing in this matter, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that the Romish Bishop hath also very euident wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Prophets of his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and of his maner of féeding. For Zacharie protesteth and sayth:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Lorde sayd vnto me, yet take vnto thee the tooles of a foolish shepeheard. For beholde I raise vp a shepeheard vpon the earth, which shall not visite the thing that is cut vp, nor seeke the thing that is youthfull or foolishe, nor heale the thing that is broozed, nor feede the thing that standeth: and shall eate the fleshe of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, &amp; breake of their hoofes.

For the Lord in those his wordes vnto Peter, teacheth vs not only that thing, but also this: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our standing out in temptations, is not by our own strength, but by the defence, helpe, and benefite of Christe our Lord, who doubtlesse geueth, increaseth, and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth fayth in vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.</note> which Iohn in his Epistle calleth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory that ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the world.

               <p>When the Lord after supper, as he was goyng to the garden of mount Oliuet, bad his disciples sell euen their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7244:11"/>
garmentes and get them swordes:<note place="margin">Christes bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples buy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> swordes.</note> and vpon the answer of his disciples how they had two in redinesse, sayd they were enowe: he did not then deliuer both the swordes as well spirituall as temporall, to be vsed in the Church vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to whome onely and peculiarly he did not then speake. For by and by he addeth the cause of this his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saying: I say vnto you, yet must this Scripture be fulfilled in mée, <hi>and he was reckoned among offenders,</hi> verely meaning thereby, that he should vppon mounte Oliuet be bound and led away as a transgressor, and that his disciples also should be put in extreme hazarde of their liues: from which notwithstanding he would deliuer them, not by the terror of any sworde, but by his owne only voyce or power. The Lord then ment another thing, yea and a farre other thing, than to yeld the vse of the temporall sword, and this endlesse authoritie either to Peter, or to any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nay rather whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his disciples were redy armed to fight, he ment too set before their eyes, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mount Oliuet, that in the persecutions which should come vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his sake, they should not be deliuered by the helpe of temporall swordes, but by the ayde and worde of their maister Christ, saying: if ye séeke me, let these go their wayes. And to this end did the Lord suffer Peter to draw his sworde, and to make as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault vpon Malchus the bishops seruaunt. But what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled Peter by that? So little did he with that sworde of his deliuer himselfe or his fellowdisciples, (and much lesse his maister) from the present daungers: that he had rather turned the bloudy weapons of his enemies vpon himselfe, if his maister had not sayd, let these go their wayes. Then was it Christes protection, and not the sword, that saued the disciples: and euen at this day also, as many as be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in persecution, are saued by the same defence. Which thing he ment to shew to the eye by those swordes, both to them and to vs: warning vs couertly by the way, that in persecution we must turne vnto Christ and craue his help, who is able euen with a worde to asswage any manner of
<pb facs="tcp:7244:12"/>
tempestes, be they neuer so outragious. And to this purpose serued the swordes, at leastwise which were brought at this tyme and to this ende to mount Oliuete at the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Christ.</p>
               <p>Besides this, the Lord expounding his owne woordes, turneth hym vnto Peter and sayth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</note> put vp thy sword into the sheathe, for all they that take the sword, shall perish w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sword. Thinkest y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> not that I can presently pray to my father, and he will geue me mo then xij. legions of angels. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled? for so must it bée. Séeing therfore that the Lord commaundeth Peter earnestly to put vp his sworde into the scaberd: who séeth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lordes bidding of his disciples to cary out swords with them, was to the end that now by this sight, he might openly and effectually and without all couerture, restraine the vse of the sword, both from Peter, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ministers, yea and to plucke it out of their handes when they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it already? Considering then how the Lord pulled that temporall sword out of the handes of Peter: what wicked féend willeth you Bishops to draw the sworde againe out of the scaberd, contrary to the Lordes commaundement, &amp; to shake it, and to misuse it at your owne pleasure? Doth it not irke you and shame you to say, that by these wordes of of the Lordes, is sufficiently geuen vnto you the power of both swordes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you so little or nothing at all therof hitherto, that he hath euen openly striken the temporall sword out of your handes? Now let the whole world iudge whether those Romish gripes haue proued by the foresayd textes of Scripture, that Christ hath geuen vnto them the very full power of both the swordes. Certesse the testimonies which they haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alledged out of the Scriptures, haue not onely not geuen any thing too them: but also taken from them all the thinges which they clayme to themselues against all right and reason.</p>

For in these and by him, they auouch themselues to haue receiued power and most full soueraigntie, both of heauen &amp; earth. And there they blaze out wonders of the building of the Church vpon Peter, and of the keyes and wonderfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king power of them, alledging for themselues the wordes of our sauiour which are written in the xvi. chap. of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of S.

Which thing by gods helpe I wil euidently shew to the godly readers by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things that ensew. The Lord in that place demaundeth of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whom men take him to bée. His disciples aunswer, how there be diuers iudgementes and opinions of hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people: some saying him to be Helias, some Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, &amp;c. And by that question it was the Lordes wil to do them to wit, how there haue alway bene, &amp; alwayes shalbe diuersitie of opinions in the world concerning religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how be it, that no man ought to be offended at that diuersitie: for we read also the Lordes Apostle hath sayd there must néedes be heresies,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> to the ende, that such as be tryed among you, may be made manifest. And vnto the former questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Lord addeth forthwith an other, namely, what the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples who had heard Christ now a long while, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doutlesse were better séene in matters of Religion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7244:13"/>
the common sort were, I say what opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they themselues had of Christ. And by this other question of his he shewed, that the sure and true confession in matters of Religion is to be asked at the hand of the children of God: for they must not wauer as the children of this world do, and be sure of nothing, nor apply themselues to euery kinde of opinion after the liking and course of this world. Truly in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the scripture also, is required a singular and true confession of fayth, at the handes of euery one of gods children. To this question Saint Peter, not so much in his owne name, as in the name of all the other disciples, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a singular confession, saying: Thou art Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of the liuing God, very God (I say) and very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen that same anoynted, namely, the Messias or Christ that was to come into the world. The king I say, and priest, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, pacifier, redéemer, and saluation of the whole worlde. And that this confession is the true and sincere confession, Paule also the apostle of Christ, sheweth in the third, fourth and tenth chapters to the Romaines, and in many other places.</p>
               <p>The Lord liking well of this confession, sayth vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Blessed art thou Simon the sonne of Ionas: geuing to vnderstand in these short wordes, what and how great the force of true fayth in Christ is: namely, euen to iustify and make blessed, that is to say, to make pertakers of eternall life, which thing the apostle sheweth in large wordes in his Epistles to the Romaines, Galathians, Ephesians, &amp; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. Furthermore the Lord immediatly addeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence commeth that same so excellent fayth, saying: flesh &amp; bloud hath not opened it vnto thée, but my father which is in heauen. Fayth then hath not his originall in vs or of vs, but is geuen vs from heauen by the father of lyght, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Apostle witnesseth in many places, and the Lord himselfe saith in Iohn:<note place="margin">

vs Christians, for there followeth in the Lordes wordes, <hi>And thou art Peter,</hi> namely, for confessing of the rocke. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> now what a rocke is, there is no man but he knoweth. And in the scriptures it is euery where Metaphorically ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto God, because he is the strength, the stedinesse, the refuge, and the foundation of the faythfull, wheruppon they rest, and in whom only they be preserued. Of this <hi>(Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra)</hi> rocke, was Simon the sonne of Ionas called Peter, which name implyeth as much as if a man shoulde say, grounded vpon the rocke God, and grafted into Christ the sonne of God: stedfast, and so consequently a Christian, for the doctors &amp; interpreters of holy scripture do terme Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, Peters also, because that beyng setled by fayth vpon the rocke Christ, they draw stedinesse, strength, and lyfe out of him, so as through the operacion of Christ, they be all their lyfe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g stedfast in fayth, &amp; honor Christ with all kind of vertues. And Peter himselfe also expounding this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> sayeth: <hi>Christ (the rocke) is the lyuing stone, forsaken in deede of men, but chosen and precious vnto God, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whom we also as liuely stones are builded, that we may be a spirituall house, offeryng spirituall sacrifices, acceptable to God through Iesus Christ.</hi> Whosoeuer are not such Peters or stones, there is no cause that they should glory at all of the name of Peter or Christians: for they continue that which they bée, euen the children of this world.</p>
               <p>There followeth yet further in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes wordes, <hi>And vpon this Rocke will I build my Church.</hi> By which woordes Christ ascending from the particular to the generall, and deliuering an vniuersall lesson to his Church, declareth most manifestly, that these thinges belong not to Peter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or to his disciples onely: but to the Catholike, that is, to the vniuersal church, wherof the foundacion, Rocke, and head, is Christ, vpon whom being builded by faith, she shal obtayne saluation. As if the Lord had sayd, not onely Peter is so called, of me the Rocke, but also as many as shal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb facs="tcp:7244:14"/>
by Peters example, confesse me to be Christ the sonne of the liuing God, and by this true fayth settle themselues vpon me the onely foundation: all them will I take and acknowledge for my household, that is to say for my church And this (that is to say) Christ the Rocke shall be the only foundation of Gods church in earth: and all they shall be members and citizens of this holy church, euen as many as beleue as Peter did, and settle themselues vpon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of soule health by the same fayth. And this is it, that the Lord ment by saying: <hi>And vpon this Rocke will I builde my Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And least any man may doubt of this simple and true exposition of the Lordes wordes, considering how diuers wrest them, and draw them some one way and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Behold, I will by other places of scripture also, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and enlighten this exposition aboue recited. Surely, the scripture doth euery where agréeably witnesse, that by fayth onely in Christ, we be iustified &amp; grafted into Christ, and made members of Christ and his church, which is the communion of all saintes, that is to say of the faythfull, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vpon Christ: and that no creature (no not eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter himselfe, &amp; much lesse the bishop of Rome) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the Rocke, the head, &amp; the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Catholike church. And least any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may thinke this thyng hard and varying from the truth: forasmuch as it is directly against the decrées of the Romish church: Loe, I in this case bring in the cleare and vndoubted recordes of the holy Ghost himselfe speaking by the prophetes and Apostles. Dauid in the 18. psalme cryeth out,<note place="margin">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7244:14"/>
in all pointes agréeth the witnesse of S. Peter,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2.</note> who sheweth out of Dauid, that Iesus is that stone or Rocke, wherupon it behoueth them to be builded by fayth, which will become the house of God, or be made pertakers of the churche of Christ. Which thinges being vndoubtedly so: These wordes of the Lord, <hi>Vpon this Rocke will I build my Church,</hi> must of necessitie be vnderstoode of Christ alone, as who reigneth from heauen in his saintes, as the head doth in the members, and from whom as the liuely head, they be watered with the spirite, and sucke lyfe out of hym, and through him do liue a lyfe beséeming hym. And to be a head (as it is most manifestly gathered by the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) is to be a Lord and Sauiour, and to inspire life into the members that be subiect to the head. Neither may the head at any time be from the body without the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body. Seing then that Christ is the onely head of the Church, it behoueth him to be alwayes with his Church. By reason wherof she hath no néed of any deputie or vicegerent vpon earth. For a deputie or vicegerent is the deputie or vicegerent of him that is absent. But Christ is euermore present with his Church: For he sayth in the Gospell: <hi>I will be with you euen to the vttermost end of the world, &amp; will neuer leaue you comfortlesse.</hi> Our religion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willeth vs, and the vniforme doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles willeth vs to expound these thinges, not of Peter or of the Bishop of Rome, but of Christ only. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ye méete with any interpreters, be they olde or new, that interprete the foresayd wordes of our Lord to be ment of Peter and the Pope: the authoritie of the Prophets and Apostles, yea and of this selfsame Peter too, ought to beare more sway with you, than the authoritie of any men els, whatsoeuer they be in the world. For Christ abideth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly the foundation of his Church: and as for Peter, and the rest of the Apostles, and the ministers that haue come in their roomes, they remaine as workmaisters of this building, which build, not vpon them selues being me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:15"/>
but vpon this onely and euerlasting foundation, according as the Apostle teacheth plainly in the third chapt. of the first Epistle to the Corinth. And let this be our brazen wall.</p>
               <p>Neither fighteth it against this, that in the Apocalips the Citie of God is sayd to haue twelue foundations, and the names of the twelue Apostles written in them. For (sayth Paule) <hi>there can none other foundation be layd then is layd already:</hi> notwithstanding, forasmuch as in the laying of this foundation, that is to say, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of Christ, the Apostles were Gods workfellowes &amp; bestowed their trauell faythfully theraboutes: therfore that Citie is sayd to haue twelue foundations. For otherwise, the Apostle in his 2. chapt. to the Ephesians sayth: <hi>You are fellow citizens wyth the sainctes, and Gods houshold meyny, builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, whereof the corner stone is Christ Iesus him selfe, in whom the whole buildyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng semented together, groweth to a temple in the Lorde, vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you also are builded, to be a dwellyng place for God through hys spirite.</hi> And what man that hath his right wits, will, after these thinges, séeke for manifester? Wherfore let all of vs beware of that rotten and tottering fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation which the Court of Rome striueth to set vnder vs.</p>
               <p>We will yet héerunto adde the wordes of our Lorde that follow after, least any thing of this place may remain vndiscussed. And the <hi>gates of hell</hi> (sayth Christ) <hi>shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle agaynst it.</hi> By which wordes is declared the power and victoriousnesse of Christ, and of his Church, &amp; of fayth. The gates of hell are all kinde of powers that are against it, yea euen the power of Sathan, which of all other is the strongest and noysomnest to the faythfull. And therfore it is sayd, that no force be it neuer so mighty, whether it be of Sathan him selfe, or of the world, or of any other aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary power vnder heauen or in hell, shall preuaile against Christ the Rocke, and the Church that is builded vpon the rocke, which howsoeuer it be tempted and persecuted, must notwithstanding at length ouercome in Christ, through

fayth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.</note> For the Lord him selfe hath sayd: <hi>The prince of this world is already condemned and cast out.</hi>

Also, who is he that ouercommeth the world, but he whych beleueth that Iesus is the sonne of God?</hi> So I say, this place is opened plainly inough by laying together of the Scriptures. Now if I listed to play the Rhetoricien héere, I could with many wordes declare, that hell gates do not onely preuaile against the Romishe Bishops and their Court, the filthiest that euer was: but also that the very prince of féendes him selfe obteineth full and onely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereintie in them. Which thing I could without trouble shew and proue both by the witnesse and by the complaints of the Bishops them selues. But let vs ouerpasse that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable filthinesse, and make hast to the opening of the residue of this place. For there is no man so blockishe, that hath not now of late euen felt with his handes, that in these wordes of the Lord there is nothing spoken of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable power of the Pope, but that there be set out vnto vs farre more heauenly and healthfuller thinges.

               <p>THe Lorde addeth vnto the premisses: <hi>And I will geue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou byndest vpon earth shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou loosest vppon earth shall be loosed in heauen.</hi>

By which wordes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord sheweth againe, that this charge concerning blessednesse and eternall life, which he hath he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto layd forth, perteineth not onely to Peter or the rest of the Apostles, but also vnto all men through the whole world. Moreouer he sheweth the meane and maner how men are brought into the Church, that is to say, how they be builded vpon the Rocke and made members of Christ and the Church, and so enter into the kingdome of heauen. You Apostles (sayth the Lord) shall open the way, and as it were by reaching out your handes bring men into the company of me and of my Saintes, and consequently into the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and that shall be done by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell. <hi>For by fayth we be graffed into Christ and his Church. But fayth commeth by hearing, and hearing by the preaching of the Gospell.</hi> And therfore (sayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord) I will geue you the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, that is, I will commit vnto you the charge of preaching the Gospell, to this end, that you shall go out into the whole world, and by declaring vnto all men the remission of sinnes through me, set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loose that be fettered in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaines of their sinnes, and open the kingdome of heauen to them that beleue: and on the other side bynde those that shake of the preaching of the Gospell, that is to say, declare and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto them that they be subiect to eternall damnation. And this your declaration and witnessing shall be so rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and assured, that whomsoeuer ye loose or binde by my worde vpon earth, them will I also account as loosened or bound in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this is the simple meaning of Christes wordes, flowing out of the wordes them selues, without any racking of the wordes at all. Which meaning I will more cléerly enlighten and more assuredly confirme by that which ensueth.</p>
               <p>The worde <hi>Keyes,</hi> are not vttered alwayes in one signification in the Scripture: For otherwise there is no man but he knoweth what they be in their proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: that is to wit, tooles wherwithall the lockes of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7244:16"/>
doores, chestes, and such other thinges are opened or shut. And they be conueyed ouer from bodily thinges to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thinges, from earthly thinges to heauenly thinges: and sometime they be taken for souerein and full power, like as when we read in the Apocalips that Christ hath the keyes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of death, and of hell. For by that phrase of spéech is betokened that Christ hath the souerein and most absolute power or authoritie to gouerne the kingdome of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and also full power ouer death it self, and ouer hell, and that he is able to deliuer from death, or to thrust down into hell whomsoeuer he listeth. These Keyes, that is to say, this power, belongeth onely vnto Christ, and no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is partaker of it. Wherupon also in the Apocalips the Lord sayth with a vehemencie, <hi>I haue the Keyes:</hi> and he sayth not, I haue had, but I haue, I say I haue them yet still, and will haue them euer, &amp; I resigne them to no man.</p>
               <p>There is also the Key of knowledge, and the Key of the kingdome of heauen, whereof we intreate at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. The Key of knowledge is instruction, wherby a mans vnderstanding is opened, and his want of skill amended. And the Key of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a plaine or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some declaration or laying forth of thinges, whereby men are taught, what way they may goe into heauen, or how they may be saued. I faine nothing of mine owne head in this behalfe, in these thinges I followe the Scripture, and for mine exposition I alledge the very worde of Christ say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Gospell after S. Luke:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe be to you Lawyers, whych haue taken away the key of knowledge: ye entred not in your selues, and them that came in, ye forbad.</hi> Which wordes of the Lord, Mathew vttereth in this wise: <hi>Woe be to you Scrybes and Pharyseys, for ye shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: ye your selues goe not in, neyther suffer ye them that come, to enter in.</hi> Behold, looke what Luke called <hi>the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the key of knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 23.</note> that doth Matthew call <hi>the shuttyng vp of the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And therefore what els I pray you is it to bring forth the keyes of the
<pb facs="tcp:7244:17"/>
kingdome of heauen, then to bring forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keyes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is to say, the doctrine which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, through the instruction whereof we may know how to become partakers of the euerlasting salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Againe, to take away the keyes of knowledge or of the kingdome of heauen, is nothing els but to withstand the doctrine of the Gospell concerning the kingdome of God, or to assault it, or to geue commaundement that it be not preached. You therfore enter not in (sayth the Lorde) I meane by harkening to my doctrine: ye beleue not, that ye might be saued: neither suffer ye them to enter which come and are desirous of my doctrine concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that is to say, which would faine heare and beleue my doctrine, that by faith they might be made heires of Gods kingdome, while you slaunder my doctrine and my workes, as though they procéeded from Sathan, and therefore were to be abhorred and eschewed of good men. And by these wordes of the Lord it appeareth most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, that the keyes wherof he speaketh here in S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, saying, <hi>and to thee will I geue the keyee of the kingdome of heauen,</hi> are not any other thing then the charge of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospell, committed by the Lord to the ministers of his Church, that by the sayd publishing of the Gospell, they might open the kingdome of heauen to the beleuers, and shut it against the vnbeleuers.</p>
               <p>But if these thinges which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (if I be not deceaued) I take to be euident &amp; strong inough) do not yet satisfie you: beholde I will vnfolde this whole matter of the keyes yet an other way, though nothing differing from the interpretation which I haue set downe already, as in respect of the pith of the matter. The worde keyes are also vsed in the Scripture, for the care &amp; ordering of an house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. For the seruauntes whom the master of any house setteth in office, haue keyes deliuered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherewith to open and shut, and to order all the house: which thing is wont to be done by the Stewardes or Comptrollers, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7244:17"/>
haue the chéef charge of the house. By meanes wherof the keyes also are taken for the very charge, the ordering, or the gouerning of the house. Héere againe I faine nothing of my self,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay.</hi> 22.</note> I follow the holy Scriptures. For in Esay the Lord sayth: <hi>I wyll lay the key of the house of Dauid vpon the shoulder of Eliachim, which shall open and no man shall shut, and shall shut and no man shall open.</hi> And what els is this, then if he had said without figure, I wil put <hi>Sobna</hi> out of office, and make <hi>Eliachim</hi> Lord Treasurer, and commit the gouernement of the Realme or of king <hi>Ezechias</hi> palace, which charge he shall performe with so great faithfulnesse and authoritie, that whatsoeuer he ordaineth, shall stand sure and inuiolable, and whatsoeuer he disanulleth, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall attempt to ratifie. In like respect are the keyes of the kingdome of heauen sayd to be geuen to the Apostles and other ministers, I meane the gouerning or housholdly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Church, therby to bring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the kingdome of heauen, or to shut them out of the partenership thereof. Which surely can be none other, then that which it accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as the chéef, namely, the message of Gods worde, I meane the preaching of the Gospell of Iesu Christ, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the remission of sinnes, and euerlasting life. The which truely is so certaine and sure, that looke whom the ministers absolue from their sinnes by it, they are also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly acquit before God, and whom the ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne by the worde for their vnbeléefes sake, those remain also condemned to destruction before God.</p>
               <p>And as for these thinges which I haue layd forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ordering of a housholde by Stewardes, that is to say, concerning the ordering of the Church by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, they are not differing from the worde of God. For the Lord in his Gospell rehearseth a parable of a man that went from home and committed the charge of his house to his seruauntes which should be as Stewardes to order his house. Which Parable certesse is applyed to the Church the house of God, and to the ministers placed in the same,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:18"/>
that in gouerning it they may chéefly beautifie it with the preaching of the Gospell. For in the same Gospell the Lord sayth againe: <hi>Who (thinkest thou) is that faythfull and wise seruaunt, whom his Lord hath set ouer his housholde to geue them meate in due season?</hi> But who knoweth not what the meate of the Church is? Truely Paule writing to a Bishop, that is to say, to an ouerséer or steward of the Church, sayth: <hi>Indeuour to yeeld thy selfe an allowable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vnto God, not to be ashamed of, and rightly distributing the worde of truth.</hi> And the same Apostle speaking yet more manifestly of the ministers and the housholde order of the Church, sayth: <hi>Let a man so esteeme you as the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and housholde guides or stewardes of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God.</hi> Then the which, I pray you what can be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more fully and plainly in this our case? Christ our Lord ordained in his Church, ministers and not Lordes, ministers or seruauntes I say to be stewardes or dealers forth of Gods mysteries in the Church, that is to say, of the Gospell, and of the thinges that are annexed to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For so doth the Lord him selfe expound the worde Mysterie in the xiii. chapt. of Mathew: and so doth Paule also in the third to the Ephesians. These keyes, that is to say, this charge &amp; houshold order of gouerning the Church, which is executed according to the appointment of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Iesus Christ, did the Apostles receaue, and after them all ministers of Churches that be lawfully called to the same office.</p>

               <head>¶What is ment in the Gospell by loosing and binding: and how Christes Apostles did loose and binde.</head>
               <p>NOw although our Lorde sayd, <hi>I will geue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,</hi> and that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way he made no mention in the processe following, of opening and shutting, which are the properties of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7244:18"/>
keyes: yet did he set down other termes in their stead, that is to wit, <hi>to loose and to binde,</hi> by which doutlesse he ment to shew the power of the keyes, and after what maner the Apostles doe either open or shut heauen with the keyes. They open when they vnbinde or let loose (for both those thinges come to one point) and they shut whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they binde. To let loose therefore is to open: and to shut is to binde. Otherwise to binde is a word of knowen signification. For the officer bindeth, which at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of his lord casteth a man in prison, or by some other way hampereth him in bondes. And he looseth, which dischargeth a man from bondes or bringeth him out of prison. This thing is conueyed ouer from the body to the minde. For bondes in the Scripture betoken as well spirituall as bodily impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment. To loose therefore is to open the prison of sinnes by preaching forgeuenesse of sinnes, through Christ, who onely releaseth sinnes and bringeth out of prison. Which thing shall be the rightlyer vnderstood, if we vewe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider more néerly this saying of the Prophet which the Lord Iesus him selfe expoundeth in the Synagog of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in S. Luke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 4.</note> saying: <hi>The spirite of the Lord is vpon me</hi> (meaning vpon Christ) <hi>because he hath annointed me, and hath sent me to bring glad tidynges to the poore, to heale them that be hart broken, to preach release to the prisoners, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of sight to the blynd, and to set the broosed at lybertie.</hi> Héerunto adde also that which the same Lord said in Iohn:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Like as the father hath sent me, so send I you: Whose sinnes soeuer you release, they are released vnto them, and whose sinnes soeuer you retayne, they be retayned.</hi> The sonne of God then sent out his disciples after the same maner that he him self was sent out by the father. But the sonne of God (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Prophet hath auouched) was sent to bring glad tidinges to the poore, &amp; to preach deliueraunce to prisoners: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Apostles also were sent forth to shew glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges, and to preach deliueraunce to prisoners. Which thing when they do, then open they heauen by the keyes,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:19"/>
and let loose them that were tyde in the bondes of sinne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing them their sinnes, that is to say, witnessing by the Gospell, that their sinnes are released by fayth through Christ. For the Apostles release not sinne otherwise then by the warrant of the Gospell, which auoucheth vnto them that onely Christ by his owne merite forgeueth sinnes. For like as the Apostles are not sent to offer them selues in sacrifice for the clensing of the whole world as Christ was, the sacrifice of whom alone clenseth away the sinnes of the whole world: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so doutlesse the Apostles were not sent to forgeue sinnes by their owne authoritie as Christ did, but to witnesse vnto men that they be forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith through Christ. For we must in these cases aduisedly and with a conscience obserue the matching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> superior with the inferior, so as we may yéeld to ech partie that which is his owne, and not wickedly attribute that glory vnto ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, which is due to the onely sonne of God. Certesse <hi>Austine</hi> behauing him selfe reuerently in these matters, sayth peremptorily, that Christ worketh these thinges by power, and that the disciples do the thinges which they do, by seruice or seruauntly. Wherof more shall follow anon. Also Marke and Luke handling the same story which Iohn hath touched in his xx. chapt. do witnesse that in the talke which Christ hath in the day of his resurrection, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els betaken to the Disciples, but the office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospell. For in Marke the Lord sayth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe into the whole world and preach the Gospell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 24.</note> And in Luke he sayth: <hi>So behoued it Christ to suffer, &amp; to rise againe from the dead the third day, and repentaunce and forgeuenesse of sinnes to be preached to all nations in his name.</hi> And therefore by laying all these places of Scripture together, it is made most manifest and vndouted, that the keyes which were geuen to Peter and the other Apostles, is nothing els but the ministration of preaching the Gospel, wherby the way is opened for the world into heauen, &amp; wherby (to be short) is declared most assured release and forgeuenesse of sinnes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7244:19"/>
through fayth in Christ, to such as beleue. Wherunto also séemeth to perteine this most elegant and fit sentence of the Lord speaking with Paule: <hi>I will make thee a witnesse and messenger</hi> (marke how he sayth, <hi>a witnesse and messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>) <hi>and will send thee vnto nations and realmes, to open their eyes, that they may be turned from darknesse to light, and from the power of Sathan vnto God, so as they may receaue forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, and lot among those that be sanctified by the fayth which is to meward.</hi> You haue in these wordes a most exacte description of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. Wherunto to adde any more, I thinke it but superfluous.</p>
               <p>Now if vnto all these thinges, ye will adde the practise of the Apostles (as they terme it) and diligently search out how they haue vsed the keyes that were deliuered to them, and after what sort they haue opened or shut the kingdome of heauen vnto men, and also in what wise they haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound them or loosed them: ye shal no where in all the new Testament finde them to haue exercised the Popishe practise, that is to wit, that the Apostles haue set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues downe in the places where they came to preach the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and saluation, and commaunded me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come vnto them, and there to crouch or to knéele after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worshippers, and to shriue them selues, that is to say, to poure out all their thoughtes, wordes, and déedes, with all the circumstances of them into the eare or lap of the confessor as he sits, and to craue of him the absolution of their sinnes, with enioynance of satisfaction: and that he on the other side laying his handes vpon the head of the shriftman, whispered an absolution of sinnes ouer him in an ordinary forme of wordes, and enioyned him a certaine satisfaction by the workes of penance. Much lesse shall ye finde that the Apostles installed them selues in thrones, and thrust downe sinners into hell by sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. &amp;c. What then? Looke vpon the Actes of the Apostles, or rather goe through that booke, wherein Luke hath most diligently written the notable sayinges and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
<pb facs="tcp:7244:20"/>
of the Apostles (and specially of Paule) without ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipping of any thing which tended to soule health, or was necessary to be knowen, and therwithall hath in xxviii. chapters set forth as many yeares, that is to wit, the things that the Apostles did by the space of xxviii. yeares together in the matter of saluation: and thou shalt not finde in all that great worke, that all and euery of the Apostles did any thing els then agreably and constantly in all places and in euery place preach the Gospell, and promise remission of sinnes and euerlasting life to such as beleued in Christ: and on the contrary part, threaten endlesse and most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red damnation to them that beleued not. Thus (I say) did the Apostles vse the keyes which they receaued of the Lord. Thus did they binde and loose. If they would haue had any other thing, or any thing more to haue bene done in the Church by their successors, they would not haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled it by the space of xxviii. yeares preaching, in all their doinges which Luke hath most faythfully written. And among other places of the Actes of the Apostles, let the godly read the second, x.xiii.xvi. and xviii. chapters, and they will beare witnesse that the thinges which I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken héere are most true, yea and also thinke them selues satisfied in this case. I speake of such as are not contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for such no man can well satisfie. And at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I say to them also as Paule sayd:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man seeme to be full of contention, we haue no such custome, neyther the Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the aduersaries vrge this singular spéech: <hi>I wyll geue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen vnto thee, I say, vnto thee Peter, vnto thee,</hi> singularly, and not <hi>vnto you,</hi> plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: and in their vrging do cry out that I haue openly corrupted this place of the Gospell, by communicating vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rest of the Apostles and to all their successors being ministers of the word, the keyes that were geuen to Peter onely: they bewray their owne grosse foolishnesse, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their inuincible malice, considering how they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7244:20"/>
can not deny but that such <hi>synecdoches</hi> or figures of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one for a number, and specially in such cases, are very vsuall in the Scriptures. Againe, seing it is sufficiently knowen what the keyes be, and that the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles receaued them as well as Peter: I pray you what will they proue by their singular number? But let them aske their owne fathers, why the Lord wheras he gaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall or one maner of power to them all: did neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse say seuerally vnto Peter, <hi>I will geue thee:</hi> and they shall perceaue that therby is betokened and expressed the vnitie of the Church. Surely <hi>Austine</hi> in his 118. treatise vpon Iohn, sayth thus: Whereas they were all asked the question, Peter alone answered, <hi>Thou art Christ the sonne of the liuing God:</hi> and it is sayd vnto him: <hi>Vnto thee will I geue the keyes,</hi> as though he alone had receaued the power to binde and loose: when [notwithstanding] he both spake it alone for them all, and receaued them with them all, as bearing the person of vnitie: and one [did] therfore [both speake and receaue] because there is vnitie in all. The same wordes repeateth he againe in his 124. treatise vpon Iohn. And in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 50. treatise, he sayth: when Peter recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the keyes, he represented the holy Church. The same thinges auoucheth the blessed Martyr <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his little worke concerning the simplicitie of Clerkes. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more if we shoulde graunt any thing to be geuen héere singularly vnto Peter, what is that to the Pope of Rome? He hath not yet proued him selfe to be Peters heire and successor. In his owne Decrées, in the sentences of <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> in the xl. distinction, he shall finde that which will put him to his trumpe, wring him by the eare, and cut his combe. Neither doth he which sayth that in Peter the keyes were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the whole Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Romish toyes.</p>

               <p>BEfore I depart from hence, I will glauncingly and bréefly set forth the thinges which séeme to perteine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to the keyes, not of the kingdome of heauen, but the keyes which the Bishops of Rome take to them selues, and which they blaze abroad in their Armes, that is to wit, by painting and stamping them commonly in a scutchion and vnder an helmet, yea and by fastening them vnto all their Bulls. For vnder those armes and cognisances of theirs, after the maner and fashion of scutchions and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, doe they shadowe the fulnesse of their power, and blaze it abroad to the knowledge of all men. For the scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion it selfe beareth the armes of the house of the Bishop that sitteth in the Sea. And ouer the scutchion stand two keyes a crosse, so set, that in stead of an helmet or crest, they beare vp, or haue set vpon the shéeld and keyes a triple crowne or cap of mainteinance, which (according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Austin Steuchus</hi>) they them selues call their Royaltie. The cap of mainteinance it selfe sheddeth out little Labells such as are hanging at Bishops Miters.

And the two keyes set crosse aloft vpon the shéeld (like as also their two swordes) doe (according to their holy and misticall diuinitie) beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that vnmeasurable power of theirs which extendeth it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7244:21"/>
selfe foreward and backward through the whole earth, and aduaunceth it selfe also aboue the very cloudes euen into heauen. In the meane while, it was Gods good will to teach wise men by such fatall badges, who and what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a one this prince is, verely euen the same of whom S. Iohn hath written in his Apocalips, saying: <hi>And I saw an other beast comming out of the earth, and hauing two hornes, like vnto the Lambes.</hi> But those two hornes are Préest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Princehood: and both of them belong to Christ the Lord, who is, continueth alone both King and Préest for euer. For he is that La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be of God. Therfore it is piththely sayd that those hornes which the beast taketh vnto him, are not the Lambes hornes (for the Lambe kéepeth his still, and lendeth them to no man) but like the Lambes hornes. For the Bishop will haue all men beleue, that by Peter, Christ hath geuen them equall power with him selfe, that is to wit, Préesthood and Princehood, and so prate they in those tyrannicall Decretalls of theirs, which thing for all that, is but of their owne making, neither haue they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any such thing of Christ or yet of Peter.</p>
               <p>Furthermore their Royaltie or Crowne hath Labells hanging at it, yea euen bishoply labells flaring about, and wrythed with the keyes to the sides of the crowne, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therby that this prince is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prince, but both a prince and a préest. Yea &amp; the crowne which this préestly king, prince, and Emperor beareth, is not single and one, but triple, such as neuer any Monarkes wore, that men can read of, were they neuer so puissant: neither are there any princes liuing at this day, that weare the like. And who (I pray you) would dout that there were a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in these thinges, if it were not such a one as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that the matters of these men are stuffed with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries like the holy letters of the Egyptians? This triple crowne therfore signifieth, that he which beareth it is Lord of Lordes, and King of Kinges, or rather that he is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prince vpon earth, which hath power in earth, in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:22"/>
and in purgatory vnder the earth, or more verely which is king of heauen, of the earth, &amp; of the vnfortunate Ilandes, or of the new found land Purgatory. And this crowne is not of lesse value then the crownes of other kinges, but much statelyer, wrought with wonderfull cunning, and garnished and beset with iewels and things of great price, that at least wise euen therby they might do men to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that that power of theirs hath not his match in all the world, but in all pointes surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth all others. Again, it is come to passe by the goodnesse of God, that none of all the princes in the world weareth such a crowne, but onely the Bishop of Rome. For so was it Gods will to shew openly by this peculiar marke, that this prince thus capped with a triple crowne, is the very same whom Daniell in his vij. chapter termeth the little horne. For the little horne in déede is the bishop and shepeheard which is bedecked with humilitie, and whom God hath forbidden to reigne as a Lord. This little pretie horne springeth vp among the tenne hornes. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romane Monarchie which is the olde beast, was diuided and decayed, there appeared vp a little slender horne, and a despised one among the rest, and swept away thrée of the other hornes. By doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he purchased him self power. For the Bishops of Rome, at the beginning of their créeping vp, dispatched thrée princes. First <hi>Gregory</hi> the second of that name, pluckt vp <hi>Leo</hi> the third Emperor of Constantinople one of these thrée hornes, by procuring his Exarke to be slaine in a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyburly at Rauenna, and dispatching the Emperor quite out of Italy. Afterward Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> draue <hi>Childericke</hi> king of Fraunce to decay, by counselling to depose <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,</hi> and to aduaunce <hi>Pippin</hi> to the kingdome. And so was an other horne ouerthrowen by the little horne. The third horne (which was the kinges of Lombardie) was brought lowe at the incensing of the Popes, and finally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vtterly wiped away by <hi>Pippin</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> kinges of Fraunce. But by the vndoing &amp; oppressing of these kinges,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7244:22"/>
the wealth of the Bishops of Rome increased, and their power waxed strong, whom Gods will was to shew by this triple crowne, as it were with the fingar, to be very Antichristes. Thus much concerning the Keyes, Armes, and Cognisances of the Romane Bishops. Now come to my way againe.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>¶Of the wordes, power, and ministery, and so is the disputation of the keyes knit vp.</head>
               <p>I Know well inough it offendeth many euen in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that I vse the terme power so seldome, and the worde ministerie or ministration so often, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Scripture doth openly geue power to the ministers, and it is commonly called the power of the keyes. But how small a thing is that I beséech you, if it be compared with the fulnesse of power which these men cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to them selues openly? I graunt in déede that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Church, or (if ye like it better) of the keyes, is called power. For the Lord sayth in the Gospell: <hi>Like as a man that at his going into a straunge countrey, left his house and gaue his seruauntes power. &amp;c.</hi> But who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that the power which is spoken of héere, is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to do seruice or to minister: specially seing that in an other Euangelist, it is more effectually opened what maner of power the same is, in these wordes: <hi>to geue his honsholde meate in due season,</hi> sayth the Lord. Which thing no man will wrest to the fulnesse of power, but he that is past all shame. For the Lorde speaketh manifestly of the preaching of the Gospell, whereby meate is set before the housholde, I meane before the Church of God. And when Paule to the Corinthians had termed the preaching of the Gospell the word of attonement:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> by and by expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding him selfe he addeth, that the office or ministration of preaching the attonement was geuen vnto him: behold, héere he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that thing a ministration, which he had euen now
<pb facs="tcp:7244:23"/>
called the worde. And he addeth againe, that Christ by the ministers exhorteth men to be at one with God. What power (I pray you) shall the faythfull minister claime by this géere? Rightly therefore do some men geue warning, that the power by lawe is one thing, and the power by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration is an other. The power by lawe is that wherby ech man as an owner hath power ouer the thinges that are his owne, subiecte to his owne commaundement and not to an other mans. After this sort the Lord hath power ouer the Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 28.</note> who sayth in the Gospell: <hi>All power is geuen to me in heauen and in earth.</hi> So is it sayd before, that Christ hath the key of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of death, and of hell. This power is communicated to no creature, but remaineth to God alone. Therefore except they will be false ministers, they will neuer take this power vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the power of ministration or office, is that which the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ministers, with a certaine limitation and not absolutely. For these do, not what they list them selues, nor as owners of thinges, but as their Lord and master hath commaunded them, and onely in the same maner that he by his certaine determination hath appointed them to be done: and if they do it not, or do it otherwise then their master hath commaunded them, they shall be but vntrusty seruauntes. And so vndoutedly the minister of Christ hath the ministering power of the keyes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, to preach the Gospell to the Church, and to preach it in such wise as the Lord hath commaunded him to preach: and certeinly he shall be a false and vnfaythfull seruaunt to his master, if he take vpon him any other power and specially fulnesse of power, and preach not the Gospell at all, or preach it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then is appointed him.</p>
               <p>Besides this, I am not ignorant, that Christ gaue the Apostles great power, howbeit with limitation, and but for the beginning and for a certeine time, according as Mathew witnesseth, saying: <hi>And he gaue his twelue Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples power against vncleane spirites, to cast them out and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7244:23"/>
heale all maner of diseases and infirmities.</hi> For I thinke not that any man will affirme the same power to be geuen to all ministers of the Church, together with the keyes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that we know, how that (the Gospell being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirmed already by such signes) they be now no longer common and vsuall in the rest of the Church, no more then the ablenesse and vse of sundry tounges. But howsoeuer the case sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with that wonderfull power, it is most certeine that the Apostle Paule sayd of all maner of power geuen vnto him by the Lord, that the same was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him to edifie withall, and not to destroy. Which thing vnlesse euery minister wey very aduisedly with him selfe: not onely in vaine, but also to his owne great harme shall he dispute of the power that is geuen him, and much more daungerously shall he take it vpon him.</p>
               <p>Hetherto I haue made discourse of the keyes with as much bréefnesse and plainnesse as I could. Wherby I trust that such as shut not their eyes of malice, may perceaue that the keyes are for an other thing, then the Papistes face vs withall, doutlesse not an absolute ouer thinges in earth and in heauen, but an healthfull ministery of Gods worde, or of the Gospell of Iesu Christ, and the charge and good ordering of the very Church of God: And therefore that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord sayd, <hi>I will geue thee the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen,</hi> he gaue not Peter and the Romane Idoll an infinite power which they call the fulnesse of power. For when the Lord promised and gaue the keyes, he gaue not the keyes of an earthly kingdome, but of the kingdome of heauen. Which thing is chéefly to be marked in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. And in this kingdome &amp; in this his Church Christ is the souerein Lorde, and abideth King, Bishop, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head: yea and that alone without any copartener or deputie. But his messengers or Ambassadors sent to his Church, are the Elders, rulers, and ministers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. As for all power it is onely Christes the King, Préest, and Head, and is not surrendred to any other. For
<pb facs="tcp:7244:24"/>
he him selfe caryeth yet still, and vnto the very end will ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vpon his shoulders the key of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and he will open and no man shall shut, and shut and no man shall open, and he alone both looseth and bindeth. But his Ambassadors or preachers that are sent and ordeined to gather his Church, doe preach this Christ the Lord, assuring men by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, that Christ forgeueth the sinnes of such as beléeue certeinly and bestoweth eternall life vpon them, and that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth those to eternall death, which beléeue not, or which gainstand the Gospell. The self same Ministers do féede with Gods word the Church that is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vnto Christ, comfortyng the weakeharted, quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and thrusting foreward the slothfull, confirming the wauerers, exhortyng all men euermore vnto continuall prayers, to the lawfull vsing of the Sacramentes, too the dewties of godly conuersation, and most of all to charitie and mercy, and in all thinges &amp; by all meanes with singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faythfulnesse and diligence endeuering to bryng and preserue the Churche safe and sound vnto Christ: whiche doutlesse is the very true and wholesome vse of the keys of Gods kyngdome, euen the natiue and holy stewardshyp, charge, and well orderyng of Gods Church.</p>

               <head>¶Here is expounded that place of Ieremy, <hi>I haue set thee ouer kynges &amp; kingdomes &amp;c.</hi> and it is shewed how the same maketh nothyng to the proofe of the Byshop of Romes tyranny which he exerciseth agaynst kynges and kyngdomes.</head>
               <p>LEt vs procede further, that we may also espye, how truly the Pope of Rome vaunteth himself alone to be ordeined prince ouer all nacions and all kyngdomes.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7244:24"/>
this matter. But we will haue no toyes, we will haue them shew vs by Christes expresse wordes, that the Byshops of Rome are lawfully ordeyned Princes ouer all nacions and all Realmes, by the ordinance of Christ our Lord, not by the ordinance of any men.</p>
               <p>A few yeares past, <hi>Austin Steuchus</hi> of Eugubie the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarikéeper of the sea of Rome, and besides that, a Byshop also, a man otherwise that had read much, but yet for all that, smally séene in the holy Scriptures, and moreouer a most filthy flatterer of the Romish Bishops, did put forth a booke agaynst <hi>Laurence Valla,</hi> in the defence of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> Donation, worthy to be spitted at of all godly men, and méete to be trampled in the myre with dirtie féete. In this booke, among other thynges, in the xv. Diuision. First of all (sayth he) it standes you in hand to know, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> did not giue by name those fewe Townes, and those fewe Cities which are called the patrimonie of the Church, but he gaue the whole West part of the world, and so departyng from the Citie, did as it were giue place to a greater Prince then hym selfe (that is to wit to the Pope) assuryng him selfe that Rome it selfe was the head and dwelling place of godlinesse, wherein it were vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man to reigne, besides the souereine of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any two men to reigne in that one Citie to whiche he knew Peter the Prince of the Apostles and head of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be come, he counted it a haynous matter, specially if the earthly Prince should beare the cheefsway in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And in his xvi. Diuision, It could not be sayth he) that two princes should reigne in one Citie, specially in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that worldly matters would haue ouermated holy matters. Namely it would haue happened, as it is in the Prouerb, that riuers should haue ronne agaynst theyr streames. Also in the 90. Diuision: This is the Maiestie and prerogatiue which Peter gaue vnto Rome, that lyke as she was Lady of all landes, so she should reigne ouer all Religion, and all thynges should be ruled at her becke.
<pb facs="tcp:7244:25"/>
Agayne in his 94. Diuision, he reckeneth vp all the mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyest kyngdomes of the West, as Fraunce, Spayne, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmarke, Portingale, and all the residue, all which are subiect to their holy and vniuersall mother (for so spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he) the Church of Rome. And least he might ouerslyp any thyng, at length in his 103. Diuision he addeth: But what should I alledge any more to proue by this kynde of Argumentes, the most auncient and welnere almightie power of the Church of Rome ouer all kyngdomes and kinges, and the most auncient possession of the same. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideryng that the auncient monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of all the Byshops are full of the highe power wherwith they ruled the whole world at their commaundement, holdyng the souereintie of all Realmes &amp;c. These thynges wherby he hath put all the kyngdomes of the world vnder the Pope and Churche of Rome, could not satisfie and content that lying and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous clawbacke, but he must also with extreme shamelessenesse and horrible wickednesse make a God of that wicked wight the Bishoppe of Rome. For in his 26. Diuision he sayth, that the faythfull worshyp the sonne of God him selfe in the Pope, and that they honour, not so much hym as a mortall man, as in him euen God hym selfe who hath made him his deputie vpon earth. Agayne, in the 67. Diuision, 141. leafe. Thou hearest (sayth he) how the hygh Byshop which is called God, was by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> estemed as God. And ye must vnderstand that this was then done, when he endowed him with that noble graunt, for euen then dyd he worshyp him as God, then dyd hee (as much as lay in hym) bestowe godly honour vppon hym as Christes vicare and Peters successour, and then did he reuerence him as the liuely image of Christ. Thus sayth he. And such blasphemous and wicked wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges doth Rome yeld vnto vs. Which thynges I haue hitherto mencioned, to the end I might disclose vnto all men, the extreme &amp; vnrecouerable madnesse of the Pope him selfe and of his houshold together with their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7244:25"/>
where through, they beyng most heathenish &amp; shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men, are not afrayd euen in the sight of the whole world as well of Angels as men, to vsurpe vnto them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues the very Godhead it selfe and all the kyngdomes of the world, and to spit out whatsoeuer commeth at their tounges end.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Steuchus</hi> was also a Byshop, and yet he was not ashamed to offer so blasphemous writinges to the Church, yea &amp; to dedicate them to S. Peter. But let them bryng vs some one sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or at least wise some one word of Christ or his Apostles, whereby they may shewe and auouch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that Christ authorized the Pope to be souereine of all kyngs &amp; kingdomes. No, they cannot bryng me oneiote out of all the new Testament. And therfore they flée vnto Ieremy for succour. But eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this mans holy writyngs also do they defile: béeray, &amp; corrupt with their poyson. For the Prophet speaketh of the ministration of the word, and not of any Lordyng of his owne. For the Lord calleth, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth, and sendeth Ieremy to the charge of preachyng. For he sayth to him by expresse wordes: Before thou camest out of thy mothers wombe, I sanctified thée, and appointed thée to be a Prophet vnto nations. Afterward when Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie excused him selfe by his tender yeares and vnenured childhode: the Lord harteneth and comforteth him, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be present with him, and to speake by his mouth. For in the Lordes wordes it foloweth, behold I haue put my wordes in thy mouth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.</note> For so read we also that the Lord spake after the same maner in old tyme vnto Moses, when he drew backe and would haue shunned the Lordes callyng. But in those wordes there is no speakyng at all of souereintie, but of the charge of preachyng. Whereupon it ensueth that Ieremie is instructed how to teach, and not how to reigne. And there foloweth in the Lordes wordes: behold, this day haue I set the ouer natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; kyngdomes, to plucke vp, roote out, destroy, and ouerthrow: to build vp: and to plant. By which wordes the Lord sheweth vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:26"/>
to whom he sendeth him, what his office should be, or what should be, end of his ambassade.</p>
               <p>He is sent vnto nacions and kyngdomes as a preacher of Gods word, and not set ouer them as a prince or a king. For there foloweth to plucke vp &amp;c. Which is the office of a teacher, and the end of the Lordes ambassade. And a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet plucketh vp, ouerthroweth buildeth vp and planteth, two wayes. First when by Gods word he declareth to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nacions, and kyngdomes, that the Lord which hath planted the nations &amp; kyngdomes, will roote out the same for their outrageous sinnes, vnlesse they amend. For Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of himselfe did not ouerthrow or build vp kyngdomes, but the Lord alone did it. But Ieremy beyng Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and messenger, told them out of the Lordes mouth or by his word, that the Lord would do it. And this sence is ministred and furthered by the thynges that folow in the 45. chapter, where the Lord sayth: behold, I pull downe the thynges that I haue builded, and I plucke vp the thynges that I haue planted. And agayne in the 42. chapter, I will build you vp and not pull you downe, I will plant you and not plucke you vp. Besides this, to plucke vp and to plant are termes of husbandry, like as to build and to pull down are termes of masonry and carpentry. Hereupon now the Prophet is by an allegoricall speach informed, what he must do and wherunto his commission extendeth. Like as husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and builders do first prepare their ground and cut it vp with the plough, and afterward sow it with séede, or first pull downe the decayed buildynges and clense the floore, and then afterward build vpon it: So is it the dewtie of a Prophet or preacher, first and formest to confute by Gods word to pull downe and plucke vp wicked opinions, Idolatrie, and whatsoeuer thynges els are raysed vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst God: and afterward in place of the thynges that be rooted out, to plant agayne sound doctrine, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppyng of God, and all maner of godlinesse, and finally to kéepe the Lordes field in tilth and to decke Gods house
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7244:26"/>
with all diligence. These thynges wilbe the more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if ye compare them with the Lordes owne wordes in the 13. and 15. of Mathew, and with the wordes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paule in the third chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and in the tenth chapter of the second Epistle. Once againe therfore by the cleare, natural, and right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued interpretation of this place of Ieremye, we haue wonne, that the Pope by that Bull of his, hath wickedly and trayterously to the Lord Godward, corrupted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted his wordes, and wrested them to his own souerein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or rather to his owne tyranny, which the Lord hath not ordeined or defended by his word, neither here nor in any place els.</p>
               <p>And if they be not yet ashamed of their wicked wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng and corruptyng of this place of the Prophetes: Let them tell vs what maner of souereintie Ieremy bare in Hierusalem the chief Citie of Iewry, or ouer what nation or kyngdome he reigned? From the death of kyng <hi>Iosias,</hi> he liued vnder the wicked kynges <hi>Ioachaz, Ioachim, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zedechias.</hi> The horrible déedes of these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are described both in the holy stories of the Bible, &amp; also in the same Ieremyes booke, let them tell vs then in what wise Ieremy by the vertue of these the Lordes wordes, I haue set thee this day ouer nations and kyngdomes. &amp;c. dyd roote out or plant, and which of those vngodly kynges he plucked vp and excommunicated? or where he taught that bycause of the wickednesse of these kynges, their people ought to yeld no obedience vnto them? Let them tell vs where or when he discharged the noblemen and commons of the Realme of their othe made vnto the sayd kinges, yea or vnto <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> which was a heathen kyng? Or which of the kinges Ieremy cast downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his throne, and afterward aduaunced another to it at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? Tell me, tell me I say. Why are ye thus dumine. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye be neuer able to proue by any Scriptures, the thyng that you take vpon ye. For the truth witnesseth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
<pb facs="tcp:7244:27"/>
that Ieremy was the humble seruaunt of the Lord God, a poore Minister, and therewithall a faithfull Prophet of the Lord God, and that he was pitifull vexed, impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and persecuted by those kynges: agaynst whom for all that, he ment so litle to draw any sword at all: that in all ciuill cases he willyngly obeyed them, and taught all the people yea the nobilitie also to obey them, and finally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced them as his soueraine Lordes. In déede he did sharply rebuke the wicked offences of these kynges, and preached Gods greuous iudgementes, not so much to them as to the Priestes and to the whole people, vtterly after the same maner that the Lord had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to do it. But in the meane while he made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in the Realme, but rather patiently suffered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution at their handes, &amp; prayed earnestly for their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.

This matter is of it selfe right plentifull in the holy Scriptures, but I will (as much as may be) comprehend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a brief. Therefore although our Lord Iesus Christ, was by his almightie father ordeined both kyng and priest in his kingdome, and that he manifestly auouched himselfe to be a king: yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng he laid aside the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of temporall and worldly thyngs, and tooke him selfe to the charge onely of spirituall thynges. By reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when Pylate asked hym whether hee were the kyng of Israell or no? He denyed not him self to be a kyng, but hee addeth an exposition and méekely aunswered, my kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world. Whereupon in another place of the Gospell he sayd, he came not to be serued (that is to wit as a worldly prince) but to serue or to do seruice him selfe, and to giue his life for the raunsome of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. For that cause,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.</note> he vtterly refused the iudgyng or diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the heritage that was desired at his hand, and put it ouer from himself to the lawfull iudges, not without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure saying: ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hath made me a iudge or vmper betwene you?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> And therfore when the people were purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue made him a temporall kyng, he fled, and by that flight of his shewed that those his ministers must not séeke for worldly souereintie in the Church, and much lesse pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it or by any meanes claime it, no nor receiue it or take it vpon them if it be offered.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Math.</hi> 17</note> to be payd for him, least he might be an offence vnto others. Finally by the space of whole iij. yeares together, in which he most
<pb facs="tcp:7244:28"/>
faithfully went through with the charge that his heauenly father had put him in trust with, &amp; accomplished all things enioyned him to the full, he neuer gaue any inclyng (no not the least that could be) of any souereintie or worldly domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Unto this holy and most humble example of the Lord, there is also further added his most modest doctrine. For when he perceiued that his disciples beyng caught and led away with ambition, burned altogether with desire of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereintie, and striue among themselues for supremacie or prerogatiue or (as the Romane Bishops terme it) for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse (as surely this maladie sticketh fast to the ribbes of them that are atteinted neuer so litle with ambitiousnesse, which thyng appeareth by the Romish sort them selues:) he gaue them a very sore checke, and withdrew them from that desire of souereintie, beating lowlinesse into them, &amp; therwithall also mainteinyng the right of the Magistrate ordeined of God, and finally committyng the ministration of the word to his disciples, without any hope or mention of souereintie at all.</p>
               <p>Therfore when in the xvii. of Mathew, Peter had payd a péece of twentie pence for the Lord and himselfe, to those that demaunded but ten pence, and that therby he had put the rest of the disciples in suspicion, as though Peter should be aduaunced aboue all the rest of them: or be made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate among them in the kyngdome of heauen, or in the gouernement of the Church: they began to dispute of the matter among them selues: and eche of them accordyng to mans infirmitie gaped after that hyghest degrée of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reintie. But what sayd the Lord, and what did he in that debate of his disciples? He tooke a child vnto him and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in the middes of them, sayd: Uerely I say vnto you, except ye turne and become like children, ye shall not enter into the kyngdome of heauen. Therfore whosoeuer humbleth himselfe as this child he is greatest in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Which is all one as if the Lord had sayd vnto them, ye striue for preheminence, which of you should
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7244:28"/>
be gréeted as greatest of all. But I tell you for a certeintie, except ye turne your myndes from such ambitious dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that sauour of nothyng but pride and pompe, and turne your selues in lowlinesse vnto me and my example, yea and vnto the simplenesse of this little boy whom you sée here: ye shalbe so farre from greatnesse and gloriousnes in that kyngdome of myne, that I will not so much as take you for my Disciples. Uery truly sayth S. Chrisostome in his 59. Homely vpon Mathew, litle childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know not how to enuy, nor how to gape for vaineglorie, nor how to desire preheminence of dignitie, neither are they any whit the statelyer if ye prayse them or honor them. What then aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth the Lord to the question of his Disciples? Who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer (sayth he) becommeth like a child by puttyng away naughtie affections, but chiefly ambition and desirousnesse to beare rule: truly the same is greatest in the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Upon which place Chrisostome sayth agayn. Thou séest how he hath taught that preheminence of dignitie is not to be coueted in any case. And so forth.</p>
               <p>Agayne in the 20. chapter of Mathew, when the mother of Zebedies children came vnto the Lord with her sonnes Iames and Iohn, and made sute for them that they might haue the highest roome and chief authoritie about him in his kingdome, so as he should place them next him selfe: the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, (for looke who they be that are next about a kyng, and garde his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in sittyng on either side of him, those are counted chief men in the Realme, like as at this day those be called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates <hi>a latere</hi> or from the Popes side, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Byshop sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from Rome with full power and authoritie.) The Disciples hauyng forgotten the thynges which the Lord had taught them afore, mistrusted eftsoone that those two brothers should be preferred before them all. By reason wherof, enuying them, they began to take pritch at it, and to contend agayne among themselues for the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The Lord therfore calling them to him, sayd: ye know that
<pb facs="tcp:7244:29"/>
the kynges of nations reigne ouer them: and they that be great exercise authoritie vpon them. It shall not be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you: but he that will be great among you, let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your seruaunt: and he that wilbe chief among you, let him be your vnderlyng: like as the sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is come, not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of many. Most trimly and effectually hath the Lord herein seuered the Ecclesiasticall ministerie, from the ciuill authoritie. And iustly doth he challendge and yeld to the Magistrate, that which belongeth to the Magistrate, without derogatyng or takyng any thyng from him, and conueying it to him selfe and his: and likewise shew the ministers what they also ought to do. Ye know (sayth he) that there be Princes or Magistrates ordeined among peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and among the Gentiles, so as there is no neede that you also should be made rulers ouer nations. I mynde not to make warres with the Romanes, and to put downe their presidentes and Tetrarkes, to set you vp in theyr roomes, (which thyng, notwithstandyng the Iewes beleued that Christ should haue done, and therfore when he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered not their expectation, they acknowledged him not to be the Messias.) Princes haue their power giuen them of God. Wherby you vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that there is no cause why you should striue among your selues for souereintie. For you sée that those which are in office already, shall continue still in their charge. Thus much sayd the Lord concernyng ciuill gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Now foloweth also concernyng the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the Church. <hi>It shall not be so amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you.</hi> For I haue not chosen you to make you princes of landes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seruantes of the Churches, not Lordes I say, but prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to publish the word of glad tydinges, and to shyne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people in example of holy lyfe. Therfore I will not haue you once thinke of bearing rule, or wish to reigne like princes of this world: it shall not be so among you. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit for asmuch as ambitious pride had brought the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples this farre, here also like as afore he commendeth low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7244:29"/>
vnto them, saying: whosoeuer will be great among you &amp;c. Neither is there any cause why the Romish sorte should now a dayes blere our eyes with their stile of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the seruants of God,</hi> which the Pope vseth. For that style is a forged style, and the lowlinesse of these men is but a counterfet or hipocritly lowlinesse. For the very experience of many hundred yeares witnesseth, that in all the whole world there are none that can worse away with doyng seruice, than this kynde of men. Nay rather they will be worshipped for soueraines and kynges of kynges. Or if they be the seruauntes of Gods seruauntes in déede; why offer they their feete to be kissed euen of Gods princes? And the Lord to moue them the more euidently, addeth his owne example to his foresaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, saying. <hi>Like as the sonne of man is not come to be serued &amp;c.</hi> This is a notable saying: for it is as much as if he had sayd, If I which am your Lord and master, and the liuyng sonne of the liuing God to, and kyng of kynges, sue not for, ne cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge not to my selfe any worldly prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, as who am come into the earth, to serue all mens turnes euen with the losse of my lyfe: truly you ought to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it, that you which are but wretched men and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thralles, are notwithstandyng not afrayd to gape after souereintie. These thynges, these thynges I say as dreadful thunderboltes, not onely shake, but also turne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side downe that seate of the Romishe Byshops, which they haue most boldly &amp; shamelessely exalted aboue the thrones of all kynges, vnder pretence of Peter and of the graunted souereintie and vnmeasurable power which [they say] they receiued of Christ. And whereas the Lord vttered these thynges to his Disciples once or twise very earnestly, and so forcibly as they could not be vttered more forcibly: yet had ambition and desire of prerogatiue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so déepe rootes in the mindes of the Disciples accordyng to the corruption of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature, that at the Lordes last Supper, when they vnderstode he should depart out of this world, they fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb facs="tcp:7244:30"/>
to striuyng for the supremacie and prerogatiue then most of all,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.</note> that is to wit, who should be chief vpon earth and preferred before all others in the Church, when the Lord was gone away and receiued vp into heauen? But the Lord inueyeth not sharply against his Disciples ne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth them of as they had deserued, for renewing their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errour now the third tyme and for by inforcyng it by harping still vpon it after he had so euident instruction and disprofe of their souereintie: but salueth the disease of both them and of all other in the church that are atteynted with the same vice. And first of all he repeteth the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he had obiected agaynst them in the 20. of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, saying. There is no reason why you should striue for superioritie. For the Princes that reigne at this tyme in the world, neither are now nor shall hereafter be put down for me. For the Magistrate continueth still in his former state &amp; dignitie. He shall reigne, but so shall not you reigne. By the way also and as it were glauncingly, he shadoweth out the office of princes, saying: And they which haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer them are called <hi>Good &amp; Gracious:</hi> that is to say, they be ordeined of God to the end they should do good to their subiectes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> For the Apostle sayth: The Magistrate is Gods minister, for thy welfare. For Princes are not a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to such as do wel, but to such as do ill. And what could be sayd more piththily and strongly in this case, that which is sayd already, or rather now twise repeted, but so shal not you? By and by he addeth an ordinaunce after what sort the Ministers must behaue themselues in their Ecclesiasticall charge, saying: He that is an elder among you, let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come felow to the yonger. That is to say, he that hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a greater roome in the Church, &amp; is endewed both with sundry giftes and also with singular authoritie in respect of his old age and his experience in matters, let hym not vaunt himselfe for those singular giftes, but let him be wise after a lowly maner, as if he were some young man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience, and as yet raw in so great a charge. Also, he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7244:30"/>
that is a Prince. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that is, a Capteine, Ruler, or Gouerner, let him assure himselfe that he hath not gotten a souereintie, but a ministerie: and therfore let him behaue himselfe as a Minister.</p>
               <p>Unto these he addeth also other reasons, whereby to lay forth to the eye, that Apostolicke men are called, not to reigne but to serue. Greater (sayth he) is the prerogatiue of him that sitteth at the table, then of him that serueth him which sitteth. But the Church beyng called by the Lord to a spirituall feast, sitteth downe: And you serue the Church of that spirituall foode: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church is as your Lady and mistresse, and you are the seruauntes of this mistresse, but not her maisters and much lesse her souereines. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto agayne he ioyneth his owne example: I am (sayth he) as a seruaunt among you. Seyng then that I which am your Lord, do neuerthelesse serue you: it is a shame for you which be but seruauntes, to thinke of Lordyng it in the Church, considering how my most humble example is day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before your eyes vtterly abhorryng from all desire of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereintie. Furthermore he addeth this also: Surely it is straunge that you should striue among your selues for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie: considering how that I haue hetherto ben sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many and sundry afflictions. Wherof you your selfe can beare witnesse, vnto whom some part of my temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and afflictions hath redounded. Wherefore ye might rightlyer conferre among your selues, of bearing the crosse and of patience, than of Lordshyp &amp; superioritie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng he annexeth here agayne a comfort, least their hartes might fayle them at the mention of afflictions. And therefore he knitteth vnto it a declaration of heauenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes that shalbe liberally giuen vnto those in the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting countrie, which get the vpper hand in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: aduauncyng his maner of spéech from bodily and earthly thinges, to spirituall and heauenly thinges.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstandyng, after all these thinges, (which surely may séeme a wonder to the whole world) yea euen
<pb facs="tcp:7244:31"/>
after thrise most earnest warning and euident instruction, the Disciples dare byanby vpon Christes Resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and at the verie instant of his Ascension into heauen, make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet agayne of reigning, yea and to cloy the Lord again with their desirousnesse of superioritie, saying: Wilt thou at this time, that is to say before thou depart from vs into heauen) restore the kingdome vnto Israell? Unto which question the mercyfull Lord bearing with the weakenesse of his Disciples, aunswereth, méekely agayne, and biddeth them referre the seasonable doing of it vnto God. In the meane while he repeteth and beateth into them agayne, what they should do and what he requireth at their hands, saying: After that the holy Ghost is come downe into you, you shall receiue power, and you shal beare witnesse of me, not onely at Hierusalem, but euen to the vttermost costes of the earth also. And what els is this, then if he had sayd, The holie Ghost shall teach you to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what maner of kingdome mine shalbe, doutlesse spirituall, &amp; not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherin I shall sit and reigne the chief &amp; onely souerein. And in this my kingdome, that is to wit, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very Church of the saintes, you shalbe witnesses &amp; not kinges, preachers and not princes. For by preachyng of the Gospell you shall gather me a Church out of the whole world.</p>
               <p>This I say is Christes doctrine concerning supremacie and reigning, &amp; concernyng the ministerie of Christ in the Church, more lightsome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sunne. Wherby also it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, more clearely then the day light, that the Byshop of Romes vsurping of souereintie in the Church, and his bosting of himselfe to be ordeined head ouer all kinges and Realmes, contrarie to Christes example and doctrine, is not by the lowlie spirite of Christ, but by the proude spirite of Lucifer?</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:7244:31"/>ANd when the Apostles had receiued the holy Ghost, they vtterly displaced all ambition and desire of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reintie out of their hartes, perceiuyng now, that no such thing as they and the Iewes had hitherto surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, was to be sought or looked for in the kyngdome and Church of Christ, but farre greater and diuiner thinges, namely spirituall thynges. And therfore accordyng to their Lord &amp; maisters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, traueling ouer the whole world, they so behaued them selues, that in all thinges they were sound to be the very Disciples and folowers of their maister: endewed with lowlinesse, &amp; not with Lordlinesse, &amp; renowmed for their faithfull seruice, &amp; not for stately su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie. For they not onely preached the Gospell purely without mens forgeries and traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but also were wont to reuerence kynges as next vnto God in earth and chief of all men, and to call them their Lordes, and to pay them tribute, and to obey them faithfully, and to pray for their welfare without ceasing, yea and to threaten Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to such as refused obedience to the Magistrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding no wickednesse. They no where intermedled them selues in worldly affaires, in somuch as they cast eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the care of the poore (which otherwise is most holy,) vpon the shoulders of the Deacons, verely to the end they might the earnestlyer apply them selues to the preaching of the word. They no where vsurped to them selues the benches of iudges or the thrones of princes, and much lesse did they depose any kyng or prince from his kingdome, were he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so wicked, (and yet there is no man ignoraunt what the Romane presidentes were that liued in the time of the Apostles, full of couetousenesse, lechery, and pride: and the posteritie of <hi>Herode</hi> euen venemouse slippes: yea and the Emperours them selues most filthie and vngracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as the <hi>Tyberiusses,</hi> the <hi>Caligulaze,</hi> the <hi>Claudiusses</hi> and the <hi>Neroes</hi>) or discharge his people of their allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or contend with any prince for the souereintie, and much lesse did they euer purpose or practise to place &amp; exalt them

selues aboue him. Nay rather they suffered sore persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which they ouercame by patience, and not by violent withstanding, nor by practises and pollicies of malicious wylinesse: and gathered verie great Churches vnto Christ out of the whole world by preaching the Gospell ouer all the earth. S. Luke the Euangelist describeth these thynges diligently and plenteously in his booke of the Actes of the Apostles, wherin although he pursue their doinges by the space of xxviii. yeares together, Yet doth he no where giue any little incling of that supremacie and fulnesse of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which they at this day do boast of, that call them selues Apostolick, and crake of the fulnesse of their power.</p>
               <p>But if any man desire to here some singular thyng of S. Peter: he is alwayes set first in the register of the holie Apostles. But all men know that this formershyp of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is not in ouer ruling, but in order: for accordyng to the doctrine of the Gospell, all the Apostles were indewed with like dignitie and power, and the Churches were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by their trauell in common. In the meane while it was requisite that there should be order both in speakyng and doing for the auoydance of disordered confusion: &amp; they that had obteined greater giftes were more honored and had in more estimation and authoritie than the residew. Like as Paule speaking of Iames,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</note> Peter, and Iohn, sayth that they séemed to be pillars in the Church. Not for that they were preferred afore all the rest, or had obteined a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Commission: but bicause that hauing obteined grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giftes, they did more luckely and easly go through with all pointes of their charge (wherin otherwise, the residew had as good part as they) and therfore were had in greater price and estimation among the faithfull. So also were the Apostolike Churches which were first founded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, worthely had in great price and estimation in old time. For their authoritie was of great credit with other Churches: not that they were beleued to haue superioritie ouer them, but bicause that being the first that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7244:32"/>
to the faith, they kept still vnappaired, the faith which they had once learned of the Apostles, and gaue light to other Churches, by their purenesse and consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. These thinges are set forth more at large by a very auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the prescriptions of heretickes. In which place also he not onely calleth Rome an Apostolike Church, but Ephesus also, and Corinth, and Thessalonica, and other Churches founded by the Apostles. And it is not to be douted but that the men of old tyme called Peter and Paule the princes of the Apostles: not that they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or worldly princes, or that they had dominion ouer the rest, or that they had obteined a larger commission: but bicause that being endewed by God with most excellent giftes, both in their sayinges and doinges, yea and finally in their writings and vertewes they shyned as most bright Cressets among the rest of the Starres.</p>

Peter neuer chalendged to him selfe any supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie no not euen ouer the basest sort of men, and much lesse ouer princes: he neuer aduaunced his throne (which he had not) aboue all kinges and all kingdomes. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion a knight of Rome fell down at his féete, and it was no small cause that made him so to do. For the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord had set a great commendation vpon this Peter vnto him, wherupon he fell downe before Peter. But Peter liftes him vp agayne, and humbly sayth that he him selfe is a man also. So also when he had lifted vp the lame man and made him whole and sound, at the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ierusalem, and that the people stode wondering and worshipping of him, he gaue all the glorie vnto Christ, and told them that he him selfe was but a Minister. Neither doth he in his Epistles aduaunce him selfe with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, but simply calles him selfe an Apostle and felowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, forbidding the elders to vsurpe any Lordship ouer the Clergie.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> Neither sitteth he still in his chayre at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and sendes abroad his Legates <hi>a latere:</hi> but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to let the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation send him with Iohn into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria.<note place="margin">

                  <pb facs="tcp:7244:33"/>
Yea and in the Counsell of Ierusalem, he chalend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no preheminence to him selfe. All thinges were done in that Counsell by common aduise and consent. And the Apostle Paule, who in all thinges euen of the smallest sort was a most diligent obseruer of the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Christ, no where acknowledgeth S. Peter as prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all other men by any prerogatiue, neither would he in any wise haue neglected it, if he had euer thought him to haue ben preferred afore the rest by the Lord. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he fréely reproued Peter in the Church of Antioche, accordyng as he himselfe declareth, in the 2. to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. In the same place in déede, he calleth Peter a Piller, but not Peter aboue, and therfore much lesse the piller of all pillers, greatest and most excellent. For with Peter he matcheth two other Apostles, whom he termeth pillers as well as him, euen Iames and Iohn: yea and he putteth Iames afore Peter. He had sayd heretofore, that the same were had in reputation, to the end we might know wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called them pillers. Meaning that they were in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as men that by their common and faithful trauell séemed as it were to vphold the Church, which els was like to fall, if it had not ben vnderpropped and stayed vp through the grace of God in their faithfull teachyng. And yet Paule affirmeth that those pillers added nothyng vnto him. But rather comparing him selfe with Peter, The same (sayth he) which was mighty in Peter in the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship ouer the Circumcision, was mighty in me also among the Gentiles.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> And the same Paule speakyng of the plurall nomber, saith he was nothing inferiour to the chief Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. And in the 3. chapter of his first Epistle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, what is Paule (sayth he,) what is Apollo, (and in this place is Peter or Cephas to be implyed also, as of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made mention in the first chapter, vsing the same maner of speaking. Neither is there any reason why the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of those should hold vs in a mamering, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that here is not ment Peter, but some other disciple
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7244:33"/>
whom Paul calleth by the name of Cephas. For the truth of the Gospell crieth out against them in the first of Iohn, and so doth Paules owne declaration in the second to the Galathians.) What are they (saith he) but onely ministers by whom you haue beleued, euen as the Lord gaue vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man? I haue planted, Apollo hath watred, but God gaue the increase. Therfore, neither is he any thing which planteth nor he which watereth, but God which giueth the increase. And anone after, speakyng of all the Apostles, yea and euen of Peter or Cephas to,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note> Let a man (sayth he) in such wise esteme vs as the Ministers of Christ, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of the secretes of God.</p>
               <p>These lightsome and euident textes of Scripture, are sufficient for men that be curable, (as for vncurable &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling men, we leaue them to God the iust iudge) and doe witnesse manifestly enough that neither Christes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles no nor the Apostle Peter him selfe vsurped so much as one iote of souereintie in the Church, but onely tooke vpon them ministration of the glad tydinges of saluation, and of Christes holy Church, all their life long euen vnto the last gaspe of their liues. And therfore there is no reason why the Bishop of Rome should hereafter in maintenance of himselfe &amp; his supremacie, alledge any more the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Peter, which is now sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly apparant to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none, and alwayes to haue ben none at all in déede.</p>

               <head>¶That the first Bishops of Rome vsurped not any souereintie at all in the church, but were lowly shepeheardes, teachers and ministers of the Church of Rome: yea and besides that, also Martyrs of Christ.</head>
               <p>I Will not now dispute whether Peter came at Rome or no. Wherof I sée learned men to dout, not without cause. Surely it may be proued by substantiall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, that Peter sate not in that seate, at that tyme
<pb facs="tcp:7244:34"/>
and so long a tyme as he is commonly sayd to haue sit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually together. If he came to Rome at all, certes it was late ere he came, and peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture not long afore his death. For all the old writers, euen those that were néere the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time, do agreably and stedfastly affirme, that Peter was crucified at Rome vnder the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> for preaching Christ and his Gospell, the same time that Paul was beheaded. Which thing I can easly graunt. But from this Peter vnto <hi>Siluester</hi> there be registred 33. Byshops or pastors of Rome. Of whom notwithstandyng none tooke vpon him any souereintie either ouer the Citie it selfe, or ouer the Church of Rome, and therfore much lesse aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced they them selues ouer kynges and kyngdomes. Yet am I not afrayd to say thus much more of them, that if they might be found to haue attempted any whit of this prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, or to haue sewed for souereintie, it is certein that they started aside from the way of their predecessours, yea and from their maister Christ, and grew out of kynd from their owne Peter. Wherfore their sayinges and doinges being against the expresse testimonies of Christ and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles aboue rehearsed, could proue nothing.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, like as in other Churches, as of Antioche, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, Corinth, Philippos, Ephesus, Cesarea, and the rest, there were pastors or teachers which were called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, set ouer the Church of God, which by their holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie serued seuerally their owne shéepe that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and not other mens shéepe, or in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once: (for at the begynnyng, euery pastor had his slocke appointed and committed vnto him.) So also was done in the Church of Rome, which is named Apostolicke Sea or Chayre. I would not haue any man amased at the termes of <hi>Sea &amp; Chayre,</hi> and surmyse and imagine any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishnesse by them. Men in old time gaue the termes of Sea and Chayre, not onely to the Church of Rome, but to any of the notable Churches, I meane which the Apostles them selues founded, and in which the traditions or the doctrine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7244:34"/>
of the Apostles and of the Gospell sounded or was preached &amp; florished still vncorrupted. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of heretikes, saith: Peruse the Apostolik Churches, among which the very chayres of the Apostles are yet still sytin in their places, &amp; among which their authenticall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are still read, resounding the voyce and resembling the face of euery of them. If Achaya be next thée, thou hast Corinth: if thou be not farre from Macedonie, thou hast Philippos, and thou hast Thessalonice. If thou list to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Asia, thou hast Ephesus. And if thou border vpon Italy, thou hast Rome, from whence also we haue authoritie at hand. O happy Church wherupon the Apostles bestowed their whole doctrine together with their bloud, where Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was matched with his Lord in passion, where Paule was crowned with the end of Iohn Baptist, and where the Apostle Iohn, after he had ben plundged in scalding oyle &amp; felt no harme at all, was banished into the Ile of Patmos. Thus saith he. Otherwise the Chayre is properly a hygh place in the Church furnished for the ministers to teach out of the more commodiously, as from whence they may the better be séen and heard of their audience that is assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Church. Such as the men of old time are knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue had, as appeareth by the doynges of <hi>Achaz</hi> kyng of Iuda, and by the viij. chapter of Nehemias. It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a Pulpit or preaching stoole. It is not a cloth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, or a <hi>Salomons</hi> throne, or a kynges chayre of estate. Neither did men in old tyme by the Apostolike chayre or sea, meane reigning or souereintie and I wote not what greater thyng, as they meane at this day. But rather the chayre is taken for the very Apostolike doctrine, which was preached out of those chayres or pulpites, and to fit in the Apostolike sea is to preach the Apostolike doctrine. For it is well knowen to all men what the Lord ment by the chayre of Moses in the Gospell, when he sayd, The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Pharisies sit in Moses chayre. What soeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue and do ye. For what els is it
<pb facs="tcp:7244:35"/>
to sit in Moses chayre, than to professe Moses, and to teach the things that Moses taught? If any had taught any thing besides that or contrarie to that, they had ben of neuer the more authoritie for the chaire, like as at this day also, they that preach not Apostolicall doctrine, haue none authoritie by the Apostolike chayre or sea of Rome, of Antioche, or of Philippos, neither are they in any wise to be regarded, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they sit in the same seas. Uery well knowen is this Canon reported in the 40. Distinction of the Decrées, out of the writings of Ierome, It is hard to stand in the roome of Peter and Paule, and to kéepe the chayre of those that reigne with Christ. For hereupon it is sayd, They are not the Saintes children, which possesse the Saintes places, but they that fulfill the workes of the Saintes.</p>
               <p>They the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had the charge of the Romane Church after that Peter was put to death, were ministers, pastors, and teachers or preachers, and not princes or Lordes. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> placeth <hi>Linus</hi> immediatly after Peter. <hi>Tertullian</hi> placeth <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Eusebius</hi> puts <hi>Anacletus</hi> in the middes betwixt <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Clement.</hi> Some register one <hi>Cletus</hi> betwixt <hi>Clement</hi> &amp; <hi>Anacletus,</hi> which <hi>Cletus</hi> is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing quite ouerskipped and omitted by diuerse. Others also dispose the succession or Register of the first Byshops of the Romane Church, some after one sort and some after another so as it may séeme straunge that antiquitie vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so in the succession of them, &amp; hath almost nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein &amp; assured in that behalf. But howsoeuer the case stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, this is most certein that such as held the Apostolik sea of Rome after <hi>Clement,</hi> were vtterly ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power and the authoritie of both the swordes which those men presumptuously boast of, that thinke themselues possesse the same seate at this day. They were lowely and poore ministers of the Church, &amp; preached the Gospell and the doctrine of the Apostles to the Church, wherof they had the charge, and therewithall ministred Christes Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to the Church, and beautified their doctrine with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7244:35"/>
example of lyfe, &amp; in the end sealed it vp with Martyrdome, For all those Byshops or pastors of Rome, became Christs Martyrs, and were put to death for mainteynyng the pure faith and doctrine, and for preaching against Idolatrie and the vncleane conuersation of the heathen.</p>
               <p>And whereas in other Churches there spring vp sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry heresies and greuous debates: The Romane Church aboue the rest, did faithfully at that time and in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning kéepe still the purenesse of doctrine, and the consent and agréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of faith. And this was the cause why the men of old time did worthely make so great account of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of those men in the Church and of their consent in the faith: who otherwise would vndoubtedly haue made no reckening at all of the succession in the Sea, onlesse the pastors and the Church of Rome had continued in pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and vnappayred faith.</p>
               <p>Truly there arose dissention euen in this Church also, betwixt <hi>Anicetus</hi> Bishop of Rome, and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> the minister of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> the Disciple of Iohn the Apostle: howbeit not for any Articles of faith, but for kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Easter day. Neuerthelesse the contention endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not long. For they agréed well and brotherly agayne, and willed that euery man should obserue and kéepe still his owne custome that was admitted in his owne Church: that the concord of the Churches might not be broken for the diuersitie of ceremonies. But yet agayne <hi>Victor</hi> the Byshop of the Romane Church takyng more vppon him than became him, and stepping aside from the modestie and simplicitie of his predecessours, aduentured to breake the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement that was begon betwene <hi>Anicetus</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi> &amp; excommunicated the Easterne people that kept the Easter day vpon the xiiii. day of the moneth. Yet for all that, the pastors of the residew of the Churches acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not <hi>Victor</hi> for a commaunder of the Churches, or for such a one as by right might take vpon him authority ouer other Churches. For his ouerbold and rash enterprise was
<pb facs="tcp:7244:36"/>
reproued by the Bishops as well of the East as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> West, that is to wit by the holyest and best learned and by such as were had in chief estimation in that age, namely by <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> Bishop of Ephesus, and by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Bishop of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And so was <hi>Victor</hi> brought agayne into the right way. Which thing <hi>Eusebius</hi> declareth at large in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the Church matters.</p>
               <p>And truly in processe of tyme the vices that had euery where occupyed and corrupted other Churches, began also to enter into the Church of Rome, for there arose a great schisme in the Church of Rome, some chosing <hi>S. Cornelius</hi> to be their pastors, and some choosing <hi>Nouatus</hi> from whom sprong the heresie or sect of the Nouatians, which became very noysome to the Church. But <hi>Cornelius</hi> got the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, vnder whom certein of Aphrike began to put the decidyng of their controuersies to the sea of Rome. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, the blessed Martyr &amp; Byshop of Carthage <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> did set himselfe agaynst them also, and in his 3. booke of Epistles in his first Epistle to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Byshop of Rome whom he calleth his brother, he sayth among other thinges, how it is decréed by all men, yea and also that it is right and reason, that eche mans case should be there heard where the fault is committed. Also he sayth, that vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pastor is allotted a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the slocke, for euery of them to rule and gouerne, and he shall render an account of his doing vnto the Lord. Among these thinges marke that as yet at that tyme the Byshop of Rome, was not taken for: the vniuersall shepheard, to whom all the other Churches should be subiect. Nay rather he sayth that euery shepheard had his seuerall Church committed to him to gouerne, for which he should render account, to the Lord God, and not to the Pope. And <hi>S. Cornelius</hi> himself did not either allow such as appealed out of Affricke to Rome, or desire to rule ouer all other Churches and to be called the souerein Lord of all kinges and kingdomes. To be bréef, these Byshops of the Romane Church were all put to death for the sound
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7244:36"/>
doctrine and the professing of Christes name, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of Rome. So farre were they of from taking vpon them full and absolute power ouer any Princes, and least of all ouer the princes of Rome. For which of so many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, bloudy, &amp; manquellyng princes being mo then xl. in nomber, did they depose from his souereintie? or which of them I pray you did they exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate? Or which of these bishops assoyled the people of their othe made to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours? Or which of all these, said, wrate, or thought himself to haue receiued fulnesse of power at the handes of Christ our Lord by Peter, &amp; to be set ouer kinges and kingdomes? Therfore it is most certein, that these first ministers of the Romane Church, were ignoraunt of the thinges which the Romish Bishops of this last and forworne age haue vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to themselues, and which they haue now a long tyme in vayne indeuered to stablish by the Epistles of those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

               <p>VErely I am not ignorant how there fly abroad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Epistles of these holy Romane Bishops &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs which they call decretals. But they ouerthrow themselues with their owne absurdities, and shew themselues to be but counterfettes, in asmuch as many thinges be so light, so triflyng, and so vtterly vnlike that auncient simplicitie, purenesse, and maiestie, that not with out good cause they séeme vnto godly and learned men, to haue ben deuised long since by others. Neither do I greatly regard that the same are fathered vpon the gatheryng of <hi>Damasus</hi> and <hi>Isidorus:</hi> seyng that there want not some men which put ouer certeine of these kynd of thinges euen to the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. But howsoeuer the case sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for the tyme. I pray yon what can be more fond, then the fathering of these wordes vpon <hi>Anacletus?</hi> This holy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Apostolike Church of Rome obteined the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb facs="tcp:7244:37"/>
and preheminence of power ouer all Churches, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles, but from the very Lord himselfe our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. And again, There was a difference euen betwene the blessed Apostles: and albeit that all of them were Apostles: yet did the Lord graunt and the Apostles determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them selues, that Peter should haue preheminence afore all the rest of the Apostles, and be Cephas, that is to say a head, and hold the souereintie of Apostleship. Thus sayth he. But who knoweth not (though he be but meanely séene in histories,) that after full fiue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeares, it was obteined and ordeined, not by Christ, or his Apostles but by loytering lozels or rather by traiterous perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that Rome should be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of all Churches, that is to wit, that it should obteine supremacie &amp; prerogatiue of power ouer all Churches? Or who would beleue that <hi>Anacletus</hi> exercised himselfe so little in readyng of the Gospell, that he knew not how Cephas signifieth, not a head but a stone or a Rocke? according as it is interpreted by Iohn the Apostle in the first chapter? And which interpreter should a man rather beleue? Iohn the Apostle, or the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet <hi>Anaclete?</hi> The lewd packing then of the lewd lozelles is detected both in these and in many other thinges. The same partie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth very often mention of Archbyshops and metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, neither omitteth he primates. But it is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that those titles were vtterly vnknowen to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, and were afterward inuented and vsurped in times folowyng. And at their first comming vp the maner of vsing them was after a sort méetly tolerable, till their posteritie did afterward vse them or rather misuse them more proudly. Besides this, the sayd counterfet <hi>Anaclete</hi> maketh a Bishop greater than an Elder: whereas Ierome himselfe sheweth by Scriptures, that Elders and Bishops are all one, and that in processe of time Byshops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Elders, not by the ordinaunce of God, but by the ordinaunce of man. Moreouer this <hi>Anacletus</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Appeales that are made to the sea of Rome, saying:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7244:37"/>
that all questions and matters of weight ought to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Apostolike sea, for so had the Apostles decréed. But this selfe same thing is manifestly disallowed by the holy maister of Christ <hi>Cyprian</hi> writyng to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Pope. Many other thinges prateth he concerning the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and iudgementes of the Church: which who soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer séeth not to disagrés with these first tymes of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, he seeth nothyng, but is blynder then a béetle.</p>
               <p>Furthermore there is a decrée fathered vpon Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> wherby he commaundeth that water should be halowed with salt, to clense the people and to put away the secret slightes of the deuill. But who is so light headed to beleue that so great men in so great light of the Gospell published so filthy decrées concerning such baggagely gew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gawes so openly fighting agaynst the Gospell and doctrine of the Apostles? These thinges sauour not that Apostolike and auncient purenesse and maiestie which entierly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth all saluation to the onely bloud of the sonne of God and not to water and salt.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> in the sayd decretall Epistles commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that no man els should touch the holy vesselles but he that is halowed. Ye may perceiue that this stuffe agréeth trimly with the Apostolicall doctrine deliuered by Paul in the 2. to the Colossians, and finally with the histories which openly beare record that euen the laymen receiued &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bread and cup of the Lord with their [bare] handes, certein hundred yeares after this <hi>Sixtus.</hi> Besides this, in the same Epistles, there is open &amp; manifest mention made of <hi>Clementes</hi> iourney, which booke neuerthelesse eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very Decrées of <hi>Gratian</hi> do reiect among the authenticall writynges.</p>
               <p>Yea and <hi>Thelesphorus</hi> commendeth the seuen wéekes fast before Easter, forbidding also the eating of flesh. Which thing againe how well it agréeth with the doctrine of the Apostles, and with the doinges, it is to be knowen by the thinges which S. Paul hath written in the 2. chapter to the
<pb facs="tcp:7244:38"/>
Colossians, and in the 4. chapter of the first Epistle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie, and which <hi>Socrates</hi> hath left written in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall historie in the 5. booke and xxii. chap. but most of all which are taken out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the 5. booke and xxvi. chapter of his Ecclesiasticall historie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer in those Epistles <hi>Calixtus</hi> is reported to haue ordeined the imber fast at foure seasons of the yeare. Which thing others referre to other authors or founders. And among this stuffe this is a thing that can not be read without laughter, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> the predecessour of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciades</hi> doth with so great statelinesse commaund the feast of the finding of the holy crosse to be solemnized the vi. day of May. For some declare that the crosse was not yet found at this time, but a xx. yeares after by <hi>Helene</hi> the mother of the Emperour <hi>Constantine.</hi> Agayne how superstitious, péeuishe, and fond géere are commaunded in the same Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, namely that Nonnes should not touche the holy ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. As who should say there had ben any Nunnes as yet in those dayes, the first comming vp of whom is referred to farre later times. Many other thinges of this sort do I passe ouer willingly, least I might make my readers to cast vp their stomakes. For in these Epistles there be very many thinges so foolish, so farre agaynst reason, so full of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so full of ambition: that all men which haue eyes may gather therby that they be counterfettes, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for asmuch as there is very seldome or no mention at all made in all the booke through out, of vncorrupted fayth in Christ, yea or of Christ himselfe our redemer, &amp; of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which the father hath giuen vs in him, which thinges are the naturall markes of Apostolicall writinges. Now although there be many thinges in them not vnprofitable to be read: yet are the same thinges to be found in other men set forth more purely, and without any paringes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerfretted with the filthinesse of mans traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it is very well knowen that those first most pure tymes of the Church were not acquaynted with so many
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7244:38"/>
ceremonies, so many decrées, and so many constitutions, as are found vrged vpon Gods Church in those Epistles. For the holy and deuout folke of old time had not yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Apostolicke Counsell that was held at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, wherin not onely Peter playnly would not there should be any yoke layd vppon the frée neckes of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but also moreouer it séemed good to the holy Ghost and to the whole primitiue Church of the Apostles, that there should not any burthen be layd hereafter vppon the faithfull. This story is knowen to be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the xv. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Actes of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>But if our aduersaries will nedes procede to mainteine that these are the very Epistles of those men vppon whom they be fathered: we haue aunswered a little afore, how they be of no authoritie against the doctrine of the Gospell and the Apostles, and therfore we admit them not in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Notwithstanding by the way we haue better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so, of so great learned men, and of so holy Martyrs of Christ, neither will we in any wise stayne and deface their honorable names and blessed memoriall with such maner of gewgawes, wherof out of all doubt there neuer came any in their mindes, no not euen in their dreames.</p>

               <p>NEuerthelesse we must néedes graunt, that from the tyme of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, who did set the Churches in peace, not onely the Bishops of Rome, but also the Bishops of other Churches through the worlde began to step aside from the playne footesteppes of their predecessors, and claue not so carefully to the simple doctrine of the Apostles, and therfore admitted mo ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

               <p>But howsoeuer the Bishops as well of Rome as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches began to grow worse and worse, yet were they still ignorant of that Romish Monarchie or rather ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rannie which is defended at this day. For that I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nothing hether out of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter writers of Gods Church: doth not S. Hierome in his Epistle to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> and in his Commentaries vpon S. Paules Epistle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, most manisfestly make the Bishop of Rome and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church of Rome it selfe, equall with all other Byshops and Chuches in the world? Doth he not openly say, that the Churches in old time were gouerned by the common aduise of the elders? Doth he not most piththely shew out of the Scriptures, that elders and bishops be all one thing? and that the one is not the name of age and the other of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Doth he not playnly say that Bishops were preferred before elders, &amp; elders made subiect to Bishops, by custome of the Church and not by appointment of God? Wherfore it were truly a wonder, why <hi>Epiphanius</hi> agaynst the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> should recken vp this thing for an heresie, which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome vrgeth with so many and so piththy wordes: but that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7244:39"/>
others giue me warnyng that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was to gentle in charging other folkes with heresie. Truly in this case (to speake with reuerence of so great a learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully misreported the giltlesse, contrarie without authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the holy Scripture. But if any man list to heare Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes owne wordes, behold I will briefly rehearse the thinges that make to this purpose. We must not (sayth he to <hi>Euagrius</hi>) esteme the Church of Rome to be one, &amp; the Church of the whole world to be another. Both <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> and <hi>Affrike,</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Eastcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and <hi>Inde,</hi> and all the barbarous natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, worshyp one Christ, &amp; obserue one rule of truth. If authoritie be sought, the world is greater than a Citie. Where soeuer is a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, whether he be of Rome, or of Eugubie, or of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, or of Tanais, he is all one in merite, all one in Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode. The statelinesse of riches or the basenesse of pouertie maketh not a Bishop either higher or lower? but all of them are successors of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>And vpon the Epistle of S. Paul vnto Titus: An El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (sayth he) and a Byshop are both one. And before such tyme as by the instinct of the deuill there were sectes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and it was sayd among folke, I hold of Paule, I of Apollo, and I of Cephas: the Churches were gouerned by the common aduise of the Elders. But after the time that euery man imagined those whom he had baptised to be his owne and not Christes: it was decréed through the whole world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that one (he speaketh not of the bishop of Rome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of all other Metropolitanes through the whole world) should be chosen from among the Elders, and set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the rest, vnto whom the charge of the whole Church should belong, and so the séedes of schismes and variances be taken away. Againe when the same Ierome had proued and shewed by many textes of Scripture, that Elders and Byshops are all one thing he addeth byanby: I haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mencioned these thinges, that I might shew how El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Bishops were all one thing, and that for the pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:7244:40"/>
vp of the plantes of dissention, the charge of all things was by little put vnto one. Therfore like as Priests know that by the custome of the Church they be subiect to him that is set ouer them: so also let the Bishops vnderstand that they be greater than the Priestes rather by custome than by truth of Christes ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and that they ought to gouerne the Church in common. And so forth.</p>
               <p>And although I thinke not that any man will looke for plainer &amp; fuller matter in this present case than this which I haue rehearsed already out of Ierome: yet will I adde somewhat more out of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who was himselfe a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, placed in that sea the yeare of our Lord. 591. in which he dyed the yeare of our Lord 64. He alone wilbe a sufficient able witnesse, that in his time the sayd tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Popish Monarchie was not yet either placed in that sea, nor grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to it. Before this <hi>Gregorie</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to the Byshoprik of Rome, he was Pretor or Maior of the Citie of Rome, as he himselfe witnesseth in his booke of Epistles the second Epistle. Beyng chosen Byshop &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his Bishoprike or sea by the Emperour <hi>Morice</hi> who kept his residence at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> he calleth him Emperour &amp; acknowledgeth him to be his souerein Lord ordeined by God, and himselfe to be his subiect &amp; seruaunt. Yea and he faithfully obeyed his Exarkes and Captaines that were placed through Italie, calling them his Lordes. He obeyed their lawes, yea and their Ecclesiasticall lawes to. All which thinges are to be read in his Epistles, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 61. Againe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 31. <hi>&amp; Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 43. Also, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Epist.</hi> 11. Besides this <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in his 4. booke &amp; 9. chap. of the doyngs of the Lombardes, witnesseth that <hi>Gregorie</hi> submitted himselfe to be iudged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maurice,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murther of <hi>Malchus</hi> a byshop, wherof he was appeached. And <hi>Gregorie</hi> him selfe maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same matter in the seuenth booke of his Epistles.</p>
               <p>But these thinges will séeme light and small, if they be compared with those which he himselfe hath left in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7244:40"/>
For when as one <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of Constantinople would néedes be called <hi>oeconomicall</hi> Bishop and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for vniuersall Bishop to haue supremacie, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and dominion ouer all Churches and Byshops of Churches in the whole world: <hi>Gregorie</hi> withstode him sharpely and stoutly, like as Bishop <hi>Pelagius</hi> had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He wrate many and sundry Epistles concernyng that matter to <hi>Maurice</hi> the Emperour, to <hi>Constance</hi> the Empresse, to <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe the Bishop of Constantinople, and to the Bishops of Antioche and Alexandria. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges he denieth that any man ought to be an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Bishop sauing Christ, &amp; that any Bishops vsurped that title afore him. For he sayth, that the title is, straunge, foolish, proude, péeuish, wicked, and heathenish, wherunto to consent, were euen as much as to renounce the fayth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne speakyng of <hi>Iohn</hi> of Constantinople, Out of the same dust (sayth he) in which he sate, and out of the same lowlynesse which he pretended, he hath taken presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, so as he assayeth to ascribe all thinges to himselfe, and by haultinesse of stately spéech indeuereth to subdue all Christes members to himselfe, which cleaue alonely to their owne head, that is to say, to the same Christ. Anon after comparing with Lucifer, he writeth: Lucifer sayd, I will clymb into heauen, I will exalt my throne aboue the starres of the skie. For what els are all thy brethren the Byshops of the vniuersall Church, but starres of heauen? whose life together with their toung shineth among mens sinnes &amp; errours, as it were in the dareknesse of the night. Before whom when thou couetest to preferre thy selfe by title of preheminence, and to treade their name vnder foote in comparison of thine owne, what els sayest thou, but I will clymb vp into heauen &amp;c. Finally writing to the same <hi>Iohn</hi> Byshop of Constantinople, all thinges (sayth he) that were forespoken, do come to passe. The kyng of pride is néere at hand, and (which is a shame to be spoken) there is an army of Priestes in preparing for him. For they which
<pb facs="tcp:7244:41"/>
were set to be lodesmen of lowlynesse serue as souldiers vnder the necke of loftinesse. And the same man agayne in his 6. booke of Epistles and the xxx. Epist. But I say boldly, that who soeuer termeth himselfe or desireth to be termed the vniuersall Bishop, is in his pride the forerunner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, bycause he preferreth himselfe by his proudnesse before the residue, and by like pryde is led into errour. And certes <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath spoken these thynges most truly. For the sayd <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of Constantinople was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forerunner of Antichrist, as who by his wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate demaund of highest preheminence, gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Byshops of Rome to aspire to the top of supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie. Among them after the death of <hi>Gregorie, Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the third obteyned of the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> that he should proclaime the Church of Rome to the head of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, as <hi>Bede</hi> sayth: to be the first Church, as <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> sayth: or to be the mother Church, as <hi>Vrspergensis</hi> and <hi>Crantzius</hi> say. Whereupon the Bishops of Rome as beyng Byshops of the souerein S<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

For the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> (sayth <hi>Naucle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in his hystorie) by the Byshop of Romes persuasion sent abroad proclamations openly and to the whole world, ordeinyng that all the Churches of the world should obey the Church and Byshop of Rome. The same History wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter addeth further that in tymes forepast, the same procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was not obserued in all pointes, and specially not of the Greekes &amp;c. The sayd <hi>Phocas</hi> that made this law was a monster of mankynd, a most vnthrifty Prince, a most cruell murtherer, a thrall of lecherie, and all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as histories beare witnesse, and of all kynges the wretcheddest.

               <p>NOt vnfitly are diuerse godly and learned men of the Church reported to haue sayd, that among the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Byshops of Rome that are worthy to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among Shepherdes, <hi>Gregory</hi> is the last.

Among other thing, Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, Lord and God, leauing (saith he) his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly throne, became mortall and poore, that he might make vs immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and rich. And when he had conquered hell and was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning triumphantly into heauen, he gaue vs hys peace, he left vs his peace, and he assigned concord and mutuall loue to be as it were the badge and cognisance whereby his citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens might be discerned from the souldiers of the infernall Ioue. And he gaue vs earnest warning to beware of false Christes and false Prophetes, namely men that should séeke to raigne ouer vs, and to mocke vs vnder the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian name and byshoply title. If we be not blynde, we sée a most cruell woolfe in a shéepes skinne, vnder the title of the chiefe byshop. The Romish flamines haue warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Christians, being growen great by aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by deceiuing, and by sowing warre vppon warre, they kill the shéepe, they slea, they driue peace and concord out of the world, they bring vp ciuill warres, and house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold debates from hell, and they weake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all mens stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthes dayly more and more, that they themselues may leape o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all mens heades, deuour all men, and bring all men in bondage.

Iustice waxeth skant: vngodlinesse, couetousnesse, desire of honor, loue of money, and lechery waxe rise. Christ forbiddeth vs to hate our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and commaundeth vs to loue them. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Romish sort vnder great pretence of holinesse, commaund men to breake stedfast couenauntes, to abuse Gods holy name to deceiue men withall, to be vnkinde to such as haue deserued well, to recompence good déedes with euill déedes, to make warre, to quarrell, to beguile, and to betray. <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (the same is <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth) a hundred threscore and tenne yeares agoe layde first the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

is continued vnto this day by his successors. First they thrust out the Emperour from the election of the byshops, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied it to the people and the clergie. After they had geuen them a mocke also and hist them out of doores, now they labour to bring vs also vnder coram and bondage, that they may raigne alone.

Beleue me (I speake of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) they will not cease till they haue gotten all into their owne handes. The Pope imagineth new deuises in his brest, to the intent he may stablish his owne Empyre, he altereth lawes, he stablisheth his owne, he defileth, he filtheth, he spoyleth, he defraudeth, he killeth. That lost man whom men are wont to call Antichrist, in whose forehead is written a name of blasphemy, that is to wit, <hi>I am God, and I cannot erre,</hi> euen that lost soule I say sitteth in Gods temple and raigneth far and wide. These and many other thinges like these, did that holy byshop discourse with great boldnesse and constancie. Neither was this Prelate altogether a vayne Prophet, considering that within thréescore yeares after, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight of that name, a most filthy and vngracious wight is reported to haue bene puffed vp into so diuelish and brasenfaste pride, that openly in the Iubilie (which he himselfe first inuented and ordayned contrary to the Christian fayth) he durst vaunt himselfe as highest byshop and chiefe Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great assembly and prease of people of all nacions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen. For the first day he came forth in hys byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like apparell, and gaue the foolishe people his Apostolike blissing as they terme it. And the next day wearing an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall crowne, and being clothed in robes of estate, he commaunded a naked sword to be borne before hym, and sittyng downe in a throne, cryed out, <hi>Behold here be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7244:43"/>
the two swordes.</hi> And being not satisfied with this Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferlike gaze, he durst yet further at the same time most spitefully reiect the Ambassadours of the Princes Electors which gaue him to vnderstand that they had chosen <hi>Albert</hi> Prince of Habspurge and Austrich, the sonne of king <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus,</hi> to be king of Romanes: yea and also to make a lawe in all respectes tyrannicall, and Antichristian, which is extant in the extrauagantes, in the booke of maioritie &amp; obedience, beginning with <hi>vnam Sanctam. &amp;c.</hi> In that lawe, after he hath attributed all power both spirituall, &amp; temporall to the Pope: in the end he concludeth the same and saith: moreouer we declare, auouch, determine, and geue sentence that it is vtterly of necessitie of saluation, that all men be subiect to the byshop of Rome. Whereas there is commonly blazed abroad of the same byshop this commendation of his, that he entred as a Fox, raigned as a woolfe, (others haue as a Lion) and dyed as a dogge: And whereas Phillip the fayre king of Fraunce appeached him of heresie, murther, simonie, and all maner of most hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes: yet are not the Papistes ashamed to alledge still the sayd stinking lawe of this rancke varlet for the maintenaunce of their monarchy.</p>
               <p>Hereunto perteineth it, that the Bull of <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxij. published agaynst <hi>Lewes</hi> the 4. Emperour of that name, (which Bull <hi>Auentine</hi> rehearseth whole in his vii. booke of Chronicles) sayth among other thinges: When the chief Empire happeneth to be without a head, the souerein pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it is in the handes of the highest Bishop, whole bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the same is, &amp;c. This durst he write the yeare of our Lord. 323. So greatly were their corages increased since <hi>Boniface</hi> dyed in prison, which was within xxiij. yeares space. But the Emperour <hi>Lewes</hi> aunswereth the Bull at large by a proclamation, which is to be read copyed whole by the same <hi>Auentine</hi> into his booke of histories. In the same proclamation, among other thinges, The Byshop (sayth he meaning <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxij) thristeth, after Christian
<pb facs="tcp:7244:44"/>
bloud, and soweth euery where the mischief of discord and seditions among Christians. Neither can the Christians kéepe the peace giuen them of God, by reason of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. So great is the madnesse of that man, or rather of that féend, that he preacheth his owne wicked doynges as if they were good déedes, in open audience. When Christian Princes (sayth he) are at variance one with an other, then is the Romish Priest the hyghest Byshop in déede, then rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth he, then is he in his ruffe. And so the debate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Germanes is meate and drinke to the Byshops of Rome. Therfore it standes the high prelate in hand to weaken the Empire of the Almaines. And a little after the Emperour sayth. Looke who soeuer kéepe their allegeance to the Emperour, and to Christ our Sauiour which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them to obey: Them for so doyng and for none other cause, doth he brond with the marke of heresie. What soeuer he listeth, he déemeth it lawfull. How shall I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deale with him? He mindeth not to execute or to know any right, any equitie, any good. He séeth nothyng, he doth nothyng, but what he listeth himselfe. He taketh to him the spirit of Sathan, and maketh himselfe like the highest. He suffereth himselfe to be worshipped (which thing a certaine aungell forbade Iohn to do vnto him) and his féete to bée kissed, after the maner of the most cruel tyrantes <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whereas Christ our Lord and kyng washed the féete of his Disciples beyng but fishermen, to the intent that his messengers should do the same agayne to those that they were sent to: &amp; so forth. I haue rehearsed these things, to the end that the manifest record and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely of a famous Byshop, but also of a most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kyng or Emperour, concernyng this latter vnhappy and vngracious Bishops, might remaine in record.</p>
               <p>In the same tyme of <hi>Lewes</hi> the iiij. about the yeare of our Lord .1330. that is to say, two hundred and forty yeares ago, florished the renowmed and sage Lawyer <hi>Marsilius</hi> of Padua, who wrate a singular booke for the Emperour

                  <hi>Lewes</hi> the 4. agaynst the Byshops of Rome, and intitled it the defence of peace. In the same booke <hi>Dict.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. he sheweth by many and those most euident reasons that neither the Byshop of Rome, no nor any other Byshop, or Priest hath any souereintie ouer any man, either clerks or layman: and that by the example of Christ, if any such be offered them they ought to refuse it: and that all By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Churchmen ought to be subiect to the souerein that ruleth them. Agayne the same man in <hi>Dict.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25 sayth thus: They haue taken to them the title which they make their boast of, namely <hi>The fulnesse of power:</hi> which they say that Christ gaue peculiarly vnto them in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of S.

And agayne, Although the Euangelist sayd trew in auouchyng Christ to be kyng of kynges, and Lord of Lordes: yet notwithstandyng he that hath auouched any power of souereintie at all &amp; much lesse any full power, to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the Bishop of Rome, or to any other Bishop, in the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S.

But such power is, was, and shalbe forbidden by Christ vnto the Byshop of Rome and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the person of any of the Apostles, accordyng as we haue vndoubtedly certified you by the Scripture and the authorities of holy men in the 4.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>Dist.</hi> hereof.

               <head>¶This discourse is concluded, and here is shewed that the sentence of Pope Pius the fifth published against the most vertuous Queene of England, and all her whole noble Realme, is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fond and of none effect.</head>

                  <pb facs="tcp:7244:45"/>BUt to what purpose serueth so déepe repetyng of these thinges will some man say? Surely all these thinges serue to this purpose, that it may appeare manifestly by them, yea &amp; be perceiued eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the most simplest sort of all, that this fulnesse of power &amp; souereintie ouer all kings &amp; kyngdomes, which the sayd Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth braggeth of in hys Bull, to be giuen vnto himselfe and to all By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome, is nothyng els but <hi>Bullyng</hi> or <hi>Bublyng,</hi> that is to say nothyng els but a most vayne forgerie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deuilish and cursed lye deuised, found out, and forced vpon the people of God, by the Popes themselues and by flattering clawbackes of their owne stamp. For Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gaue any such thyng either to Peter or to the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. Neyther did Peter leaue any whit thereof to his successors: so as I may well say, that the Popes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse than the successors of Simon Peter, but rather the successors of Simon Magnus. Moreouer the Lord in his Gospell not once nor darckely, but most openly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth byshops to obey kinges, and not to raigne ouer them. And therefore the Apostles and the first byshops of the Romane Church, were ministers of the Church, yea and martyrs, but not Princes of nacions: and they yelded due obedience vnto Princes. What maner of men the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter byshops of Rome be and haue bene, who stepping aside from the footsteppes of the fathers, haue both vniustly vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and cruelly executed, the sayd fulnesse of power, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they now make their boast, they are knowen to all men, not by their vertues but by their unspeakeble outrages. What els remayneth then, but that the sentence of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift (who as he sayth himselfe is mounted vp into the throne of Iustice to geue iudgement) which he by the fulnesse of his power hath geuen and pronounced defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely by publishing it against the most vertuous Quéene of England and the noble Realme of England, is vtterly nothing and of none effect, because it is but a vayne, a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and counterfet power, by force wherof this disguised
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7244:45"/>
Iudge hath geuen sentence, not as a Iudge, but as a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, and Antichrst.</p>
               <p>Therefore O England (happie euen in the same res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect) when thou séest the Romish thunderbolts which the Bull spreddeth into the whole world, to be throwen and darted agaynst thée: thou must thinke it is but a new Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Cacus that puffeth out again his vaine flashes of fire, from those his shadie dennes of meant Auentine blinded with much mist, and dazeleth the sight of blearied folke with black fogginesse and darcknes mixt with fire. They that haue receiued their eysight by the grace of God, know well inough what that fond Salmonean lightener is, namely euen the man of sinne, &amp; the child of damnation, as the Apostle saith, which is lifted vp against all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God or the power of God, in so much as he sitteth in the temple of God, boasting himselfe to be God. Therfore the godly and those that be enlightened beleue that God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their curssages and curseth their blessinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his excommunications are nothing to be feared.</p>
               <p>Surely from the time that these men executed that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable power of theirs in the Church, they haue bene so farre from holding Gods people together in the vnitie of the spirit, or from bringing them to their Sauiour, that they rather dispersed them &amp; pulled them away from them their Sauiour.

               <head>¶Here are perused the articles as well of the accusation as also of the slaunders alleadged by the Byshop of Rome in his Bull agaynst the most vertuous Queene of England.</head>
               <p>NOw let vs also come downe to the chiefe pointes of the accusation which <hi>Pius</hi> the fift the byshop of Rome bendeth against the most vertuous Quéene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For by confuting them, and by mainteining the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and innocency of that vertuous Quéene and her
<pb facs="tcp:7244:46"/>
noble Realme, it will appeare againe to the whole world, that the Popes curse is but a very flimflaw and a filme of a nutshell as they say in the prouerbe. Least he might not resemble the reuiling &amp; blasphemous mouth of Antichrist, he beginneth these thinges with rayling and slaundring, for he termeth the noble Prince kyng <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this good Quéene, an Apostata, as who turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Church of England from the Church of Rome, &amp; he termeth his daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the grace of God now Quéene of England, a thrall of wickednes, as who (by his saying) hath plucked backe and called againe into miserable destruction, the Realme of England which had bene brought to the catholike faith by Queene <hi>Marie</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceased: and also is become the refuge of heretickes. If the beast should not speake so, he could not be beleued to be the same that he is. For so doth he trimly fulfill the things that are written of Antichrist. For Saint Peter speaking of Antichrist, and of Antichristes household, saith that God knoweth how to reserue the wicked to be punished at the day of iudgement, and specially such as folowing the flesh (that is to say, such as being led by lust of the flesh, and not by inspiration of the spirit) walke in vncleane concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and despise Lordship (that is to say, the order of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion &amp; soueraintie) &amp; such as malapertly standyng in their own conceit (that is to wit, such as being stubburne &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilfull in their owne opinions) are not afrayd to rayle &amp; reuile the higher powers: wheras y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very angels (which are greater in power and strength than they) geue not rayling sentence against them before the Lord: and so forth as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the second chapter of Saint Peters second Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Herewithall agrée the thinges which the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Iudas Thaddaeus</hi> hath left written concerning the same matter, saying: these defyle the flesh, despise rulers, and rayle vpon them that be in authoritie. But in the law of God, commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is geuen that thou shalt not raile vppon the Gods,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.</note> nor blaspheme the Prince of thy people.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7244:46"/>
A man may sée that the Byshops of Rome make great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of these thinges, when they raile vppon Princes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. But what (I pray you) haue kinges committed whereby they should deserue to be ouerwhelmed with so many &amp; so great reproches and with so foule raylinges?</p>
               <p>In déede, that wise Prince king <hi>Henry</hi> the viii. tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Church that is in England away from many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish superstitions that were very fowle. And what offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he therin? Nay rather, he deserued prayse, and his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng away is counted among wise men, a vertue, and not a vyce. Moreouer the renowme of this Prince is so famous among all good and godly men, as it can not be defaced by the raylinges of these rascals of the Romish sink. He was of singular learnyng, of notable wisedome and experience, of excellent corage, and adorned with all heroicall vertues and feates méete for a Prince. And it is not I alone that thinke thus of this Kyng: there be other graue personages which haue commended the same thinges in hym. This Prince departyng blessedly out of this lyfe in the xxxviii. yeare of his reigne about the end of Ianuary in the yeare of our Lord .1547. and hauyng erst by his will intayled the succession of his Crowne first vnto his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> a young child of ix. yeares of age, and successiuely after hym, vnto his daughters <hi>Marie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> was succeded by the sayd <hi>Edward,</hi> the vi. of that name, whose ample com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations that notable Historiographer <hi>Sleidan</hi> hath comprised in few wordes in the xxv. booke of his Comenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, saying: <hi>Edward</hi> the vi. the kyng of England, doutlesse a Prince of singular towardnesse, departed out of this lyfe the vi. day of Iuly in the yeare of our Lord. 1553. beyng about the age of xvi. yeares, truly to the grief of all godly men. For after his decease there folowed a very great alteration of thinges in England. Surely Europe hath not had any kyng of so great hope now these certein hundred yeares. Beyng very well trayned vp in godlinesse and instructed in learnyng euen from his tender yeares, he was séene not

And what els is that, but to wype away all shamefastnesse, and openly and wickedly to rebell agaynst God, and to outface him, with saying to him, but we will do so, and not simply, but also farre further, yea and more to. But I haue shewed eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inough afore, that all pastors of Churches are called and ordeined by Christ, not to beare rule, but to serue in all thinges.</p>

For if the thyng be sayd to be done monstruously, which is done either agaynst nature or Gods expresse ordinaunce: I pray you what can be deuised more monstruous, than that he whom the Lord of all thinges, of whom commeth all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and dominion, hath cast downe as the basest seruaunt of all, and put farre vnderneath the footestooles of all Lordes, should not onely take vpon him the chayre of estate which God hath graunted onely to kynges: but also moreouer, deuise himselfe a throne which he will haue séeme to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted aboue the thrones of all kinges: and mountyng vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same without remembraunce of his own base estate, deuilishly vaunt himselfe to the whole world, not now as a King or Emperour onely, but also as chief Byshop that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth both the swordes and all power both in heauen and in earth? Here is that dubbleshapped monster, here, here is
<pb facs="tcp:7244:49"/>

But for a kyng or a Quéene to be called a head as well in spirituall as temporall matters within their owne Realme, it is no monstruousnesse at all, bycause the Lord hath so ordeined it, &amp; in Gods word Princes be called the heades of the people, &amp; so the thing can not be sayd to be done mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struously agaynst nature,<note place="margin">That Quenes although they be women, doe reigne lawfully</note> which is done according to Gods will &amp; word. With Kyngs I ioyne Quéenes also, and not without cause, least the Pope perchaunce might surmyse, that women are excluded from reignyng, or that it is a monstruous thyng if a woman should reigne. For we know that the thinges which the Apostle speaketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the obedience of wiues and the silence of women in the congregation of God, are not to be wrested vnto rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gning. For it is certein that the Lords Apostles impeached not the successions in kyngdomes, ne disordered not the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed maner of inherityng in kyngdomes.

But they submitted themselues redely to their Prince, and obeyed his holy hestes in all thinges. It is declared at large in the holy Scriptures, that <hi>Iosias</hi> did set order in the whole Religion accordyng to the rule of Gods law,<note place="margin">

               <p>And yet in the meane while, the Princes meddled not with the sacrificing, which God had committed to the

Priestes.<note place="margin">God made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and will not haue them confounded.</note> For that was not lawfull for them without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as it appeared by kyng <hi>Azarias,</hi> otherwise na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Osias,</hi> who was striken with leprosie for presumyng wilfully to burne incense vpon the brasen altar, contrarie to Gods ordinaunce. For it is one thing to sacrifice and to execute the offices that belong peculiarly to the Priestes: and an other thyng to dispose the Priesthode and discipline of the Church in conuenient order, and to kéepe them when they be ordered. For God hath sorted these offices asunder, and will not haue them confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.<note place="margin">Kynges of the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t haue no lesse authoritie then had the kynges of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</note> And what man (except it be some giddybraynd and froward Anabaptist,) will say that Christen Princes haue lesse authoritie and power in the Churches of Christenfolke, than the Iewish kynges had in the Synagoges? Can ye say, that the authoritie of these is diminished by Christ our Lord, or by his Apostles? Most certein it is, that it is not diminished by Christ. For the Prophetes, and among them specially <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 2. Psalme, and Esay in his 49. chapter &amp; in other places, haue foretold that kings should come into the Church of Christ, &amp; that they should not onely lead their liues there after the maner of other Christen men, but also more ouer continue there still in gouernyng, defending, &amp; aduauncing Church affaires, as kinges still executyng kyngly power. Which point S. Austin handleth excellently, garnishyng and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightenyng it with many sentences, agaynst the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, which denyed the Magistrate to haue any power at all to deale in matters of the Church. Furthermore it is certein, that Christes Apostles remoued not the faithfull Magistrate from the administration of Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, therby to make Christen kynges of lesse power than the kynges of the Iewes had. For they say expresly that Princes are Gods ministers, yea and ordeined to plant the thing that is good, and to plucke vp the thing that is euill. But who is so ouerlode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the flesh, that he will restreine these things to the flesh onely and to outward affaires: and not also extend them to mens soules, and to spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7244:51"/>
Considering how it is agréed vpon among all men of a right opinion, that a Magistrate ought to looke chiefly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such thinges as belong to the maintenaunce of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like welfare of the common weale, or of the happy state of their Realmes. But it is out of all dout, that the diligent care of faith and Religion make to the increase and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the happie state and welfare of kyngdomes and common weales: and therfore no man (but he that is an enemy to the happy state of Gods people) can deny that the regard of Religion also perteineth to Princes or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. And that so much the lesse, bicause we learne plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by readyng the stories of the kinges of Iuda and Israel, that those kyngdomes were and are most happie, wherin the Princes do faithfully administer matters of Religion: and that those be most vnhappie wherin the kynges either neglect or peruert the matters of the Church, and bryng thinges into the Church, which Gods word hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and fill all thinges with mens traditions.</p>
               <p>Furthermore we haue notable examples of those Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Princes,<note place="margin">Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church.</note> which (accordyng to the Prophesies) came into Christes Church and renownced their heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishnesse, and shewed themselues faithfull fosterfathers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerséers, and defenders of the Church. Among the first in account is <hi>Constantine</hi> who for his noble actes and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold vertewes was surnamed the great.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Constantine</hi> the great.</note> This man closed vp the temples of idols, and abolished all heathenish sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. In <hi>Nice</hi> a citie of <hi>Bithynia</hi> he called a Counsell, the greatest of all Counsels and of most authoritie, And there he rebuked the Byshops sharply and layd his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon them, &amp; set order in the matters of the Church. <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the life of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantine,</hi> is not afrayd to terme this Prince a Byshop, bycause he did most diligently looke to the matters of the Church. If any man require the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors wordes, thus they be. <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantine</hi> (sayth he) imployed his care vpon the Church of God. And bycause many were at oddes among themselues in diuers places: he beyng or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
<pb facs="tcp:7244:52"/>
a common Byshop by God, sommoned a Dyet of Gods Ministers. Neither disdained he to be at it himself, &amp; to sit amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, &amp; to become a felow of theirs, &amp; to dispose to all of them the thynges that made for the peace of God. Thus much sayth he. Behold, here is a Councell called, not by the Pope, but by the Emperour. Wherupon when one <hi>Ruffinus</hi> obiected a certein Councell agaynst <hi>Ierome,</hi> he aunswered, saying: shew thou me what Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it to be assembled. Moreouer the strife of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had burst further out, if this Emperour had not bridled them, and brought them to order. This Prince by his intermedlyng in matters of Religion &amp; of the Church, dyd within a while not onely salue them but also greatly further them. Which thing the Emperours, <hi>Valentine, Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> did in likewise, as it appeareth in the beginnyng of <hi>Iustinians Code.</hi> And the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> in <hi>Nouellis tit.</hi> 2 concerning Iewes, Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, &amp;c. confesseth to <hi>Florentius,</hi> that the searchyng out of Religion is the chief charge and greatest care that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes to the Maiestie of an Emperour.

Therefore if these men pyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for sorrow, and dyed miserably in prison, that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Quéenes Maiestie: for they may wite it vppon theyr owne vniust stubbernesse, ioyned with maliciousnes: they may wite it vpon their owne most wilfull rebellious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in generall vpon their owne wickednes. And as for those that be punished, or put to death for their owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, the righteous Lord God geueth sentence vpon them in his owne law, saying: Their bloud be vpon their owne heades. Most excellent and true also is the sentence of S. Iohn Chrisostome: No man is hurt, but by himself. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore Paule in expresse wordes to the Romanes saith: Princes are not a terror to them that do well,<note place="margin">

Why then did not these men well, whome the Bull bewayleth? for so should they doubtlesse haue receyued both prayse &amp; reward at the Quéenes hand, being a gracious and bountifull prince.

For like as Iosias calling a parlament or Couusell of his noble men, Priestes, and Commons, did first cause the law of God to be read openly before them, and then obediently refourmed hys whole realme, woord for word according to the law that was read: And like as Constantine summoned a generall counsell of the teachers and Ministers of the Churches through the whole worlde, and sitting downe among them sayd, The bookes of the Gospelles, and the Apostles together with the oracles of the auncient Prophets, do plainly entruct vs of Gods meaning and will: and therefore laying aside all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylike discord, let vs take the exposition of our questions out of the sayinges of the Holie Ghost: Euen so King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward summoning a parlament at London of all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, Bishoppes, and notablest learned men through hys whole realme, admitting also the famousest clarkes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther realmes being Gods seruauntes, commaunded them to shew by the holy scriptures, what was to be followed of him and his realme, in so great diuersity of opinions. And they executing faythfully the charge which the King had enioyned them, did the same time with one consent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods woord, agrée vpon certaine articles, which the King did both receiue and publish without delay, wyth this title set afore them: Articles agréeed vpon by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and other learned men in the Parlament holden at London in the yeare of our Lord 1552. for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the diuersitie of opinions, and the stablishing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente in the true religion, published by authoritie of the Kinges maiestie. Therefore by the labour and endeuor of that godly prince King Edward, the English Church was

               <p>Most false also is this that the Bull auoucheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene to haue abolished prayer and fastyng.<note place="margin">Not prayer but the abuse of prayer is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> For she hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the abuses and superstitions in them and not the good thynges themselues which God hath commended vnto vs. Which thing the matter it selfe doth openly auouch. It can not be denyed but prayer and fastyng are couered with abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and superstitions, yea and with Idolatries almost innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, among the Papistes. Among them prayer is not made to God alone, neither beleue they that God heareth vs for the intercession of Christ alone.

And they haue in such wife commended the intercession and defense of Saintes to the wretched people, that they know litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng of Christes intercession to God the father, which is the onely acceptable and effectuall intercession. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they serue and worship God and Baal together.</p>
               <p>The Popish fastynges are not wynges and helpes of prayer nor an humbling of our selues wherby our amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is declared,<note place="margin">Fastyng.</note> but meritorious workes and playne hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.

And if they be compared with the fastyngs of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, they shalbe found to be nothyng lesse than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings.

For there is but one true Church, which is the Catholike Church. There is but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one body, vnder the one Christ, in whom onely is salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherupon it foloweth that there is no saluation but onely in the Church. Therfore the Church of Rome, lyke as also the Church of Antioche, or of Alexandria, or of any other place, is not the Catholike Church. For they be but members of that vniuersall body, if so be that they be by one faith and one doctrine knit into this vniuersalitie as in the body vnder the head Christ. The Catholike Church then comprehendeth the Church of the fathers before Christes comming, and our Church after his comming and consequently all the Saintes or faithful folkes of all places &amp; tymes, and (to conclude in one word) of tymes past, tyme present, and tymes to come: all which are one Catholike or vniuersall body, vnder one Catholike or vniuersall head Christ.<note place="margin">The Catholik fayth and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> And so the Catholike faith &amp; doctrine is that which is preached and heard in this Catholike Church, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng all thinges to Christ the onely head of saluation, and depending wholly vpon the word of God, and directing and gouerning all her matters by the same.<note place="margin">Catholikes.</note> Therefore those be Catholikes in déede, which in what place soeuer or in what tyme soeuer they be, are in the felowshyp of this one body, vnder the onely head Christ, beyng all of one fayth and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, attributing their whole saluation vnto Christ alone, &amp; dependyng wholly vpon his holy and most soothfast word.

               <p>The same Austen in his 48. Epistle to <hi>Vincent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augustine him selfe also was sometyme of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that no man was to be compelled.</note> against the Donatistes, concernyng the restreinyng of heretikes by force, sayth: I haue bene of opinion heretofore that no man is to be compelled to the vnitie of Christ: but that we must deale with them by the word, fight with them by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ouercome them by reason, least we might make them feyned Catholikes, whom we knew to be open here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.

Kinges therfore in asmuch as they are kinges, do then serue God, when they do that thing to serue God withall, which they could not do if they were not kinges. Considering then that kinges serued not the Lord in the time of the Apostles, but as yet imagined vaine thinges against God and against his annointed, that the sayinges of the Prophetes might be fulfilled: truly vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse could not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be prohibited, but rather it was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by lawes. For the state of those tymes was so far out of order, that euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes slew them that preached Christ, thinking themselues to do God high seruice, (according as Christ had prophesied afore,) &amp; the Genttles raged against the Christians, and yet the strength of Martyrs ouercome them all. But after the thing began to be fulfilled which is written. All the kinges of the earth shall worship him, All natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shall serue him: what is he that is in his right wits, that will say vnto kinges, Take you no care in your kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth or assaulteth the Church of your Lord: it makes no matter to you who be chast &amp; who be vnchast in your Realme.<note place="margin">How &amp; in what sence Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a man free choyse or will, read in hys booke of chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; grace, chap. 1.

But bycause they that be
<pb facs="tcp:7244:63"/>
ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly allured be the better, it foloweth not that those which are otherwise should be neglected. For it hath done many men good, (which thing is euident by experience) to be first compelled by feare or smart, that they might afterward be taught, or accomplish the thing in worke which they had learned already by word. Thus much haue I hetherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed out of the bookes of Austen, which I suppose do sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie such as are not giuen to contention, in this case.</p>

Marke and heare all that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund thée, that thou mayest fare well and the children after thée, when thou doest the thing that is good and acceptable in the sight of thy God. Therfore looke what I commaund thée, that onely do thou vnto the Lord, &amp; neither put thou any thing to it nor take thou any thing away. Nay truly, it is the welspring and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of all mischief, errour, heresie, schisme, dissention, and troubles, if it were frée for euery man to folow the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his owne head and the imaginations and deuises of his owne hart. Which thing is proued by the stories of all ages, and by the experience of our time also. And ye shall read often in the Prophetes, depart ye or turne ye from your owne wayes: and, you haue chosen in your wayes, the thinges that displease me.

From the which God willeth the Magistrate to turne away his seruaunts, and to bring them backe agayne into the way of the Lord. Dauid the king and Prophet pleased the high God singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this respect, (though in many things he defiled him selfe shamefully) that he neither presented the good intent of his hart or the likinges of his owne will for seruices vnto God, nor stifly vrged them vpon other men to be kept: but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7244:63"/>
persisted simply and vncorruptly in the way of the Lord, according as he himselfe sheweth in the 119. Psalme. But king Saul put him selfe quite out of Gods fauour,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Samuel.</hi> 15.</note> bycause he ouerslipped the commaundement of God, and folowed the thing which the good intent of his owne hart counselled him vnto. For he had reserued for sacrifice, the thyng which God had commaunded him, not to reserue for sacrifice, but vtterly to destroy and put away. Wherupon the Prophet Samuell sayd vnto Saul: Doth the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice, so much as in obeying his voyce? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to obey is better then to do sacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fat of Rammes. For disobedience is as the sinne of Soothsaying or witchcraft, and stubbornesse is as the wickednesse of Idolatrie. And for asmuch as thou hast despised or reiected the word of the Lord, he hath reiected thée also that thou shalt not be kyng. They that be wise haue in these short wordes what to thinke of the thynges that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chuse to folow at their owne pleasure in cases of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: namely that they be neuer a whit better then very witchcraft and Idolatry, which of all wickednesses are most heynous afore God.

For in thys case, al vniustice and cruelty, is to be eschewed: like as also it is a thing most of al to be abhorred, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those which are religious indéed, &amp; of a sound opinion, yea and enemies of al idolatry, superstition, and heresies, should be punished vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of false religion.

Out of which I haue taken out these thinges, &amp; put them in here.</p>
               <p>But all these thinges are done to this purpose,<note place="margin">Here is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the answer to the articles of accusation.</note> because that the Bull hath alleaged it against the Quéenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as an article of accusation not of the meanest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: that she hath layd penalties and punishments vpon such as were disobedient, and executeth the same vpon those that haue perseuered in obedience of the Romish sea, as though in so doing she outraged wrongfully and cruelly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst innocentes, and such as had deserued no such thing, and so sinned haynously. The Bull procéedeth yet further in lying and sayth, that the catholike byshops haue ended their dayes miserably by pyning away for sorow in prison. How fond a report this is, the very thing it selfe witnesseth which is commonly knowne to all the people of the whole Realme. Nay rather (as I haue learned by men of very good credit) the popish byshops are handled curteously in England, and far otherwise then they haue deserued. For some of them soiorne at theyr libertie in the houses eyther
<pb facs="tcp:7244:66"/>
of the Archbishop or of some of the byshops, and now &amp; then sit at their owne tables, where they fare daintely without penny cost. Other some dwel as much at liberty as may be, eyther in theyr owne houses, or in theyr frendes houses: &amp; a very few (that is to wite, such as are vtter enemies of the Gospell, and of all godlines, troublesome persons, and men that can away with no quietnesse) are in déede put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, least they might sette all thinges in a broyle: where they walke at libertie enough, and are not dead and py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away for sorow, but aliue and lustie, and passe away, theyr time merely. These being alate the champions and hastelers of the popish crueltie, did oftentimes vppon very light suspitions catch vp godly men that professed Christes Gospell, and tormenting them a long time like butchers, with lothsumnes of prison, darknes, fetters, famin and rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, at the last put them to most cruell death. The bishop of Rome (a Gods name) complayneth that these men are misintreated, because they be kept in prison: and therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he condemneth that most mercifull Quéene, of cruelty. By these thinges that haue bene hetherto declared, it may euidently appeare to all men, that the Quéene hath not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at all in so doing, but hath in all these thinges execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hir office to hir singular prayse. Therfore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bull he concludeth hys accusation with these wordes: That all the sayd thinges are so notorious as there can be no excuse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or vnsaying in the matter: he bewrayeth hys shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse saucinesse ioyned with as shamefull foolishnes. For the Quéene vnsayeth nothing, she excuseth nothing, she séeketh no starting hole at all, she denyeth not that she hath done as she hath, but fréely confesseth it, and she is neyther asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor affrayd: for the knoweth, sayth, and auoucheth, that the thinges which she hath done, she hath done lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, iustly, and according to hir office: the which of all defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is most effectuall, and with the strong blast of it, bloweth away this most vaine Bull. And as for the things which she hath not done, or which she hath done otherwise
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7244:66"/>
than the Bull quarelleth: they defend themselues by theyr owne soundnes without a maintayner.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I hetherto in all this discourse of mine,<note place="margin">The generall conclusion.</note> cut a sunder the sinewes of the foresayd definitiue sentence of the Bul that was published by pope Pius the fift ageinst the most gracious Quéene of England: for first we shewed that the popes fulnesse of power aforesayd, by vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath vttered his sentence, is but forged and counterfet and therfore that the sentence also being pronounced by au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie that is forged, &amp; no authoritie at all, is most vaine. Secondly, aunswering somewhat largely to euery article of the accusation layd in by the Bull, against the Quéene: for which he pronounceth sentence agaynst hir, and wiping away the coulerablenesse of the slaunders. I haue shewed that all and eueryone of those articles are most false, &amp; that the Quéene hath not offended at all in any of the thinges, whereof she is accused: but rather hath in all of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scharged hir dutie to hir singular prayse. Upon al the which premises concluding also the whole latter part of this our discourse, I say and auouch it to appeare more clearely than the Moone light, that the sayde difinitiue sentence, which Pius the fifth, hath geuen against the Quéene of England, is most partial and vniust. For iust iudges pronounce their sentences according to law and equitie. But no law, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie willeth to condemne a partie that is vnconuicted, yea and vtterly giltles in the offence that he is charged with. For by Gods owne iudgement, he is an vniust, a partiall, and a wicked Iudge, whosoeuer he is that condemneth a person which is vnconuicted, yea and cleare to, and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth or acquiteth a person that is conuicted and found giltie in déed. Truely by law Iudges heare the enditementes of the accusers, and likewise on the other side the aunswers of them that be accused: and yet he that is accused, runneth not in any danger by law, so long as the articles of inditeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be not lawfully prooued: but rather if he cleare himselfe of the articles of the enditement by lawfull and euident aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:67"/>
he is discharged of all domages, and acquit of al fault. Now forasmuch as it is certainly apparant by the thinges aforediscoursed, that all the accusations wherwith the pope hath hetherto charged the Quéene of England, and which he hath alleaged by hys Bull, are disproued by iust, open, &amp; euident reasons or aunswers, and therefore that her royall Maiestie is not conuicted of any of the faultes that be layd against hir: It is also certaine and sure therewithall, that the popes definitiue sentence, against that giltles Quéene, vnable to be conuicted of any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crimes layd to hir charge is both most partiall and most vniust: and that the Pope, which taketh vppon him as a Iudge in thys cace, is a most wicked and abhominable iudge. And yet I wil not say that euen he the pope, hath contrary to all right &amp; reason made himself both accuser &amp; iudge in thys case, and hath bables out what so euer came at hys tounges ende, and what so euer he listed, but proueth not, ne confirmeth not any whit of hys case.</p>

First the pope declareth and denounceth the Quéene of England to be an hereticke, and a bolsterer of heretikes, &amp; therfore that she is stricken with his curse, and cut of from the vnitie of Christes body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:7244:67"/>But it hath bene shewed in many woords already, that the Quéene is a catholike and Christian princesse, and not giltie of any heresie or crime. Wherupon it followeth, that the pope by his condemning of so giltles and rightbeleuing a Prince, bewrayeth and vttereth himself what he is, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen one of those of whome Peter hath sayd,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2.</note> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise higher powers: presumptuous are they and stubbern, and feare not to speak euill of them that be in authority &amp;c. A few yeares past, the reuerend Bishops of England dyd setfoorth a godly and learned Apologie: in the third chapter whereof chiefly they shew howe the Realme of Englande hath no aliance at all with heretickes, or heresies. In the same they plainly and stedfastly professe their fayth, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declare themselues to be of a sound and christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, eloquently and truely washing away all the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and slaunders of the papistes. It is more manifest, then that it néedeth to be reported with many words, what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doctors,<note place="margin">Who is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke.</note> diuines, &amp; ministers of the Church of Christes time haue thought to be heresie, and whome they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be heretickes. As for the law of Lucius the thirde, concerning the suppressing of heresie (which is registred by Gregory the ninth, in the thirde booke of decretalles, &amp; the seuenth title concerning heretickes) wherby the popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, and shape all their iudgementes and condemnations. Wise men and godly men haue alwayes déemed it tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, contrary to the iudgements of holy and religious an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiquitie: and therfore we thincke it not woorth the naming, and we estéeme all the decrées that be formed and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced according to the same, to be tyrannicall. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I can not stay my selfe, but I must néedes at thys present rehearse the opinion of the auncient writer Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian concerning this matter. In his booke of the veyling of Virgins, Heresies (sayth he) are ouercome, not so much by newnesse, as by truth. What so euer fauoureth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse than of truth, the same is heresie, yea though it be eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> auncient custome. And againe in Prescriptions of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.
<pb facs="tcp:7244:68"/>
Heresies (sayth the same author) are termed of the Gréeke woord, as in respect of the choyce which a man vseth eyther in the mayntayning, or in the receyuing of them. And therefore he sayth that an heretike is condemned in himselfe, because he hath chozen the thing wherein he is condemned. But it is not lawfull for vs to do any thing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon oure owne head: nor to choose the thing that an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man hath brought in of hys owne head. We haue the Lordes Apostles for our warrant, who chose not any thing of theyr owne head to bring in, but faythfully deliuered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to all nations the discipline that they had receyued of Christ. And therfore if euen an Angell from heauen should preach any otherwise vnto vs, we would hold him acursed. Thus far Tertullian. Wherfore séeing that the Quéene hath chozen nothing of hir owne head, to deliuer to hir sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, but onely hath betaken to them, propheticall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall truth of the scriptures to be followed: hir maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie is vtterly discharged of the crime of heresy. And séeing that the romish opinions, and the popish rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies differing from our opinions and ceremonies, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but opinions inuented by mens owne braynes, &amp; selfchozen ceremonies. Let the Romanistes consider, to whether of vs, the crime of heresy may iustlyest be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to whome it sticketh fastest. Besides this, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall lawes commaunde all that be vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, to follow that religion which S. Peter deliuered to the Romanes. And it addeth: We pronounce, that such as folow this law, embrace the name of catholike Christians: and that the rest are to be taken for heretiks, iudging them to be mad, and out of their wits. But the Quéene wil haue nothing to flourish in hir realme, but the Apostolike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: ergo she is a catholike, and not an heretike: neither fauoureth she heretikes, nor can abide to haue heresies taught in hir realme, nor cherisheth such as be stayned w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the spotte of heresy: but rather euen for the same cause she hath banished the romish traditions and popish ceremonies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7244:68"/>
out of her whole Realme, least she might be sayd to beare with any thing against the Apostolike doctrine and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And therfore the thunderclap of that Tarpeian or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Iupiters curse,<note place="margin">The curse of the Tarpeian Iupiter is not to be feared.</note> wherewith he will haue the Quéene to séeme to be striken through, is but a blockish thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbolt, and no more to be feared, then the thunderclappes, smokes, and mistes of Cacus were to be feared of Hercules, as hath bene sayd already afore. The blind ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to whom Christ had giuen eye sight was in old tyme cast out of the Synagoge of the Pharisies. But that excommunication was so farre from hurting him, that from thence forth he was receiued into Christes houshold by the Lord Christ himselfe, who in his Gospell prophesying of the thinges that are now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished by the Pope,<note place="margin">

Yea and the tyme commeth that who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer killeth you, he shall thinke he doth God seruice. And these thinges shall they do vnto you, bycause they haue not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father nor yet me. But I haue told these things vnto you, to the intent that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time is come, ye may remember what I haue sayd vnto you.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it hurteth not the Queenes Maiestie a whit,<note place="margin">The Queene is not cut of from the vnitie of Christes body.</note> that she is sayd to be cut of, truly not from the vnitie of Christes body, but from the felowshyp of the Popish corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For were she not cut of from this, verely she could not be reckened among the true and liuely members of Christes body: neither could she haue God to be her father, if she could finde in her hart to be an obedient daughter to the Syr that sitteth vppon mount Tarpey, deuouring his owne sonnes and daughters like Saturne. For the Lord willeth hys children to get them out of Babylon if they minde to escape the plagues of God, and to atteine true sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And we be not kept in the vnitie of Christes body, (which is the Church of the liuing God) by obeying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing the Romane Church and the Bishop therof: but by true faith in Christ according to the Gospell of God.

               <head>¶That the Pope of Rome doth falsly and tyrannously giue sentence that the Queene of England is depriued of her kingdome and of all right of her crowne.</head>
               <p>AFterward the Pope in his sayd definitiue sentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth peremptorily that the Quéene of England is depriued of her crowne and of all right of her crowne, and of all other authoritie, dominion, dignitie, and priuilege whatsoeuer.

Heretofore when I discoursed vpon Ieremies wordes <hi>I haue set thee ouer kynges and kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp;c.</hi> I haue shewed openly and sufficiently inough, (so as there néedeth no more at this tyme) that the Pope is not set ouer kynges and kyngdomes by God, but rather v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpeth superioritie and power ouer kynges and nations, contrarie both to the open example and commaundement of the Lord. Therfore as now I wil adde no more but this, that the Pope doth falsly or rather through mere tyranny without any right or regard of shame chalenge to him selfe this power, which the Lord neuer deliuered to any man.

deposed him agayne for his disobedience and rebellion, aduauncing Dauid to his roome,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.</note> a man accordyng to Gods owne hart. Agayne, vnder Salomon Dauides sonne, the kyngdome was rent a sunder,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kynges.</hi> 11</note> and God by the message of his Prophet Ahia gaue ten partes of the kyngdome to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam: and those ten partes of the kyngdome were not taken away from Salomon and his posteritie for any other cause, then for that Salomon him selfe had withdrawen his hart from God, and allowed his outlandish wiues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to set vp and exercise their Idolatrie. But the same Ieroboam is deposed agayne,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kynges.</hi> 14</note> and none other cause of hys deposing (by the report of the same Ahia the Prophet) then for that he hearkened not to the word of the Lord, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mans policie vpon a good intent of his owne, made him straunge Gods, and set vp the same for the children of Israel to worship, and cleaued not vncorruptly to the word of the Lord.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kynges.</hi> 15 16.</note> Other kinges of Israel also were deposed from from their kingdome by God, as Baasa, Ela, Achab, &amp; such other like, and for none other cause, then that they had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to folow the Idolatrie of Ieroboam, then the word of the Lord.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kinges.</hi> 9.10.</note> Furthermore, when Iehu had destroyed Iezabell king Achabs wife and all his posteritie, and therewithall made cleane riddance of all the Priestes of Baal, yea &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe the Temple of Baal and made a draught of it: the Lord said vnto him, for asmuch as thou hast earnestly executed the thing that is right in mine eyes, and done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the house of Achab according to all that was in my hart: thy sonnes shall sit vppon the seate of Israell to the fourth generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I could rehearse many other thinges of this sort, no lesse notable then these, but that I séeke to be brief as far as the matter giueth leaue.</p>
               <p>And I haue rehearsed these thinges to the end that all men may manifestly perceiue,<note place="margin">God vsed the seruice of hys Prophetes in puttyng kyngs downe.</note> how it is God himselfe and not the pope, that createth kinges and displaceth them, yea and which remoueth, shaketh, ouerthroweth, repaireth, and stablisheth all kingdomes vniuersally and seuerally. Now although he haue disposed it by his messengers the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes,
<pb facs="tcp:7244:70"/>
as by Samuell, Ahias, Eliseus, and others: yet is not the Pope called to these matters, as those men were, neither hath he receiued any commission from God in this case, so much as by one little word: but rather is commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to attempt no such thing. Besides this, God deposed kinges as it were extraordinarily by the Prophetes &amp; not by the high Priestes (which were ordeined by God to be in Israell with the kinges) least the kingdome and the Priest hode might be set at oddes betwene them selues. Therfore although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope were the souerein Bishop, yet should not the disposing and ordering of kinges belong to his charge. Moreouer if a man consider wherefore God deposed those kinges by the meane of his Prophetes: the Quéene of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath wherwith to comfort and confirme her, and the Pope hath that which graffeth him into the nomber of false prophetes, discorageth him, and vtterly ouerthroweth him. For Ahias said out of the mouth of the Lord vnto Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam: if thou wilt hearken to my commaundementes and walke in my wayes, as my seruaunt Dauid did, I will be with thée and I will build thée a sure house, and so forth as foloweth, in the third booke of kinges and the xj. chapter. And I haue already rehearsed out of Gods word what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Iehu reaped at Gods hand for taking away of Idols, Idolatrie, and Idolaters. Seyng then that the Quéene of England hath made reformation in her Realme according to Gods word, and taken away the Idols and Idolatrie of Baal, yea and Baals chappels and temples, and his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleynes also together with all Popish abhominations: she hath not lost her kingdome, but rather knit it more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto her, and is sure of Gods protection and fauour, and by Gods grace shall alwayes be sure of it, if she continew in the faith. Therfore there is no cause why her most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Maiestie should be troubled any whit at the Popes most peruerse sentence of deposition. For God in his word hath giuen a contrarie sentence to the Popes, so as the pope is most manifestly reputed among the false Prophetes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the times of Ioachim, Iechonias, &amp; Zedechias kinges
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7244:70"/>
of Iuda, there were false Prophetes and fauorers of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which warranted good lucke to these Idolatrous kings, and cursed the king of Babylon (whom God had stalled in the kingdome, and whom he would haue to reigne, and who afterward in the time of Daniell was turned from Idols to the true God,) and drew away the miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from his obedience. But they were greuously rebuked and disproued by Gods holy and true Prophetes Ieremie and Ezechiell, who prophesied that all maner of miseries should be powred out vppon the Idolaters: according as the falling out of thinges proued in the end by Gods large powring out of a sea of miseries vppon them. The same God also a thréescore and ten yeares after, ouerthrew the kingdome of Babylon, chiefly for Idolatries sake, as it is read in the fifth chapter of Daniell: and conueyed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to Cyrus king of Persia, who proclaymed the true God of Israell, and let Gods people go frée out of captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and commaunded Gods temple and holie Ceremonies to be set vp agayne. Therefore after so great light of Gods word, and the goodly consent of the holie histories, there is no cause why any Princes or sacred Magistrates should be afrayd of the Balaamish popes cursinges, depriuations, and manaces, brandished and denounced for putting away Idolles and for treading vnder foote that new Baalishnesse the Poperie. For God likes well of all such as reuerence Gods word, reforming them selues purely according to Gods word, and framing all thinges in Rellgion by the same. But it is most manifest that Gods word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth and reiecteth all Idolatrie, and all seruing of God that is counterfet and deuised by mans good intent, inuented and receiued at the good pleasure and appointement of men, without Gods woorde or agaynst it.</p>

But we say further, that the othe which the nobilitie and commons haue made to the Quéene of England, is not to be accounted among euill promises, and vnaduised vowes or othes: but among such promises and othes as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and confirmed with swearing, by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and allowance of God.

For we know we must liue according to lawes, and not according to custome nor after the example of particular déedes. But the law commaundeth that we should not lye, or deceiue any man by couin or craft, and much lesse then may wee defile our selues with periurie. The thinges are knowen well inough which Austen hath discoursed to <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sentius</hi> against lying. We may adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that king Iehu bound not himselfe by any solemne othe to the Priestes of Baal: but onely allured them by putting them in hope that he would offer a right great and sumptous sacrifice: &amp; that the Priestes being blinded with their owne naughtinesse and their ouereager desire of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, came flocking by heapes, &amp; therfore suffered iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in Gods behalfe, for their owne sturdy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and their vnappeasable hatred towardes the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and true Ministers of God.

therby, that the true seruauntes and worshippers of God, must not be punished or put to death with the offenders &amp; Idolaters that be hated of God. Which thing doth strongly assault and battre the purpose and indeuer of the Romane Bishop, whose gréedy gaping is for nothing els but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the true seruauntes and worshippers of God. His desire is to aduaunce and mainteine Idolaters, and to oppresse and destroy the true seruauntes and worshippers of God.

About y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare of our Lord 630. or as other reckon 681. vnder Sisenand king of Spaine, at the citie of Toledo in Spayne, there was hild a competent Synode, wherin this case of performing othes sworne vnto Princes is diligently entreated of. The sayd Synod is commonly called the fourth counsell of Toledo. Among other thinges they make a decrée in these wordes: <hi>Can.</hi> 74. The report goeth that many nations are so false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harted, that they neglect to perfourme the promise, which they haue made by othe vnto theyr owne princes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to sweare with their mouthes, when they wickedlye purpose to forsweare themselues in theyr hartes. For they sweare to theyr kinges, and impeach the faithfulnes which they haue promised, and they are not affrayd of that booke of Gods iudgement whereby cursednes is brought vppon such as swear by the name of God lyingly. What hope the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall such people haue against theyr enemies, when they be in danger?

And wheras Dauid sayth, who can lay his hand vppon the Lordes annoynted and be giltlesse: they are not affrayd to fall into periury, nor yet to destroy theyr owne kinges. For promise is made to the enemies, and not broken. Now if faythfulnes take place in war, how much more is it to be obserued in all other thinges? For it is hye treason to God,

for disobeying the Popes Decrées.

And these things are to be read word for word written by the Apostle Paule in the xiij. to the Romanes.</p>
               <p>For subiectes ye and all good men must both thinke and speake reuerently and honorablie of their Princes or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,<note place="margin">Princes and Magistrates must be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> as whom God in his word vouchsaueth to call by the name of Gods, as by whom God himselfe gouerneth, iudgeth, defendeth, bridleth, and preserueth his people. In consideration wherof, in the booke of Iudges, iudges be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Sauyours.</hi> Which thing al subiectes ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with a certeine reuerence, admiration, and giuing of thankes. For we be commaunded to make earnest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for our Princes in our prayers vnto God: we be commaunded to loue our Magistrate vnfeynedly, and in a comly, decent, and diligent wise to honor them with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours accustomed to eche countrey. So haue all the holie Priestes, Prophetes, and faithfull seruauntes of God done to their king: as it is to be séene in many places of the holy Scripture. Besides this, it is an expresse commaundement in Gods law,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.</note> Thou shalt not speake euill of the Gods, nor curse the Prince of thy people.<note place="margin">Princes are to be feared.</note> Moreouer the Prince is also to be feared of his subiectes, that they practise not any thing against him, and much lesse make not insurrection against him as enemies, or moue sedition, or otherwise commit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious actes and worthie to be punished. For if thou do the thing that is euill (sayth Paule,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note>) then feare: for he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the sword in vayne. For he is Gods Minister to punish him that doth euill. And truly good men feare their Princes, not as executioners, but as fathers. For agayne the Apostle sayth: Princes are not a terror to them that do well, but to them that do ill. And wilt thou not sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in feare
<pb facs="tcp:7244:77"/>
of authority? then do the thing that is good, and so shalt thou receiue prayse of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">All dewties be to be payde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Princes.</note>Moreouer, subiectes must pay their Princes all maner of tributes, customes, and all other dewties. For againe the Apostle saith: who goeth a warfare at his owne charges? But Princes serue the common weale: therfore it is good right that they should be mainteined of the common char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Surely Paule saith expresly, euen therfore do ye pay tribute: for they be Gods Ministers seruing for the same purpose. Therfore render vnto euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his dew, tribute to whom tribute is due: Custome to whom custome is due: awe to whom awe is due: honour to whom honour is due. The same Apostle willeth subiectes also to obey their Princes, that is to wit, their lawes and ordinaunces, not onely that they may by their due obedience escape the punishments which Princes execute vpon the disobedient: but bycause it is Gods will we should do so, and we must yeld obedience to his commaundement, except we had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to fall into the hand of Gods vengeance, although prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces punish vs not. And this is it that the Prophet ment by saying, ye must obey, not onely for feare, but also for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science Also: they that resist the Magistrate procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues damnation. And truly this obedience stretcheth so farre, that if the Prince néede thy seruice in the warres, for the defence of his Realme against inuasions: thou owest euen thy body to thy Prince, yea and thy life, and therefore much more thy goodes. These are the thinges, these (I say) are the thinges that all subiectes owe to their souereines by the allowance and commaundement of God: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Englishmen also owe the same thinges to their Quéene. True it is in déede that S. Peter sayd, we must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God rather then men howbeit, that is in such things as are commaunded expresly against God and his word. But the politike or ciuill gouernement is stablished, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by Gods word. And most of all it is stablished if the Princes be godly. For the Princes that gouerne their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quietly, and enforce not their subiectes to any wicked
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7244:77"/>
thinges, but honour Gods seruice &amp; spread it abroad more &amp; more:<note place="margin">Agaynst sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons.</note> are well liked of God and helped by him. And truly, this obedience of the subiectes which God hath inioyned them, kepeth them in their dewtie, and perswadeth them that they attempt not any thing against their Prince or Magistrate. As for those that rise against their Prince ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by priuie practise or open force, and breake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace: they are not onely disobedient, but also tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and hated of God. And yet it is the thing that the Pope in his Bull, not so much teacheth as by his manaces inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth to inforce the noblemen and commons of England vnto. The noble Realme of England, through Gods grace, cleaueth well together in lawes spirituall and temporall, and the subiectes therof enioy peace and publike profite, by the benefite of their most gracious Quéene. Therfore not to be willing hence forth to obey her, (as the Pope would haue it) what els is it, then to trouble the state of the whole Realme, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to stirre vp rebellion and sedition wickedly, and to procure themselues assured and greuous damnation at Gods hand.</p>

There be six bookes of epistles of one Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Uynes, wherein these thinges and other of the same sort are to be read, like as they be set out also by Cuspinian, in the life of Frederik the second, and by other storiwriters, and also by Iohn Auentine in the vii. booke of his stories. No man that séeketh to be brief (as I do at this present) can in few wordes comprise the miseries, slaughters, and most bloudy treasons, which the popes that bayted thys Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rik the second, (and specially thys Gregory the nynth) styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in Italy and throughout all Germanie, and other realmes, by those bulles of theyrs like to this Bull (for the deuyll is no chaingling) which is now put foorth by Pope Pius the fifth, against the Quéene of England. Truely the partaking of the Gwibelines,<note place="margin">The Gwelfes &amp; Gwibelines.</note> and Gwelfes, which sprang vp vnder Innocent the second were greatly renewed and spread abroad far and wide through all Italy by the practise of thys Gregory the nynth. Of which things Nauclerus in his story of pedegrées 42. fol. 826. writeth thus: This desire of partaking is at this time crept so far abroad, that there is no citie, nor people which remayneth vntouched of that most pestilent infection. For citie against citie, shyre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst shyre, one part of the people against another parte, haue gone together by the eares from thenceforth euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our dayes, without any other cause to moue them, saue onely these parttakinges.

that the papistes in those dayes had found out a spyke &amp; spawne new maner of preachyng the crosse. For it decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ, that is to say his death which is our life, accordyng as the Apostles, and their Apostles, &amp; the disciples of them preached in old time. But it published the open defiances and warres which the pope made, not at his charges but at other mens, accordyng as Daniels prophesie imported.<note place="margin">1095.</note> And truly this new maner of preachyng the crosse began at the first agaynst the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes vnder <hi>Vrbane</hi> the ij. in the tyme of the Councell of Clermount, when the holy warre was Decréed. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if the popes had denounced any as heretikes, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to be rooted out by force of armes for the same: They sent out their preachers as vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tcorrours to preach a Croysie to the people, that is to wit to blow vp a trumpet, persuading yea &amp; by the popes authoritie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding, that as many as were able to beare armour, should take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe of the crosse vpon them, &amp; serue the Bishop of Rome in his warres.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, (that is to say, if they slew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretikes without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; spoyled all that euer they had) there was promised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> full remission of sinnes, and euerlasting life. All this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is by the storywriters of late times called a Croysie. Also together with this souldierfare, the Bishop (like as he doth yet still at this day) was wont to inioyne his seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fasting, penaunce, &amp; praying, therby to craue good successe of their enterprises at Gods hand. In this straunge preaching of the Crosse, the begging Friers shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues stoutest seruauntes of the Popes: and of those also the Dominicane Friers (commonly called the Friers preachers) were sorer felowes then the rest, wherin they resembled their founder Dominike very wel.
