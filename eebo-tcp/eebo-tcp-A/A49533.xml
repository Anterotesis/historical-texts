            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>MY LORD,</opener>
            <p>I Should not have presum'd to have prefix'd so Great a Name to so mean a Work, had I not been sufficiently assur'd that <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> are not the least of those Excellent Qualities, which have acquir'd You the Love and Esteem of all that have the Honour to know You. 'Tis this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, joyn'd with the Experience of Your Lordship's former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which rais'd me to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of expressing my Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Your Honour, by dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:61334:3"/>
not so much the following Sheets, as My Self, the Compiler of them, to Your Lordship's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But I am afraid both the Piece and its Author, are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable in themselves, and so unworthy of Your Lordship's Eye &amp; Regard; that my Offering will seem to most Men, to have more of Presumption than Gratitude in it. And truly, <hi>MY LORD,</hi> I am so sensible of the Objection, That tho' I would willingly shroud my self under Your Lordship's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, yet I dare not in the least implore it for the Essay it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self; which hath so many faults, that some may be apt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the whole Undertaking as an unpardonable One: and I am unwilling that Your Lordship's Name shoud be used, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a Trifle, which it might
<pb facs="tcp:61334:3"/>
have been perhaps more for the Author's Credit to have conceal'd than publish'd.</p>
            <p>And now having said thus much in Excuse of my self, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I was never under a greater Temptation, to say something, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Modern</hi> Custome of Dedications, in Praise of Your LP; but that I fear I should need ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Apology, should I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to give a Character of Your Personal Worth and Excellency; or enlarge upon those Eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, with which You have oblig'd both Your Prince and Country, in the most hazardous Tryals of Your Loyalty &amp; Affection to each, when either the rights of the Crown, or the Liberties of the People call'd for your Assistance: Your Lordship being still one of the <hi>First,</hi> that was content to have these Your Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:61334:4"/>
cancell'd and forgotten; and who never suffer'd either the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses of the <hi>Court,</hi> or the Applause of the <hi>Populace,</hi> to tempt You from Your Duty, or Your Post: But having adorn'd the Great Office You under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and nobly defended the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> You profess'd, (by steering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the hot blasts of Zeal, &amp; the colder calms of Indifferency) You generously declin'd to make Your Services appear mercenary, or by raising Your Self to a higher Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, give the World occasion to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that You courted <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> for any other than their own <hi>Rewards:</hi> Which that Your Lordship may happily enjoy is the Constant and Affectionate Wish of</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY former <hi>Catalogue of Plays,</hi> in spite of the Malice and poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of some of the <hi>Poets</hi> and their Agents, to destroy its Reputation, (by printing a Spurious Title-page, and an uncorrected Preface) has notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found so kind a Reception from the Generality of Unbyass'd Judges; that I thought my self oblig'd by Gratitude, as well as Promise, to revise it: tho' it were only to purge it of those <hi>Errata's</hi> contracted in the former Edition. I am so far from relenting what I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpris'd, (as some have been pleas'd to report) that I am only sorry that my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not equal to the Zeal I have for the Memory of those Illustrious Authors, the Classicks, as well as those later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our own Nation, Mr <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher, Johnson, Cowley, &amp;c.</hi> that I might be capable of doing them better Service, in vindicating <hi>Their</hi> Fame, and in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our Modern <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> by detecting <hi>Part</hi> of their Thefts. I say <hi>Part,</hi> because I cannot be suppos'd to have trac'd them
<pb facs="tcp:61334:5"/>
in <hi>All</hi>: And having no <hi>Partners</hi> in my Discovery, it cannot be expected but that many things will escape my Observation. However, this may serve for a Hint to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; who being better vers'd in Books, may build upon the Foundation which is here laid. And who ever peruses the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sheets, will find the Observation of <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> to be very applicable to most of the Poets of this Age; <hi>Castrant alios, ut Libros suos per se graciles, alieno adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe suffarciant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how just soever my Design may seem to unprejudic'd <hi>Readers,</hi> I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be loudly exclaim'd against, is not openly assaulted by those <hi>Poets,</hi> who may think themselves injur'd in their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the following <hi>Remarks:</hi> But I am already prepar'd for the worst; having learnt from the Author of <hi>Absalom and Achitophel</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>In the Epistle.</hi>
               </note>, <q>That how honest soever the Design be, he who draws his Pen for <hi>One</hi> Party, must expect to make Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Other</hi>; and every Man is a Knave or an Ass to the contrary side.</q> I shall therefore leave the <hi>Poets</hi> to their own Management, whilst I address my self to my disingag'd <hi>Reader</hi>; whom I hope to find
<pb facs="tcp:61334:5"/>
Favourable, to One who aims only at his Diversion; and intends never to trouble the World again on this Subject.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd to make this <hi>Piece</hi> as useful as the Subject would bear, or my Abilities reach; and I am almost confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they who were satisfied with my former <hi>Catalogue,</hi> will be much more favourable to <hi>This Account of the Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poets:</hi> since they will find <hi>This</hi> so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from <hi>That,</hi> both in Form and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it may justly be stil'd <hi>A New Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the First place then I have given a succinct Account of the Time in which most of the Ancient <hi>Poets</hi> liv'd; the place of their Nativity, Quality, Death, Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a larger manner than either Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> or Mr. <hi>Winstanley;</hi> and have collected all the material Passages of their Lives, which I found scattered in Doctor <hi>Fuller, Lloydd, à Wood, &amp;c.</hi> into One Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, for the greater Ease of the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and Advantage to the Work. I have not indeed always cited my Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, to avoid loading the Page; tho' I here once for all make my publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to the Fore-mention'd, as well as other worthy Writers, to whom I
<pb facs="tcp:61334:6"/>
have been oblig'd in the compiling this <hi>Treatise.</hi> Neither have I omitted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my self to several Persons now living for Information, some of which promis'd me great matters; which occasioned my deferring the Publication for some time: but I found that the <hi>Memoires</hi> I expected from <hi>London,</hi> were like to arrive with Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s Manuscripts from <hi>Rome,</hi> which he was to make use of in his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Henry le Grand:</hi> and that should I have stay'd for the completion of these Promises, the <hi>Louvre</hi> would have sooner been finisht than my <hi>Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I have in this Edition, given the <hi>Reader</hi> a large Account of the Title-page of each Play which I have seen, as the <hi>Double</hi> Titles; the Place where acted, the Date when printed, and the Person to whom Dedicated; with other Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which might <hi>obiter</hi> occur or relate more immediately to each Play.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to those Plays founded on History, instead of One or Two, (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) I have cited most of the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that have treated on that Subject, that the <hi>Reader</hi> might compare the Play, with the Original Story. I have not mention'd so many Authors, out of hopes of being
<pb facs="tcp:61334:6"/>
counted Industrious, or to beget an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the World of my Reading: Tho' as an Ingenious Author observes<note place="bottom">
                  <hi>Fuller's Chr. Hist. p.</hi> 43.</note>, <q>This Humor possesseth many Men, that brag of many Books Coming under their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: as if not only with the <hi>Mice</hi> they had crept through the Crannies of all Libraries; but also with the <hi>Mothes,</hi> had got betwixt the Leaves of all Treatises therein.</q> I am so far from affecting <hi>Title-Learning,</hi> in which every <hi>Bookseller</hi> would perhaps excel me, that I am willing to acknowledge to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that I am owing to the Compendious Collections of Historians and Chronologers, for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, to find any Story or Action in the Original Author; and therefore shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it no lessening to my Reputation to be trac'd in <hi>Calvisius, Spondanus, Lloyd, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reri,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As to the <hi>Drammas,</hi> which are founded on Romances or Forreign Plays, I have much enlarg'd my <hi>Remarks;</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employ'd a great part (if not too much) of my Time in reading Plays and Novels, in several Languages; by which means I have discovered many more Thefts than those in the former Catalogue; and have
<pb facs="tcp:61334:7"/>
(for the <hi>Readers</hi> Ease, as well as my own Vindication) cited the particulars of each Plagiary, to obviate an Objection of a certain <hi>Poet,</hi> who professes he has not stollen half of what <hi>I then</hi> accused him of.</p>
            <p>What Reception this <hi>Piece</hi> may find in the World, I am not very sollicitous, nor greatly concern'd: since (as the Judicious Sr. <hi>Robert Howard</hi> has observ'd<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pref. to</hi> 4 <hi>Plays Fol.</hi>
               </note>) <q>Things of this Nature, tho' never so Excellent, or never to Mean, have seldome prov'd the Foundation of Men's <hi>New-built</hi> Fortunes, or the Ruine of their <hi>Old.</hi>
               </q> I am so far from valuing my self upon this Performance, that if there be any thing in it worth Commendation, the <hi>Poets</hi> are at liberty to father it upon whom they please, or claim it as their own, without my taking any offence at it: And if I can but be so happy as to obtain a Pardon from the more solid part of Mankind, for having mis-spent my Time in these Lighter Studies, I promise for the future, to imploy my self on Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of more Weight and Importance.</p>

                  <head>William ALEXANDER, Earl of <hi>Sterline.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OUR Alphabet begins with this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Nobleman, who was a <hi>Scot</hi> by Birth; and liv'd in the Time of King <hi>James</hi> the First of <hi>England,</hi> and the Sixth of <hi>Scotland.</hi> All that I am able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint my Readers with, concerning his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affairs, or Family, is only this short account; that he was much in Favour with his Sovereign, and Father to the present Earl of <hi>Sterline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Occasion of his being mention'd in our Catalogue, is, from <hi>four Monarchick Tragedies,</hi> (as he stiles them,) which are in Print under his Name, <hi>viz. The Alexandraean Tragedy, Croesus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Plays seem to be writ with great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61334:10"/>
Judgment, and (if I mistake not) the Author has propos'd the Ancients, for his Pattern; by bringing in the <hi>Chorus</hi> between the Acts. They are grave, and sententious, throughout, like the Tragedies of <hi>Seneca</hi>; and yet where the softer, and more tender Passions are touch't, they seem as moving, as the Plays so much in vogue with the Ladies of this Age. The greatest objection that I know against them, is the Choice the Author has made of his Verse, which is alternate, like the <hi>Quatrains</hi> of the French Poet <hi>Pibrach;</hi> or Sr. <hi>William Davenant</hi>'s Heroick Poem, call'd <hi>Gondibert.</hi> This measure of Verse has lately been found fault with by an Eminent Critick<note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi>'s Pref. to <hi>Kapin</hi>'s Reflections on <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Treatise of Poetry.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what Sr. <hi>William</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Preface to <hi>Gondibert.</hi>
                     </note> has urg'd in its Defence: I shall not pretend to decide the Controversy, but leave it to my Reader, to peruse both their Arguments at leisure. It may possibly be objected that his Stile is not pure, but as the Author has already pleaded his Country,<note n="c" place="bottom">Epistle to <hi>Darius</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Edin. Edingh.</hi> 1603.</note> so he ought to be excus'd by all English Criticks, having given the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our Tongue, as exceeding the <hi>Scotch Dialect,</hi> both in Elegance and Perfection.</p>
                  <p>His Tragedies, are all of them founded on History, and he has so strictly ty'd himself to it, that even his <hi>Episodes,</hi> (which usually, are the sole Invention of every Author) are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Truth likewise.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Alexandraean Tragedy</hi> is a proof of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61334:10"/>
for after the First <hi>Act,</hi> which is wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Ghost</hi> (possibly in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Thyestes</hi>) the rest of the Play is wholly circumscrib'd by History. The The Play is built upon the Differences about the Succession, that arose between <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains after his Decease. The Second <hi>Act</hi> begins with the Councel held by <hi>Perdiccas, Meleager,</hi> and the rest of the Commanders. The Author has chiefly followed <hi>Q. Curtius lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> and <hi>Justin lib.</hi> 13. But there are other Authors that have toucht upon this Story, as well Annalists as Historians; which for the Reader's satisfaction I shall set down. Such are, <hi>Diodorus Siculus lib.</hi> 18. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Author has since pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and corrected much of his Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and even the Play it self is alter'd, and 'tis now reprinted with the Rest of his Works.

                     <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> is founded on History, and the Reader may find many Authors that give an account of his Actions, particularly <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> each of which writ his Life See besides <hi>Appian de Bellis Civilibus, lib.</hi> 2 <hi>Florus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Salian.

                  <p>Besides these Plays, he writ several other Poems, of a different Species, <hi>viz. Doomsday</hi> or the great day of the Lord's Judgment; Poem divided into Twelve Books which the Author calls Hours. <hi>A Paraenaesis to Prince Henry,</hi> who dying before it was publish'd, he dedicated it to Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> afterwards King and Martyr. <hi>Jonathan,</hi> an Heroick Poem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but the first Book only extant.

                  <p>This being all the Account I am able to give of our Author and his Works, I must have recourse to an old Copy of Verses stiled <hi>The Censure of the Poets,</hi> which tho' mean in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, shew the Opinion the unknown Author had of our Poet: Part of which Copy take as follows;

His Genius lays wholly to Tragedy; and he has had the Fortune to please the fair Sex in the <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> and <hi>Anna Bullen.</hi> He has five Plays in print, of which in their Alphabetical Order.</p>

Various are the Authors that have toucht on this subject, as <hi>Homer, Virgil,

Ovid, &amp;c.</hi> but none more fully than <hi>Dares Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and <hi>Dictis Cretensis:</hi> though Learned Men suppose those pieces we have under their Names, to be spurious: yet <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> has turned <hi>Daxes</hi> into Latin Verse: and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman <hi>Lydgate</hi> into old <hi>English</hi> Meetre.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Tragedy seems to be written in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Shakspear</hi>'s old Play of <hi>Pericles</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre:</hi> for as <hi>Shakspear</hi> raises <hi>Gower,</hi> an old <hi>English</hi> Bard, for his Interlocutor or Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, in that Play; so this Author revives <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardine</hi> for the same design. This was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of the Poets of the last Age, as <hi>Shakspear, Heywood, &amp;c.</hi> at which time they frequently introduced <hi>dumb Shews,</hi> which took much with the Spectators of those times.</p>
                  <p>'Tis evident the Author followed <hi>Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> who has largly treated to this Pope, in his History of the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi>; see the first six Books.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61334:14"/>
Academy,</hi> printed octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1647. He dedicated it to the famous Traveller Mr. <hi>James Howel,</hi> in particular, and to the Ladies and Gentlewomen of <hi>England,</hi> in general. In his Romance, are included two Dramaticks, which Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi> has inserted in his Catalogue, tho' they are not entire Tracts of themselves, nor of any signal Eminence; but since they have been mention'd in former Catalogues, I shall not omit them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deorum Dona,</hi> a Masque presented before <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Clorinda,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> at their Regal Palace in <hi>Nicosia.</hi> Part of this piece is borrow'd from Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Poem to the King on his Navy.</p>

                     <hi>Gripus and Hegio,</hi> or <hi>The Passionate Lovers</hi>; a Pastoral, acted by the Lady <hi>Julio</hi>'s Servants, for the Entertainment of <hi>Flaminius.</hi> This Play consists but of three Acts, and is borrow'd very much from <hi>Waller</hi>'s Poems, and <hi>Webster'</hi>s Dutchess of <hi>Malsy</hi>; which is excusable only on the account of the Author's Youth, he being but 17 Years of age, when he compos'd that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which was the reason that it was so highly commended by twelve Copies of Verses writ by his Friends, and printed with his Book.</p>

This Play is much beyond either of the former, and has the repute of a good Play. It is commended by five Copies of Verses, written by the Author's <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Friends. On this very Subject, the

                  <p>The Author seems to have propos'd for his pattern the famous <hi>Catiline,</hi> writ by <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> and has in several places not only hit the model of his Scenes: but even imitated the Language tolerably, for a young Writer. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleases to compare the <hi>Ghost</hi> of <hi>Emir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamze-mirza,</hi> with that of <hi>Scilla,</hi> may easily see his Imitation, but that being too long to transcribe, I shall set down the first words of <hi>Catiline,</hi> in that admirable Play; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those of <hi>Abbas,</hi> and then submit my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to my Reader's judgment.</p>

                  <p>The Reason why we mention him in our Catalogue is, on account of a Play writ by him, called, <hi>The Excommunicated Prince:</hi> or, <hi>The false Relick:</hi> a Tragedy Acted by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness's Servants: being <hi>The Popish Plot, in a Play,</hi> printed in folio, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1679. Dedicated to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> I must confess, I was very desirous to read this Piece for the sake of the Title-page, and came to it with great expectations; but found them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together frustrated, and only a Story which I had formerly read in Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>Geography,</hi> described in it. But afterwards when his Life came out, I was satisfied with the Account the Publisher gave of it: which for the Readers Information, and the Justification of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, I shall quote word for word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">See his Life, <hi>pag.</hi> 110.</note> 
                     <q>In the next place, I desire leave to speak something of his <hi>Dramatick Poem,</hi> call'd <hi>The Excommunicated Prince,</hi> or, <hi>The False Relick.</hi> As to the worth of the Play, I do own my self so unskilful in Poetry, that I will not rashly pretend to give my opinion of it.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61334:17"/>
But that which I know, let me assert in its vindication, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was both began and finisht in the space of two Months, which every one must needs acknowledge was but a very short time, considering the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that then more earnestly imploy'd his thoughts, which must necessarily be a weighty clog to the ablest Muse. Whereas some of the chiefest Poets of this Age have thought it no disparagement to confess, that a correct Play to be perfected, will require at least twelve Months time. And I remember in some Prologue, I think in that to the <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> I have read this Distick to the same purpose.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>A Play, like Ground, must a Year Fallow lye,</l>
                     <l>E're it can ripen to good Comedy.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <q>This consider'd, (and it being the first Essay he ever finish'd of this Nature) what few mistakes are found in his Play, may be easily excus'd. But besides its real faults, the errors of the Press, and what it suffers thro' the prejudice and malice of the Author's Adversaries, I do not at all wonder if even the most impartial Reader too, should look severely on it, seeing he is promis'd in the Title-page, what he can never find in the Book. It would fain cozen him to believe that he shall meet with the Popish Plot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in that Play, though I have heard Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> often say he never intended any such thing. The History he designed, may, as I am inform'd, be read in several Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Authors; but in <hi>Heylin's Geography</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I met with it my self. So may any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61334:17"/>
that will peruse his History of <hi>Georgia.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> well knew it was against his Interest so for to ridicule the Plot, as to compose a Play of it; and he had more judgment in Poetry, than to imagine that such a new thing would please in Tragedy. And least any one should suspect that his design did in the least incline that way, he writ an Epistle to assure his Reader of the contrary. Which the Stationer, (supposing under that pretence the Play would vend much better) thought it his interest to stifle, and added these words to the Title-page (<hi>Being the Popish Plot in a Play</hi>) without the Author's consent or knowledge.</q>

                  <p>A Person lately deceased, but whose Memory will be long fresh amongst the Lovers of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Poetry, as having been sufficiently Eminent not only for her Theatrical Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, but several other Pieces both in Verse and Prose; which gain'd her an Esteem among the Wits, almost equal to that of the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Orinda,</hi> Madam <hi>Katharine Phillips</hi> (of whom we shall speak hereafter). Her Plays are Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in number, having therein exceeded any of the Poets of this Age, Sr. <hi>William Davenant,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> excepted. Most of her Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have had the good fortune to please: and tho' it must be confest that she has borrow'd very much, not only from her own Country Men, but likewise from the French Poets yet it may be said in her behalf, that she has
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61334:18"/>
often been forc'd to it through haft: and has borrow'd from others Stores, rather of Choice than for want of a fond of Wit of her own: it having been formerly her unhappiness to be necessitated to write for Bread, as she has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht to the world.<note n="e" place="bottom">Pref. to <hi>Sir Patient Fancy.</hi>

                     <hi>Abdelazer,</hi> or <hi>The Moor's Revenge</hi>; a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy Acted at his Royal Highness the Dukes Theatre, printed in quarto, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1671.

The Plot of <hi>Antonio,</hi> the curious Husband's trying his Wives Chastity by his Friend <hi>Alberto</hi>'s means, is founded on a Novel in the Romance of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> call'd <hi>The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Impertinent:</hi> See Part 4.

Play, and improv'd the Novel itself.</p>

                     <hi>Dutch Lover,</hi> a Comedy Acted at the Duke's Theatre, printed in quarto, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1673.

                  <p>
                     <hi>False Count,</hi> or <hi>A New Way to play an Old Game,</hi> a Comedy Acted at the Duke's Theatre, and printed in quarto, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1682.

                     <hi>Hyde,</hi> E. of <hi>Rochester.</hi> Tho' some Criticks decry'd this Play, yet whoever will consult the Author's Preface, will find the Objections fully answer'd: however I must observe that the Incident of <hi>Gayman</hi>'s enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady <hi>Fulbanck,</hi> and taking her for the Devil, is copied from Mr. <hi>Alexander Kickshaw</hi> and the Lady <hi>Aretina,</hi> in the <hi>Lady of Pleasure.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61334:19"/>
are the only Comedies, for the Theft of which, I condemn this ingenious Authoress; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so excellent in their Original, that 'tis pity they should have been alter'd: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing her Apology in the Postscript to the first part; I cannot acquit her of prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since <hi>Angelica</hi> is not <hi>the only stol'n Object,</hi> as she calls it: she having borrow'd largely throughout.

                     <hi>Sr. Patient Fancy,</hi> a Comedy Acted at the Duke's Theatre; printed in quarto, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1678. The Hint of <hi>Sr. Patient Fancy,</hi> is borrow'd from a French Play called <hi>Le Malade imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire:</hi> and the Characters of <hi>Sr. Credulous Easy,</hi> and his Groom <hi>Curry,</hi> are stol'n from <hi>Sr. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> the <hi>Cornish</hi> Knight, and his Man <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basco</hi> in <hi>Brome</hi>'s Play called <hi>The Damoseille.</hi>

The foundation of this Play, is a Comedy writ by <hi>George Wilkins,</hi> call'd <hi>The Miseries of inforc'd Marriage;</hi> from which not only the Plot, but a great part of the Language is stol'n.</p>

I refer the Reader to this Epistle for the Plays justification: only I cannot but observe, that the Prologue was written Ten years since, and publisht before Mr. <hi>Shadwell's True Widow:</hi> and if I mistake not the Epilogue is Old like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For the Story of <hi>Bacon</hi> I know no History that relates it, but his Catastrophe is founded on the known story of <hi>Cassius,</hi> who perished by the Hand of his freed-Man <hi>Dandorus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his Friend <hi>Brutus</hi> vanquished.</p>

                  <p>Besides these Plays this Ingenious Woman has publisht several other Works, both in Verse and Prose. As a Collection of Poems

Another Volume in octavo, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1688. amongst all which are many of her own Composures. Her several Versions from the <hi>French</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by those who think themselves Judges of Wit; amongst which the chiefest are, <hi>A Voyage to the Island of Love; Lycidas,</hi> or <hi>The Lover in Fashion;</hi> and <hi>The Lover's Watch.</hi> These Pieces in the Original may be found in the second and third Tomes of <hi>Le Receueil des Pieces Gallantes, en Prose &amp; en Vers, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Paris</hi> 1684. Those who will take the pains to compare them, will find the English rather Paraphrases, than just Translations: but which sufficiently shew the Fancy and excellent Abilities of our Authress.</p>
                  <p>She has written other Pieces in prose, which have had the fortune to please, as <hi>The Love Letters between a Nobleman and his Sister,</hi> in Three Volumes, octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1684. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Three Histories, printed in octavo, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1688. <hi>viz.

                  <p>What Opinion the Wits of the Age had of her, may appear from several Copies of Verses written before her Translation of Monsieur <hi>Bonnecorse's La Montre,</hi> or <hi>The Watch:</hi> amongst whom Mr. <hi>Charles Cotton,</hi> who was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Poet, gives her the following Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>

About this time <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the Tenth King of <hi>Castile,</hi> (the subject of this Tragedy) was chosen by other Electors. Tho'this King was accounted by some a Pious Prince, yet our Author represents his as a Bloody Tyrant, and contrary to other Historians brings him to an unfortunate End, he supposing him to be kill'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> Son to <hi>Lorenzo de Cipres</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary: in revenge of his Father, who was poyson'd by him: and to compleat his Revenge he makes him first deny his Saviour in hopes of Life, and then stabs him, glorying that he had at once destroyed both Body and Soul.

But there is One thing in this Play, far more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; that it is extended to Seven Acts: a thing which I never saw in any other, either in our own, or Foreign Languages, and which is directly contrary to that Rule of <hi>Horace</hi>

This Play was writ shortly after <hi>Decker's Westward Hoe,</hi> as you may see by the Prologue which is writ in Blank Verse.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> I know not why, has omitted half this Authors Plays, as you may see in his Account of the <hi>Modern Poets,</hi> p. 53.</p>
                  <p>Having given an Account of his Plays, I am now to speak of his other Works which were not in those days accounted less eminent: particularly his Version of all <hi>Homer</hi>'s Works; <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Illiads, Odysses,</hi> and what he calls <hi>The Crown of all his Works,</hi> his <hi>Batracomyomachia,</hi> or <hi>The Battle of Frogs and Mice,</hi> together with his Hymns and Epigrams. If it be urg'd by some that he has been since out-done by Mr. <hi>Ogleby</hi> in the Two former, it is chiefly to be ascrib'd to the ill choice of his measure of Verse, and the obsolete Expressions in use in his time, and besides Translation was then, as I may say, in its Infancy. However I think Mr. <hi>Ogleby</hi> himself has since been as far exceeded by the exact and curious Pen of Mr. <hi>Hobbs:</hi> and for for his <hi>Minor Poems,</hi> they have never been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by any other Pen that I know of. To these I must add his Translation of <hi>Hesiod;</hi> his finishing <hi>Musaeus</hi> his <hi>Erotopaenion,</hi> or <hi>The Loves of Hero and Leander,</hi> a Piece begun by

He was very much addicted to Books, and the study of Poetry; spending most of his time in the Muses company. Amongst his other Poetical Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he has written Three Plays, and a Masque which are in print; of which take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account.</p>

                     <hi>Masque</hi> presented at <hi>Bretbie</hi> in <hi>Darby-shire,</hi> on Twelfth-Night 1639. This Entertainment has hitherto been omitted in all former Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, as I suppose through an Over-sight, it being but short, and printed in the body of the Author's Poems,<note n="r" place="bottom">See <hi>pag.</hi> 118.</note> amongst others of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nature. It was presented, (as I find upon perusal of it) before the Right Honourable <hi>Phillip</hi> the first Earl of <hi>Chesterfield,</hi> and his Countess, Two of their Sons acting in it.

                     <hi>Obstinate Lady,</hi> a Comedy printed in octavo, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1658. This Play, with other Poems were left in the Custody of a Friend, at the Author's Removal from <hi>London,</hi> who dying, they were disperst into several Hands. One Mr. <hi>William Godbid,</hi> (a Bookseller as I suppose) got this Play into his Hands, and tho' he found it imperfect, the last Leaf being wanting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the Authors Conclusion and Epilogue: he procured some of his Acquaintance to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that defect, and so printed it. And tho' this Comedy were very much of it writ in Number (as the Author calls it) he put it forth as if the most part of it were Prose. In this Edition you have that defect much amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Authors own Conclusion, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue added. Sr. <hi>Aston's Obstinate Lady,</hi> seems to be Cousin-German to <hi>Massinger's Very Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> as they that will compare <hi>Don John, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi> and <hi>Almira,</hi> with <hi>Carionil</hi> and <hi>Lucora</hi> in this Play, may easily perceive.</p>

                     <hi>Ovid's Tragedy,</hi> printed in octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1669. This Play was printed since the rest of his Works, tho 'tis frequently bound with them. I know not why the Author gave this Play the Title of <hi>Ovid's Tragedy,</hi> except that he lays the Scene in <hi>Tomos,</hi> and brings him to fall down dead with grief at the News he received from <hi>Rome,</hi> in sight of the Audience: otherwise he has not much business on the Stage, and the Play ought rather to have taken the Name from <hi>Bassanes</hi> Jealousy, and the dismal effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the murther of his new Bride <hi>Clorina,</hi> and his Friend <hi>Pyrontus.</hi> But this is an Error

The passage of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s inviting the dead Carcass of <hi>Helvidius</hi> to Supper, is possibly borrow'd from the Italian Play called <hi>Il Atheisto Fulminato,</hi> to which Language our Author was no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and on which Foundation the Catastrophe of the <hi>Libertine</hi> is built.</p>

The Design of this Play, the Author borrow'd from One which he saw, or rather heard, twice Acted in <hi>Venice</hi> during his abode in that City; since he built this on that Foundation: So that as he pleads in his Proloque it is no Translation. This Play was reviv'd on our Stage since the King's Return, and a new Prologue writ by <hi>Duffet,</hi> printed in his Poems <hi>pag.</hi> 82. and has since that, been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> and acted at the Theatre in <hi>Dorset-Garden</hi> 1685.</p>

                     <q>That as it may be lamented, that he carried not on the Work so far as he design'd, so it might he wisht that he had liv'd to Revise what he did leave us: I think the Troubles of <hi>David</hi> is neither Title nor Matter proper for an Heroick Poem; seeing it is rather the <hi>Actions</hi> than his Sufferings, that make an Heroe: nor can it be defended by <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Odysseis,</hi> since <hi>Ulysses</hi>'s Sufferings conclude with one great and perfect Action.</q> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, this judicious Author allows, <q>That in the <hi>Davideis</hi> (Fragment and imperfect as it is) there shines something of a more fine, more free, more new, and more noble air, than
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61334:52"/>
appears in the <hi>Hierusalem of Tasso,</hi> which for all his care, is scarce perfectly purg'd from Pedantry.</q> And after all says, <q>That in the Lyrick way however <hi>Cowley</hi> far exceeds him, and all the rest of the Italians.</q> Tho' <hi>Jacobus Philippus Tomasinus, Laur. Crasso,</hi> and other great Men give <hi>Tasso</hi> an extraordinary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But to return to our Author, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faults Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> may have committed in the Oeconomy of his Poem, (as Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> reckons up others) if it be consider'd, <q>That he writ the greatest part of it, (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his Life observes) whilst he was a young Student in <hi>Trinity</hi> College in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and withal, reflect on the vastness: of the Argument, and his manner of Handling it, he may seem like one of the Miracles he there adorns, <hi>like a Boy attempting Goliah.</hi>
                     </q> The rest of his Verses are written on several Occasions, and for what remains unspoken of in his Second Volume, they are Verses which he made when he was a King's Scholar, and to which he gave the Title of <hi>Sylva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to his Pieces in English Prose, they are Discourses by way of Essays, upon grave and serious Subjects; where he gives the truest and best Character of himself, and his thoughts during his Retirement. These, with several others which he design'd to add; he intended had not Death prevented him, to have dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his old Patron the Earl of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> 
                     <q>As a Testimony of his entire Respects to him: and a kind of Apology for having left hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs in the strength of his Age, while
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61334:53"/>
he might still have been serviceable to his Country.</q> But not withstanding his Death, his intentions are made good by his worthy Friend the careful Overseer to his Writings, who has paid in this Legacy according to the will and intention of the deceased Testator.</p>
                  <p>His Latine Works contain the two former Books of his <hi>Davideis;</hi> a Latine Comedy call'd <hi>Naufragium Joculare,</hi> which was acted before the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the Members of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge, the second day of <hi>February</hi> 1638. and his <hi>Poemata Latina,</hi> printed in octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo 1668. consisting of Six Books of Plants, and One of Miscellanies; of whose several Character, you will find an account in his Life; where you may likewise find a description of his Temper, Conversation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would swell this Volume beyond its design'd Bulk, to relate. All that I shall acquaint you further with is, that this best of Poets, that ever our Nation produc'd, and a Man of so excellent a Temper, in the Opinion of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, that he was pleas'd to say of him upon the news of his death, that Mr. <hi>Cowley had not left a better Man behind him in</hi> England. This Excellent Man I say, Died after a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights Sickness, of a Stoppage in his Breast and Throat, accompanied with a violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluction. He was Buried at <hi>Westminster</hi> Abby, near Two of our most eminent English Bards, <hi>Chaucer,</hi> and <hi>Spencer;</hi> his Corps being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a numerous Train of Persons of the most eminent Rank, both for Birth and Virtue, The late Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his Noble Friend
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61334:53"/>
and Patron, has erected a Magnificent Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over his Ashes in testimony of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; whose Sculpture you may see at the beginning of his Second Volume. Tho' I take it for granted that every Lover of Poetry hath the Works of this Worthy Ornament of our Nation: (since in my weak judgment, what was said of <hi>d'Urffé</hi>'s <hi>Astraea,</hi> by the great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> may more truly be said of our Authors Works, That he was not fit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Academy, who had not been before well read in <hi>Astraea:</hi>) yet since his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph may prove an Embellishment to this Work, I shall transcribe it.</p>

                  <p>A Person now living, who has attempted all sorts of Dramatick Poetry, with different suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.

He has written Fifteen Plays, of which Alphabetically.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Andromache,</hi> a Tragedy acted at the Duke's Theatre, and printed in quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1675. This Play Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> claims no farther share in, than the turning it into Prose, it being translated from the French of Monsieur <hi>Racine,</hi> by a young Gentleman, who had a great esteem for all French Plays, and particularly for this; but whose Genius in Verse, it seems was not very fortunate. In a word, Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> has written as Epistle to clear himself of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal (as he terms it) of so poor a Translation. This Play tho well esteem'd in the Original, had not its expected success on our English Stage.</p>
                  <p>The French Author has followed <hi>Virgil,</hi> in

I know not what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> has follow'd, or whence he hath taken his Plot: but I suppose by his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Statesman,</hi> he means <hi>Bernard d' Armag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi> the seventh, <hi>Comte d' Armagnac,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of <hi>France</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth. My Reason for this Conjecture is, that he speaks of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth's Landing in <hi>France,</hi> which was in the time of that King.

He was (as I may say) the Father of Pastorals; being the first that transferr'd them from the Eclogue, to Dramatick Poetry: and his <hi>Aminta</hi> is esteem'd by Forreigners, a Master-piece of Pastoral Comedy: and has been translated into the French, Spanish, English, German and Dutch Tongues. This was the Pattern which the admired <hi>Guarini</hi> propos'd for his Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he writ <hi>Il Pastor fido;</hi> and our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has since endeavour'd to imitate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Translator, the Lord Embassador <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw.</hi> If it be objected by some that this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of <hi>Tasso,</hi> is far short of that of <hi>Guarini;</hi> we may however with justice affirm, that at least this Translation exceeds <hi>that</hi> printed in 1628, if we allow some consideration for his being clog'd with Rhime, which forces him more upon Paraphrase, and withal that it was his first attempt to Poetry. With this Play, are printed several Poems of different Subjects, amongst which are Love Verses, which seem as is they were writ in imitation of Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>Mistriss.</hi>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> William DAVENANT.</head>
                  <p>A Person sufficiently known to all Lovers of Poetry, and One whose Works will preserve his Memory to Posterity. He was Born in the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Parish of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> vulgarly call'd <hi>Carfax,</hi> near the End of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> in the year 1605. and was Christned on the Third of <hi>March</hi> following. He was the Mercurial Son of a Saturnine Father, Mr. <hi>John D' Avenant,</hi> a Vintner by Profession: who liv'd in the same House, which is now known by the Sign of the <hi>Crown.</hi> He was formerly of <hi>Lincoln</hi> College, and instructed in Logick and Physicks, by his Tutor Mr. <hi>Daniel Hough,</hi> Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of that Society; tho' his Genius rather inclin'd him to walk in the more flowry Fields of Poetry, in which he made a Prodigious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: advancing even without any Guide, but his own Wit, and Ingenuity, as far as the <hi>Herculean</hi> Pillars (if any such bounds are to be set) of Poetry. He was Poet <hi>Laureat</hi> to Two Kings, whose Memory will always be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to all good, loyal, and witty Men; I mean King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, the Martyr for, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the Restorer of the Protestant Religion, according to the Church
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61334:63"/>
of <hi>England.</hi> During this Honour, of which his Wit and Parts render'd him Worthy, he writ (as I suppose) his Dramatick Pieces, of which I shall give some Account.</p>
                  <p>To speak of them in general, I need only say, that most of them have appear'd on the Stage with good applause, and been receiv'd with like success in Print: the greatest part publisht in the Authors Life time in Quarto, and all since his Death collected into one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, with his other Works, printed in Folio <hi>Lond.</hi> 1673. and dedicated by his Widow to his Royal Highness, the late King <hi>James.</hi>

                     <hi>Albovine King of the Lombards his Tragedy,</hi> printed first in quarto, and dedicated to the Right Honourable the Duke of <hi>Somerset.</hi> This Play is commended by Eight Copies of Verses. For the Design, it is founded on History. You may read the Story in several Historians: See <hi>Paulus Diaconus de Gestis Langobardorum, lib.</hi>2. <hi>c.</hi> 28. <hi>Gregorius Epise.

The later Dispute is between a <hi>Parisian,</hi> and a <hi>Londoner,</hi> who declaim con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Preheminence of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> The Vocal and Instrumental Musick was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by Dr. <hi>Charles Coleman,</hi> Capt.<hi>Henry Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Laws,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Hudson.</hi>

For the Plot, I refer you to the abovemention'd Plays, in the Account of <hi>Shakespear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Love and Honour,</hi> a Tragi-Comedy which I have several times seen acted with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause; first at the Play-house in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> and since at the Theatre in <hi>Dorset-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> This was first printed in quarto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man's the Master,</hi> a Comedy which I think I have seen acted at the Duke's House; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am sure the Design, and part of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is borrow'd from <hi>Scarron</hi>'s <hi>Jodelet, ou Le Maistre valet;</hi> and (as I remember) part from <hi>L'Heritier ridicule,</hi> a Comedy of the same Authors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Platonick Lovers,</hi> a Tragi-Comedy, which was first printed in octavo with <hi>The Wits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Play-house to be Let.</hi> I know not under what Species to place this Play, it consisting of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pieces of different Kinds handsomely tackt together, several of which the Author writ in the Times of <hi>Oliver,</hi> and were acted separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by stealth; as the History of Sr. <hi>Francis Drake</hi> exprest by Instrumental, and Vocal Musick, and by Art of Perpective in Scenes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the Spaniards in <hi>Peru.</hi> These two Pieces were first printed in quarto. They make the third and fourth Acts of this Play. The second
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61334:65"/>
Act consists of a French Farce, translated from <hi>Molliere's Sganarelle, ou Le Cocu Imaginaire,</hi> and purposely by our Author put into a sort of <hi>Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> common to French-men newly come over. The fifth Act consists of <hi>Tragedie travestie,</hi> or the Actions of <hi>Caesar Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in Verse Burlesque. This Farce I have seen acted at the Theatre in <hi>Dorset-garden</hi> some years ago, at the end of that excellent Tragedy of <hi>Pompey,</hi> translated by the incomparable Pen of the much admired <hi>Orinda.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Siege of Rhodes,</hi> in two Parts. These Plays were likewise in the times of the Civil Wars, acted with <hi>Stilo Recitativo,</hi> and printed in quarto, but afterwards enlarged by the Author, and acted with applause at the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields.</hi> It is dedicated to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England.</hi> For the Plot, as far as it is founded on History, there are several Historians have writ of it in the Life of <hi>Solyman</hi> the second, who took this City in the year 1522.

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61334:66"/>Having done with his Plays, I am now to speak of his other Works, which consist of Poems, of several sorts, and on several Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, amongst which <hi>Gondibert</hi> an Epick Poem has made the greatest noise. This Poem was design'd by the Author to be an Imitation of an English Dramma; it being to be divided into Five Books, as the other is into Five Acts; The <hi>Canto</hi>'s to be the Parallel of the Scenes; with this difference, that this is deliver'd Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, the other Dialogue-wise. The Reader may find a long account of the Author's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and his Reasons in the Preface, which is directed to his Friend, the so well known Mr. <hi>Hobbs;</hi> who not only approves his Design, but in the Close of his Letter fixes an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Complement upon him: <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues you distribute <hi>in your Poem,</hi> amongst so many Noble Persons, represent (in the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the image but of One Man's Virtue to my fancy, which is your own.</q> Nor was Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> the only Person that commended this Poem: for the first and second Books were usher'd into the world, by the Pens of two of our best Poets: <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley;</hi> which One would have thought might have prov'd a sufficient Defence and Protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the snarling Criticks. Notwithstanding which, Four Eminent Wits of that Age, (two of which were Sr. <hi>John Denham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Donne,</hi>) publisht several Copies of Verses to Sr. <hi>William</hi>'s discredit, under this Title, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Verses written by several of the Authors Friends, to be reprinted with the second Edition
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61334:66"/>
of Gondibert,</hi> in octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1653. These Verses were answer'd (as Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> says<note n="n" place="bottom">

Oxon.</hi> 2. 168.</note>) by the Author himself, with as much, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Wit, and little or no concern for their Raillery, rather seeming to sport at, and pity their want of Sence. The Title of his Answer is, <hi>The Incomparable Poem</hi> Gondibert <hi>vindicated from the Wit-Combats of Four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squires; Clinias, Dametas, Sancho,</hi> and <hi>Jack Pudding,</hi> printed in octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1655. The Books being scarce, I shall for the Readers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, chuse one out of each of these, as a Sample of the rest: and amongst the former I shall pitch upon <hi>that</hi> Copy which reflects on the Commendations given by those great Men above-mention'd<note n="o" place="bottom">Pag. 5.</note>.</p>

chiefly on account of the Subject of it, which was the Witty <hi>Ben Johnson.</hi> He has had a Hand in Twelve Plays, Eight whereof were of his own Writing. Of all which I shall give an account, in their Alphabetical Order, as follows;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> a Comedy; of which I can give no other account than that I once barely saw it and is printed in quarto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honest Whore,</hi> the First Part; a Comedy, with the Humours of the <hi>Patient Man,</hi> and the <hi>longing Wife,</hi> acted by her Majesties Servants with great applause; printed in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Lond.</hi> 1635.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honest Whore,</hi> the Second Part; a Comedy, with the Humours of the <hi>Patient Man,</hi> the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Wife;</hi> the <hi>Honest Whore,</hi> perswaded by strong Arguments to turn Curtizan again: her brave refuting those Arguments; and lastly the Comical passage of an <hi>Italian Bridewel,</hi> where the Scene ends: printed in quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1630. This Play I believe was never acted, neither is it divided into Acts. The passage between the <hi>Patient Man,</hi> and his <hi>Impatient Wife's</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight for the Breeches, with the happy Event, is exprest by Sr. <hi>John Harrington</hi> in Verse. See his Epigrams at the end of <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> Book 1. Epigr. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If this be not a good Play, the Devil is in it,</hi> a Comedy acted with great applause, by the Queen's Majesties Servants, at the <hi>Red Bull;</hi> printed <hi>Lond.</hi> 16— and dedicated to his loving, and loved Friends and Fellows, the Queens Majesties Servants: by which he means the Actors. The beginning of his Play, seems to be writ in imitation of <hi>Matchiavel's</hi> Novel of

This Play was writ on the occasion of <hi>Ben Johnson<hi>'s </hi>Poetaster,</hi> where under the Title of <hi>Chrispinus, Ben</hi> lash'd our Author, which he endeavour'd to retaliate by Untrussing <hi>Ben</hi> under the Title of <hi>Horace Junior.</hi> This Play is far inferior to that of Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> as indeed his abilities in Poetry were no ways comparable to his: but this may be said in our Author's behalf, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61334:72"/>
'twas not only lawful, but excusable for him to defend himself: pray therefore hear part of his Defense in his own language, and then censure as you please. <q>

                  <head>Sir <hi>John DENHAM,</hi> Knight of the BATH.</head>
                  <p>A Poet of the first Form, whose Virtue and Memory will ever be as dear to all Lovers of Poetry, as his Person was to Majesty it self; I mean, King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and Second.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61334:73"/>He was the only Son of Sir <hi>John Denham</hi> of little <hi>Horesly</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> but Born at <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> His Father being at the time of his Nativity a Judge of that Kingdome, and Lord Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> But before the Foggy Air of that Climate, could influence, or any way adulterate his Mind, he was brought from thence his Father being prefer'd to be One of the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> At Sixteen years of Age, in the Year 1631. he was taken from School, and sent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he became a Member of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge. In this Society he spent some years; after he was remov'd again to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and follow'd the Study of the Civil Law.</p>
                  <p>The Civil War breaking out, this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Person exerted his Loyalty so far, that upon the voluntary offer of his Service, he was intrusted by the Queen, to deliver a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to his Majesty,<note n="z" place="bottom">See his Epistle to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</note> 
                     <q>Who at that time (<hi>viz.</hi> in 1647.) was in the hands of the Army. By <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>'s Assistance he got admittance to the King, who was then at <hi>Causham,</hi> and having deliver'd his Instructions, his Majesty was pleased to discourse very freely with him of the whole state of Affairs; and at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> he was pleas'd to command him to stay privately in <hi>London,</hi> to send to him, and to receive from him all his Letters from and to all his Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents at Home and Abroad; and he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther furnisht with Nine Cyphers in order to it: which Trust he performed with great
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61334:73"/>
safety to the Persons with whom he corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponded; but about Nine Months after, being discover'd by their knowledge of Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Hand, he happily escap'd beyond Sea both for himself, and those that held Correspondence with him. He got safe to His Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and during his Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the King in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> His Majesty was pleas'd sometimes to give him Arguments, to divert and put off the evil Hours of their Banishment, which (as he modestly expresses himself) now and then fell not short of His Majesty's Expectation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At His Majesty's departure from St. <hi>Germains</hi> to <hi>Jersey,</hi> he was pleas'd without any sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to confer upon Sir <hi>John,</hi> the office of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor General of all His Majesties Royal Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and at his Coronation, created him Knight of the <hi>Bath.</hi> This Honor he enjoy'd Eight years, and then surrender'd up his Honor with his Soul, on the Tenth day of <hi>March</hi> in the Year 1668. at his House near <hi>White-hall,</hi> and was Buried the Twenty-third Instant at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> amongst those Noble Poets, <hi>Chaucer, Spencer,</hi> and <hi>Cowley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Abridgment of his Life, I am next to give you a Summary of his Works. They consist of Poems, part of which are Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations; as <hi>The Destruction of Troy,</hi> an <hi>Essay on the Second Book of</hi> Virgil's AEneis, <hi>The Passion of</hi> Dido <hi>for</hi> AEneas, being the later part of the Fourth Book; <hi>Sarpedon's Speech to Glaucus,</hi> being part of the Twelfth Book of <hi>Homer;</hi> Two Pieces from the Italian of <hi>Mancini,</hi> upon
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61334:74"/>
the two first Cardinal Virtues, <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Justice, &amp;c.</hi> Others, are his own Productions, amongst which his <hi>Coopers Hill</hi> is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; <hi>A Poem, which</hi> (in the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>

                     </note>, who is without contradiction a very able Judge in Poetry) <hi>for the Majesty of the Stile, is, and ever will be, the exact Standard of good Writing.</hi> His Verses on Sir <hi>William Fanshaw</hi>'s Translation of <hi>Il Pastor Fido,</hi> and his Preface to the <hi>Destruction of Troy,</hi> shew sufficiently his Judgment, and his Translations themselves his Genius, for Peformances of that nature: and admitting it true, that few Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions deserve praise; yet <hi>His</hi> are to be excepted from the general Rule. His Elegy on Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> (part of which we have transcribed already in the Account of that great Man<note n="b" place="bottom">See Pag. 83.</note>, will make his Name famous to Posterity: and there wants nothing to eternise his Name, but a Pen equal to his, (if any such were to be found) to perform the like Friendly office to his <hi>Manes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He has writ but one Play, but by that Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men we may judge of his ability in Dramatick, as well as Epick Poesy; this Play being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commended. 'Tis call'd <hi>The Sophy,</hi> a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, acted at the Private-house in <hi>Black-friars</hi> with good applause: 'Twas first printed in quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1642. but since publisht with his Poems and Translations; all which are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.

                  <p>A Person whose Writings have made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to all sorts of Men, as being for a long time much read, and in great Vogue. It is no wonder that the Characters given of him, by such as are, or would be thought Wits, are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; since even those, who are generally allow'd to be such, are not yet agreed in their Verdicts. And as their Judgments are different, as to his Writings; so are their Censures no less repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Managery of his Life, some excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing what these condemn, and some exploding what those commend. So that we can scarce find them agreed in any One thing, save this, That he was Poet Laureat and Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to His late Majesty.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> is the most Voluminous Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Writer of our Age, he having already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant above Twenty Plays of his own writing, as the Title-page of each would perswade the World; tho' some people have been so bold as to call the Truth of this in question, and to

propogate in the world another Opinion.</p>
                  <p>His Genius seems to me to incline to Tragedy and Satyr, rather than Comedy: and methinks he writes much better in <hi>Heroicks,</hi> than in <hi>blank Verse.</hi> His very Enemies must grant that <hi>there</hi> his Numbers are sweet, and flowing; that he has with success practic'd the new way of Versifying introduc'd by his Predecessor Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> and follow'd since with success, by Sr. <hi>John Denham,</hi> and others. But for Comedy, he is for the most part beholding to French Romances and Plays, not only for his Plots, but even a great part of his Language: tho' at the same time, he has the confidence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate, if not flatly deny the Accusation, and equivocally to vindicate himself; as in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the <hi>Mock Astrologer:</hi> where he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Thomas Corneille's le Feint Astrologue</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus'd 'twas translated, and the Theft prov'd upon him; but never says One word of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi>'s <hi>Depit amoreux,</hi> from whence the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of <hi>Wild-blood</hi> and <hi>Jacinta,</hi> (which he owns are the chiefest parts of the Play) are stollen. I cannot pass by his Vanity<note n="e" place="bottom">Preface to <hi>Mock Astrologer.</hi>
                     </note> in saying, <q>That those who have called <hi>Virgil, Terence</hi> and <hi>Tasso,</hi> Plagiaries (tho' they much injur'd them) had yet a better Colour for their Accusation:</q> nor his Confidence in shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring himself under the protection of their great Names, by affirming, <q>That he is able to say the same for his Play, that he urges for their Poems; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Body of his Play is his own, and so are all the Ornaments of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61334:77"/>
Language, and Elocution in them.</q> I appeal only to those who are vers'd in the French Tongue, and will take the pains to compare this Comedy with the French Plays above-mention'd; if this be not somewhat more than Mental Reservation, or to use one of his own Expressions,<note n="f" place="bottom">

                  <p>Nor are his Characters less borrow'd in his Tragedies, and the serious parts of his Tragi-Comedies; as I shall observe in the sequel.

                     <q>I shall never (says he) subject my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to the <hi>French</hi> Standard; where Love and Honour are to be weigh'd by Drams and and Scruples: yet, where I have design'd the patterns of exact Virtue, such as in this Play are the Parts of <hi>Almahide,</hi> of <hi>Ozmyn,</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida,</hi> I may safely challenge the best of theirs.</q> Now the Reader is desir'd to observ, that all the Characters of that Play are stolle, from the French: so that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> took a secure way to Conquest, for having robb'd them of their Weapons, he might safely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them and beat them too, especially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten <hi>Ponce de Leon</hi>

                  <p>But had he only extended his Conquests over the <hi>French</hi> Poets, I had not medled in this Affair, and he might have taken part with <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> without my engaging in this Forreign War: but when I found him flusht with his Victory over the great <hi>Scudery,</hi> and with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor's</hi> assistance triumphing over the noble Kingdome of <hi>Granada;</hi> and not content with Conquests abroad, like another <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> turning his Arms upon his own Country; and as if the proscription of his Contemporaries Reputation, were not sufficient to satiate his implacable thirst after Fame, endeavouring to demolish the Statues and Monuments of his Ancestors, the Works of those his Illustrious Predecessors, <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Johnson:</hi> I was resolv'd to endeavour the rescue and preservation of those excellent Trophies of Wit, by raising the <hi>Posse-comitatus</hi> upon this Poetick <hi>Almanzor,</hi> to put a stop to his Spoils upon his own Country-men.

                        <hi>Shakespear</hi> who many times has written better than any Poet in any Language, is yet so far from writing Wit always, or expressing that Wit according to the dignity of the Subject, that he writes in many places below—the dullest Writers of ours, or any precedent Age.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61334:78"/>
many of them were made up of some ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, incoherent Story, which in one Play, many times took up the business of an Age.

                     <q>Most of <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Plays, I mean the Stories of them, are to be found in the <hi>Heccatomouthi,</hi> or <hi>Hundred Novels of Cinthio.</hi> I have my self read in his Italian, that of <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet; The Moor of Venice,</hi> and many others of them.</q>

so tired with his Labour, that he goes heavily in the Fourth, and sinks under his Burthen in the Fifth. Speaking of his Plots, <note n="p" place="bottom">Pres. <hi>Astrol.</hi> B. 4.</note> he says, <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> had most of theirs from <hi>Spanish</hi> Novels: witness <hi>The Chances, The Spanish Curate, Rule a Wife and have a Wife, The little French Lawyer,</hi> and so many others of them as compose the greatest part of their Volume in Folio.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the great <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> he deals not much better with him, though he would be thought to admire him; and if he praise him in one Page, he wipes it out in another: thus tho he calls him <q>
                        <hi>The most Judicious of Poets</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="bottom">Postscript, p. 146.</note>, and <hi>Inimitable Writer,</hi> yet, he says, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency lay in the low Characters of Vice, and Folly. When at any time (says he) <hi>Ben</hi> aim'd at Wit in the stricter sence, that is sharpness of Conceit, he was forc'd to borrow from the Ancients, (as to my Knowledge he did very much from <hi>Plautus:</hi>) or when he trusted himself alone, often fell into meanness of expression. Nay he was not free from the lowest and most groveling Kind of Wit, which we call <hi>Clenobes;</hi> of which <hi>Every Man in his Humour</hi> is infinitely full, and which is worse, the wittiest Persons in the Dramma speak them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are his own Words, and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these three Great Men in particular, now take his Opinion of them all in general, which is as follows;<note n="r" place="bottom">Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, <hi>pag.</hi> 143.</note>

set apart, let any Man, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands English, read diligently the Works of <hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher;</hi> and I dare undertake that he will find in every Page, either some <hi>Solecisme</hi> in Speech, or some notorious flaw in Sence.</q> In the next Page; speaking of their Sence and Language, he says, <q>I dare almost challenge any Man to shew me a Page toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is correct in both. As for <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> I am loath to name him, because he is a most judicious Author, yet he often falls into these Errors.</q> Speaking of their Wit, he gives it this Character<note n="s" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 148.</note>, <q>I have always acknowledg'd the Wit of our Predecessors, with all the Veneration that becomes me; but I am sure, their Wit was not that of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; there was ever somewhat that was Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and Clownish in it: and which confest the Conversation of the Authors.</q> Speaking of the advantage which acrues to our Writing, from Conversation, he says<note n="t" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, <q>In the Age wherein those Poets liv'd, there was less of Gallantry, than in ours; neither did they keep the best Company of theirs. Their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has been much like that of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in the Retirement of his Gardens: to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unknown, and to be Celebrated after their Decease. I cannot find that any of them were Conversant in Courts, except <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> and his <hi>Genius</hi> lay not so much that way, as to make an Improvement by it.</q> He gives this Character of their Audiences<note n="u" place="bottom">Ibid. 144.</note>; <q>They knew no better, and therefore were satisfied
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61334:80"/>
with what they brought. Those who call theirs <hi>The Golden Age of Poetry,</hi> have only this Reason for it, that they were then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Acorns, before they knew the use of Bread; or that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>These are Errors which Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has found out in the most Correct Dramatick Poets of the last Age, and says<note n="x" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 148.</note> in defence of our present Writers, That if they reach not some Excellencies of <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> yet at least they are above that Meanness of Thought which he has tax'd, and which is so frequent in him.</p>
                  <p>After this he falls upon the Gentlemen of the last Age in a Character, which (as <hi>Bayes</hi> says) is sheer point and Satyr throughout<note n="y" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 144.</note>; for after having Droll'd upon them, calling them <hi>Old Fellows, Grave Gentlemen,</hi> &amp;c. he summes up his Evidence, and sings an <hi>Io Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe;</hi> ascribing his Victory to the Gallantry and Civility of this Age, and to his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Customs and Manners of it.</p>
                  <p>I must do Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> this justice, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the World, that here, and there in this <hi>Postscript,</hi> he intersperses some faint Praises of these Authors; and beggs the Reader's Pardon for accusing them<note n="z" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note>, <q>Desiring him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that he lives in Age where his least faults are severely censur'd, and that he has no way left to extenuate his failings, but by shewing as great in those whom he admires.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this be a sufficient Excuse or no, I leave to the Criticks: but sure I am that this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61334:80"/>
procedure seems exactly agreeable to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which an ingenious Person draws of a Malignant Wit,<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi>'s Different Wits of Men, <hi>p.</hi> 120.</note>

                  <p>Were Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> really as great a Scholar, as he would have the World believe him to be; he would have call'd to mind, that <hi>Homer,</hi> whom he professeth to imitate, had set him a better pattern of Gratitude, who mentions with Respect and Kindness his Master <hi>Phemis, Mentor</hi> of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and even <hi>Tychius,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Leather-dresser.

                  <p>Honest <hi>Shakespear</hi> was not in those days ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with those great Wits, <hi>Scudery, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pranede, Scarron, Corneille,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>I must further alledge that Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> in borrowing from the Ancients, has only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Pattern of the great Men of former Ages, <hi>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Plautus, Terence, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c. all which have imitated the Example of the industrious Bee, which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61334:85"/>
sucks Honey from all sorts of Flowers, and lays it up in a general Repository. 'Twould be <hi>actum agere</hi> to repeat what is known to all Learned Men; that there was an Illiad written before that of <hi>Homer,</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and from which, (by <hi>Suidas, AElian,</hi> and others,) <hi>Homer</hi> is supposed to have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd his Design. <hi>Virgil</hi> copied from <hi>Hesiod, Homer, Pisander, Euripides, Theocritus, Aratus, Ennius, Pacuvius, Lucretius,</hi> and others; as may be seen in <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and <hi>Fulvio Ursini,</hi> which last Author has writ a particular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of his Thefts. Notwithstanding he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it no Diminution to his Worth, but rather gloried in his Imitation: for when some snarling Criticks had accus'd him for having borrow'd his Design from <hi>Homer,</hi> he reply'd; 'Tis the Act of an <hi>Hero,</hi> to wrest <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Club out of his Hand. Besides he not only acknowledges in particular his making use of <hi>Hesiod,</hi>

Yet, I say, He himself not only imitated <hi>Lucilius</hi> in his Satyrs, and followed <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle <hi>De Arte Poetica:</hi> but also translated <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> those Fragments of the Greeks, which in some Editions are to be found at the End of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Works, and inserted them in his first Book of <hi>Odes,</hi> as might be easily made appear, were it not too long a Discursion.</p>
                  <p>For this Reason I shall only speak succinctly of the Latine Dramatick Poets, most of which were Imitators at least, if not wholly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Greek Poets for their Productions. Thus <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Tragedies imitated <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> and <hi>AEschylus; Terence</hi> borrow'd from <hi>Menander,</hi> and in his Prologue to <hi>Andria,</hi> quotes <hi>Naevius, Plautus,</hi> and <hi>Ennius</hi> for his Authority. I could enumerate more Instances, but these are sufficient Precedents to excuse Mr. <hi>Johnson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Permit me to say farther in his behalf, That if in imitation of these illustrious Examples, and Models of Antiquity, he has borrow'd from them, as they from each other; yet that he attempted, and as some think, happily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Endeavours of Surpassing them: insomuch that a certain Person of Quality<note n="a" place="bottom">Poems and Essays, By Mr <hi>Edw. Howard,</hi> p. 24.</note> makes a Question, <q>Whether any of the Wit of the Latine Poets be more Terse and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their Tongue, than this Great and Learned Poet appears in ours.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> who has likewise suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to admiration in this way, or Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> have most improv'd, and best advanc'd
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61334:86"/>
what they have borrow'd from the Ancients, I shall leave to the decision of the abler Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: only this I must say, in behalf of the later, that he has no ways endeavour'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal what he has borrow'd, as the former has generally done. Nay, in his Play call'd <hi>Sejanus</hi> he has printed in the Margent throughout, the places from whence he borrow'd: the same he has practic'd in several of his Masques, (as the Reader may find in his Works;) a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, which Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> would have done well to have copied, and had thereby sav'd me the trouble of the following Annotations.</p>
                  <p>There is this difference between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of these Poets, that Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> has by Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Confession<note n="b" place="bottom">Pref. <hi>Mock Astrol.</hi>

When Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> borrow'd, 'twas from the Treasury of the Ancients, which is so far from any diminution of his Worth, that I think it is to his Honor; it least-wise I am sure he is justified by his Son <hi>Carthwright,</hi> in the following Lines<note n="c" place="bottom">Carthwright's <hi>Poems,</hi> p. 315.</note>:

                  <p>On the contrary, tho' Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise borrow'd from the Greek and Latine Poets, as <hi>Sophocles, Virgil, Horace, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c. which I purposely omit to tax him with, as thinking what he has taken to be lawful prize: yet I cannot but observe withal; that he has plunder'd the chief <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Wits for Forage, notwithstanding his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contempt of them: and not only so, but even his own Countrymen have been forc'd to pay him tribute, or to say better, have not been exempt from being Pillag'd. This I shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently make out in the Examen of his Plays; in the mean time, give me leave to say a word, or two, in Defence of Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>'s way of Wit, which Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> calls <hi>Clenches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There have been few great Poets which have not propos'd some Eminent Author for their Pattern, (Examples of this would be needless and endless.) Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> propos'd <hi>Plautus</hi> for his Model, and not only borrow'd from him, but imitated his way of Wit in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. There are none who have read him, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61334:87"/>
are acquainted with his way of playing with Words: I will give one Example for all, which the Reader may find in the very entrance of his Works; I mean the Prologue to <hi>Amphitruo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Justam rem &amp; facilem oratum à vobis volo:</l>
                     <l>Nam juste ab justis justus sum Orator datus.</l>
                     <l>Nam injusta ab justis impetrare non decet:</l>
                     <l>Justa autem ab injustis petere insipientia'st.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Nor might this be the sole Reason for Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>'s Imitation, for possibly 'twas his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Age that induc'd him to this way of writing, it being then as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> observes<note n="d" place="bottom">Postscript to <hi>Granada</hi>; p. 148.</note> the Mode of Wit, the Vice of the Age, and not <hi>Ben Johnson</hi>'s: and besides Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s taxing Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> for playing with his Words, I may add that I find it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by several Dramatick Poets, who were Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>'s Cotemporaries: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the advantage which this Age claims over the last, we find Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himself as well as Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> not only given to Clinches; but sometimes a <hi>Carwichet,</hi> a <hi>Quarter-quibble,</hi> or a bare <hi>Pun</hi> serves his turn, as well as his Friend <hi>Bur</hi> in his <hi>Wild Gallant;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might have spar'd this Reflection, if he had given himself the liberty of Thinking.</p>
                  <p>As to his Reflections on this Triumvirate in general: I might easily prove, that his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprieties in Grammar, are equal to theirs: and that He himself has been guilty of Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms in Speech, and Flaws in Sence, as well as <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Johnson:</hi> but this
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61334:87"/>
would be to wast Paper and Time: and besides' I consider that <hi>Apollos</hi> Laws like those of our own Nation, allow no Man to be try'd twice for the same Crime: and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> having already been arraign'd before the Wits upon the Evidence of the <hi>Rota,</hi> and found Guilty by Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> the Foreman of the Jury: I shall suppress my further Evidence, till I am serv'd with a <hi>Subpaena,</hi> by him, to appear before that Court, or have an Action clapp'd upon me by his Proctor, as guilty of a <hi>Scandalum Archi-Poetae;</hi> and then I shall readily give in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
                  <p>For these, and the like Reasons, I shall at present pass by his dis-obliging Reflections on several of his Patrons, as well as the Poets his Cotemporaries: his little Arts to set up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and decry others; his dexterity in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Mens Thoughts, so as to make them pass for his own; his Tautologies; his Petty-Larcenies, which notwithstanding his stiling of himself <hi>Saturnine,</hi> shew him sufficiently <hi>Mercurial,</hi> at least, if Plagiaries may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted under the Government of that Planet. In fine, (if Old <hi>Moody</hi> will allow me to borrow that word) he resembles Vulgar Painters, who can tolerably copy after a good Original, but either have not judgment, or will not take the pains themselves to design any thing of value. This will easily appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account of his Plays, of which I come now to speak. <hi>Viz.</hi>

                  <p>How much Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has borrow'd from the <hi>French</hi> in this Play, cannot be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the compass to which I confine my self; and therefore I shall only mention some of the most remarkable Passages which are stollen. I am therefore in the first place to begin with the Persons represented: The Character of <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi> is chiefly taken from <hi>Ponce de Leon</hi> in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahide;</hi> from <hi>Ozmin</hi> in <hi>Gusman,</hi> and <hi>Artaban</hi> in <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> His other Characters of <hi>Boab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delin, Almahide, Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> Duke of <hi>Arcos, Ozmin, Hamet, Gomel,</hi> &amp;c. are taken from <hi>Almahide.</hi> The Characters of <hi>Ozmin</hi> and <hi>Benzaida,</hi> are borrow'd from <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> in the Story of <hi>Ozmin</hi> and <hi>Alibech,</hi> and <hi>Lyndaraxa,</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61334:91"/>
are copied from Prince <hi>Ariantes, Agathirsis,</hi> and <hi>Elibesis;</hi> See <hi>Grand Cyrus,</hi> Part IX. Book I.</p>
                  <p>I am now to give some Instances that may make good my Assertion, That Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has borrow'd most of his Thoughts, as well as his Characters from those Authors abovemention'd, tho'he has new cloath'd them in Rime. In the beginning of the First Act, he has borrow'd the Description of his <hi>Bull-feast,</hi> from <hi>Guzman</hi>'s <hi>Juego de Toros &amp; Cannas:</hi> See the Story of <hi>Oz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> and <hi>Daraxa,</hi> part 1. pag. 82. and 85. The Description of the Factions <hi>pag.</hi> 4 is borrow'd from <hi>Almahide</hi> p. 1. The next four Lines spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the King is taken from Prince <hi>Mussa</hi>'s advice in <hi>Almahide,</hi> p. 6. The King's Speech in going between the Factions, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from <hi>Almhide,</hi> Part 3. Book 3. p. 63. The Description of the Quarrell between <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifa</hi> and <hi>Ozmin,</hi> is founded on <hi>Abindarrays</hi> his Speech in <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 2. The Rise of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>p.</hi> 6. from the same. <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s killing <hi>Gomel,</hi> from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 64. His quelling the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 64, 65. In the second Act, <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s Victory, and his taking the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> Prisoner, <hi>p,</hi> 12. is copied from <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hide,</hi> p. 65. The Scene between <hi>Abdalla</hi> and <hi>Lyndaraxa,</hi> p. 13. is stollen from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 62. and from the Story of <hi>Elibesis</hi> in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Part 9. Book 1. p. 20. <hi>Zulema</hi>'s Plea for <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s right to the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 17. is copied from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 62.

The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy between <hi>Almanzor</hi> and <hi>Zulema,</hi> p. 31. from the same Column. In the Fourth Act, <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s going over to <hi>Boabdelin</hi>'s Party, <hi>p.</hi> 34. is taken from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 72. <hi>Abdelmelech</hi> his coming to visit <hi>Lyndaraxa</hi> in Disguise, <hi>p.</hi> 35. is stollen from the former Story of <hi>Elibesis</hi> in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> p. 25. <hi>&amp;c. Abdalla</hi> visiting her, being Royally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Guards, <hi>p.</hi>39. from the same, p.67. <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s freeing <hi>Almahide</hi> from <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s Captivity, <hi>p.</hi> 45. is copied from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 73. The beginning of the Fifth Act, <hi>viz.</hi> The Scene between <hi>Abdalla,</hi> and <hi>Lyndaraxa,</hi> under the Walls of the <hi>Albayzin,</hi> immediately after his Defeat, <hi>p.</hi> 48. is stollen from <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the Story aforesaid, <hi>p.</hi> 61. His flying to the Christians, <hi>p.</hi> 50. from <hi>Alm.</hi> p. 72. <hi>Ozmin</hi> and <hi>Benzaida</hi>'s flight, <hi>p.</hi> 62. from <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> p. 8.</p>
                  <p>I might proceed through the Second Part, did I not fear the Reader to be already as tir'd as my self. I shall therefore only acquaint him, that most of that Play is borrow'd as well as the former: So that had our Author stollen from others, in none of his Labours, yet these Plays alone argue him guilty of the highest Confidence, that durst presume to arraign the Ancient English Poets as Plagiaries, in a Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script to two Plays, whose Foundation and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage are in a great measure stollen from the Beginning to the End.

                     <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> a Tragedy acted at the Theatre-Royal, printed in quarto, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1690. and dedicated to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester.</hi> This Play is accounted by several One of the best of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s, and was as I have heard acted with great Applause. The Foundation of it is built upon a French Novel call'd <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> How far our Author has followed the <hi>French-man,</hi> I leave to the Readers of both to judge. Only give me leave to take notice of that passage in his Epistle to this Play, where he endeavours to clear himself from the charge of Plagiarie. He says, <q>The Ancients were never accus'd of being Plagiaries, for building their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies      on known Fables.</q> To prove this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he brings several Instances; <q>Thus (says he) <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> wrote an <hi>Ajax,</hi> which was not less his own because <hi>Euripides</hi> had written a Play before him on that Subject.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61334:93"/>
Thus of late years <hi>Corneille</hi> writ an <hi>Oedipus</hi> after <hi>Sophocles;</hi> and I have design'd one after him, which I wrote with Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>French</hi> Poet stole from the <hi>Greek,</hi> nor we from the <hi>French-man.</hi> 'Tis the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, the new turn, and new Characters which alter the Property, and make it ours.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not that I know of, any where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd the Poets in general, or Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in particular, for borrowing their Plots; knowing that it is allow'd by <hi>Scaliger, M. Hedelin,</hi> and other Writers. 'Tis true I have shew'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were founded on History, or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and cited the Authors that treat on the Subject of each Dramma, that the Reader, by comparing them, might be able to judge the better of the Poets abilities, and his skill in Scenical Performances. But tho' the Poet be allow'd to borrow his Foundation from other Writers, I presume the Language ought to be his own; and when at any time we find a Poet translating whole Scenes from others Writings, I hope we may without offence call him a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giary: which if granted, I may accuse Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> of Theft, notwithstanding this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and inform the Reader, that he equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in this Instance of <hi>Oedipus:</hi> for tho' he stole not from <hi>Corneille</hi> in that Play, yet he has borrow'd very much from the <hi>Oedipus Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> as likewise from that of <hi>Seneca.</hi>

He says, <q>That <hi>The Tragedy of Queen Gorbuduc</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in English Verse; and consequently that Verse was not so much a new way amongst us, as an old way new reviv'd: and that this Play was written by the late Lord <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of <hi>Dorset.</hi>

Whether Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> intended his Character of <hi>Dominick</hi> as a Satyr on the Romish Priests only, or on the Clergy of all Opinions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I know not: but sure I am, that he might have spar'd his Reflecting Quotation in the Front of his Play:
<q>

                     </q>
But the truth is, ever since a certain Worthy Bishop refus'd Orders to a certain Poet, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has declar'd open defiance against the whole Clergy; and since the Church began the War, he has thought it but Justice to make Reprisals on the Church. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> who is famous for collecting Observations, and Rules for Writing, has learnt this great <hi>Arcanum</hi> from his Brother Poet, the Tutor to <hi>Pacheco</hi> in the Comedy of the <hi>Reformation</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Act 4. p. 8.</note>; <q>That this one piece of Art of Reflecting in all he writes, on Religion and the Clergy, has set off many an indifferent Play, by the titila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it affords the Gallants, who are sure to get those Verses all by heart, and fill their Letters with them to their Country Friends.</q> But whatever success this way of Writing may find from the Sparks, it can never be approv'd on by sober Men: and there are none who have any sense of Religion themselves, that can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concern suffer it to be abus'd; and none but Apostates or Atheists will be so impudent to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it: and the real cause of their Envy and Malice is the same with that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to his Son <hi>Aureng-zebe</hi>

first Play printed in the Folio Edition) and was revis'd by Sr. <hi>D'Avenant</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> The Character of the Saylors were not only the Invention of the former, but for the most part of his Writing: as our Author ingeniously confesseth in his Preface.

                     <hi>Tyranick Love,</hi> or <hi>The Royal Martyr,</hi> a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy acted by His Majesties Servants at the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61334:99"/>
Theatre-Royal, printed in quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1677. and dedicated to the Most Illustrious Prince <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Bucclugh.</hi> This Tragedy is writ in Heroick Verse: and several Hints are borrow'd from other Authors, but much improv'd. Only I cannot but observe that whenever the Criticks pursue him, he withdraws for shelter under the Artillery of the Ancients; and thinks by the discharge of a Quotation from a Latine Author, to destroy their Criticisms. Thus in the Preface to his Play, he vindicates the following Line in his Prologue;
<q>
                        <l>And he who servilely creeps after Sence</l>
                        <l>Is safe; —</l>
                     </q>
By that Quotation of <hi>Horace,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Serpit humi tutus.</l>
                     </q>
So he justifies the following Line in the end of the Fourth Act:
<q>
                        <l>With Empty Arms embrace you whilst you sleep,</l>
                     </q>
From this Expression in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—Vacuis amplectitur Ulnis.</l>
                     </q>
I could cite you other passages out of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Granada, Indian Emperor, State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, &amp;c.</hi> but these are sufficient to shew, how much <hi>Self-justification</hi> is an Article of our Author's Creed.

                  <p>An Author altogether unknown to me, but by his Writings; and by them I take him to be a Wit of the third Rate: and One whose Fancy leads him rather to Low-Comedy, and Farce, than Heroick Poetry. He has written three Plays; Two of which were purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd in a Burlesque Stile: but are intermixt with so much Scurrility, that instead of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, they offend the modest Mind.

                  <p>Having given you this Abridgment of <hi>Guarini's</hi> Life, I shall return to our <hi>English</hi> Author's Translation. Tho' in his Epistle to the Prince, <q>He speaks modestly of his Performance, as if this Dramatick Poem had lost much of the Life and Quickness, by being poured out of one Vessel, (that is one Language) into another; besides the unsteadiness of the Hand that pours it; and that a Translation at the best, is but a Mock-Rainbow in the Clouds, faintly imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true one; into which <hi>Apollo</hi> himself had a full and immediate Influence:</q> I say, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this modest Apology; yet Sir <hi>John Denham</hi> in his Verses on this Translation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely commends it: and tho' he seems to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our Author's Notions, touching Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations in general: yet he shews that Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> has admirably succeeded in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Attempt; as the Reader may see by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines; where after having blam'd ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Translators, he goes on thus;

At that time he writ on this Dramatick Romance 3 Stanzas, both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> which may give the Reader a Taste of his Vein in both these Languages; and therefore may not be improper for me to transcribe, or unpleasant to the Reader to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufe.

                     <hi>Humourous Lieutenant,</hi> a Tragi-Comedy which I have often seen acted with Applause.

                     <hi>Love's Pilgrimage,</hi> a Comedy. This I take to be an admirable Comedy.

The Compositor maim'd the last Act by setting the Sheet [I] false, so that 'tis pretty difficult to make out the five first Scenes: The Catastrophe of this Play is as <hi>moving</hi> as most Tragedies of this Age, and therefore our Author chose a proper <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> for the Frontispiece of his Play, in that Verse of <hi>Ovid.</hi>

Author, and Mr. <hi>Francis Kinwelmershe</hi> of <hi>Gray</hi>'s <hi>Inn,</hi> and there presented, and printed in quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1556. Each Act of this Play is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by a Dumb shew, (which in those times was the mode in Tragedies) and concluded by a <hi>Chorus.</hi> The First, Fourth, and last Acts were translated by Mr. <hi>Kinwelmershe,</hi> the Second and Third by our Author: and the Epilogue was writ by Mr. <hi>Christopher Yelverton,</hi> in Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rime.</p>
                  <p>This is the only Play of that ancient Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, that to my Knowledge is translated into English: tho' our Language, and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Age, be far more proper for Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>now,</hi> than in that time our Author flourisht.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Poet was stil'd the Tragick Philosopher, and was born at <hi>Phyla</hi> a Town in <hi>Attica,</hi> in the 75 Olympiade, and in the 274 Year after the Building of <hi>Rome. Prodius</hi> taught him Rhetorick, after which he made a Voyage to <hi>AEgypt,</hi> with <hi>Plato,</hi> to visit the Learned Men there, and to improve himself by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. He was also a Friend of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and some have believed that this Philosopher assisted him in the Composition of his Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. He went from <hi>Athens</hi> dissatisfied with the People, for preferring the Comick Writers
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61334:128"/>
before him; and retir'd to the Court of <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> about the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 338. This Prince confer'd many Favours on him, and had a great value for him. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at that time, that a certain person nam'd <hi>Decamnion,</hi> having raillied him about his Breath (which was not over agreeable) <hi>Archelaus</hi> sent him to <hi>Euripides,</hi> to be punisht at his pleasure. This so exasperated <hi>Decamnion</hi> both against the King and the Poet, that for the sake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge he join'd with other Conspirators in the Assassination of the Former, and set Dogs upon the later, which soon devour'd the Object of his Hatred. Some say, that this Misfortune pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Brutality of those irrational Creatures, by accident, and not design. Others again relate, that he receiv'd his Death, from some inhumane Women, against whom he had somewhat too bitterly inveigh'd. I remember a pleasant Story in <hi>Ford</hi>'s <hi>Apothegms;</hi> that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi> being once ask'd the Reason why in his Tragedies he always represented Women <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Euripides Wicked;</hi> answer'd, That <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> describ'd them <hi>as they were,</hi> he, <hi>as they ought to be.</hi> But Digression apart; the time of his Death no more than the manner of it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon. Some say, he Dy'd about the 65 year of his Age, in the 93 Olympiade, and in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 348. being 406 years before the Incarnation of our Saviour. Others say, that he Dy'd not, till the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 351. The Ancients mention Ninety odd Tragedies writ by him, of which at present we enjoy but Nineteen.</p>

                  <p>A Gentleman that lived in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and was the Eldest Son of an Esquire. He was born at <hi>London,</hi> and was sent by his Father to the University of <hi>Oxon.</hi> 1616. being then 14 Years of Age. He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and in a little time was chose Student of that Royal-Foundation. Here he took his Batchelors and Masters Degrees, and in the Year 1627. he went out Batchelor of Divinity.

However I am assur'd he died in the Year 1646.</p>
                  <p>He is accounted by some no mean Preacher, or Poet: but this I leave to the Judgment of those who will peruse the Works which he has publisht, and tho' <hi>Divinity</hi> ought to claim the preference, yet <hi>Poetry</hi> being my immediate Subject, I crave the Readers pardon that I give Account of his <hi>Poetry</hi> in the first place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with his Play call'd</p>

                     <note n="c" place="bottom">In Addend. 1. 2. Instit. Poetic.</note> printed before this Play, may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy them in this point. <q>I am of Opinion (says he) 'tis better to chuse another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than Sacred. For it agrees not with the Majesty of Sacred things to be made a Play and a Fable. It is also a Work of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous Consequence, to mingle Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions with things sacred; because the Poet adds uncertainties of his own, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falsities; which is not only to play with holy things, but also to ingraft in Mens Minds uncertain Opinions, and now and then false. These things have place especially, when we bring in God, or <hi>Christ</hi> speaking, or treating of the Mysteries of Religion. I will allow more where the History is taken out of the Sacred Scriptures, but yet in the Nature of the Argument is Civil. As if the Action be of

                        <hi>David</hi> flying from his Son <hi>Absalon;</hi> or of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> sold by his Brethren, advanced by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> to the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in that Dignity adored by, and made known unto his Brethren.

                  <p>I shall say nothing of the Life of <hi>Hugo Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>; only that he was an Honour to <hi>Delph,</hi> where he was born in the Year 1583. and will be famous to Posterity, in regard of those many Excellent Pieces that he has published.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61334:137"/>
of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Tragedies, of which we shall give an Account: But first with the Readers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, since an hansome Opportunity offers it self, we will present you with an Abridgment of the Life of this our <hi>Poetical-Stoick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</hi> was born at <hi>Cordoüa,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> a little before the Death of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> He bore his Father's Name, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity has mis-led some Authors, causing them to ascribe to the Son, the <hi>Declamations</hi> colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Father. He gave himself to the Study of <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi>; and in the beginning of <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Reign, he signaliz'd himself by a Cause which he pleaded in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, under the protection of <hi>Cneus Domitius.</hi> But finding that Emperor, aiming at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Monarchy of Eloquence, he pleaded no more in publick, for fear of giving Ombrage to this Ambitious Prince. He was banisht for two Years into the Isle of <hi>Corsa,</hi> upon suspition of too much Familiarity with the Relict of his Patron <hi>Domitius. Agripina</hi> being married to <hi>Claudius,</hi> she repeal'd his Banishment, and gave him the Honourable Station of Tutor to her Son <hi>Nero,</hi> who she design'd for the Empire. He acquitted himself of this Employ with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Applause; and the first five Years of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Reign, sufficiently testify'd the Diligence and Prudence of the Tutor, and the pregnant Temper of the Royal Pupil: who so well put in practice the Instructions that were given him, that the beginning of his Reign might serve as a Model to the best of Princes: But when once <hi>Poppaea</hi> and <hi>Tigillinus</hi> became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61334:138"/>
of his Temper, they soon destroy'd that Noble Foundation of Virtue, that <hi>Seneca</hi> had taken so much pains to erect; and he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to those abominable Crimes, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him the shame of Mankind. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Virtue was a continual Check to his Vices; this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Company at first disagreeable to him, afterwards intolerable. This occasion'd him to hire <hi>Cleonice, Seneca</hi>'s Freed-man, to poyson him; which either through the Repentance of the Domestick or the Distrust of <hi>Seneca,</hi> was prevented. <hi>Nero</hi> some time after, hearing that <hi>Seneca</hi> was privy to <hi>Piso</hi>'s Conspiracy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient of his Death, laid hold of that Opportunity to destroy him. All the Return this ungrateful Pupil made him for the Care of his Education, was to allow him the choice of his Death; which he accepted from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and causing his Veins to be open'd, he died in the twelfth Year of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, <hi>A.D.</hi> 65.</p>
                  <p>I could willingly enlarge upon his Life, but since my Subject confines me to speak <hi>obiter</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of forreign Poets, I hope the Reader will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, and seek in <hi>Tacitus, Suetonius,</hi> and other <hi>Roman</hi> Historians for the further Satisfaction: or in <hi>Justus Lipsius,</hi> who has Pen'd his Life more at large; whilst I return to my Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and those three Plays made <hi>English</hi> by him, which are <hi>Hercules Furens, Troas,</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hercules Furens,</hi> tho' not allow'd by some who are Criticks in Stile, to be writ by <hi>Seneca,</hi> is yet thought by most Learned Men to be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61334:138"/>
an Imitation of that Play of <hi>Euripides,</hi> which bears the same Name: and tho' in some things relating to Oeconomy and Contrivance, they differ, in others they agree; as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by <hi>Scaliger, Apud Euripidem Tragoedia est huic assinis, &amp; Argumento &amp; Nomine: oeconomia, partim similis, partim dissimilis.</hi> An Instance of this, is in the Scene between <hi>Lycus</hi> and <hi>Amphitruo,</hi> where <hi>Seneca</hi> has observ'd the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi> of the Stage in the person of <hi>Amphitruo,</hi> better than <hi>Euripides;</hi> so that <hi>Scaliger</hi> sticks not to prefer the <hi>Latin</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet, <hi>In Decore personae Amphitrionis longè inferior Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câ ut in multis aliis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Version of our Author, tho' I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not much commend it, yet I believe it may vye with the Translations of Mr. <hi>Brisset,</hi> and <hi>Le Sieur Nouvelon.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Linage</hi> has outdone him, 'tis because the One is writ in Prose, and so is left at liberty to express his Thoughts; the Other is fetter'd in Rhime, and has taken an ill Measure of Verse; Lines of fourteen Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables sounding harsh to the Ears of those that are used to Heroick Poetry. I must do my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor this Justice to acquaint the whole World, That he endeavours to keep to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Sence; and likewise to imitate his Verse, changing his Measure as often as the Author; the <hi>Chorus</hi> of each Act being different from the Act it self, as the Reader may observe by comparing the <hi>English</hi> Copy with the <hi>Latin</hi> Original.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Troas,</hi> is a Tragedy which is extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Learned <hi>Farnaby,</hi> and the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Daniel Heinsius;</hi> the former stiling it A

Divine Tragedy, in his Preface before these Tragedies, <hi>Divinam Tragoediam Troadas L.

Etiam in Choris noster vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit quos ex paucis Graecis verbis, &amp; quae sparsum leguntur fecit alios &amp; planè divinos.</hi> I shall not dispute whether this Tragedy be nam'd <hi>Troas,</hi> or <hi>Troadas,</hi> according to <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Opinion: or whether it ought to be nam'd <hi>Hecuba,</hi> as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Probus,</hi> and some others believe; but leave these Niceties to the Decision of the more Learned Criticks, whilst I proceed to give an Account of our Authors Version.</p>
                  <p>In this Tragedy the Author has taken the liberty of adding several things, and altering others, as thinking the Play imperfect; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left so by <hi>Seneca,</hi> or whether part of it be lost, he pretends not to decide. First, as to his Additions; he has at the end of the <hi>Chorus</hi> after the first Act, added threescore Verses of his own Invention. In the beginning of the second Act, he has added a whole Scene, where he Introduces the Spectre of <hi>Achilles</hi> rising from Hell, to require the Sacrifice of <hi>Polyxena.</hi> To the <hi>Chorus</hi> of this Act, he has added three <hi>Stanzas.</hi> Secondly, as to his Alterations; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of translating the <hi>Chorus</hi> of the third Act, (which is wholly taken up with the Names of Forreign Countries, the Translation of which without Notes, he thought would be tiresome
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61334:139"/>
to the <hi>English</hi> Reader;) he has substituted in its stead, another <hi>Chorus</hi> of his own Invention. This Tragedy runs in Verses of fourteen Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, and for the most part his <hi>Chorus</hi> is writ in Verse of ten Syllables, which we call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Verse. Whether his Translation excel, or be excell'd by those done by <hi>Robert Garnier,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Sallibray,</hi> I must leave to those who have read them to decide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thyestes,</hi> is a Tragedy in the Judgment of <hi>Heinsius</hi> not inferior to any of the other Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Pieces writ by <hi>Seneca.</hi> Whether he made use of <hi>Lucius Varius</hi> or no, I must leave to the Inquiry of the Learned; whilst I Inform my Reader, That our Author translated this Play when he was Fellow of <hi>All-Souls</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi> This Tragedy, is writ in the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Verse with the other; only the <hi>Chorus</hi> is writ in Alternate Rime. The Translator has added a Scene at the end of the fifth Act, spoken by <hi>Thyestes</hi> alone; in which he bewails his Misery, and implores Heaven's Vengeance on <hi>Atreus.</hi> These Plays are printed with the other seven in a Black Letter, in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p>'Tis not unlikely that our Author may have more Plays in Print, than we have mention'd; but I am very confident that <hi>The Pinder of Wakefield,</hi> and <hi>Philotas Scotch,</hi> notwithstanding the Allegations of Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> and Mr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanley,</hi> are not of that number: the One being written, as I suppose, at least printed, above Twenty, the Other more than Fourty Years after his Death.</p>

                  <p>An Author that liv'd in the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the First. Tho' he were but an Actor, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi>'s Testimony, and apparent from a Piece writ by him, call'd <hi>The Actors Vindication;</hi> yet his Plays were in those Days accounted of the Second-Rate. He was the most Voluminous Writer that ever handled Dramatick Poetry in our Language; and I know none but the Famous <hi>Spaniard, Lopez de Vega,</hi> that can vye with him; if at least we give Credit to his own Attestation, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face

                        <hi>English Traveller.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>This <hi>Tragi-comedy</hi> (as he says) being One reserv'd amongst two Hundred and Twenty, in which I have had either an entire Hand, or at the least a main Finger.</q> Of this Number we have, that I know of, but Five and Twenty entire Plays re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining: the Reason of which the Author gives us in the same Epistle. <q>True it is, that my Plays are not exposed unto the world in Volumes, to bear the Title of <hi>Works,</hi> (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) one Reason is, That many of them by shifting and change of Companies, have been negligently lost, Others of them are still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Hands of some Actors, who think it against their peculiar profit to have them come in Print; and a third, That it was never any great Ambition in me to be Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minously read.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These seem to me, to be more plausible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons than what Mr. <hi>Winstanley</hi> gives for their Miscarriage; <q>'Tis said<note n="m" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Lives of the Poets,</hi> p. 96.</note>, that he not only acted himself almost every day, but also wrote each day a Sheet; and that he might loose no time, many of his Plays were compos'd in the Tavern, on the back-side of Tavern Bills; which may be the occasion that so many of them be lost.</q> Certainly the Tavern Bills were very large, or Mr. <hi>Winstanley</hi> must think his Readers Credulity of the same extent with his own; who would subscribe to the belief of so ridiculous a Story. This Report Mr. <hi>Winstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> partly borrows from Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi>'s Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement at the End of his Catalogue, and as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61334:142"/>
Stories lose nothing in the carriage, Mr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanley</hi> had added the Contrivance of making use of Tavern Bills to save Paper. But tho' many of these Plays being written loosely in Taverns as Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi> observes, might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion their being so mean; yet it did not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability much contribute to their loss, as Mr. <hi>Winstanley</hi> would have it.</p>
                  <p>To do our Author justice, I cannot allow that his Plays are so mean as Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi> has represented them: for he was a general Scholar, and an indifferent Linguist, as his several Translations from <hi>Lucian, Erasmus, Textor, Beza, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> and other Latine and Italian <hi>Authors,</hi> sufficiently manifest. Nay, further in several of his Plays he has borrow'd many Ornaments from the Ancients; as more particularly in his Plays call'd <hi>The Ages,</hi> he has intersperst seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things, borrow'd from <hi>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, Plautus, &amp;c.</hi> which extreamly set them off. What Opinion the Wits of the last Age had of him may appear from the following Verses, extracted from a Copy of the Poets of those Times: <hi>viz.</hi>

want of Modesty. I am apt to believe, that our Author levell'd his Accusation at <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> since no other Poet that I know of, in those day, gave his Plays, the pompous Title of <hi>Works;</hi> of which Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi> has taken notice in his <hi>Sessions of the Poets.</hi>

                  <p>These are all the Plays that our Author has extant, except we will reckon his Dialogues, under the Species of Dramatick Poetry; such
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61334:147"/>
as <hi>Jupiter and Io; Apollo and Daphne; Amphrise,</hi> or <hi>The Forsaken Shepherdess; &amp;c.</hi> all which with several Translations above-mention'd the Reader may peruse in a Book intituled, <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Dialogues and Drammas, collected out of</hi> Lucian, Erasmus, Textor, Ovid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> printed octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1637.</p>
                  <p>There may be another Reason added to those already mention'd, why no more of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Plays have been published, which he himself gives us in his Epistle to <hi>The Rape of</hi> Lucrece; <q>That he used to sell his Copy to the Players, and therefore suppos'd he had no further right to print them, without their Consent; which is the Reason that so few are in print; and that some of these Plays that are so, have been copy'd by the Ear, and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uncorrect without his Knowledge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to his other Pieces, he has publisht se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral in Verse and Prose. In the former he has written a Poem, called <hi>The Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels,</hi> with Notes, printed fol. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1635. In reading over this Book, I find our Author informing the World,<note n="s" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Notes on</hi> Lib. 5. p. 245.</note>
                     <q>That he intended to commit to the publick View, the Lives of the Poets, Forreign and Modern, from the first before <hi>Homer,</hi> to the <hi>Novissimi</hi> and last, of what Nation or Language soever; so far as any History, or Chronology would give him warrant.</q> But this Work, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Author's Intention, I presume was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compleated, or at least publisht.</p>
                  <p>His chief Pieces in Prose are, <hi>An Apology for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61334:148"/>
Actors,</hi> printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1612. which was highly commended by several Copies of Verses, written in <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and <hi>English.</hi> This piece was answer'd, or rather rail'd against by One <hi>J.

The Examplary Lives and Acts of Nine Women Worthies; three <hi>Jews,</hi> three <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and three <hi>Christians;</hi> printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1640.

                  <p>The usual Motto which he prefix'd to most of his Works, and which shew'd the chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his Writing, was this of <hi>Horace,</hi>

                  <p>As to his Poetry, I dare not pretend to give a Judgment on it, it deserving somewhat above what my faint Praise can reach, or describe: therefore those who would be better satisfy'd must have recourse to his Character drawn by Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anthony Wood</hi> in Prose, and by Mr. <hi>Carthwright,</hi> and the late Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi> in Verse; to the foregoing, I might add Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s <hi>Dramatick Essay,</hi> which had it been writ after his Postscript to <hi>Granada,</hi> might have ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd for that unbecoming Character, and had serv'd for a <hi>Palinode</hi>; but since he has not that I know of thought fit to retract it, give me leave to insert an old Copy of Verses, which seems to wipe off the Accusations of Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Enemies<note n="*" place="bottom">Fizts-geofridi Altaniarum, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.</note>.</p>

                     </note>) is the only Plea for their being Wits: for this reason I shall forbear, and hasten to give an Account of his Works.</p>

                     <hi>Alchymist,</hi> a Comedy, acted in the Year 1610. by the Kings Majesties Servants, with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Master of the Revels; printed fol. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1640. and dedicated to the Lady most deserving her Name and Blood, the Lady <hi>Mary Wroth,</hi> [the Author of the <hi>Urania</hi>]. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> supposes this Play was copy'd from the Comedy of <hi>Albumazer,</hi> as far as concerns the <hi>Alchymist</hi>'s Character, as the Reader may observe from the following Lines, (being part of his Prologue, to <hi>Albumazer</hi> reviv'd;)</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Subtle</hi> was got by our <hi>Albumazer,</hi>

                     <l>Here he was fashion'd, and we may suppose</l>
                     <l>He lik'd the Fashion well, who wore the Cloaths.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Whether this Accusation be true, I pretend not to determine; but sure I am, that this last Couplet is borrow'd from Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Essay</hi>;<note n="g" place="bottom">Pag. 46.</note> where he says of Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> thus; <hi>You will pardon me therefore if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume he lov'd the Fashion, when he wore their Cloaths.</hi>

It was so well approv'd of by the Judicious <hi>Beaumont,</hi> that he writ a Copy of Verses in praise of it, which the Reader may find before our Authors Works. Nevertheless I must take notice that Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> has borrow'd very much from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in this Tragedy; as for Instance, part of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Ghost, in the very Entrance of the Play, is copy'd from the Ghost of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Thyestes.</hi> Thus our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has translated a great part of <hi>Salust</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, (tho' with great Judgment and Elegance) and inserted it into his Play. For the Plot, see <hi>Salust. Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Cicero. Florus</hi> Lib. 4. C. 1.</p>

After he left the Colledge, he betook himself to a retir'd Life, never intermedling with the Controversies of Religion, or the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State: which prudent Demeanor, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sweetness of his Disposition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him in the Favour and Good-will of the Society; till the New-modelling of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, under the <hi>Ecclesiastical Commissioners;</hi> by whom he was re-placed in his former Station: but did not long enjoy it, the Colledge being shortly after again restored to its former Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

The Author has propos'd the <hi>Oedipus and Hippolitus</hi> for his pattern; and I think it may justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be observ'd, That his Tragedy is writ in a more Masculine, and lofty Stile than most Plays of this Age; and Terror and Compassion

being the chief hinges on which he design'd his Tragedy should turn; he has judiciously rejected what he calls the Gingling Antitheses of Love and Honour. By the Advice of Friends, he tells us, that he hath disguis'd the Names: yet that this Emperour was One of the Greatest that ever <hi>Rome</hi> boasted. I am apt to believe, that under the Character of <hi>Valentius,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor means <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; and that <hi>Crispus,</hi> and his Mother-in-law <hi>Faustina,</hi> are shadow'd under the Characters of <hi>Florus</hi> and <hi>Fulvia:</hi> but this being only Conjecture, I must leave it to the Criticks Decision.</p>
                  <p>Our Author has nothing else in print that I know of, except a little Book entituled <hi>Some Observations on the Life of Cardinal</hi> Reginal dus Polus; where he disguises his Name under these two Letters, <hi>G.

                  <p>A Person of Fame and Note, as well for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts, as acquired Learning. He was Born in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the First, at <hi>Hatherleigh,</hi> &amp;c. His Education was at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> School; from whence be was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and admitted Student <hi>A.D.</hi> 1624. In this Colledge he gradually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the Study of Arts and Sciences, till he took both his Degrees, and enter'd into holy Orders, and was prefer'd to two Livings, both in the Gift of the Colledge, and one hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Oxford.</hi> About this time the Civil Wars breaking out, and the Pious King being forc'd by wicked Subjects, to fly for shelter to this Seat of the Muses: our Author was made choice of amongst others deputed to Preach before His Majesty. Soon after which, Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> tells us, he was created Dr. of Divinity, and resided in <hi>Oxford</hi> till the time of the Mock Visitation sent to the University, when he, amongst other Worthies eminent for their Loyalty, was ejected not only from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but both his Livings. During this Storm, he found an <hi>Asylum</hi> in the House of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> where for the most part he resided, till the Happy Return of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to his Kingdomes;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61334:181"/>
at which time, he was not only restored to his Places, but made Canon of <hi>Christ-church,</hi> and Arch-deacon of <hi>Chichester;</hi> which Preferments he enjoy'd to his Death. He was a Person of a ready and facetious Wit, and yet withal, a sound, Orthodox Preacher. In his younger years, he was very much addicted to Poetry, in which time he writ two Plays, which are very much esteem'd by the generality of those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Dramatick Poetry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amorous War</hi> a Tragi-comedy, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p>Besides these Dramatick Pieces our Author writ a Poem, upon the Naval Victory over the <hi>Dutch</hi> by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> printed 1665. and added some Dialogues to those of <hi>Lucian</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Mr. <hi>Francis Hicks,</hi> printed Fol. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1638. He publisht likewise many serious Pieces, as several Sermons in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1646—47—52—62. Amongst which, none was so much talkt of, as <hi>that</hi> concerning false Prophets. It was, if I mistake not, writ against by Mr. <hi>Francis Cheynel,</hi> which occasion'd our Authors Vindication pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht 1647. He writ besides <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antonio and Melida,</hi> a History acted by the Children of <hi>Paul's,</hi> printed octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1633.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antonio's Revenge,</hi> or <hi>The Second part of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio <hi>and</hi> Melida; frequently acted by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Paul's,</hi> printed in octavo. These two Plays were likewise printed in quarto above 30 Years before this new Edition, <hi>viz.</hi> 1602.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dutch Curtezan,</hi> a Comedy divers times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented at the <hi>Black-fryars,</hi> by the Children of the Queens Majesties Revels; printed in octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1633. This Play was publisht long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in quarto <hi>viz.</hi> 1605. <hi>Cockledemoy</hi>'s cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs. <hi>Mulligrub</hi> the <hi>Vintner</hi>'s Wife, of the Goblet and the Salmon, is borrow'd from an old <hi>French</hi> Book called <hi>Les Contes du Monde:</hi> see the same Story in <hi>English,</hi> in a Book of Novels, call'd <hi>The Palace of Pleasure,</hi> in the last Novel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Insatiate Countess,</hi> a Tragedy acted at the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61334:187"/>
                     <hi>White-fryars,</hi> printed quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1603. It being a common custom with our Author to disguise his Story, and to personate real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, under feign'd Characters: I am perswaded that in this Play, under the Title of <hi>Isabella,</hi> the Insatiable Countess of <hi>Suevia</hi>; he meant <hi>Joane</hi> the First Queen of <hi>Jerusalem, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily:</hi> and I doubt not but the Reader who will compare the Play with the History, will assent to my conjecture. Many are the Writers that have related her Life, as <hi>Collenuccio, Simmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta, Villani, Montius, &amp;c.</hi> but I refer my <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Reader to Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>'s <hi>Prophane State.</hi> Ch. 2. That her Life has been the Subject not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of History, but of Poetry and Novels also, is manifest from this Play, and the Novels of <hi>Bandello,</hi> who has related her Story under the Title of <hi>The Inordinate Life of The Countess of</hi> Celant. This Novel is translated into <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Belleforest,</hi> Tom. 2. Nov. 20. and possibly our Author might build his Play on this Foundation. The like Story is related in <hi>God's Revenge against Adultery,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Anne of Werdenberg,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Ulme</hi>: See Hist. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Male Content,</hi> a Tragicomedy, the first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign being laid by Mr. <hi>Webster,</hi> was corrected and augmented by our Author, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1604. and dedicated in the following Stile to <hi>Ben Johnson: Benjamini Johnsonio, Poetae Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantissimo, Gravissimo, Amico suo candido &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato, Johannes Marston, Musarum Alumnus, aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram hanc suam Thaliam D.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61334:188"/>
afterwards could not refrain from reflecting on Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> on Account of his <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and <hi>Catiline,</hi> as the Reader will find in the perusal of his Epistle to <hi>Sophonisba</hi>: <q>Know (says he) that I have not labour'd in this Poem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late any thing as an Historian, but to enlarge every thing as a Poet. To transcribe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, quote Authorities, and translate <hi>Latin</hi> Prose Orations into <hi>English</hi> Blank-Verse, hath in this Subject been the least aim of my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</q> That Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> is here meant, will I presume be evident to any that are acquainted with his Works, and will compare the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Salust,</hi> with those in <hi>Catiline.</hi> On what provocations our Author thus censured his Friend I know not, but this Custom has been practic'd in all Ages; the Old Proverb being verify'd in Poets as well as Whores, <hi>Two of a Trade can never agree.</hi> 'Tis within the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man, that a Play has been dedicated to the late witty Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and an Essay upon Satyr from the same Hand has bespatter'd his Reputation: So true it is that some Poets
<q>
                        <l>Are still prepar'd to praise or to abhor us,</l>
                        <l>Satyr they have and Panegyrick for us.</l>
                     </q>
But begging pardon for this Digression, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Play, which I take to be an honest general Satyr, and not (as some malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies endeavour'd to perswade the World) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to strike at any particular Persons.</p>
                  <p>

80. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1633. This Play was formerly print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in quarto 1606. The Plot of <hi>Dulcimel</hi> her cozening the Duke by a pretended Discovery of <hi>Tiberio</hi>'s Love to her, is borrow'd from <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace</hi>'s Novels, Day 3. Nov. 3.

                  <p>This Author was Born at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First; being Son to <hi>Philip Massinger,</hi> a Gentleman belonging to the Earl of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> in whose service after having spent many years happily, he Died. He

bestow'd a liberal Education on our Author, sending him to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at Eighteen years of Age <hi>viz.</hi> 1602. where he closely pursued his Studies in <hi>Alban-Hall,</hi> for Three or Four years space. How he spent his Life afterwards I know not: but 'tis evident that he dedicated a great part of his Studies to Poetry, from several Plays which he has publisht, and which were highly esteem'd of by the Wits of those times, for the purity of Stile, and the Oeconomy of their Plots; for which Excellency he is thus commended by an old Poet:
<q>
                        <l>Ingenious <hi>Shakespear, Massinger,</hi> that knows</l>
                        <l>The Strength of Plot, to write in Verse, and Prose;</l>
                        <l>Whose Easy <hi>Pegasus</hi> will ramble o're</l>
                        <l>Some Threescore Miles of Fancy in an Hour.</l>
                     </q>
He was extreamly belov'd by the Poets of that Age, and there were few but what took it as an Honour to club with him in a Play: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>Middleton, Rowley, Field,</hi> and <hi>Deckers:</hi> all which join'd with him in several Labours. Nay, further to shew his Excellency, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Fletcher,</hi> took him in as a Partner in several Plays, as I have already hinted, <hi>p.</hi> 217. He was a Man of much Modesty and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Parts, and were it not that I fear to draw Envy on our Poets Memory, I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce several Testimonials in confirmation of this truth: however I will give the Reader one Instance for many, being the Testimony of a Worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Jay:</hi>

                  <p>Our Author has publisht <hi>Fourteen</hi> Plays of his own Writing, besides those in which he join'd with other Poets. We shall begin with a Play call'd</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bashful Lover,</hi> a Tragi-comedy often acted at the private House in <hi>Black-friars,</hi> by His Majesties Servants, with great Applause, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1655.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bondman,</hi> an ancient Story, often acted with good allowance at the <hi>Cock-pit</hi> in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> by the most Excellent Princess the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> her Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1638. and dedicated to the Right Honourable and his Singular good Lord <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Montgomery.</hi> The Plot of the Slaves being seduc'd to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion by <hi>Pisander,</hi> and reduc'd by <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and their flight at the sight of the Whips; is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from the Story of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Slaves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against their Master. See <hi>Justin</hi> L.1.C.5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>City Madam,</hi> a Comedy acted at the private House in <hi>Black-friars</hi> with great Applause, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1659. for <hi>Andrew Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuicke,</hi> One of the Actors, and dedicated by him
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61334:191"/>
to the truly Noble and Virtuous Lady, <hi>Anne,</hi> Countess of <hi>Oxford.</hi> This is an Excellent old Play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Duke of Millain,</hi> a Tragedy printed in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. tho when, or where acted I know not, my Copy being imperfect. As to the Plot, I suppose <hi>Sforza</hi>'s giving orders to his Favourite <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco,</hi> to murther his beloved Wife the Dutchess <hi>Marcelia,</hi> was borrow'd from the History of <hi>Herod,</hi> who on the like occasion left orders with his Uncle <hi>Joseph</hi> to put his beloved <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne</hi> to Death; as the Reader may see in <hi>Josephus,</hi> Lib. 15. Cap. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emperor of the East,</hi> a Tragi-comedy divers times acted at the <hi>Black-friars,</hi> and <hi>Globe</hi> Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, by the King's Majesties Servants, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1632. and dedicated to the Right Honourable, and his very good Lord, <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Mohune,</hi> Baron of <hi>Oke-hampton.</hi> This Play is commended by three Copies of Verses, One of which was writ by Sir <hi>Aston Cockain.</hi> For the Play, 'tis founded on the History of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger. See <hi>Socrates</hi> L. 7. <hi>Theodoret</hi> L.5. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> L. 14. <hi>Baronius, Godeau,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fatal Dowry,</hi> a Tragedy often acted at the private House in <hi>Black-friars,</hi> by His Majesties Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1632. This Play was writ by our Author and Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Field</hi> (of whom I have already spoken). The behaviour of <hi>Charalois</hi> in voluntarily choosing imprisonment to ransom his Fathers Corps, that it might receive Funeral Rights; is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied from the Athenian <hi>Cymon,</hi> that admirable Example of Piety so much celebrated by <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

Maximus,</hi> Lib. 5. C.4. Ex.9. <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> notwithstanding make it a forc'd Action, and not voluntary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Guardian,</hi> a Comical History often acted at the private House in <hi>Black-fryars</hi> by his late Majesties Servants, with great Applause, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1655. <hi>Severino</hi>'s cutting off <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipso</hi>'s Nose in the dark, taking her for his Wife <hi>Jolantre,</hi> is borrow'd from the <hi>Cimerian Matron</hi> a Romance 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the like Story is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Boccace</hi> Day 8. Nov. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Great Duke of Florence,</hi> a Comical History often presented with good allowance by her Majesties Servants at the <hi>Phoenix</hi> in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1636. and dedicated to the truly Honoured and his noble Favourer, Sir <hi>Robert Wiseman</hi> of <hi>Thorrel</hi>'s-<hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Essex.</hi> This Play is commended by two Copies of Verses, One of which was writ by Mr. <hi>John Ford,</hi> of whom we have already spoken <hi>p.</hi> 219. The false Character given the Duke of the Beauty of <hi>Lidia,</hi> by <hi>Sanasarro,</hi> resembles the Story of King <hi>Edgar</hi> and Duke <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> in his Account of the Perfections of <hi>Alphreda.</hi> As the Reader may find the Story related in our English Chronicles that have writ the Reign of <hi>Edgar,</hi> as <hi>Speed, Stow, Baker,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maid of Honour,</hi> a Tragi-comedy often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with good allowance, at the <hi>Phoenix</hi> in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> by the Queen's Majesties Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1632. and dedicated to his most Honoured Friends, Sir <hi>Francis Foliambe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Bland.</hi> A Copy of Verses is prefixt to the Play, writ by Sir <hi>Aston Cokain.</hi>

                     <hi>New way to pay Old Debts,</hi> a Comedy often acted at the <hi>Phoenix</hi> in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> by the Queens Majesties Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1633. and dedicated to the Right Honourable <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Carnarvan.</hi> This Play is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly commended by the Pens of Sir <hi>Henry Moody,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Jay,</hi> above-mention'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Old Law,</hi> or <hi>A new Way to please you,</hi> an excellent Comedy acted before the King and Queen at <hi>Salisbury-house,</hi> and at several other places with great applause, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1656. In this Play our Author was assisted by Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rowley.</hi> At the End of it is printed a Catalogue of Plays, which tho' stil'd <hi>perfect</hi> in the Title-page, is far from it: for besides abundance of Typographical Faults, there are many other gross Errors: several pieces being mention'd under the Title of Plays which are of a different Species; for Instance <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Eclogues</hi> are inserted under the Name of a Tragedy <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Picture,</hi> a Tragi-comedy, often presented with good allowance at the <hi>Globe</hi> and <hi>Black-Fryars</hi> Play-houses, by the King's Majesties Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1636. and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Honour'd, and Selected Friends of the Noble Society of the <hi>Inner-Temple.</hi> This Play was acted by those excellent Players of the last Age, <hi>Lowin, Taylor, Benfield,</hi> &amp;c. and is commended by his true Friend, Sir <hi>Thomas Jay.</hi> The Plot of <hi>Sophia</hi>'s decoying the two debaucht Courtiers <hi>Richardo</hi> and <hi>Ubaldo,</hi> who attempted her Chastity, is related in a Book of Novels in octavo, call'd <hi>The Fortunate, Deceiv'd,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate

                     <hi>Renegado,</hi> a Tragi-comedy often acted by the Queens Majesties Servants, at the private Play-house in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1630. and dedicated to the Right Honourable <hi>George Harding,</hi> Baron of <hi>Barkley</hi> of <hi>Barkley-Castle,</hi> and Knight of the Honourable Order of the <hi>Bath.</hi> This Play is likewise commended by two Copies of Verses; One of which was writ by Mr. <hi>James Shirley.</hi>

                     <hi>Roman Actor,</hi> a Tragedy acted divers times with good allowance at the private House in the <hi>Black-fryars,</hi> by the King's Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1629. and dedicated to his much Honour'd, and most True Friends, Sir <hi>Philip Knivet,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Jay,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham</hi> of <hi>Newtimber</hi> in <hi>Sussex</hi> Esquire. This Play is commended by Six Copies of Verses writ by several Dramatick Poets of that Age, as <hi>May, Goss, Ford,</hi> &amp;c. For the Plot read <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Domitian, Aurelius Victor, Eutropius,</hi> Lib. 7. <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Lib. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Our Author owns<note n="n" place="bottom">See Prologue.</note> this Play to be founded on a Subject which long before appear'd on the Stage: tho' what Play it was I know not.

In this Play our Author took in Mr. <hi>Thomas Decker</hi> for Partner. I presume the Story may be met with in the Martyrologies which have treated of the Tenth Persecution in the time of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Maximian.</hi> See <hi>Rossweidus, Valesius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

he writ. I shall first give the Reader a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct Account of his Plays as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agrippina</hi> Empress of <hi>Rome,</hi> her Tragedy, printed 120. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1639. Our Author has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Xiphilinus, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> in the Designing his Tragedy: and besides has trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and inserted above 30. Lines from <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Arbyters Satyricon</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="bottom">Act. 4.</note>, being a Translation of those Verses recited by <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> beginning</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Orbemjam totum victor Romanus habebat,</hi> &amp;c. and concluding with
<q>
                        <l>—Siculo scarus aequore mersus</l>
                        <l>Ad mensam vivus perducitur,—</l>
                     </q>
Now altho' this is patly enough apply'd by our Author, he having introduced <hi>Nero</hi> at a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, commanding <hi>Petronius</hi> to write a Satyr against those Pleasures he us'd to commend; yet methinks Mr. <hi>May,</hi> having such a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Value for <hi>Lucan,</hi> as to translate his <hi>Pharsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> he should not have inserted what was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely writ against this particular Work; as may be gather'd from the foregoing Speech, <hi>Ecce Belli Civilis ingens Opus, &amp;c.</hi> but rather have left it to such a Man as <hi>Douza,</hi> who (as a <hi>French</hi> Author has observ'd) could no longer endure the Fire and Tempest of <hi>Lucan,</hi> when he read the<note n="*" place="bottom">I take the first to be spoke of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>AEn.</hi>
                     </note> Taking of <hi>Troy</hi>; or that<note n="*" place="bottom">The second of <hi>Petronius</hi> his Poem above-mention'd.</note> little Essay of the War of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> which he declar'd to love much better <hi>quam trecenta Cordubensis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Pharsalicorum versuum Volumiua.</hi> The first Act of this Play has been ill corrected, four
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61334:195"/>
pages of it being printed twice over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antigone,</hi> the <hi>Thebane</hi> Princess her Tragedy, printed 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1631. and dedicated to the most Worthily Honoured <hi>Endymion Porter</hi> Esquire. Our Author in the Contexture of this Tragedy has made use of the <hi>Antigone</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and the <hi>Thebais</hi> of <hi>Seneca.</hi> The Reader may see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Statius</hi>'s <hi>Thebais, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>AEgypt</hi> her Tragedy, acted 1626. and printed 120. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1639. and dedicated to the Accomplish'd Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby.</hi> The Author has follow'd the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of those times, as <hi>Appian. de Bellis Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus lib. 5. Plutarch</hi>'s Life of <hi>M. Anthony, Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>'s Life of <hi>Augustus. Florus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Dion, &amp;c.</hi> He has borrow'd besides several other Embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishments, as <hi>Calimaccus</hi>'s Epigram upon <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Misanthropist;</hi> an Account of the Ancient <hi>Lybian Psylls,</hi> so famous for curing the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bites of Serpents, by sucking the wound, related by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and by <hi>Solinus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heir,</hi> a Comedy acted by the Company of Revels 1620. printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1633. This Comedy is extreamly commended by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd Mr. <hi>Thomas Carew,</hi> in a Copy of Verses affix'd to the Play; where amongst other Commendations bestow'd on the Stile, and the Natural working up of the Passions, he says thus of the Oeconomy of the Play:
<q>
                        <l>The whole Plot doth alike it self disclose,</l>
                        <l>Thro' the Five Acts, as doth a Lock, that goes</l>
                        <l>With Letters, for till every one be known,</l>
                        <l>The Lock's as fast, as if you had found none.</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:61334:196"/>
I believe there are few Persons of Judgment that are true lovers of Innocent and inoffensive Comedy, but will allow this to be an Excellent Play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Old Couple,</hi> a Comedy printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1651. This Play is not much short of the former, and is chiefly design'd an Antidote against Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Philips</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="bottom">Pag. 179.</note> and Mr. <hi>Winstanley</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="bottom">Pag. 164.</note> ascribe two other Plays to our Author, <hi>viz. The Old Wives Tale,</hi> and <hi>Orlando Furioso;</hi> the first of these I never saw, but for the latter, I assure my Reader, it was printed long before our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was born, at least before he was able to guide a Pen, much less to write a Play, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1594.</p>
                  <p>But tho' he has no more Plays, he has other pieces extant in print; as the Translation of <hi>Lucan</hi>'s <hi>Pharsalia</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1635. which Poem our Author has continued down to the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> in VII Books both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Verse. I have already given you <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>'s Character of this Poem, to which I might add that of <hi>Scaliger, Rapin,</hi> and other Criticks; but this being somewhat forreign to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Subject, I shall wave it, and content my self with acquainting my Reader, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pompous and splendid the <hi>French</hi> Version of <hi>Brebeuf</hi> has appear'd in <hi>France,</hi> our <hi>English</hi> Translation is little inferiour to it; and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly commended by our Famous <hi>Johnson,</hi> in a Copy of Verses prefix'd before the Book well worth the Reader's perusal. He translated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61334:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Georgicks,</hi> printed with Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1622. Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> mentions a History of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, writ by him in Verse, and a History of the late Civil Wars of <hi>England</hi> in Prose; neither of which have I seen, and therefore pretend not to determine whether he were a partial Writer or no. Only give me leave to conclude in the Words of Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>; <q>That if he were a <hi>byassed</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Writer, yet that he lyeth buried near a good and true Historian indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> in the West-side of the North-Isle of <hi>Westminster Abbey,</hi> dying suddenly in the Night, <hi>A.D.</hi> 1652. in the 55<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of his Age.</q> I know not how Mr. <hi>Winstanley</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to omit the Transcript of so memorable a passage, since he has elsewhere borrow'd so largely from this Worthy Author, as well as Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> without either of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the least obligation to him.</p>

                  <p>An Author of good Esteem in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First.

He joyn'd with <hi>Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Johnson,</hi> in a Play called <hi>The Widow,</hi> of which we have already spoken, p. 298. in the Account of <hi>Johnson</hi>; and certainly most Men will allow, That he that was thought fit to be receiv'd into a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> by two such Great Men, was no common Poet. He club'd with <hi>Massinger</hi> and <hi>Rowley</hi> in Writing the <hi>Old Law,</hi> as before I have remarked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: See pag. 352. He was likewise assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Rowley</hi> in three Plays, of which we shall presently give an Account; and in those Plays which he writ alone, there are several

this Valiant Heroe, Careful Tutor, Wise Statesman, Exact Courtier, and Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to be describ'd by some Illustrious Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian; or else refer my Reader to his Life, already writ in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> by the Hand of his Incomparable Dutchess: who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life-time, describ'd all his Glorious Actions, in a Stile so Noble and Masculine, that she seems to have even antedated his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theosis.</hi> But tho' I dare not pretend to describe his Heroick Atchievements, or view him in the Field, as a General; yet I shall presume to look upon him in his Retirements, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider him as a Poet, and an Author, it being my immediate Province.</p>
                  <p>To speak first of his Acquaintance with the <hi>Muses,</hi> and his affable Deportment to all their Votaries. No Person since the Time of <hi>Augustus</hi> better understood Dramatick Poetry, nor more generously encourag'd Poets; so that we may truly call him our <hi>English Mecaenas.</hi> He had a more particular kindness for that Great Matter of Dramatick Poesy, the Excellent <hi>Johnson;</hi> and 'twas from him that he attain'd to a perfect Knowledge of what was to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed True Humour in Comedy. How well he has copy'd his Master, I leave to the Criticks: but I am sure our late, as well as our present <hi>Laureat,</hi> have powerful Reasons to defend his Memory. He has writ four Comedies, which have always been acted with applause; <hi>viz.</hi>

This Play, and <hi>Country Captain,</hi> are always bound together: the Duke's Name is not prefix'd to them, but I am confident they are his, from several Testimonies; since Mr. <hi>Alexander Brome</hi> writ a Copy in praise of this Play, directed to his Grace, and printed before the Comedy, call'd <hi>Covent Garden weeded:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> in a Copy directed to Mr. <hi>Mosely</hi> (the publisher of Mr. <hi>Carthwright</hi>'s Works) in reckoning what Poetical Treatises he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Publick with, names these two Plays, in the following Couplet:

Nay, further, I think it no small Glory that I am the only Author that I know of, who has quoted him in <hi>English.</hi> He has written two Books of Horsemanship; the first in <hi>French,</hi> called <hi>La Methode nouvelle de Dresser les Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux,

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apocryphal Ladies,</hi> a Comedy. This Play consists of three and twenty Scenes, but is not divided into Acts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bell in Campo,</hi> a Tragedy in two parts: In the second Play, are several Copies of Verses writ by the Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blasing World,</hi> a Comedy: Tho' this be stil'd a Play in former Catalogues, yet it is but a Fragment; the Authress before she had finisht the second Act desisted, not finding her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius tend to the prosecution of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bridals,</hi> a Comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comical Hash,</hi> a Comedy: This Play has not been in any Catalogue before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Convent of Pleasure,</hi> a Comedy.</p>

                     <hi>Female Academy,</hi> a Comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lady Contemplation,</hi> a Comedy in two parts. Three Scenes in the first, and two in the second part, were writ by the Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loves Adventures,</hi> in two parts, a Comedy. The Song, and the <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> in the last Scene in the second part, was likewise writ by the Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matrimonial Trouble,</hi> in two parts; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond being a Tragedy, or as the Authress stiles it, a Tragi-comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Natures three Daughters, Beauty, Love, and Wit</hi>; a Comedy, in two parts.</p>

                     <hi>Presence,</hi> a Comedy. To this are added twenty nine single Scenes, which the Dutchess design'd to have inserted into this Play, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would too much lengthen it, she printed them separately.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Publick Wooing,</hi> a Comedy, in which the Duke writ several of the Suitors Speeches; as that of the Souldier, the Countryman, the Spokesman for the Bashful Suitor; besides two other Scenes, and the two Songs at the End of the Comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Religious,</hi> a Tragi-comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Several Wits,</hi> a Comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sociable Companions,</hi> or <hi>The Female Wits,</hi> a Comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Unnatural Tragedy.</hi> The Prologue and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, were of the Duke's making. Act 2. Sc. 3. the Dutchess inveighs against Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Brittannia:</hi> tho' whether with Justice, I leave it to the Determination of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wits Cabal,</hi> a Comedy in two parts: His Grace writ the Epilogue to the first part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Youth's Glory, and Death's Banquet</hi>; a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy in two parts. Two Scenes with the Speeches at the first part, in commendation of <hi>Mile Sans pareille,</hi> were writ by his Grace; so were all the Songs and Verses in the second part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Blazing World, Bridal, Convent of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Presence, and Sociable Companions,</hi> are printed together in one Volume; and the rest in another.</p>

lay a little too much to Libertinism, but in Tragedy he made it his business for the most part to observe the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the Stage.

Nov. 3.

                  <p>I know not when our Author died; tho' I presume he liv'd to no great Age, being too much addicted to the Principles of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor <hi>Aristippus,</hi> Pleasure, and Contempt of Wealth.</p>
                  <p>My Readers are not to expect any Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Thefts, for this Author had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to practice Plagiary, having so large a Fond of Wit of his own, that he needed not to borrow from others; and therefore I may justly say, with a Friend of his,

'Tis not that I any ways abet Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> for his falling upon his <hi>Mamamouchi;</hi> but that I may maintain the Character of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, to which I pretend, I must pull off his Disguise, and discover the Politick Plagiary, that lurks under it. I know he has endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shew himself Master of the Art of Swift-writing; and would perswade the World, that what he writes is <hi>ex tempore</hi> Wit, and written <hi>currente calamo.</hi> But I doubt not to shew, That tho' he would be thought to imitate the <hi>Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,</hi> that spins its Web from its own Bowels;

yet I shall make him appear like the <hi>Leech,</hi> that lives upon the Blood of Men, drawn from the Gums; and when he is rubb'd with Salt, spues it up again. To prove this, I shall only give an Account of his Plays; and by that little of my own Knowledge which I shall discover, 'twill be manifest, that this Ricketty-Poet (tho' of so many Years) cannot go without others Assistance: For take this Prophecy, from your humble Servant, or Mr. <hi>Ravenscroft</hi>'s <hi>Mamamouchi,</hi> which you please,

<q>
                        <l>Till then he borrowed from Romance, and did translate,</l>
                     </q>
was unreasonable, when our Poet knew his own Guilt; for notwithstanding he writes in the same Prologue,
<q>
                        <l>`That all that's in it is <hi>ex tempore</hi> Wit.</l>

This Play was fore-stall'd in the Action, by the Duke's House, they having brought upon the Stage the <hi>Cheats of Scapin;</hi> as the Author com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in the Prologue.

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:61334:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Play, and to have brought a new sort of Comedy on our Stage: as he says,
<q>
                        <l>The Poet does a dang'rous tryal make,</l>
                        <l>And all the common ways of Plays forsake.</l>
                        <l>Upon the Actors it depends too much;</l>
                        <l>And who can hope ever to see two such,</l>
                        <l>As the fam'd <hi>Harlequin,</hi> and <hi>Scaramouch.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>This he well knew—</l>
                        <l>Yet rather chose in New Attempts to fail,</l>
                        <l>Than in the Old indifferently prevail.</l>
                     </q>
But notwithstanding our Author's Boasting, he is but a Dwarf drest up in a Giant's Coat stufft out with Straw: for I believe he cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly challenge any Part of a Scene as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Off-spring of his own Brain; and may rather be reckon'd the Midwife than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of this Play. This Author has followed his old Custom of sweeping clean, and leaving nothing behind him; for what he left of <hi>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,</hi> he has taken into this Play; as will appear to them that will compare the first Act with that <hi>Dramma.</hi> Almost all <hi>Le Marriage forcé,</hi> is taken into this Play like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and for the <hi>Cheats of Scapin,</hi> I suppose our Author has not only seen that Play, but borrow'd from thence; I have already taken notice, that part of it resembles <hi>Terence</hi>'s <hi>Phormio.</hi>

                  <p>An Author that flourish'd in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First; and was sometime a Member of <hi>Pembroke</hi> Hall in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> I can say nothing further of his Life or Country; but as to his Poetry, and his intimate Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the prime Poets of that Age, I can speak at large. He was not only beloved by those Great Men, <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> but likewise writ with the former, <hi>The Birth of Merlin.</hi> Besides what he joyned in writing with Poets of the second Magnitude, as <hi>Heywood, Middleton, Day</hi> and <hi>Webster;</hi> as you may see under each of their Names; our Author has four Plays in print of his own Writing, of which take the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; <hi>viz.</hi>

The Plot of <hi>Alexander Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound</hi>'s being hid by <hi>Jarvis</hi> under the Widow's Bed, is founded on an old Story inserted in the <hi>English Rogue,</hi> part 4.

The Play is founded on a stitcht Pamphlet in quarto, called <hi>The History of the Gentle-Craft.</hi> The Reader may find an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue printed in <hi>Duffet</hi>'s Poems, p. 60. writ for this Play, when 'twas revived.</p>

                  <p>To speak of the Translation in general, I think, if the Time be considered when it was undertaken, it may pass muster with candid Readers: The Author having at least so far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd it, as to bring several things in Action, which in the Original are delivered in Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; an Excellency commended by <hi>Horace,</hi> in those Lines so well known to all Scholars.</p>

                  <p>It is true our Author has altered in the Original, some places; but not many. Two Scenes he has left out, as being Soliloquies, and things little pertinent to the Business: and give me leave to observe by the by, That the <hi>French</hi> are much addicted to bring in these <hi>Monologues,</hi> in their serious Plays. Some
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61334:232"/>
things likewise our Author has added, but scarce discernable: and where M. <hi>Corneille</hi> would give him leave, he says he has follow'd close both his Sense and Words; tho', as he has observed, many things are received Wit in one Tongue, which are not in another. As to the Play, 'tis founded on true History; and the Author has follow'd <hi>Roderic de Tolede,</hi> and <hi>Mariana.</hi> The Reader may consult other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, that have writ of the Affairs of Don <hi>Fernando,</hi> the First King of <hi>Castille.</hi>

This Play is ascrib'd by Mr. <hi>Kirkman,</hi> to our Author; tho' only <hi>J.R.</hi> is affix'd to the Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page.

He was Son to his Grace <hi>Edwin,</hi> Arch-bish. of <hi>York:</hi> and was born in the Year 1577 at <hi>Bishops-Thorp,</hi> in the same County, being his Father's youngest Child.

But 'tis not on this Account, but his Poetry, that he is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and therefore I shall hasten to speak of his Writings in that kind, and first of that excellent Piece of Dramatick Poetry, which he has left us; and chiefly in this Account chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges a particular place; <hi>viz.</hi>

As to the Translator, I doubt not but he will be allow'd an Excellent Artist, by Learned Judges; and as he has follow'd <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>'s Advice of Avoiding a servile Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<q>
                        <l>Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus</l>

So he comes so near the Sence of the Author, that nothing is lost, no Spirits evaporate in the decanting of it into <hi>English</hi>; and if there be any Sediment, it is left behind. This Book was reprinted with Figures, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1688.</p>
                  <p>Nor are his other Translations less valu'd, especially <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> printed with Cuts, Fol. <hi>Oxon.</hi> 1632. This Translation was so much esteem'd in former times, that I find two old Copies of Verses, speaking in praise of our Author. In the first, called <hi>A Censure of the Poets,</hi> are these Lines:
<q>
                        <l>Then dainty <hi>Sands,</hi> that hath to <hi>English</hi> done</l>

                     </q>
The other on the <hi>Time Poets,</hi> sayes thus,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Sands</hi> Metamorphos'd so into another,</l>
                        <l>We know not <hi>Sands,</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> from each other.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I may add the Translation of the first Book of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>AEneis</hi>; by which Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, we may see how much he has excell'd Mr. <hi>Ogilby.</hi> For his other Divine Pieces, as his <hi>Paraphrase on the Psalms, Job, Ecclesiastes, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatiöns of</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have heard them much admired by Devout and Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and I believe very deservingly.</p>

                  <p>Our Author I think has several Copies of Verses in print, besides Prose; but because some of them will not advance his Reputation; and of others, I know not exactly which he writ, I shall omit further mentioning of them in this place.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Gentleman, whose Dramatick Works are sufficiently known to the World; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:61334:237"/>
his Excellent Comedies; which in the Judgment of some Persons, have very deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced him to the Honour he now enjoys, under the Title of <hi>Poet Laureat</hi> to their present Majesties. An Advancement which he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously consesses, is chiefly owing to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the Noble Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> that Great Judge of Wit and Parts; in whose Favour it has been Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s particular Happiness sor several Years, to have had an Eminent Share. Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> I dare presume, little ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, when he writ that Satyr of <hi>Mack-Flecknoe,</hi> that the Subject he <hi>there</hi> so much exposes and ridicules, should have ever lived to have succeeded him in wearing the <hi>Bays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I am willing to say the less of Mr. <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> because I have publickly profess'd a Friendship for him: and tho' it be not of so long date, as some former Intimacy with others; so neither is it blemished with some unhandsome Dealings, I have met with from Persons, where I least expected it. I shall therefore speak of him with the Impartiality that becomes a Critick; and own I like <hi>His</hi> Comedies better than Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s; as having more Variety of Characters, and those drawn from the Life; I mean Men's Converse and Manners, and not from other Mens Ideas, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed out of their publick Writings: tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I cannot wholly acquit our <hi>Present Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat</hi> from borrowing; his Plagiaries being in some places too bold and open to be disguised, of which I shall take Notice, as I go along; tho' with this Remark, That several of them
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61334:238"/>
are observed to my Hand, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure excused by himself, in the publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment he makes in his several Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, to the Persons to whom he was obliged for what he borrowed.</p>
                  <p>That Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi> has propos'd <hi>B. Johnson</hi> for his Model, I am very certain of; and those who will read the Preface to the <hi>Humorists,</hi> may be sufficiently satisfied what a value he has for that Great Man; but how far he has succeeded in his Design, I shall leave to the Reader's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. So far only give me leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in our Laureat's Defence, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not to measure his Merit by Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Standard; since <hi>Socrates,</hi> never was more persecuted by the Inhumane <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> than Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi> by Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Pen; and with the same injustice: tho' I think, whoever shall peruse the Modest Defence of the former, in his Epistle to the tenth Satyr of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> will not only acquit him, but love him for his good Humour and gentle Temper, to One who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to destroy his <hi>Reputation,</hi> so dear to <hi>All Men,</hi> but the very <hi>Darling</hi> of Poets; as <hi>Ovid</hi> says<note n="k" place="bottom">De Arte Amandi, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3.</note>,

                     <hi>Amorous Bigotte,</hi> with the Second Part of <hi>Tegue O Divelly</hi>; a Comedy acted by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1690. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Right Honourable <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bury Fair,</hi> a Comedy acted by his present Majesties Servants, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1689. and dedicated to the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Honourable <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> the present Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain of his Majesty's Houshold. How diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is for Poets to find a continual Supply of new Humour, this Poet has sufficiently shew'd in his Prologue; and therefore he ought to be excus'd, if <hi>Old Wit,</hi> and Sir <hi>Humphry Noddy,</hi> have some resemblance with <hi>Justice spoil Wit,</hi> and Sr. <hi>John Noddy;</hi> in the <hi>Triumphant Widow.</hi> Skilfull <hi>Poets</hi> resemble excellent <hi>Cooks,</hi> whose Art enables them to dress one Dish of Meat se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways; and by the Assistance of proper Sawces, to give each a different Relish, and yet all grateful to the Palate. Thus the Character of <hi>La Roche,</hi> tho' first drawn by <hi>Molliere,</hi> in <hi>Les' Precieuses ridicules,</hi> and afterwards copy'd by Sir <hi>W. D' Avenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Behn;</hi> yet in this Play has a more taking Air than in any other Play, and there is something in his Jargon, more diverting than in the Original it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epsom Wells,</hi> a Comedy acted at the Duke's Theatre; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1676. and dedicated to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> This is so diverting, and withal so true a Comedy, that even Forreigners, who are not generally the kindest to the Wit of our Nation, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61334:239"/>
commended it: and it is no small cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to our Author, that the <hi>Sieur De Saint Euvremont,</hi> speaking of our <hi>English</hi> Comedies in his <hi>Essays,</hi> has ranked this Play with <hi>Ben Johnson</hi>'s <hi>Bartholmew Fair,</hi> as two of our most diverting Comedies. 'Tis true that some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to fix a Calumny upon our Author, alledging that this Play was not in Ingenious but this Stain was quickly wip'd off, by the Plea he makes for himself in the Prologue, spoken to the King and Queen at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where he says,
<q>
                        <l>If this for him had been by others done,</l>
                        <l>After this Honour, sure they'd claim their own.</l>

These and other Disadvantages (the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of which you may read in the Preface) the Poet met with: and yet I think a Candid Judge would let it pass without much Censure; and pardon the faults of the Play, for that Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that is made for it in the Preface.</p>

                     <hi>Lancashire Witches, and Teague O Divelly,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61334:239"/>
the</hi> Irish <hi>Priest;</hi> a Comedy acted at the Duke's Theatre, and printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1682. This Play was written in the Times of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> therefore was opposed by <hi>Papists</hi> and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, for the sake of their Dear-Joy, <hi>Teague O Divelly:</hi> but nevertheless there appeared so numerous a party in the Play's Defence, that the Play lived in spight of all their Malice. However, I wish our Author for his own sake, had left out the Character of <hi>Smirk,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and the Defence he makes for it in the Preface, and his Protestation of having a true value for the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that her Sons, the Clergy, are abused in that Character; particularly in the first Scene of the second Act: and therefore Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi> must allow me a little to distrust his sincerity, when he makes such large Professions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Gowns-men; to whom I believe his Obligations are greater than Kindness: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he would not have suffer'd such reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have passed his Pen, as are to be met with in his <hi>Squire of Alsatia,</hi> and the Epilogue to the <hi>Amorous Bigotte, &amp;c.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi> would therefore take a Friend's Counsel, I would advise him to treat serious things with due Respect; and not to make the <hi>Pulpit</hi> truckle to the <hi>Stage;</hi> or Preface a Play, with a a Treatise of Religion: every Man has his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and I think the Stating of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Non-Resistance, is none of Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s: He may remember, that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> never miscarried <hi>more,</hi> than when he inter-meddled with Church Matters; and that all
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61334:240"/>
the Art and Beauty of his <hi>Absalom and Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi> will hardly make Amends for the Spots and Blemishes that are to be found in his <hi>Hind and Panther.</hi> But to return to our Subject: Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brome</hi> have writ a Play on the same Story with our Author; but how much this exceeds it, will be evident to unbyassed Judges. As to the <hi>Magick</hi> in the Play, our Author has given a very good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his Notes, from the Writings of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, Bodinus, Wierus, &amp;c.</hi> and I know nothing that we have in this Nature, in Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, except <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi>'s <hi>Masque of Queens,</hi> which is likewise explained by Annotations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Libertine,</hi> a Tragedy acted by his Royal Highnesses Servants; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1676. and dedicated to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> This Play, if not regular, is at least diverting: which according to the Opinion of some of our First-Rate Poets, is the End of Poetry. The Play is built upon a Subject which has been handled by <hi>Spanish, Italian,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Authors: there being four Plays extant (says my Author) on this Story. I have never seen but one, <hi>viz. Molliere</hi>'s <hi>L'Athée Foundroyé,</hi> which it appear'd our Author has read. There is a Character in Sir <hi>Aston Cockain</hi>'s <hi>Ovid;</hi> I mean that of Captain <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose Catastrophe is like that of Don <hi>John,</hi> which (as I have said) may possibly be borrowed from <hi>Il Atheisto ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minato.</hi>

                     <hi>Charles,</hi> L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> the present Earl of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.</hi> This Play the Author confesses is founded on <hi>Molliere</hi>'s <hi>L'Avare</hi>; which by the way is it self founded on <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Autularia.</hi> 'Twas the last Play that was acted at the King's House, before the fatal Fire there: Whoever will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use this Play, will find more than half writ by our Author, and the <hi>French</hi> part much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Psyche,</hi> a Tragedy acted at the Duke's Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1675. and dedicated to the late <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> This was the first Play that our Author writ in Rhime; and on that Account he found most of the <hi>Crambo-Poets</hi> up in Arms against it, who look'd upon our Author, as an Incroacher on their Territories; and <hi>Were</hi> (as he says) <hi>very much offended with him, for leaving his own Province of Comedy, to invade their Dominion of</hi> Rhime: But as our Author never valu'd himself upon this Play, so his Design at that time, was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Town with variety of Musick, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Dancing splendid Scenes, and Machines; and not with fine Poetry, the Audience being not at leisure to mind the Writing. The foundation of this Play, is <hi>Apuleius</hi> his <hi>Aureus Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> which the Reader may read in <hi>English,</hi> under the Title of <hi>The Golden Ass,</hi> translated by <hi>W. Adlington,</hi> printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1639. How far he has borrow'd from the <hi>French Psyche,</hi> he tells you in the Preface, and I leave it to those which have seen it (which I have not) to give Judgment to whom the preference belongs. How much this <hi>Opera</hi> takes, every Body that
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61334:241"/>
is acquainted with the Theatre knows; and with reason, since the greatest Masters in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Musick, Dancing, and Painting, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Royal Shepherdess,</hi> a Tragi-comedy acted by his Highness the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Servants; and printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1669. This Play (as our Poet owns) was originally Mr. <hi>Fountain</hi>'s of <hi>Devonshire;</hi> and without descanting on the Play, I shall refer the Reader to the view of Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s Epistle to the Reader, and the Comparison of both Plays, which are in print, for his satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Squire of</hi> Alsatia, a Comedy acted by their Majesties Servants; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1688. and dedicated to the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex.</hi> The Ground of this Play, is from <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> his <hi>Adelphi</hi>; especially the two Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of <hi>Mitio</hi> and <hi>Demea,</hi> which I think are improv'd. If he has not taken notice of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borrowed these Characters, 'tis because he is not beholding to the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>English</hi> for his Model; and that those for whom he chiefly writes, are Persons that are well acquainted with Poets of Antiquity, and need not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. 'Tis sufficient for the vulgar Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Play is taking and divertive, without troubling their Heads whence 'tis borrowed: and all People must allow that no Comedy has found better success than this, since the Restauration of the Theatre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sullen Lovers,</hi> or <hi>The Impertinents</hi>; a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acted by his Highness the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Servants; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1670. and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:61334:241"/>
to the late Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor owns that he receiv'd a hint from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Molliere</hi>'s <hi>Les Fâcheux,</hi> upon which he wrote a great part of his Play, before he saw it. The Play is regular and diverting, and the Author himself has better defended it than I am able to do, nor doth he at any time need a Second; and therefore I refer you to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face for Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timon of Athens, the Man-hater,</hi> his History, acted at the Duke's Theatre; made into a Play, printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1678. and dedicated to the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> The Play is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s; but so imperfectly printed, that 'tis not divided into Acts. How much our Author has added, or expung'd, I must leave to the Examination of the less busie Reader; I not having time at present to enquire into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>True Widow,</hi> a Comedy acted at the Duke's Theatre; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1679. and dedicated to Sir <hi>Charles Sidley.</hi> This Play I take to be as true Comedy; and the Characters and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to be as well drawn, as any of this Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> a Comedy acted at the Duke's The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1676. and dedicated to his Grace the late Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> I think there is no Body will deny this Play its due Applause; at least I know, that the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who may be allowed Competent Judges of Comedy, (especially of such Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, as Sir <hi>Nicholas Gimcrack,</hi> and Sir <hi>Formal Trisle</hi>) applauded it: and as no Man ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to discover the Frailties of such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61334:242"/>
tenders to this kind of Knowledge, before Mr. <hi>Shadwell;</hi> so none since Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>'s Time, ever drew so many different Characters of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and with such Success.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Woman-Captain,</hi> a Comedy acted at his Royal Highnesses Servants; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 167— and dedicated to <hi>Henry,</hi> Lord <hi>Ogle,</hi> Son to his Grace <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> If this Play falls short of the former, at least it wants not variety of Characters, which have gained it a Reputation above what is written by pitiful <hi>Poets</hi> of the Fourth-Rate, our Author's perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies, who are no more to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the buzzing of Flies, and Insects in hot Weather; which tho' troublesome, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive, and without Stings: and for his greatest Enemy; he has imitated the <hi>Bee,</hi> that with his Malice, has left his Sting behind him. I hope now, our Author is advanced to a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he will endeavour to exert his <hi>Muse</hi>; and having found Encouragement from Majesty it self, aim at writing Dramatick Pieces, equal to those of Antiquity: which however applauded, have been paralelled (I was about to say excelled) by the Comedies of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Johnson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I must do Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> so much Justice, as to acknowledge, that in <hi>Epick Poetry,</hi> he far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not only Mr. <hi>Shadwell,</hi> but most, if not all the Poets of our Age: and I could wish our present Laureat, would not give his predecessor such frequent Advantages over him; but rather confine himself within his own Sphere of Comedy.</p>

                  <p>One of the most Eminent Poets of his Time; he was born at <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>; and flourished in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> the First. His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Genius to <hi>Poetry</hi> was so excellent, that like those Diamonds<note n="l" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Account of <hi>Shakespear.</hi>
                     </note>, which are found in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Nature had little, or no occasion for the Assistance of Art to polish it. The Truth is, 'tis agreed on by most, that his Learning was not extraordinary; and I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his Skill in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tongues, exceeded his Knowledge in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Language: for we find him not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to <hi>Cynthio Giraldi</hi> and <hi>Bandello,</hi> for his Plots, but likewise a Scene in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, written in <hi>French,</hi> between the Princess <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> and her Governante: Besides <hi>Italian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs scatter'd up and down in his Writings. Few Persons that are acquainted with <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poetry,</hi> but are convinced of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Compositions, in all Kinds of it: and as it would be superfluous in me to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61334:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to particularise what most deserves praise in him, after so many Great Men that have given him their several Testimonials of his Merit; so I should think I were guilty of an Injury beyond pardon to his Memory, should I so far disparage it, as to bring his Wit in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with any of our Age. 'Tis true Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Account.</note> has censured him very severely, in his Postscript to <hi>Granada</hi>; but in cool Blood, and when the <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Fit was past, he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him [in his <hi>Dramatick Essay</hi>] Equal at least, if not Superiour, to Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> in <hi>Poesie.</hi> I shall not here repeat what has been before urged in his behalf; in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Defence of the Poets of that Time, against Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Account of <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi>; but shall take the Liberty to speak my Opinion, as my predecessors have done, of his Works; which is this, That I esteem his Plays beyond any that have ever been published in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and tho' I extreamly admire <hi>Johnson,</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi>; yet I must still aver, that when in competition with <hi>Shakespear,</hi> I must apply to them what <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> writ in his Letter to <hi>Andraeas Schottus,</hi> concerning <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Plautus,</hi> when compar'd; <hi>Terentium amo, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miror, sed Plautum magis.</hi>

than those Lines made by <hi>Ben Johnson</hi>; which being too long to be here transcribed, I shall leave them to be perus'd by the Reader, with his Works, of which I shall give some Account as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All's well, that ends well;</hi> a Comedy. This Play is founded on a Novel written by <hi>Jean Boccacio;</hi> see his Nov. Day the 3. Nov. the 9. concerning <hi>Juliet</hi> of <hi>Narbona,</hi> and <hi>Bertrand</hi> Count of <hi>Rossilion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony and Cleopatra,</hi> a Tragedy. The Ground of this Play is founded on History: see <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Life of <hi>Anthony; Appian, Dion Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Diodorus, Florus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As you like it,</hi> a Comedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comedy of Errors.</hi> This Play is founded on <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Maenechmi:</hi> and if it be not a just Translation, 'tis at least a Paraphrase: and I think far beyond the Translation, call'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechmus,</hi> which was printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1595.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> a Tragedy. This is founded on History: see <hi>Livy, Dionysius Hallicarnassaeus; Plutarch</hi>'s Life of <hi>Coriolanus, &amp;c.</hi> Part of this Play appear'd upon the Stage seven Years since, under the Title of <hi>Ingratitude of a Common-Wealth.</hi>

                     <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (<hi>Thomas</hi> L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.) the History of his Life and Death. This Play is likewise found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on History: See <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Martyrology; Fuller</hi>'s <hi>Church History; Stow, Speed, Hollingshead, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Baker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet, &amp;c.</hi> The Story of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Frescobald</hi> the Merchant, is related in Dr. <hi>Hakewell</hi>'s Apology, and <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>History of Man,</hi> Book 3.

                     <hi>Cymbeline his Tragedy.</hi> This Play, tho' the Title bear the Name of a King of <hi>Brute</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; yet I think ows little to the Chronicles of those Times, as far as I can collect, from <hi>Graston, Stow, Milton, &amp;c.</hi> But the Subject is rather built upon a Novel in <hi>Boccace, viz.</hi> Day 2. Nov. 9. This Play was reviv'd by <hi>Durfey</hi> about seven Years since, under the Title of <hi>The Injured Princess,</hi> or <hi>The Fatal Wager.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, the First part; with the Life of <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Hot-spur.</hi> This Play is built upon our <hi>English</hi> History: see the four former Years of his Reign, in <hi>Harding, Buchanan, Caxton, Walsingham, Fabian, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virgil, Hall, Grafton, Hollingshead, Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Trussel, Martin, Stow, Speed, Baker, &amp;c.</hi> As to the Comical part, 'tis certainly our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own Invention; and the Character of Sir <hi>John Falstaff,</hi> is owned by Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> to be the best of Comical Characters: and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself had so good an Opinion of it, that he continued it in no less than four Plays. This part used to be play'd by Mr. <hi>Lacy,</hi> and never fail'd of universal applause.</p>

                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, the Second part; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Death, and the Coronation of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth.

                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth his Life. This Play is likewise writ and founded on History, with a Mixture of Comedy. The Play is continued from the beginning of his Reign, to his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

with <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> For Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, see as before, <hi>Harding, Caxton, Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp;c.</hi> This Play was writ during the time that <hi>Essex</hi> was General in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as you may see in the beginning of the first Act; where our Poet by a pretty Turn, compliments <hi>Essex,</hi> and seems to foretell Victory to Her Majesties Forces against the Rebels.</p>

The Play is founded on the History of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Reader may consult these Writers for the Story: <hi>viz. Hector Boetius, Buchanan, Du chesne, Hollingshead, &amp;c.</hi> The same Story is succinctly related in Verse, in <hi>Heywood</hi>'s <hi>Hierarchy of Angels,</hi> B. 1. p. 508. and in Prose in <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Cosmography, Book 1. in the Hist of <hi>Brittain,</hi> where he may read the Story at large. At the Acting of this Tragedy, on the Stage, I saw a real one acted in the Pit; I mean the Death of Mr. <hi>Scroop,</hi> who received his death's wound from the late Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and died pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after he was remov'd to a House oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the Theatre, in <hi>Dorset-Garden.</hi>

Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor borrowed the Story from <hi>Cynthio</hi>'s Novels, Dec. 3. Nov. 7. The truth is, <hi>Salustio Picolomini</hi> in his Letter to the Author, extreamly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds these Novels, as being most of them fit Subjects for Tragedy; as you may see by the following Lines. <q>

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:61334:247"/>
as yet I cannot find, but set it down in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Catalogue, relying upon his Knowledge. But I have since read it in <hi>French,</hi> translated by M. <hi>Pierre Boisteau,</hi> whose Sir-name was <hi>Launay;</hi> who says it was writ by <hi>Bandello;</hi> but not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet met with <hi>Bandello</hi> in the Original, I must acquiesce in his Word. The <hi>French</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may peruse it in the first Tome of <hi>Les Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoires Tragicques, extraictes des oeuvres Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liennes de Bandello, imprimé</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>à Turin</hi> 157c.</p>

                     <hi>Taming of the Shrew,</hi> a very diverting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Story of the <hi>Tinker,</hi> is related by <hi>Pontus Heuteras, Rerum Burdicarum, lib.</hi> 4. and by <hi>Goulart,</hi> in his <hi>Hist. Admirables,</hi> Tom. 1. p. 360</p>

                     <hi>Tempest,</hi> a Comedy, How much this Play is now in Esteem, tho' the Foundation were <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s, all People know. How it took at the <hi>Black-fryars,</hi> let Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Preface speak. For his Opinion of <hi>Caliban,</hi> the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's Character, let his Preface to <hi>Troilus and Cressida</hi> explain. <q>No Man except <hi>Shakespear,</hi> ever drew so many Charactars, or generally distinguish'd them better from one another, except only <hi>Johnson</hi>: I will instance but in one, to shew the copiousness of his Invention; tis that of <hi>Caliban,</hi> or the Monster in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest:</hi> He seems here to have created a Person, which was not in Nature; a boldness which at first sight would appear intolerable: For he makes him a <hi>species</hi> of himself begotten by an <hi>Incubus</hi> on a <hi>Witch;</hi> but this is not wholly beyond the bounds of Credibility; at least, the Vulgar (I suppose) still believe it.</q>
                     <pb n="464" facs="tcp:61334:248"/>
But this is not the only Character of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Mr. <hi>Shakespear</hi> has written; for <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> as he introduces him, is cozen-German to <hi>Caliban</hi> by Birth; as those may observe, who will read that Play. As to the Foundation of this Comedy, I am ignorant whether it be the Author's own Contrivance, or a Novel built up into a Play.</p>

                     <hi>Titus Andronicus</hi> his Lamentable Tragedy: This Play was first printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1594. and acted by the Earls of <hi>Derby, Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> their Servants. 'Twas about the time of the <hi>Popish-plot</hi> revived and altered by Mr. <hi>Ravenscroft.</hi> In his Preface to the Reader, he says<note n="q" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Synesius</hi> his Opinion.</note>, <hi>That he thinks it a greater theft to rob the Dead of their Praise, than the Living of their Money:</hi> Whether his Practice agree with his Protestation, I leave to the Comparison of his Works, with those of <hi>Molliere</hi>: and whether Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s Opinion of <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> reach not Mr. <hi>Ravenscroft,</hi> I leave to the Reader. <q>I (says he<note n="r" place="bottom">Pref. <hi>Sullen Lovers.</hi>
                        </note> ingeniously) freely confess my Theft, and am asham'd on't; tho' I have the Example of some that never yet wrote a Play, without stealing most of it; and (like Men that Lye so long, till they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) at length by continual Thieving, reckon their stollen Goods their own too: which is so Ignoble a thing, that I cannot but believe that he that makes a common practice of stealing other Men's Wit, would, if he could with the same Safety, steal any thing else. Mr. <hi>Ravenscroft,</hi> in the Epistle
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61334:248"/>
to <hi>Titus,</hi> says, That the Play was not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s, but brought by a private Author to be acted, and he only gave some Master-touches to one or two of the principal Parts or Characters: afterwards he boasts his own pains; and says, That if the Reader compare the Old Play with his Copy, he will find that none in all that Author's Works ever receiv'd greater Alterations, or Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the Language not only refined, but many Scenes entirely new: Besides most of the principal Characters heightened, and the Plot much encreased.</q> I shall not engage in this Controversy; but leave it to his Rivals in the Wrack of that Great Man, Mr. <hi>Dryden, Shadwell, Crown, Tate,</hi> and <hi>Durfey.</hi> But to make Mr. <hi>Ravenscroft</hi> some Reparation, I will here furnish him with part of his Prologue, which he has lost; and if he desire it, send him the whole.</p>

                     <hi>Twelfth-Night,</hi> or <hi>What you will;</hi> a comedy. I know not whence this Play was taken; but the Resemblance of <hi>Sebastian</hi> to his Sister <hi>Viola,</hi> and her change of Habit, occasioning so many mistakes, was doubtless first borrowed (not only by <hi>Shakespear,</hi> but all our succeeding Poets) from <hi>Plautus,</hi> who has made use of it in several Plays, as <hi>Amphitruo, Maenechmi, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Winter's Tale,</hi> a Tragi-comedy. The Plot of this Play may be read in a little Stitcht-pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, which is call'd, as I remember, <hi>The Delectable History of</hi> Dorastus <hi>and</hi> Fawnia; printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Yorkshire <hi>Tragedy, not so new, as lamentable and true.</hi> This may rather deserve the Old Title of an Interlude, than a Tragedy; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not divided into Acts; and being far too short for a Play.</p>
                  <p>These are all that are in Folio; there rest yet three Plays to be taken notice of, which are printed in quarto, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Birth of</hi> Merlin, or <hi>The Child has lost his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> a Tragi-comedy several times acted with great applause, and printed quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1662. This Play was writ by our Author and Mr. <hi>W. Rowly</hi>; of which we have already spoken. For the Plot, consult the Authors of those times:
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61334:249"/>
such as <hi>Ethelwerd, Bede, G. Monmouth, Fabian, Pol. Virgil, &amp; Stow, Speed, &amp;c. Ubaldino, Le Vite delle Donne Illustri, p.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>John <hi>King of</hi> England <hi>his troublesome Reign</hi>; the First and Second Part, with Discovery of King <hi>Richard Coeur de lyon</hi>'s Base Son, (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly named the <hi>Bastard Fawconbridge.</hi>) Also the Death of King <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Swinstead</hi> Abbey. As they were sundry times acted by the Queens Majesties Players, printed quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1611. These Plays are not divided into Acts, neither are the same with that in Folio, I am apt to conjecture that these were first writ by our Author, and afterwards revised and reduced into one Play by him: that in the Folio, being far the better. For the Plot, I refer you to the Authors aforementioned, in that Play which bears the same Title.</p>
                  <p>Besides these Plays, I know Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi> ascribes, another Pastoral to him; <hi>viz. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of</hi> Paris: but having never seen it, I dare not determine whether it belongs to him or no. Certain I am, that our Author has writ two small Poems, <hi>viz. Venus and Adonis,</hi> printed 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1602. and <hi>The Rape of</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece, printed 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1655. publish'd by Mr. <hi>Quarles,</hi> with a little Poem annext of his own production, which bear the Title of Tarquin <hi>banished,</hi> or <hi>The Reward of Lust.</hi> Sr. <hi>John Sucklin</hi> had so great a Value for our Author, that (as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> observes in his <hi>Dramatick Essay</hi>) he preferred him to <hi>Iohnson:</hi> and what value he had for this small Piece of <hi>Lucrece,</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from his Supplement which he writ, and

                  <p>A Gentleman, of the same Name and Age with the former; and was (if not <hi>Poet Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat,</hi> yet) Servant to her Majesty. One of such Incomparable parts, that he was the Chief of the Second-rate Poets: and by some has been thought even equal to <hi>Fletcher</hi> himself. He had a great Veneration for his Predecessors, as may be seen by his Prologue to the <hi>Sisters;</hi> and particularly for Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> whom in an
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:61334:253"/>
Epistle to the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> he stiles, <hi>Our acknowledg'd Master, the Learned</hi> Johnson: and in all his Writings shews a Modesty unusual, seldom found in our Age; and in this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrain from comparing his Carriage, to the Civil and Obliging Gentleman of <hi>Rome;</hi> I mean <hi>Ovid,</hi> who speaking of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the first of his two Epigrams (if at least they are his which <hi>Heinsius</hi> questions) says thus:
<q>
                        <l>Quantum Virgilius magno concessit Homero:</l>
                        <l>Tantum ego Virgilio Naso Poëta meo.</l>
                        <l>Nec me praelatum cupio tibi ferre poëtäm:</l>

                     </q>
I need not take pains to shew his Intimacy, not only with the Poets of his Time; but even the Value and Admiration that Persons of the first Rank had for him; since the Verses before se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Works, and his Epistles Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sufficiently shew it. He has writ several <hi>Dramatick Pieces,</hi> to the Number of 37. which are in print: besides others which are in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript. Of these I have seen four since my Remembrance, two of which were acted at the King's House; and the other two presented at the Duke's Theatre, in Little <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Fields: <hi>viz. Court Secret, Chances, Grateful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, School of Compliments:</hi> with what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, I leave it to the Players now in being.

                     <hi>Contention of</hi> Ajax <hi>and</hi> Ulysses, <hi>for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of</hi> Achilles. This Interlude was nobly represented (says the Author) by Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Quality, at a private Entertainment of some Persons of Honour. The Design is taken from <hi>Ovid's Metamorphosis,</hi> Book the 13. See the beginning.</p>
                  <p>There rests only his <hi>Poems</hi> to be spoken of, printed octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1646. to which is added a Masque, call'd</p>

                     <hi>Triumph of Beauty,</hi> personated by some Young Gentlemen, for whom it was intended, at a private Recreation.

I shall therefore only content my self, as the Vallys, that have no Voice of their own, to eccho out his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at the Second-hand; and give you part of his Character, from a Person whose Honour and Pride it is, to have a considerable share in his Friendship: I mean Mr. <hi>Shadwell,</hi> who in his Epistle Dedicatory to <hi>The True Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> says, <q>That he has heard him speak more Wit at a Supper, than all his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, with their Heads joyn'd together, could write in a Year.

That he has in the <hi>Mulberry Garden,</hi> shown the true Wit, Humour, and Satyr of a Comedy; and in <hi>Anthony and Cleopatra,</hi> the true Spirit of a Tragedy.</q> But least this might be thought Partiality or Flattery in our Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat, give me leave to transcribe another part of his Character, from an Unquestionable Judge of <hi>Poetry,</hi> the great Ornament of the <hi>Muses,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> in his Imitation of <hi>Horace's</hi> Tenth Satyr of the First Book.</p>

The Author seems to have a great Value for <hi>Lucan:</hi> for he not only makes King <hi>Menander</hi> repeat part in the Original, but in the Fourth Act he makes him speak a Speech containing the beginning of the First Book of <hi>Lucan,</hi> to the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verse; but how far short he falls of Mr. <hi>May,</hi> I leave to the Readers Judgment. In the Fifth Act, the Poet introduces an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude of the Contention of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Ulysses,</hi> for the Armour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which I take to be but Indifferent.</p>
                  <p>He has writ besides a Piece, called <hi>Satyrical Essays,</hi> in octavo <hi>Lond.</hi> 1615.</p>

This Play is said to be writ by One Mr. <hi>Rawlins.</hi>

This Play used to be placed under the Title of <hi>Nero's Life and Death;</hi> which made People mistake it for the Life of <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> who was the Sixth Emperour of <hi>Rome:</hi> this being the Third, I know not when this Play was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or where acted, mine wanting the Title-page: but for the Plot, read <hi>Suetonius, Tacitus, Dion, Victor, Eutropius, &amp;c.</hi>

Play acted about a Hundred and thirty Years ago, and printed quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1661. This Play is printed in an Old <hi>English</hi> Letter, and is writ in a kind of <hi>Burlesk</hi> Verse, where the Author affects an odd sort of Chiming, in the middle of each Line. The Design of the Play, is to represent a Shrew, and teach the way to humble her. The Plot of this Play has some Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with Mr. <hi>Poisson</hi>'s <hi>Le Sot vengé.</hi>

Acted by the Boys of a Publick School at a Breaking-up; and published so as it may be useful, on the like Occasion: printed <hi>Oxon.</hi> 1678. I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Remarkable in this Play, but that 'tis writ without Womens parts; which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says he never thought fit to put on Boys. I remember not any Play, but <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Captivei,</hi> that is thus writ; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it is generally accounted an Admirable Play.</p>

This is said (in the Title-page) to be writ by a Person of Quality: tho' I have been told it was writ by Mr. <hi>Rawlins:</hi> But whoever was the Author, 'tis certainly inferiour to <hi>Epsom Wells,</hi> in point of Humour and Repartee.</p>

            <p>THe Occasion of adding this following <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> is to compleat the Account of all the Plays that have been printed as far as this present Time: since several new Ones have been publisht after the Fore-going Sheets were sent to the Press, and some others thro' over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight omitted in the Body of the <hi>Book;</hi> I have chose rather to place them here, than leave the whole imperfect. I shall follow the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as before; beginning first with the <hi>Known Authors,</hi> in an Alphabetical Order; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mention those, whose Authors are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.

               <p>
                  <hi>Amphytryon,</hi> or <hi>The Two Socias;</hi> a Comedy acted at the Theatre-Royal, to which is added the Musick of the Songs, compos'd by Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Purcel;</hi> printed 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1691. and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Honourable Sir <hi>Levison Gower,</hi> Baronet. This Play is founded on <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Amphytruo,</hi> and <hi>Molliere</hi>'s <hi>Amphytryon,</hi> as the Author himself acknowledges in his Epistle Dedicatory. The <hi>Reader</hi> that will take the pains to compare them, will find that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has more closely followed the <hi>French,</hi> than the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet: but however it must with Justice be allowed, that what he has bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, he has improv'd throughout; and <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi> is as much exceeded by Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> as <hi>Rotrou</hi> is outdone by <hi>Molliere.</hi> The truth is, our Author so polishes and improves other Mens Thoughts, that tho' they are mean in themselves, yet by a <hi>New Turn</hi> which he gives them, they appear Beautiful and Sparkling: Herein resembling Skillful Lapidaries, that by
<pb facs="tcp:61334:305"/>
their Art, make a <hi>Bristol</hi> Stone appear with almost the same Lustre, as a Natural Diamond.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> This Young Author is beholding to the Poets to rig him out; Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> having bestowed a Prologue on his Play, and Mr. <hi>Tate</hi> an Epilogue; and the ever Obliging and Compassionate Mr. <hi>Montford,</hi> (as the Author with Gratitude acknowledges) <q>Not only corrected the Tediousness of the Fifth Act, by cutting out a whole Scene; but to make the Plot more clear, has put in one of his own, which heightens his own Character, and was very pleasing to the Audience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Play seems to me to be of the same Stamp with several others lately written by his Fellow-Comedians; tho' in my Opinion, they had better confine themselves within their own Sphere of Action.</p>

               <hi>Edward the Third, with the Fall of</hi> Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Earl of</hi> March; an Historical Play, acted at the Theatre-Royal, by their Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; printed quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1690. and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Right Honourable <hi>Henry,</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>Sidney,</hi> of <hi>Sheppey;</hi> by Mr. <hi>Mountfort</hi> to whom the Play was made a Present. This Play I take to exceed most of the Plays that have been lately publisht; and I think in the Characters of <hi>Tarleton,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Etherside,</hi> he has somewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Misdemeanours of some Great Men in the last Reign.

               <hi>Satyr</hi> since <hi>The Plain Dealer,</hi> has been more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously or ingeniously penn'd: and I question not but it will deserve a good Character from all <hi>Readers,</hi> except the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Bigots</hi> of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion.</p>

               <hi>Robin Conscience,</hi> a Play which I never could obtain the sight of: tho finding it mentioned in former Catalogues, I was unwilling to omit it.</p>

               <hi>Royal Flight,</hi> or <hi>The Conquest of</hi> Ireland; a New Farce, printed quarto <hi>Lond.</hi> 1690. The Subject of this Play, is evident from its Title-page; and the Author has no ways disguised his Characters: Tho' had he treated some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in his Farce, with more Modestie, it had been no less for his Reputation.</p>
