            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Honoured Friend
and Patron, Thomas
Brown of Arlsey
<abbr>Esq</abbr> and to Mrs.
Mary Brown his
Wife.</head>
            <p>ALL who have a right
Sense of Things,
and understand but
a little of the State of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in the World, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but see and lament the
great decay <hi>thereof</hi> every
where amongst us. <hi>Atheism</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56224:3"/>
and <hi>Irreligion</hi> are become
too much in fashion, and
have too many <hi>Votaries</hi> and
<hi>Followers.</hi> It has not been
known in any Age, that
such sort of Men (or rather
<hi>Monsters,</hi> for <hi>Man</hi> is too
Honourable a Name for
them) have been so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
so daring and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and so successful.
Who could imagine that
in a Christian State there
should be such Persons, who
are at great pains to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<hi>Atheism,</hi> and to run
down, if they were able,
our most Holy <hi>Religion!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the neglect of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<hi>Children</hi> aright, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb facs="tcp:56224:3"/>
too much to this
degeneracy; so the most
likely Remedy of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and spreading Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
is, a due care in
<hi>Parents</hi> and others who have
the Charge of <hi>Children,</hi> to
train them up in the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of
God; To do what in them
lies, to fortifie their Minds
against those Snares and
Temptations to which they
are exposed; and to shine
before them, in the Practice
of sincere <hi>Piety</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>Tho' too many, on
whom God has bestowed
<hi>Children,</hi> are so far from
doing their Duty for their
<pb facs="tcp:56224:4"/>
               <hi>Souls,</hi> that they corrupt
and utterly ruin them,
which<note n="*" place="margin">Chrysost.</note> one of the
Ancients calls <hi>a greater Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
than if they killed their
Bodies.</hi> Yet, blessed be
God, there are some, who
consider it as their main Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
with Relation to their
<hi>Children,</hi> to make them wise
and good, Lovers of God,
and Haters of every Evil
Thing.</p>
            <p>Amongst those who are
governed by this Religious
Principle, God hath made
you, <hi>my most Honoured
Friends,</hi> great Patterns. As
he hath blessed you with a
numerous offspring, so he
<pb facs="tcp:56224:4"/>
hath given you of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from above, to know
how to Train them up in
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
mixture of <hi>Kindness</hi> and
<hi>Severity</hi> which you use to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, makes them
not only to stand in awe of
you, but to love you.</p>
            <p>I might be allowed, on
this occasion, to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in Commendation of
those Excellent Qualities
which God has blessed you
with, and which appear
not only in your way and
manner of Educating your
<hi>Children,</hi> but in other things
likewise. The many and
great Expressions of your
<pb facs="tcp:56224:5"/>
kindness for me, ever since
I had the Honour to be
known to you, require the
most publick Testimony of
my grateful Resentment
thereof. But 'tis one of
your <hi>Virtues,</hi> that you chuse
rather to be concealed, than
to make any great noise
in the World. I shall
therefore restrain my self
from what otherwise not
only Gratitude, but the
great and just Esteem and
Affection I have for you,
do mightily tempt me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
And shall conclude this
Address with my Prayers
to God for you, That he
would increase his Grace
<pb facs="tcp:56224:5"/>
in you more and more,
that you may abound in
all the Fruits of <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and true <hi>Holiness,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
you obtain <hi>the End of
your Faith, the Salvation of
your Souls. I am,</hi>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the ensuing
Treatise, having thought fit
to recommend his Papers to
my perusal, I was willing to usher
them into the World, with some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon his pious design.</p>
            <p>The Welfare of a
Common Wealth doth in
a great measure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Duties
of the Relatives here
treated of,<note place="margin">Plat. <hi>l.</hi> 2. de Republ. Aristot <hi>l.</hi> 6. Politic. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> and did Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
conscientiously discharge all the
Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>igations incumbent upon them by
<pb facs="tcp:56224:6"/>
the Law of God, and Nature, the
World could not be so wicked as it
is. Education makes the first impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon the Souls of Men, and
were care taken, that the Ground
be impregnated with good Seed, such
a Harvest might be expected from
it, that Posterity might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for it.</p>
            <p>I am sensible that Conversation
and the Humour of the Age, is apt
to make strange alterations in the
Principles we imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>be, yet something
will stick, and when the thoughts are
cool, and Men come to reflect, the
Principles they have learned when
the wax was soft, will recoil, and
oblige them to return to their Duty.</p>
            <p>Of this we have experience; and
though there is no Rule so general,
but admits of exceptions, yet it's
enough that this effect doth frequently
appear, which is no inconsiderable
Motive to the serious consideration
of a thing of this importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56224:7"/>
It was a wise answer, which one
of the <hi>LXXII. Interpreters</hi> gave to
<hi>Ptolemaeus Philadelphus,</hi> who asked
him, what was the greatest negligence?
<hi>The neglect,</hi> saith he, <hi>of the good
Education of Children.</hi> It is so, and
the hurt that's done by it, both to
them, and to the Publick, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</p>
            <p>Whence is it that there are so
many Prodigals, that so many come
to an untimely end? that so many
run into excesses, which destroy both
Soul and Body? From want of pious
Education.</p>
            <p>It was a severe Censure, which
<hi>Carneades</hi> the Philosopher passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Children of Rich Men, <hi>that
they learned nothing but to ride
well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is to be wondered, that
Rational Creatures should be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to breed up their Progeny to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,
and neglect the cultivation
of that which makes them differ from
<pb facs="tcp:56224:7"/>
Bruits, and shews, they are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of a nobler extract: Can any
thing be more reasonable, than Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and the fear of God? Is not this
it, which both Scripture and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
teaches? Do not we our selves
confess so much, and do not most
Men acknowledge it when they come
to dye? And yet that we should
make this the least part of our care
in the Education of Youth, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
strange!</p>
            <p>Some seem to fancy, that sending
their Children to School, or to teach
them their Catechism, is all the
Care that is incumbent upon them.
Though I cannot say, but that this
is a Duty, yet it is so imperfect, that
I can scarce honour it with the Title
of doing it by halves, it being but
the beginning, or the least part of it.
Instruction, Precept, and Example
are the mighty Engines and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the promoting and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
this Work; and perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:56224:8"/>
nothing hath a greater influence
than Example; for all the Moral
Precepts of the Parents, are like
Water spilt upon the Ground, where
Example doth not concomitate the
instruction.</p>
            <p>How shall the Child learn Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
where the Father is often drunk?
Or how is it possible, the young man
should be meek and patient, where
the Father is Cholerick, and hath no
command of his passion? I do not
restrain the Grace of God, and am
sensible, that the very impiety of
the Parents hath sometimes contrary
Effects upon certain Children, and
they learn to be good by the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of their Superiors; but this
is an extraordinary Providence, which
God exerts sometimes to manifest
his Omnipotence, and to let Men see
that he can bring light out of
darkness, but the ordinary way of
Edifying those under our Charge, is
to teach them by Example.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56224:8"/>
And though even this proves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
sometimes, yet it's enough
that it is our Duty, and that we
have discharged it, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that way which was most ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and of God's prescription.</p>
            <p>I am so pleased
with St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to <hi>Laeta</hi> concerning the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of her Daughter,<note place="margin">Hierom Ep. 7. ad Laetam.</note> that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear to transcribe part of it.</p>
            <p>I will let you see, <hi>saith he,</hi>
what Education you are to give to
a Daughter, whose Soul ought to
be the Temple of God. Let her
hear nothing, learn nothing, speak
nothing, but what may inspire
the fear of God into her. Let
her not listen to prophane Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,

Let her use her self at certain
hours, to sing Psalms; let none
be about her, but sober Servants,
<pb facs="tcp:56224:9"/>
and keep her from running into
Company light and vain, where
she will learn more ill than good.
Use her to reading, and to work,
and labour, and promise her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and incite her to Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
excite her to Virtue by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Commendations, and make
her ambitious to excel others in
Virtue and good Works. Let her
learn Scripture Sentences by heart,
and chuse her a Master, that may
not only teach her to read, but
instruct her in good manners.
Give her a Nurse neither debaucht
nor tatling, nor given to strong
Liquors; and let her Habit be
modest, and such as becomes her
Christian Profession. Let her not
bore Holes in her Ears for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
neither let her use any Paint
or Wash to beautifie her self. Let
her not be nice in ordering the
Hair of her Head, neither suffer
her to adorn her self with Gold
<pb facs="tcp:56224:9"/>
or Pearls, or precious Stones, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you design her for Hell fire:
When she comes to riper Age, let
her go with her Parents to the
Temple, but let her not return
to the Gayeties of the World. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
her to keep her self in her
Chamber, and let her not go to
Feasts, and merry Meetings. I
would not have her use too much
Fasting and Abstinence, which
may hurt her health, at least till
she be stronger, and better able to
bear it. Let her use God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for necessity, and not for
voluptuousness sake. Suffer her not
to be at Musical concerts, nor to
be fond of Fiddles, and Lutes,
and Harps, but let her repeat
every day some passages out of the
Word of God. Let her not go
abroad any where without her
Mother, nor be very familiar, or
enter into intreagues with any
Servant. Appoint her a Governess
<pb facs="tcp:56224:10"/>
that's sage and wise, and who may
teach her to rise at midnight, to
sing Praises to her God. Let her
pray and work Day and Night.
Teach her to handle her Needle,
to Spin and to Exercise her
self in turning the Spindle. Suffer
her not to imploy her self in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries
of Gold and Silver. Let
her Cloaths be plain and decent,
and let her eat soberly and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
and let her not take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in common Baths.</p>
            <p>I know what will be objected here,
that this is the advice of a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi>
and to teach a Daughter how
to be a <hi>Nun.</hi> But still I appeal
to any unprejudiced Person, whether
this be not the most likely way to
Salvation, and whether these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
be not agreeable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ? And though I will
grant, that all are not under the
same Circumstances, and all cannot
give the same Education; yet as to
<pb facs="tcp:56224:10"/>
the principal part of the advice,
which is to teach Children by Word
and Example, how to die to Sin and
to the World, it must be granted
it's very practicable. This Age in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
hath learnt to shake off these
stricter Rules, but they should shew
us too, what Warrant they have
from the Word of God to do so.</p>
            <p>It was judiciously observed of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
that a <hi>soft and effeminate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
breaks the strength of
Body and Mind,</hi> and whilst we
breed up Children to all the Arts
of Vanity and Luxury, they continue
strangers to God and to themselves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vine</hi> grows <hi>wild,</hi> if it be not
cut; so doth <hi>Youth,</hi> if they be not
betimes curbed in things which war
against the Soul.</p>
            <p>Vnderstand this, ye <hi>Parents,</hi> and
be instructed, ye to whom God hath
committed the care of Education; ye
are God's Stewards, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are the Goods you are to manage
<pb facs="tcp:56224:11"/>
to your Master's Glory. Their blood
God will require at your hands. Have
not ye read the Curse God pronounced
against <hi>Eli</hi> for his negligence, and are
not ye afraid of the same Judgment?
Ye are the persons by whom your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
must be taught to serve God in
their Generation; ye are the persons
from whom they are to learn their
Duty to God and Man; at your door
the fault will lie, if they miscarry
through your carelesness. Are their
Souls so contemptible in your eyes, that
you will let them perish for want of
Admonition? Did Christ think them
worth purchasing with his own Blood,
and will ye let them lie without fence
or wall, or cultivation?</p>
            <p>You take care that they may live
comfortably in this World: Is it not
a greater Duty to bestir your selves,
that they may enjoy God for ever? It
is joy to you to see them do well here,
and ought it not to be a greater joy
to find, that they are like to reign
<pb facs="tcp:56224:11"/>
with Christ and his Saints in a better
World? You love them, but how doth
it appear you do, while you let their
Souls die? Is this your Love, to
provide for their flesh, and to neglect
enriching their better part with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Principles? You would have
them go to Heaven when they die;
but how is it possible they should, when
you are loth to be at the trouble to
shew them the way that leads to that
Paradise? Was ever any Man saved
without Holiness, and do you hope they
will be, without this qualification? If
you teach them not by Word and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to practise that Holiness, how
can you or they hope to ascend into
the Mount of God, or dwell on the
everlasting Hills?</p>
            <p>Do you believe a future Account,
and do not ye enquire, whether you
discharge your Duty to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
Or is this no part of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ye are to give? Ye are the
Persons who are to breath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> goodness
<pb facs="tcp:56224:12"/>
into them, and to give them life and
happiness. Ye are their Gods, as it
were, and from you they receive their
motion; and their spiritual as well
as their natural life must begin from
you. Ye are Magistrates in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and it is your Province to be
a terrour to evil-doers, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers
of those that do well.</p>
            <p>If by your indulgence they sin, and
by your connivence they grow wicked,
will not the supreme Judge be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on such Officers? You blame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of a Commonwealth, if they
do not animadvert on Offenders, or
are regardless of the reins of Justice;
and do not you blame your selves,
who are Commanders in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
for suffering the fear of God
to decay there, which is the only thing
that can make them happy?</p>
            <p>How is it, that you will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
your Interest? Is it not
your interest to educate them into the
Practice of Virtue, and Goodness, and
<pb facs="tcp:56224:12"/>
Self denial? If they love God, they
must needs love you, that love will
constrain them to express their Duty
to you. The Presence of God will
over-awe them, and they'll obey you,
not with eye-service, but when your
eye is off from them. The fear of
God will make them conscientious of
obeying your Commands in secret;
and if your good Counsels and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
prevail with them, they will be
not only your Children, but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God; and you will have this
satisfaction, that you do not only love
them, but that God loves them, and
dwells in them, and they in him.</p>
            <p>Remember this, ye that are <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
and let this encourage you to
a faithful discharge of your Duty.
Your Parents, that under God gave
you life, have a just Right to your
Services and Obedience. You are born
Servants to them, and to be at their
beck and Command is the obligation
you bring with you into the World.
<pb facs="tcp:56224:13"/>
As the Authority of Parents was the
first Government in the World, so
your subjection to them is the first
Service that was ever known in the
World. Can you think any thing too
good for them, who are the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of conveying to you all the
goods you possess, and all the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you are invested with?</p>
            <p>If you follow not their good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and Admonitions, ye are
the greatest Rebels in the World, and
the sin is as great a Treason in the
Family you live in, as Sedition in a
Kingdom is against the State. You
have the noblest Promises made
you to reward your Obedience; and
though it is a natural Duty bound up
with your very Being, yet God will
reward it as if it were a deliberate
self-denial; and because you shall not
stay for the recompence, God will bless
you here, and your lives shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
on this side Heaven. It is
the first Commandment in the Law
<pb facs="tcp:56224:13"/>
with Promise; and to let you see how
God delights in your honouring your
Parents, and obeying their wholsom
Counsels, he hath singled out that
Precept, and dress'd it with more
than ordinary encouragements.</p>
            <p>But then, the Honour you shew
them, must not spend it self in some
outward Civilities, but must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in Actions, in Speeches, and
in Patience, according to the Advice
of the Son of <hi>Syrach, Ecclesiastic.</hi>
3. 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>In Actions, so as to execute their
lawful Commands with great alacrity
and fidelity, to labour, and to take
pains for their mainnteance and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
if they are fallen to decay, and
to relieve their necessities, according
to your ability.</p>
            <p>In Words, and Speeches, so as to
speak honourably of them, to answer
them with humility, to comfort them
when they are in trouble, and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
<pb facs="tcp:56224:14"/>
them with soft language, when
they are angry and displeased.</p>
            <p>In Patience, so as to bear their
anger patiently, and to endure their
frowardness and pettishness without
contradiction; to receive their severer
Commands, and such as are contrary
to your genius and inclination, with
gentleness, and to do them without
murmuring.</p>
            <p>These are Duties which draw more
than ordinary Blessings upon you, God
that sees you do so, will have
thoughts of peace towards you; he
will be concerned for you, and you
may be confident, he will not leave
you, nor forsake you.</p>
            <p>In honouring your Parents, you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
your selves. It's that which
will not only procure you favour with
God, but with Men too. It's upon
this account, that Wise Men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
the Dutifulness of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Children, and make them Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
by their Writings; and there
<pb facs="tcp:56224:14"/>
are such Examples of this filial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
even among the Heathen, that
it would be odious and dreadful, if
the Children of Christians should fall
short of their Duty.</p>
            <p>God lays so great a stress upon it
that as he promises the kindest things
to it, so he threatens as severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
where it is neglected; and
that he doth not only threaten, but
execute these Judgments, any Man
may see, that will take notice of his
Providences. But all this the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will be more fully convinced of,
by reading the following Discourse,
which, that God may bless with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and edification, shall be my
hearty Prayer.</p>

            <head>ADVICE
TO
PARENTS.</head>
            <head>PART I.</head>
            <p>IT has been always reckoned by the
best and Wisest men, a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary towards a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the World, to begin with
the Instruction and Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
those of elder Years being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
so rooted and hardned in their
sinful habits, that, for the most part,
there's very little can be done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them, and make them better. So
sensible were some ancient States of
this, that they made particular Laws
for Educating Children; thinking
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56224:20"/>
it too great a Trust, to leave it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Power of Parents, to
train up their Children according to
their Humour and Fancy. Amongst
Christians, there are few restraints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Parents; in most Countries it being
in their Power to Educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as they think good: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of no small Importance for them
to know what their Duty is, that they
may approve themselves to God, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whatever he requires towards their
Children, for their Souls, their Bodies,
and their outward Estate.</p>
            <p>The Design of this Treatise, is, to
furnish those, who want such helps,
with some plain and easie Directions,
that they may know how to act the
Part of Christian Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> while Children are yet in the
Womb,<note place="margin">How Parents ought to be affected while Children are yet in the Womb.</note> it is the Duty of
Parents, to endeavour to
bring their mind to an
indifferency, as to the
Sex which shall be born;
not to prescribe to God, by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
desires, and their bold asking
of him, a Child of this or that Sex;
but to leave it entirely to his Will and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56224:20"/>
Pleasure, to do what he thinks best.
The happiness of Parents does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in having Children of this or that
Sex: Sometimes Sons (who are most
desired ordinarily) may prove useless
in the World, yea very hurtful in many
regards; they may occasion great grief
of Heart, and lasting Anguish and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Parents, by their mad and
foolish Courses, and wicked doings: And
on the other hand, Daughters may
prove great Blessings in the World,
great Comforts to their Parents, and
great Examples of Piety and of Zeal
for the honour of God: On which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
Parents ought to resign their
will to God, and be ready with all
gratitude to accept whatever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How they ought to be affected when their Children are born.</note> When a
Child is born, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ought with all
thankfulness to return
Praise to God, who hath bestowed such
a blessing upon them, giving them a
living Child, sound and perfect in all its
parts and proportions, without either
defect of necessary parts, or excess
and deformity thereof. They ought to
admire and adore the Powerful and Wise
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56224:21"/>
Providence of God, which appears in
framing and fashioning their Infant, so
curiously and wonderfully in the Womb;
in preserving it, and making it grow up
from a very small and imperfect begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to such a bigness, with all those
comely shapes and proportions which
they behold; and at last in bringing it
safely from the Womb, which is one of
the great and wonderful Works of the
Power and Goodness of God; tho it be
little regarded, because it is so common.</p>
            <p>They ought to look upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as given them of God, to be
taken care of both as to their Souls
and Bodies; to be bred up in his
fear, for his Honour and Glory; to
be made fit to serve him here, and
to live with him for ever hereafter.</p>

them to God in Baptism.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They ought to Consecrate
their Children to God in Baptism, so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56224:21"/>
soon as conveniently they can: They
cannot better express their gratitude to
God for blessing them with Children,
than by presenting them to him again
in this holy Ordinance; that he may
set his Seal upon them, and admit them
into his House and Family; that he may
bestow upon them the Priviledges of
his Children, and give them a Right
and Title to the Blessedness, the Grace
and Glory purchased by Jesus Christ.
It is for this End that Baptism is institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
not only to be a Ceremony of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into the Church, but to Seal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us the Pardon of our Sins, to assure us
of the Divine Favour, to make us
Members of Christ, Heirs of God,
and Inheritours of the Kingdom of
Heaven, if we by wilful impenitency
and unbelief, do not afterwards hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and frustrate the Virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>It is not necessary for Parents to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how such things are done by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
it is enough for them to know,
That God hath appointed Baptism for
those Ends, and we are sure that He
appoints nothing in vain: Our Saviour
is said, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>To sanctify and
cleanse his Church with the washing of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56224:22"/>
by the Word.</hi> And, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. he is
said <hi>to save us by the washing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
And in the 22<hi>d.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the
16. it is said by <hi>Ananias</hi> unto <hi>Paul, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e Baptized, and wash away thy
Sins:</hi> And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> having spoken
of <hi>Noahs</hi> being saved with his Family
in the Ark, he adds, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3 21.
<hi>The like Figure whereunto, even Baptism
doth now also save us.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. <hi>For as the Body
is one, and hath many members, and all
the members of that one Body, being many,
are one Body; So also is Christ. For by
one Spirit are we all Baptized into one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27. He saith, <hi>For
ye are all the Children of God by Faith in
Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have
been baptized into Christ, have put on
Christ:</hi> Which words import not only
our owning and acknowledging him as
the Saviour of the World, who alone
is able to wash and cleanse us with his
Blood, but also our Professing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to live holy lives, to walk in
newness of life according to his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
in token of which in the Ancient
Church, they who were baptized, were
presently cloathed with White Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56224:22"/>
to testify their resolution to live
in holiness, and to put off the Old man,
that is, all their former Wicked deeds
and Customs, and filthy Practices. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, and 4. it is thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>Know ye not that so many of us as
were baptized into Jesus Christ, were bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized
into his Death? Therefore we are
buried with him by Baptism into Death,
that like as Christ was raised up from the
dead by the Glory of the Father; even so
we also should walk in newness of Life.</hi>
These words import not only our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a Crucified Saviour, who dyed
and was buried for sin, to save us from
it; but also our Repentance, whereby
we renounce Sin, as dead and buried to
it for the time to come.</p>
               <p>The general Design of this Sacrament,
being sufficiently plain and clear from
these and other Scriptures; it is to
little purpose, (and oftentimes it proves
to very ill purpose) to enquire any
further as to particulars; for by so
doing, a great many persons judging
of Divine things by their own weak and
foolish apprehensions, have reasoned
themselves (if I may so speak) both out
of their Reason and Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56224:23"/>
As to the Right of
Children to Baptism,<note place="margin">The Right of Children to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</note>
It will appear, if you
Consider, that the
Covenant Blessing of God's being the
God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi>
17. 7. is not only continued, to those
of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation who are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Christianity, (for if the first Fruit
be holy, the Lump is Holy; and if the
Root be Holy, so are the Branches, Rom.</hi>
11. 16.) but is likewise extended to
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who by Faith in Christ
are made one Body with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
so have a Right to the Blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to His Children
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Cometh this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
upon the Circumcision onely, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the uncircumcision also? For we say,
that Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for
Righteousness. How was it then reckoned?
When he was in Circumcision, or in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision?
Not in Circumcision, but in
uncircumcision? And he received the sign
of Circumcision, a Seal of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Faith, which he had yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uncircumcised: That He might be
the Father of them that believe, tho they
be not Circumcised, that Righteousness
might be imputed unto them also: And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56224:23"/>
the Father of Circumcision, to them who
are not of the Circumcision only, but also
walk in the Steps of that Faith of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Abraham, <hi>which he had being yet
uncircumcised.</hi> From which Words it
appears, That all who believe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Jews</hi> or Persons Circumcised, but
<hi>Gentiles</hi> also, or Persons uncircumcised,
are accounted the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and capable to partake of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Salvation, which was Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him as the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
To the same purpose saith the
Apostle, writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
Chap. 3. 9. <hi>They which be of Faith, are
blessed with Faithful</hi> Abraham. And <hi>v.</hi>
29. <hi>If ye be Christ's, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s
Seed, and Heirs according to the Promise.</hi>
Again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. he saith, <hi>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Husband is Sanctified by the Wife,
and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctified by the
Husband: Else were your Children unclean,
but now are they Holy.</hi> Which intimates,
that the Children of all Believers,
whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are
within God's Covenant, and have a
Right to those Favours and Priviledges
which he hath annexed thereto. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. 'tis said, <hi>The Promise
is unto you, and to your Children, and to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56224:24"/>
all that are afar off, even as many as
the Lord our God shall call.</hi> So that, all
who are called by the Preaching of the
Gospel, and do believe in the Lord Jesus,
are both themselves and their Children
within the Covenant of Grace. If it
were not so, <hi>Then the Blessing of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>were not come on the Gentiles,
through Jesus Christ,</hi> as it affirmed,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. For how could the same
Blessing be come on the Gentiles; if
their Children were not comprehended
within the Covenant of Grace, which
was a part of the Blessing of <hi>Abraham?</hi>
And how could Christians be Heirs
according to the Promise, if their
Children have no Right to it, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Children had? Or can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that the Condition of Believers
under the Gospel, is worse than the
Condition of those who believed under
the Law? Are God's Mercies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to Mankind impaired, by Christ's
coming into the World? Has the great
Lover of Souls, the Redeemer of the
World, been the occasion of our lose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great and considerable Priviledges,
by his Tabernacling amongst us? And
yet all this must needs follow, if now
under the Gospel the Children of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56224:24"/>
are excluded from the Covenant
of Grace, which they were admitted
to under the Law; which is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the Divine Goodness,
and contrary to the Love of our Lord
Jesus, which he manifested in his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Gospel; where we find, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Children to be brought
unto him, and blamed those who would
have kept them from him; He took
them into his Arms, laid his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and Blessed them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13,
14, 15. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15. 16.
From all which, both Words and Deeds
of our Saviour, we may see very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he was far from hindering their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted Members of his Church
and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Right of Infants to Baptism
will further appear, if you consider
more particularly the Institution of
Baptism. The <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
into their Church, not only Aged
Persons who were converted to Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
but likewise their Children,
which they did by <hi>Circumcision, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
and <hi>Baptism.</hi> Our Saviour being
to determine the manner of admitting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56224:25"/>
Disciples and Proselytes into his Church
that he might make his Yoke: easie to
those who would come after him, laid
aside <hi>Circumcision,</hi> (which was a painful
Rite) and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> (which were very
Costly) and only retained <hi>Baptism,</hi> to
be the Sacrament of Initiation or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Disciples into his Church.
<hi>Go ye,</hi> said he to his Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
19. <hi>and teach</hi> (or, as the Words may
be Translated, <hi>Disciple</hi> or <hi>make Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of) all Nations, Baptizing them in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
being given to Men, who knew
that the Infants of those who were
Converted, were admitted into the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Church, as well as the Parents
themselves, is there the least Ground
to imagine any other, but that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Design was, that the Children
of Believers should still be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Church, as well as formerly into
the <hi>Jewish?</hi> And no doubt, if he had
thought fit to discontinue the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Practice, he would have expresly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
his Mind about it, to prevent an
otherwise unavoidable mistake.</p>
               <p>To all which might be added, that
the Catholick or Universal Church, not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56224:25"/>
only at this Day, but in former Ages,
has observed this Custom, of Baptizing
the Children of Christian Parents.</p>
               <p>Now, if Children have so good a
Right to Baptism, what shall be said of
those Parents, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>light and neglect
it, and so deprive their poor Children
of that which God, their Heavenly
Father, hath ordained for so great and
excellent purposes? We see how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Parents are, if their Children have
a Title to Houses and Lands, or other
Temporal Things, to use their utmost
Endeavours, to make their Title as
sure unto them as is possible. And yet
how sad is it to think, that they are not
at all careful, to have their Children
Baptized, tho' God has appointed this
Sacrament, to be the Seal of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and an Evidence of that Right
which Believers and their Children have
to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When Children begin to
speak and to discover some dawnings of
Reason, it is fit to season their Minds
with some good Thoughts, with some
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56224:26"/>

may catch hold of their tender
and innocent Minds, before they are
corrupted and defiled with bad Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and vain and unreasonable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they are apt to learn too

who made them; who dyed for them;
for what end they were made; whither
good Children go when they dye, and
whither naughty Children go; what a
place Heaven is, and Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongst other Things, 'twill be
very useful to tell Children, some of the
most remarkable Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in Scripture,<note place="margin">Children are to be acquainted with Scripture Histories.</note> as so
many Arguments and
Motives to excite them to
be good Children, and to
avoid all wicked and naughty Courses:
For Example, tell them the Story of
the Deluge, how God punished the Old
World, because they were wicked, but
saved <hi>Noah.</hi> Thereby take occasion,
to shew them the Danger of being wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that sinning with Company, will
not preserve from Punishment; what a
Happy thing it is to be good; and how
kind the Lord is to such who keep his
Commandments, as <hi>Noah</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56224:26"/>
To this purpose tell them also the
Story of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, &amp;c.</hi> How
those Cities were consumed by Fire
from Heaven, for their great Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and how <hi>Lot</hi> was preserved
from that dreadful Destruction.</p>
               <p>Tell them the History of <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Goliah,</hi> that they may learn not to be
proud of their Strength, but may put
their Trust in God, who is able to save
them from their mightiest Enemies.</p>
               <p>Tell them the Story of the naughty
Children at <hi>Bethel,</hi> how they mocked
the Old Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> and how 42
of them were torn in pieces by two
Bears. By this Example shew them,
what a dangerous thing it is to be in
the Company of naughty Children;
and what an Evil thing it is to be
Mockers and Scorners, especially of
Holy Men, of Aged Persons, or of
God's Ministers.</p>
               <p>Tell them what happened to <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> for their lying; that they
may be afraid to lye.</p>
               <p>Tell them how <hi>Daniel</hi> was preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when he was cast into the Den of
Lions: And how the three Children
were preserved in the Fiery Furnace.
That thereby they may learn, never to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56224:27"/>
be afraid to do the Will of God, tho'
by doing it they should be exposed to
never so great Dangers.</p>
               <p>Tell them how <hi>Daniel, Hananiah,
Mishacl</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> chose to eat Pulse
only, and to drink Water, and yet,
by the Blessing of God on their plain
Diet, <hi>Their Countenances appeared fairer

                     </gap>at the Portion of the King's
Meat.</hi> That thereby they may learn
to be well pleased with the most Plain
and Ordinary Fare, and may consider
that the Blessing of God is able to make
the coursest Diet very sweet, Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Nourishing, even beyond the
greatest Delicacies.</p>
               <p>In this manner 'tis sit to entertain
your Children sometimes, according to
their Age and Capacity, with such Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Histories, as tend to make the
most lively Impressions upon them.</p>
               <p>In teaching Children such matters,
it is necessary to condescend to their
weak Capacity, to speak to them softly
and gently, and in a plain and intellgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner. It is not fit to talk with
them of such things at all times, nor
yet to say too much to them at any one
time: Such Instructions are to be dropt
into their Minds leisurely and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56224:27"/>
so as not to oppress them, but
to recreate them; not to be a Burden
to them, but a Pleasure.</p>
               <p>It cannot be expressed how great
Advantages attend such early Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
these are the Seeds of Virtue,
which take root infensibly, and spring

The famous <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made
this appear, by bringing

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Teach them, so soon as
may be, to pray to God Morning and
Evening; To say after you, or others
whom you appoint for that purpose,
two or three short Petitions, which
are easie to be understood; and as
their Understanding and Capacity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
teach them the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and after that some larger Form
of Prayer, which they may say after
you, till they can read it themselves,
or get it by heart.</p>
               <p>You are to have a special care, that
they perform their Devotions in as
grave and serious a manner as their
years can admit: You are to keep them
from all sorts of indecent Actions and
Postures, when they say their Prayers:
For this end, you are to teach them
who it is they speak to when they pray,
and what those things mean, which
the pray for.</p>
               <p>Chuse the sittest times for them,
wherein to say their Prayers: As in the
Morning, when-ever they arise; while
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56224:28"/>
their Spirits are most vigorous, and
their Thoughts most free. At Night
let them say their Prayers rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Supper than after; because after
Supper, they are more apt to be very
dull and sleepy, and thereby less fit for
such a performance. God is not to be
served with the refuse of our Thoughts,
and with sluggish sleepy Desires; but
with our best and most lively Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and with the strength and fervour
of our desires.</p>
               <p>You are to prevent their omitting
their Prayers at any one time; because
doing so once or twice, they are apt
to neglect them wholly, or to return
to them with great aversness: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Custom and Constancy in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Devotions, will make them
much more easie and pleasant to them.</p>
               <p>When they are possessed with more
perfect and solid thoughts about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
with stronger and more lively
impressions of Divine things, and are
able without great difficulty to express
the sense of their Souls; They may do
what they find serves best the great
purposes of Devotion: If praying
without restraining themselves to any
particular Form of Words, contribute
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56224:29"/>
more to their Fervency and Elevation
of Mind in Prayer, let them pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
using a Form: But, if they find
that their Minds are more stayed and
fixed, and their Fervency and Devotion
greater in the use of a Form than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, let them do that which they
find best.</p>
               <p>When they pray for outward and
temporal things, teach them to do it
with an entire submission to the Will
of God, who hath promised perishing
things conditionally, that is, so far as
he sees the bestowing of them will be
for his Glory, and the good of his
Children: Therefore they must not be
peremptory, vehement, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their desires and Prayers for
such things, but ought to pray for them
with great Humility and Resignation to
the Divine Will.</p>
               <p>As for spiritual Blessings, to wit,
the pardon of Sin, the direction and
assistance of the Spirit of God, his
Grace to help them in time of need,
power and strength to fight against
the Devil, the World, and the Flesh,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things are to be prayed for
with all the importunity and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is possible. The more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56224:29"/>
and fervent their desires and
Prayers are for such things, the more
acceptable are they to God, and the
more likely to obtain from him the
desires of their Souls; for he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
<hi>to satisfie the longing Soul with
good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is the Duty of Parents to teach
their Children to pray Morning and
Evening, so they ought to teach them,
always to bless God before and after
Meals. You ought at first, when they
begin to speak, to cause them to say
after you, or after those who attend
them, two or three words, before and
after Meat. And when they come to
greater Capacity, teach them a larger
Form. This will, in due time, be a
means to excite in their Minds a Sense
of the power and goodness of God, of
their dependance upon him for all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, both for Soul and Body,
and of their own weakness and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>

them in those things which are apt to

should obey. Accustom them, now
and then, to a refusal of what they
would have, especially when you see
them too eager to have it. This you
may do in small matters, which they

means you will prepare them to bear
with a refusal in things of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(which are either inconvenient
for them to have, or for you to give)
and to be willing to have them, or
want them, as you shall think fit.</p>
               <p>If once this Foundation is laid, it
will make the rest of your work a great
deal more easie, in the Education of
your Children. If you once take their
will from them, you may then do with
them what you please. But if, instead
of this, you gratifie them in whatever
they have a mind to, and suffer them
to live according to their own Will and
Humour, whether it be right or wrong,
you may then expect, that when they
are grown up, they will improve to
their own hurt and your grief, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Liberty they had when they were

their own will, so now they will do

for doing so: But if you find them in

especially if they have done it oftner

of those, who have said ill of them;
for this were to feed and cherrish their

Words and Actions: Any body who
has but Wit enough, to find out their
Temper, may very easily make a prey
of them, and by false Relations, and
cunning Insinuations, may occasion their
saying and doing a great many things,
very hurtful to themselves or others,
or at least very silly and impertinent,
which will expose them to a great deal
of Contempt and Scorn. Parents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ought to look upon it as a matter
of no small importance, to preserve
their Children from being too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
they ought to Teach them to
enquire into the Truth of what is
spoken, and to consider who the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is that speaketh. For if it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that he who speaketh, is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
given to Lying, and that he
makes no Conscience of his words; it
is so far from being a fault, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him; that, on the contrary, 'tis
a piece of very great silliness, to make
any account of what he says, until it be

therefore your Duty, to prevent all

the Company of one another, to be
mightily concerned for one another's
Happiness and Welfare, to be upon all
occasions ready to help and assist one
another, to sympathize very tenderly
with one another, in any Pain, Grief,

manner, to tell one another of their
Faults, without publishing of them. Do
not encourage them to speak ill of one

Righteous Judgment, doth often punish
with some remarkable stroke, such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Persons, who presume to enquire
into those things which he has thought
fit to conceal from them: 'Tis said of
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 13, 14. That, <hi>he died
for his Transgression, and also for asking
Counsel of one that had a familiar Spirit,
to enquire of it, and enquired not of the

they who have been guilty of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Enquiries, shall be delivered from
Eternal Condemnation, and possibly
from some great punishments in this
Life, if they sincerely Repent of their
Sin, and Folly; yet oftentimes, they
suffer not a little from the impressions
which are made on their fancy, by their
having heard that some Tragical thing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56224:41"/>
or other should befall them. How
many, even good People, having found
unspeakable uneasiness, almost all their
Life time, only by having heard it said,
without their own asking, by such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
pretenders to Divination, that
thus or thus it should happen to them:
Tho' they abhorred and despised such
things, and did what they could to be
delivered from having any Reflections
upon them, yet now and then, of a

               <p>From all which, it appears, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is for Parents, to prevent
their Childrens doing such things. Shew
them, that their only safe way, is, to
be always careful to do what is good
and right, to make the Laws of God
their Rule, to seek his Glory as their
chief end, to depend on him for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and assistance, never to be anxious
about what is to come, but to leave all
Events to his Wise and Good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
humbly to resign themselves to
his Holy Will and Pleasure, and to be
always ready to be disposed of as he
shall see fit. Tell them, (which you
may do with great assurance) that if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56224:42"/>
they do these things, they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that all shall be well; for God
will not fail, according to his Promise,
to make all things, even the greatest
Afflictions, work together for good to
them that Love him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
               <p>If you perceive them to

take notice of those who
help and assist them, and
who have done them, or
are always ready to do them good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
endeavour to cure them of this
very ill Quality. Cause them to thank
those who are kind and serviceable to
them; strive to make them retain a
lasting Sense of Kindnesses, and to be
ready when there is an opportunity,
to make some fit acknowledgment and
return: For which end, 'twill be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
now and then, to give them
some small matter, according to your

have been at some pains to serve them,
or who have been very Bountiful or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
to them. And when they make
an acknowledgment for Favors received,
advise them to do it with a chearful
Countenance, so as to express thereby
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56224:42"/>
the inward Sense of their Minds, that
they, to whom they make the return
of Kindness, may see how hearty and
real they are, that they do it, not grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
but very willingly.</p>
               <p>There is the greater need, to instil
into your Childrens Minds, Principles
of Gratitude, because 'tis so very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongst Men to be unthankful.
For, what is there more common, than
to see those neglected and slighted, who
have been very kind and serviceable?
How many root up those, by whom
themselves have been planted? How
many basely betray their truest Friends
and greatest Benefactors? How many
think it a disparagement, to be so much
as thought to be beholden to others,
tho' their Obligations be very great?
Now, what can there be more base and
abominable, than such a Temper as this?
What Villany and Wickedness seem
they not likely to commit, who have
no Sense of Benefits? The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
reckoneth unthankfulness amongst the
great Sins, which make the last days
perilous and difficult. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2.</p>

worst things you could say of them, to
call them unthankful<note n="*" place="margin">Dixeris maledicta cuncta cum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem dixeris.</note>;
they reckoned that this
Name, included all the bad
things that could be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that unthankfulness was
the Fountain, from whence
the greatest Vices did spring. See
<hi>Sen. de Benef.</hi> l. 1. c. 10.</p>

who were over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

taught them Gratitude; so that if any
of the Boys was able to make a grateful

him severely; for they judged, that
they who were unthankful, would also
neglect their Duty to God, to their
Parents, their Country, and Friends.</p>

them more cautious and circumspect;
to reflect and think a little more, on
what they say and do; lest otherwise,
they fall into a habit of speaking and
acting impertinently and indiscreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
When they say or do a foolish
thing, for lack of consideration, then
take occasion to make them sensible
what a shame it is for them to do so;
what a reproach to those who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creatures, to speak and act
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56224:45"/>
like Fools without Reason and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
Shew them some of the bad
consequences which attend speaking and
acting in this manner. Particularly,
that such Persons not only expose
themselves to Contempt and Scorn,
but likewise to a great deal of danger
and trouble. Tell them, how a great
many, by their rash and unadvised,
though not ill intended, Speeches and
Actions, have not only highly exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
their Enemies, but also provoked
their Friends, and forfeited their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which thereby has been changed
sometimes into the utmost Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Hatred. Shew them, how
some, by this means, have lost their
Estate, their Honour, and Life it self:
and not only have ruined themselves
by their rashness and folly, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a great many of their best Friends
and dearest Relations. A due sense
of these things ought to excite all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to do what they can, to render
their Children very considerate and
wary in whatever they say or do.
And because, for lack of knowledge
and experience, they are in hazard to
fall into many miscarriages, and to
commit great absurdities, if they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56224:46"/>
themselves wholly by their own
fancy and apprehension, or by their
inclinations and desires, therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them to ask you, or to ask o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whom you recommend to them,
whether it be fit for them to do this
or that, which they have a mind to
do. It will be of unspeakable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to them all their Life long, to
learn this piece of Wisdom betimes,
to wit, to be jealous, and not too
confident of their own Apprehensions
and Opinions, and to have a great
regard for the Judgment and Opinion
of others. <hi>Solomon</hi> makes this a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
Mark betwixt a wise Man
and a Fool, that <hi>the way of a Fool is
right in his own Eyes,</hi> (and therefore
he scorns to ask the opinion, or to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the advice of others;) <hi>but he
that hearkeneth unto Counsel is wise.</hi>
Prov. 12. 15.</p>
               <p>Thus you are to make it your Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to watch over your Children,
and to consider what are their defects
and faults, and to do all that you can
to cure them thereof, and to direct
them in the ways of Wisdom and
Virtue. You are careful to pluck up
the weeds in your Gardens, while they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56224:46"/>
are yet young, and not deeply rooted,
lest otherwise the good Seeds should be
choak'd up with them. How much
more careful ought you to be, lest
the Souls of your Children should be
over-run with vicious Qualities?</p>
               <p>If your Childrens Limbs are crooked

and sometimes at no small charge like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
so long as there is hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
to make them straight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Ought you not to be at as much
pains at least for their Souls? Ought you
not to do what in you lies, to shape and
frame them to Virtue and Piety, that
they may become amiable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

their Children by immoderate kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
they cannot endure that they

They are afraid, lest they that teach

               <p>'Tis true, some, who have the

in correcting them, they pass
beyond all Bounds of Moderation; and
by their Tyrannical carriage towards
them, they do them a World of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in many respects. As for such
School-Masters, Parents ought, if it
be possible, to avoid sending of their
Children unto them. But when once
they have made choice of those, who
are not only Pious, but Wise and
Discreet Persons, who are skilful in the
way of Teaching, and are of a calm
and mild Spirit; they ought to be so
far from restraining them, that they
should rather encourage them to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

Now, to stir up Parents to take care
their Children be taught to read, at
least the Holy Bible; let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that this Sacred Book will instruct
them in the Art of being happy; how
to be saved; how to obtain a Crown of
Glory; how to purchase an enduring
Substance, a Pearl of great price, and
a Kingdom which cannot be shaken:
It will teach them true Wisdom; how
to avoid Sin, and to escape Danger;
how to resist the Devil, to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Wiles, to quench his fiery
Darts; how to overcome the World,
and to mortifie the Flesh with its Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Lusts; how to subdue
their natural Corruption, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
all their wicked Habits and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms;
how to redeem the time; how
to carry themselves as they ought to
do in their several Capacities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
wherein God hath placed them
in the World; how to enjoy satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and contentment in every state
and condition of Life; How to use
aright the things of this World; how
to improve Prosperity, and how to
reap advantage from Adversity; how
to dwell at ease, and to enjoy real
Peace and Comfort amidst the greatest
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56224:49"/>
Vexations and Confusions that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
All these things the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will teach both you and them,
if they are read as they ought to be,
to wit, with a serious and humble
mind, with an earnest desire to know
the Will of God, and with a firm and
sincere Resolution to do it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
how careful ought you to be, in
so considerable a part of your duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Children? If your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World is such, as disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
you from doing much for them
as to their outward Estate, yet if you
do this, it may prove (unless it be
their own fault) of unspeakable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to them, and, in some sense, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a great Portion, or than a
gainful Trade, as may appear from
what has been said.</p>
               <p>When once they can read tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
well in the Holy Bible, be careful
that they do it more or less every day:
See that they do it with great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as being the Word of God:
Cause them to consider who it is that
speaketh to them therein; and what it
is that he commands, promises, or
threatens; direct them at first to read
such places, as are most easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56224:49"/>
and which are apt to make
the deepest Impressions: After they
have read, see what they remember;
cause them to tell you what they can
call to mind: Explain to them so far
as you are able, what they do not
know; especially in such things as are
most useful to make them wiser and
better. Appoint them now and then a
verse or two, to get by heart; cause
them to repeat them with due Gravity;
let them not do it in a trifling manner,
as if they were telling a silly Story. Do
not appoint them too many things to
be got by heart, for this will do more
hurt than good: A few things well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
do better than a great many
by rote.</p>
               <p>Be careful lest they read
any Books which tend to
poyson their minds,<note place="margin">Great care ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what Books they read.</note> to fill
them with false Opinions,
or to lead them to bad pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices:
Their tender minds are apt very
quickly to be corrupted by such Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises.
Even they who are of a more
fixed and solid Virtue, are in danger
of receiving hurt by reading such
Books; especially when they are writ
with great Art, and when their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56224:50"/>
are represented in fair and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Colours; They are apt to impress
on the Fancy some Images of no good
consequence to the Soul: How great
need therefore have Parents to restrain
their Children from reading such Books
as tend to pollute their innocent and
chaste minds, which are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any sort of impressions either
good or bad?</p>
               <p>As for Books of Devotion; great
care is to be taken, that only such be
put into their hands as are writ in a
plain and easie style; which treat of
things fit and needful to be known by
them; and which are most likely to
make them Wise and Good. They are
to be accustomed to the Writings of
those who are Men of greatest Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
who do not impose their own
conceits, as necessary Rules of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
who do not require such things
as absolutely needful to be done, which
God hath not declared to be so; nor
yet who shorten the Rule, by cutting
off such things as God hath injoyned
us: All Books which lead Men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
are carefully to be avoided;
and such Treatises are to be made use
of, as contain the plain and necessary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56224:50"/>
Doctrines of Christianity; which tend
to inspire Men with the Spirit of Purity,
of Truth, of Peace and Love; which
promote Sincerity, Justice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Charity, Meekness, Humility,
Patience, Resignation to the Will of
God in all things, Zeal for his Honour
and Glory, a firm Belief and Trust in
him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When it is requisite to acquaint them
with the different Opinions amongst
Protestants, that their minds may not
be unfixed and unsettled, when they go
abroad into the World; be sure not to
put into their hands such Tracts as are
writ with a fiery uncharitable Spirit,
and in a Dogmatick and Magisterial
manner; but such as are writ with
great Temper and Moderation; which
tend to heal the Church of all Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Divisions, and not to kindle
and increase them; which do not load
Mens Opinions with unjust, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
and impious consequences, which
never entred into the minds of those
who vouched them; but such as make
fair and favourable Constructions, and
just allowances. Such Treatises are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be chosen for them, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Men to be humble and modest;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56224:51"/>
not to be stiff and pertinacious in their
own private Sentiments; not rashly
and severely to condemn others who
have different thoughts; and never on
the account of any such particular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
to break the Peace of Christian
Society; nor to grow more cold in
their respect and affection towards
those who have not the same thoughts
with themselves in lesser matters.
They are, as it were, to feed upon
Books of this sort, and carefully to
digest them.</p>

how a great many, who have

1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 13. When the Persons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in Divine Ministraitons are loved
and esteemed, their Doctrine is apt to
make the greater Impression, and to be
the more successful: Whereas, if People
are prejudic'd against them, tho' never
so unjustly, what they say will be
slighted, or very little regarded for
most part, even tho' what is spoken
be most excellent in it self, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56224:53"/>
in such a manner, as might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
very much affect and excite
the dullest Hearers. The Truth of
this, did not only appear in the Holy
Prophets, but in our most Blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Himself, who, tho' <hi>He spake as
never Man spake,</hi> yet what He said was
but very little regarded by most part
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ev'n by his own
Brethren and Kinsmen, who were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with most unjust and groundless
prejudices against him. The Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this, ought to make you
Careful, to beget in your Children a
due Sense of the Dignity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Pastoral Office, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a just value for the Persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whom God makes use of to
Minister unto Him in Holy Things,
whom He calls to be the Guides of
Souls <hi>and Stewards of the Mysteries of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Men have a great Respect for
Ministers of State, and for the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
of Earthly Princes, who are
employ'd to manage the Concerns of
the Kingdoms or Principalities of this
World; shall they account the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Ambassadors of Jesus Christ,
unworthy of the least regard and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56224:54"/>
Whom the King of Kings and
Lord of Lords, hath chosen out of
the rest of Mankind, and whom He
hath set apart for His own immediate
Service, to publish His Will, and to
offer Life and Salvation to the Sons of
Men, to rescue them from their evil
Courses, to direct them what they
must do to be saved, and to shew
them, not only by their Doctrine but
Example, the way wherein they ought
to go.</p>
               <p>And tho' some of those who are
of this sacred Employment, are far
from being what they should, yet you
must be careful what you say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them before your Children; you
ought to keep from their Knowledge,
such faults and blemishes as are not
obvious and notorious. Beware of
taking occasion of reproaching them,
and thinking meanly of them, for their
Infirmities. And when their miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
are very heinous and such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be concealed, you ought to take
care, not to aggravate them or make
them worse, but to speak of them so,
as your Children may see, you are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Enemies to their Vices, and not to
their Persons or Holy Office.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56224:54"/>
That you may fortifie your Children
against the danger they are in from
such sad Examples, shew them, that
our Holy Religion is not the worse,
because some of those who are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
do not live suitably to their Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Profession; that it is Men (the
best of whom are Imperfect and Sinful,
and subject to the like Passions with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
and not Angels, who are put by
God in the Office of the Ministry:
That amongst the twelve Apostles of
our Blessed Master and Saviour, one of
them was a Thief and a Traitor; that
the Holy Doctrine which such Persons
Preach, is not in it self the less excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and worthy of acceptation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is delivered by those who do
not live as they Preach; that there
were many such Teachers in the days
of our Saviour, and yet he for had not
the <hi>Jews</hi> to hear them, only he gave
them a caution to beware of their ill
Example. <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees,</hi>
says he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 2, 3. <hi>sit in Moses
Seat, and therefore whatever they bid you
observe, that observe and do; but do not
ye after their Works, for they say, and
do not.</hi>

I thought it so much the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to suggest this Direction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis none of the least Sins of this
Age and Kingdom, that too many are
very apt to despise and speak ill of
the Ministers of Jesus Christ; to listen
to all Reports which are to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
to believe them too readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to repeat them in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and even before their Children
with a great deal of pleasure. And
there want not those who have a very
fruitful Invention on this Subject, who
contrive a great many Stories, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatter
them, and to lessen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their Reputation; whereby they
too successfully promote the Kingdom
of Satan, and shew themselves to be
his Ministers. When once the great
Enemy of Souls has gain'd this point,
to make the Persons of Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
'twill be no hard matter for
him to make Men undervalue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the very Office it self: And what
can be the consequence of this, but the
rise and growth of Heresies, of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Schisms, of Atheism and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion,
and of all that can be thought
of, that is any way dishonourable to
God, and destructive to the Souls of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56224:55"/>
Men? Of all which there are but too
many sad Instances at this day, which
are a most certain Evidence of the
great decay of real Piety and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and that there is but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of true Religion to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us.</p>
               <p>And as this so common Contempt of
the Clergy is a sign of the great Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of the Age, so it is a Presage of
heavy Judgments. When <hi>the Messengers

used on such an occasion, it is a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
which might be of marvellous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
in the Church; both to stir up
Parents to instruct their Children, and
Ministers to Chatechise them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with those things that are
needful for them to know, to believe,
and to do. The careful and Religious
use of it, would tie Children more
strictly to mind the great concerns of
their Souls; it would afford them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to consider what it is to have
been Baptised, and to be a Christian:
It would work in them a more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sense of the Obligations of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
and make them more careful to
live up to that Holy Religion, whereof
they made so publick a Profession: It
would make them more afraid to do
bad things, against which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
so solemnly. And not only fear,

would not so boldly ask them to sin,
if they knew they had openly and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
disowned and renounced them,
and all their wicked Courses; and if
they were tempted, they would be
more apt to say in their own minds,
Shall we do such wicked things, and
run the hazard of being Covenant-breakers,
and Perjured Persons? Shall
we commit such Villanies, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
such Abominations, and thereby
break our Solemn Vow and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Shall we by our Folly and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety

would this be to your Children,
when Assaulted by the fiery Darts of
the Devil, the Vanities of the World<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and the Lusts of their own Deceitful

these, and given up themselves into
the Hands of God, to be kept by his
Mighty Power, through Faith unto

they ought to perform it, to keep his

               <p>These things being impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,

unclean thing can enter? Do you not
desire that their Sins may be blotted
out, that they may be washed with the
Blood of their Saviour? And yet do
you not advise and entreat them, for

two Months, or once a Quarter at least;

Great and Rich, ought so much the
more frequently, to call upon their

Excrcises of Devotion, because
their outward Estate in the World does,
ordinarily, afford them enough of time

they will but redeem it from Idleness,

and from a great many vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary

               <p>As to their Abstinence from Food on

they may eat less at a time, and of such

               <p>It will be convenient, in order to their

to a method, that so their thoughts
may not wander and be unfixed: For

have the direction of their Minister, if

of Spirit.</p>
               <p>There is not any one method can be
prescribed for all Persons, nor fit for
all times: But in general, upon such
days, it's fit for them to begin with
Prayer to God, humbly begging the
Divine Assistance and Direction; that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56224:60"/>
he would open their Eyes, to see their
Sin and Folly, and to discover his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Kindness, his long Suffering and
Patience towards them, that they may
be thereby led to Repentance.</p>
               <p>They may next enquire particularly
and strictly into their ways and doings;
which they may do, by considering what
have been their Thoughts, their Words
and Deeds; each of which they are to
examine according to the Rule of God's
Word: Or, (which comes to the same
thing) they may go over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and see wherein they have
broken any of them: Wherein they find
themselves Guilty, they are with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Sorrow and inward Contrition,
to confess it, to mourn for it, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to beg Forgiveness of God; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
with full purpose of Heart, to
do so no more; but to cease from Evil,
and to learn to do well. They are to
consider what Temptations they are
most in danger of; that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
them: They are also to consider
what course they must take, and what
Christian methods they must use, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
their Evil Inclinations and

resolve to govern themselves according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56224:60"/>
and sincerely to endeavour to go
on unto Perfection.</p>
               <p>After this, they may reflect on the
kind Providences they have met with;
that their Souls may be filled with a
grateful Sense thereof; that they may
return all Praise and Thanks to God
for his Mercy and Love; and may be
excited for the time to come, to trust
more firmly in him, and to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
               <p>They may particularly consider,
wherein God hath been pleased to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
their Prayers, and to grant them
the good things they have asked of
him for their Souls and Bodies, for
themselves or for others; that their
Piety and Love to God may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the more kindled, and their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
excited; that their Faith and Hope
may be made more strong and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>They may take notice likewise of
the Corrections and Chastisements,
wherewith God hath thought fit to
exercise them; that thereby they
may be awakened from Sin, and made
wiser and better for the time to come.</p>
               <p>It will be very useful for them to
have a Note in Writing of those vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

particulars; that they may on such
days review them, and with the more
ease make such Reflections on them, as
tend to their Improvement in real
Piety.</p>
               <p>Besides these Acts of Devotion,
which concern themselves immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
it will be fit on such days to make

They are next to consider, what may
be done by them for the Honour of God
and the good of Men; and are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to do some Act or other of Piety
or Charity, which may be of real Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to Mens Souls or Bodies.</p>
               <p>One thing more I shall mention,
which may be very useful on such days;
and that is, That they consider what
are the things wherein they desire more
earnestly the Divine Assistance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
which they may write down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
that they may renew their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
therein every day. And thereafter,
especially on such Days as they appoint
for more Solemn Reflection and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
they may consider what Answers
God has been pleased to afford them.</p>
               <p>These are a few General Heads on
this Subject, which may be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
in Order to the promoting of
true Devotion. But the designed brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Treatise does not permit the
enlarging upon them.</p>

they meet with, and to acquaint them
therewith in due time, as also with
some of the most remarkable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
which either they (to wit the
Parents) themselves, or others have
met with.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Consider what Providences
they meet with, what signal Mercies
and Favours their Merciful Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
upon them; what Dangers and
Hazards they have escaped; wherein
God's Kindness and Mighty Power has
appeared towards them, in preserving
them, and keeping them alive: Keep a
Note thereof in Writing; that so when
they come to Age, you may acquaint
them therewith, that they may therein
read the loving Kindness and tender
Mercies of the Lord, and his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Goodness and Favour towards them;
and may be excited to be thankful,
and to put their Trust and Confidence
in him, whose Mercies are over all his
Works.</p>
               <p>But, alas! How far are most Parents
from doing this? Very few do any such
thing for themselves; the Mercies of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56224:62"/>
God are renewed to them every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they live at his cost and charge,
he gives them richly all things to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
all their good things are from him
alone: But how little do they consider,
and take notice of the Hand of God, in
those many and great Benefits he loads
them with every hour and moment?
they do not reflect upon the great and
marvellous things that he does for them;
they live as if they were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
of God's Mercies and loving
Kindnesses; and no wonder, if they
take little thought to possess their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with any Impressions of that,
whereof they have no sense them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felves.</p>
               <p>But if Parents did, as they ought,
acquaint their Children with God's
Providences towards them in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
and in the days of their Youth,
when they were not so capable themselves
to reflect thereupon, it would have a
great force upon Ingenuous minds, to stir
in them Pious and Religious Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It would likewise very much serve
this end, if Parents would often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on God's kind Providences to

selves, and now and then
talk<note n="*" place="margin">

Children, and acquaint
them sometimes with one
Instance of God's care
and kindness towards
them, and sometimes with
another; this would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
make an Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on tender minds, and
in due time might bring
forth good Fruits.</p>
               <p>Shew your Children therefore, How
God was pleased to provide for you,
when you were in great necessity and
want; How he raised up Friends to
help you, in the day of your Distress;
How he preserved you from Danger;
How he delivered you out of many
and great Afflictions and Troubles:
How he comforted you in the days of
your mourning; How he raised you up,
when you were brought very low; How
he defeated the designs of your malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Adversaries; How he disposed a
great many uneasie and afflictive things,
sometimes for your Temporal, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56224:63"/>
for your Spiritual Advantage;
How he assisted and seconded your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to serve him, with great and
unexpected Success; How he rewarded
and blessed you, when you did those
things which were good and right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; And how he punished and
chastened you, when you omitted your
Duty, or did and said a bad and wicked
thing; How he heard your Prayers,
and Granted you the desires of your
Souls; How he prevented you with his
loving Kindness and tender Mercy;
How he satisfied your longing Souls
with good things; And how he deals
with you, exceeding abundantly above
all that you could think or ask. In this
manner, according as you have met
with particular Instances of the good
and kind Providence of God, you
ought, at some times, when you find
it most likely to do good, to talk
thereof to your Children, that thereby
they may be awakened to observe and
consider the Powerful, Just, Wise, and
Kind Providence of God; and may be
excited, together with you, to bless his
Holy Name, for his great, his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and undeserved Love towards
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56224:64"/>
You ought also, to discourse some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to them, concerning some of the
most Signal Instances of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards others, which either you
have observed your selves, or which
you have received an account of from
Persons of very good Authority: For
Example,</p>
               <p>Shew them, how God has brought
down proud and lofty Persons, when
their Hearts were lifted up; How he
covered them with Shame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and made them Loathsome,
Vile, and Contemptible, almost to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body; And how he raised up
humble and lowly Persons; How he
followed them with the Expressions of
his Mercy and Love; How he turned
Peoples Hearts towards them, inclining
them to love and honour them, and to
do them many good and kind Offices.
This will tend to teach your Children
Humility, and to restrain them from
Pride and Self-conceit.</p>
               <p>Tell them, what has befallen many
Passionate and Impatient Men; How
they have run into the Pit of Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when they gave up themselves to
to the Conduct of their own violent
and unruly Passions; And how the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56224:64"/>
meek and patient Ones have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
assisted, and preserved by the
good Providence of God; And how
they have enjoyed a great deal of Peace,
Joy, and Happiness, amidst the many
Afflictions and Troubles they met with
in the World. This will tend to teach
them to be meek, to restrain their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and to beware of Impatience.</p>
               <p>Tell them, How God has punished
those who have got Wealth and Riches
by false, unjust, and indirect means;
How he has cursed their Estates, and
sent a moth into them, which has in
a short time insensibly wasted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
them; And how he hath blessed
the Estate and Substance of those, who
have got their Wealth by honest and
lawful means. This will tend to make
them honest and sincere in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the World, and to hate false
and crooked ways.</p>
               <p>Tell them, how God has punished
Cursers and Vain and False Swearers,
how the Curse has followed them,
how often it has happened to such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
according to their mad and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Imprecations.</p>
               <p>Tell them, how God, by very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
and surprising ways and

means, has discovered and cut off Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

               </p>
               <p>Tell them, how he has appeared,
sooner or later, in behalf of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

things do not produce their effect at the
very time when they are told, yet
some time or other they may catch

and have a very powerful and lasting
Influence upon them.</p>
               <p>The Example of Faithful <hi>Abraham</hi>

For this end did God acquaint him with
what he intended to do to <hi>Sodom,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew that he would improve
all his Providences, that he would not
smother them in his own Breast, but
acquaint his Children and Family there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
that thereby they also might
learn to be wiser and better; that they
might see the terribleness of the Divine
Justice against Incorrigible Sinners; and
his Infinite Compassion towards those who
fear and love him; that they might know
the Power and Efficacy of Prayer, and see
how ready the Lord is to hear all
those who call upon him in earnest,
not only for themselves, but also in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of others. <hi>And the Lord said,</hi>
(Gen. 18. 17.) <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<hi>that thing which I do?</hi> and v. 19.
<hi>For I know him, that he will command</hi>

                  <hi>Suitably to this Example, we find a

Deut. 4. 9, 10. Take heed to thy self,
and keep thy Soul diligently, lest thou
forget the things which thine Eyes have
seen, and left they depart from thine heart

all the days of thy Life; but teach them
thy Sons and thy Sons Sons: Especially
the day that thou stoodest before the Lord
thy God in <hi>Horeb, &amp;c. To the same
purpose we find a Direction given them
touching the Passover,</hi> Ex. 13. 8. Thou
shalt shew thy Son in that day, saying,
This is done because of that which the
Lord did unto me, when I came forth out
of <hi>Egypt, &amp;c. And v.</hi> 14. And it shall
be when thy Son asketh thee in time to
come, saying, What is this? <hi>(to wit,
that is said about setting apart unto
the Lord the First-born)</hi> That thou
shalt say unto him, by strength of Hand
the Lord brought us out from <hi>Egypt,</hi> from
the House of Bondage. And it came to pass
when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would hardly let us go, that
the Lord slew all the First-born in the
Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>â€”Therefore I Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to the Lord all that openeth the
Matrix, but all the First-born of my
Children I redeem. <hi>Likewise</hi> Josh. 4
6, 7. <hi>'Tis said,</hi> When your Children
ask their Fathers in time to come, saying,
What mean you by these Stones? Then
ye shall answer them, that the Waters of
<hi>Jordan</hi> were cut off before the Ark of the
Covenant of the Lord, when it passed over
<hi>Jordan.</hi>â€”And these Stones shall be

               <p>From all which it appears, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant

               <head>Some Directions to Parents, how to render
their Endeavours effectual.</head>
               <p>Now, to render your
Admonitions and all other
Endeavours effectual,<note place="margin">1. They must give their Children good Example.</note> for
the good of your Children;
<hi>First,</hi> you must give them
good Example; when you bid them
read, or pray, or partake of the Holy
Sacrament, or attend the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
you must (so far as is needful and
fit) do the same things your selves:
When you exhort them to be humble,
to be of a mild and gentle Temper,
to bear patiently uneasie things, to be
sober and temperate, to be Charitable
to the Poor, to judge favourably of
those who differ from them in small
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56224:67"/>
matters, not to be unkind or uncivil to
any, tho' they agree not in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them in some lesser points of
Religion, but to love all those who fear
and love God, and who are Followers
of Jesus Christ. I say, when you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and exhort your Children to do
such things, you must joyn with your
Instructions a suitable Example; let it
appear to them that you your selves
are Humble, Mild, Patient, Sober,
Charitable, Kind, and Loving to all
who are sincerely Pious and Virtuous,
without making any difference on the
account of Indifferent things, I mean
such things which God hath neither
commanded nor forbidden. This is
the only way to make your Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Admonitions successful, when
in this manner you go before them
your selves, in the way wherein you
desire them to walk.</p>
               <p>Children learn more by the Eye than
by the Ear, if they see you do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what you advise them, they will
be apt to think you do not believe
what you say; or that you are very
cruel and unmerciful towards them, to
bind heavy Burdens upon them, and
not to touch them your selves. And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56224:67"/>
if you should constrain your Children
to do what you do not your selves;
what would it signifie? It would only
make them Hypocrites and Dissemblers,
to do that which they have no Heart
unto, and which they are not perswaded
to be their Duty. Such Children,
when once the restraint and force
which is upon them is removed, will
be sure to give themselves the full
swing in all manner of Folly; they
will do those things which they have
seen in you, and learned by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>But if you shine before your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the constant Practice of true
Piety, walking in the Fear of God,
and in Obedience to all his Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
your Example will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
Religion more effectually than
all the Admonitions and Instructions in
the World. And besides, the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which your Pious Example is apt
to have on your Childrens lives, this
is the way for you to entail a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

Famous Author reports of
the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> 'Twas
their custom to make choice
of an Elderly Kinswoman, of whose
Probity and Discretion they had good
assurance, to whom they committed
the Charge of the Children. Her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
was to keep them from hearing
and seeing whatever tended to corrupt
their Manners; to direct them in such
little Studies and Exercises, as were
proper to their Years; and to see that
their Recreations and Divertisements
were harmless and innocent, and that
they were used and managed modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and inoffensively. This course <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi>
took, says this Author, with her
Sons the <hi>Gracchi, Aurelia</hi> with her Son
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Artia</hi> with her Son <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus.</hi>
The Fruit and Effect of which
Method was this, The Spirits of the
Children being kept pure and sincere,
straight and upright, they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made the more capable to receive
Noble and Excellent Impressions, which
way soever they applied their minds,
whether to Military Arts, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Laws, or the Study of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56224:70"/>
Eloquence. But now (says he, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Age in which he lived)
Children are entrusted to the care of
a <hi>Grecian</hi> Girl; and to one or other
of the Servants, of most base and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Qualities, by whose words and
actions they are quite spoiled and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ruined. Neither are there any
in the Family who make account what
they say or do before them: And no
wonder, says he, for the Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are so far from training them up
to Modesty and Probity, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom
them to Wantonness and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Liberty, by which means they
grow Impudent and Impetuous, in the
pursuit of their wild and foolish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and Inclinations.</p>
               <p>As this Rule of chusing
good company for Children,<note place="margin">Advice to Parents who send their Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</note>
is necessary to be followed
at all times, so especially
when Parents send their
Children into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
when they are fit to
Travel; how careful should they be
not to trust them to every body? But
to the Conduct of those who not only
may be useful to advance them in the
Knowledge of the World, to assist
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56224:70"/>
them in their Journeyings, to take care
about their Lodging and Diet, to wait
on them to visit great Men, to see fine
Places, curious Fabricks, Famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,
and Ancient Inscriptions, to
learn the Language of the Country,
and the different Modes and Fashions,
the Government and Policy, and such
like: But who likewise (through the
Blessing of God on their Endeavours,)
may preserve them from the Vices of
those Countries where they Travel;
from those bad Customs to which they
have a great Inclination: Who may
make it their business to season their
Minds with deeper and more lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Virtue; to possess them
with a mighty regard for such excellent
Examples as they have occasion now
and then to see; to Fortifie them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the many wicked and dangerous
Opinions and Practices they meet with;
to acquaint them chiefly with the
wisest and best Men, by whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
they may be improved in
Wisdom and Virtue; that they
may return into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with their Minds furnished with
useful Notions, with solid Principles,
and wise Observations; that they may
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56224:71"/>
be able either in a more private way,
or in a publick capacity, to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
not unworthy of those who have
had such good occasions for improving
themselves in those things which are
excellent.</p>
               <p>To serve this design, Parents are to
be careful of two things; <hi>One</hi> is, That
their Children Travel under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a Person who is wise and
prudent, and is of a sincere and solid
Piety: If he be one that is either Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
or Prophane and Atheistical, his
Company must needs be very hurtful
and dangerous; It may utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and have been happy in a
Religious Education. We see that a
straight Twig, tied to that which is
crooked, and stronger than it self,
grows crooked also.</p>
               <p>What an unaccountable thing is it
to think, that Men who are careful to
have a skilful Groom to look to their
Horses, should be so mad, as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their Children (who are their
chiefest Possession, and the principal
Objects of their care and kindness)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56224:71"/>
into the hands of those who have little
discretion, and less Piety?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing that Parents ought
to be careful of, in this matter, is,
That their Children do not Travel till
they are come to somewhat of stayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and solidity of Judgment; till
their Understanding and Discretion is
such, as may give ground to hope that
their Travelling shall do them no hurt,
but good. It is none of the wisest
parts in some Parents, to send their
Children too soon into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
before their Judgment is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and made fit to make useful Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Observations on the World;
before their minds are possessed with
solid Principles of Virtue, and with a
deep sense of Religion; so as not to
be in great danger from the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they are sure to meet with
in most places: Before they know any
thing at home, it is too soon to send
them abroad: Before they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a little, it is not advisable to
send them into the wide World, to
know a vast multitude of other things:
Hence it too often comes to pass, that
a great many return, after their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
greater Fools than they went;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56224:72"/>
they bring back nothing but a load <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
of you and them.</p>
               <p>In order to their Reformation, try
first all gentle Methods to make them
better: Endeavour to conquer them
with the Weapons of Kindness and
Affection; endeavour by Instructions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56224:72"/>
and Admonitions to make them sensible
of their Faults; Use Promises and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to allure them to do what
they ought; if these gentler Methods
do not succeed, 'tis fit to use Reproof,
to rebuke them sharply: <hi>Reproofs of
Instruction,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 6. 23.
<hi>are the way of Life.</hi> When Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are necessary, make use of them
likewise; and if they do not serve the
turn, then try the Rod; <hi>Chasten thy
Son,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>while
there is hope, and let not thy Soul spare
for his crying.</hi> And <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. 24. he
saith, <hi>He that spareth his Rod, hateth his
Son, but he that loveth him, Chasteneth
him betimes.</hi> But let this be always the
last Remedy, after you have in vain
attempted their Reformation by milder
and gentler Methods. And when you
use Severity, do it with due moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not exceeding the Quality of the
Fault: Beware of using great Severity,
when the Fault is very small and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable.
Respect must also be had
to the Age, Temper, and Disposition
of your Children; if they are very
young and tender, your Correction
must be the more gentle and moderate;
and if they are of a flexible and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56224:73"/>
Temper, you must be the more
Favourable towards them.</p>
               <p>Beware of correcting them when you
find your Anger very hot, for then you
are apt to do more hurt than good.
Your Passion will hurry you, if you
restrain it not, into somewhat or other
very wicked, as well as indiscreet; it
will make you do and say a great many
things very unworthy of a Christian.
Always therefore be careful, that your
Reason, and not your Passion, direct
you in so important a matter as this is<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>f once you fall into the rough, severe,
and violent Method of dealing with
your Children, there are a great many
Disadvantages will attend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> You discourage your Children,
you break their Spirits, you make them
unfit for any useful thing; you tempt
them to do such things as are hurtful to
themselves, and may prove grievous to
you. If <hi>Oppression makes a wise Man mad;</hi>
'tis no wonder if a Child, or young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
is sadly disordered, and made half
mad by cruel and tyrann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>l usage: Tho' it
be a Fault in Children to be so; yet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ought to be careful not to provoke
them overmuch to wrath, by a severe,
unmerciful carriage towards them. 'Tis
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56224:73"/>
not the less important and true, because
it is a common Observation, to wit,
That a tender Sprig which grows crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may be made straight by little and
little, if you bend it and handle it gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but if you bend it with great Force
and Violence, you may quickly break
it. Thus it is with Children general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who discover very early somewhat
of crookedness in their Nature, which
is increased by evil Example; if you
use mild and gentle Methods to reform
them, temper'd now and then, as need
shall require, with a little severity,
there is hopes, that, by degrees, they
will be reformed, and made straight;
but if, instead of this moderate course,
you use cruel Methods, and deal rigidly
and unmercifully with them, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect any other, but that their
Spirits should be broken or hardened,
and so lose all sense of Ingenuity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You kindle your own Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you disorder your minds, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
your selves to a fiery Temper, you
become fierce, barbarous, and savage;
whereby you turn one of your great
Temporal Comforts into a grievous
Cross, and heavy Burden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56224:74"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You hereby likewise teach
your Children, through your Example,
to be of a passionate and violent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and so you do them more hurt,
than all your Corrections and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can do them good: Never think to
cure them of their Faults, by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
as bad your selves: <hi>You must
not do evil that good may come of it:
The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You make your Children
care less for your Corrections, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they would do: When you
are always beating them in your Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and tormenting them, they must
needs think, that you do so, not so
much for any Fault they are guilty of,
as because you are very passionate, and
therefore must give your Passion a vent
one way or other.</p>
               <p>If therefore you would chasten your
Children to good purpose, do it when
your Spirits are cool, when your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is at hand to direct you, and to
keep you within bounds, and not when
you have lost your selves, by being
under the Power of a violent Passion.</p>
               <p>If you are careful to follow this
Christian Method, you may then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56224:74"/>
that God's kind Providence will
second you in your Endeavours for
reforming your Children. Either they
will grow better; or however, you
will find Peace and Comfort, when in
this manner you govern your selves by
the Laws of Religion, and are not led
by your unruly Passion.</p>
               <p>That Parents may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perform their Duty in
correcting their Children,<note place="margin">Parents ought in correcting their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>
they ought to observe and
imitate the Example of our
Heavenly Father, who, tho'
<hi>whom he loveth, he chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
Heb. 12. 6. <hi>yet he
doth not afflict willingly, nor
grieve the Children of Men.</hi> Lam. 3. 33.
He does not make use of the Rod, but
when it is necessary, when his Mercy
and Kindness do not prevail. And
when he does correct, in the midst
of Wrath, he remembreth Mercy.
<hi>When he visits the Transgressions of his
Children, with the Rod, and their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
with Stripes: Nevertheless, his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Kindness he does not take utterly
from them, nor suffer his Faithfulness to
fail.</hi> Ps. 89. 32, 33. He is always ready
to receive his penitent Children, to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56224:75"/>
have Mercy upon them. <hi>He does not
keep his Anger for ever.</hi> A due Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of these things will direct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
how to correct their Children
both as to Time and Measure.</p>
               <p>To what hath been said, it
will not be unfit to add,<note place="margin">Parents must be careful not to oppose one another, when they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rrect and reprove their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>
That, to render Reproof,
and Correction the more
effectual, it is necessary that
both Parents concur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
not as if it were prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for them both together,
or one after another, to
reprove or chasten their Children,
for the same Fault, for this would be
rather very improper for the most
part: But when one of the Parents
chides of corrects their Children, the
other ought so far to concur, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what is done, and shew their
displeasure towards those Children who
have done that which deserves Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They must not oppose one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in this matter; when one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves,
the other must not approve
and commend; when one condemns,
the other must not justifie; when one
endeavours to correct, the other must
not hinder it; Otherwise, the Children
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56224:75"/>
will be lost; for it is not likely they will
amend their Faults, if they see that either
of their Parents is their Patron, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and defend them, or to excuse and
extenuate what they do amiss. They who
are wise Parents, ought to be so far from
doing this, that tho' one of them should
happen to reprove or chasten a Child
when there is no very great necessity for
so doing, yet the other Parent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Father or Mother, ought to conceal
their present thoughts, and wait a fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to discourse the matter together,
that such unnecessary Reproofs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements
may be prevented for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If Parents do not carefully observe
this Rule, their Children will be sure to
take notice of their Indiscretion, and to
make a very bad use of it, so as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
their reproofs and chastenings,
when they are more just and necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When it
pleaseth God to visit
them with sickness,<note place="margin">4. They must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improve the Time of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Sickness, or of any other affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they meet with, towards the making of them wiser and better.</note> or
any other adversity;
be sure to do all that
you can, to bear in upon
their minds, a sense of
those things you are
most desirous to have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56224:76"/>
them touched with, and which in time
of their health they made but very
little account of. Affliction is the time,
in which God useth to work upon the
hearts of People most powerfully and
effectually; then he awakeneth them,
and convinceth them of their sad and
dangerous state; he casts them down,
that being made sensible of their sin and
danger, he may again raise them up, and
speak comfortably to them. <hi>I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure

and speak comfortably to her, Hos.</hi>
2. 4. Therefore all they who sincerely
desire to reclaim their Children, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
from their bad and foolish courses,
ought to take the opportunity of their
Sickness, their Pain and Grief, their
Losses and Disappointments, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other sorts of Troubles and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
wherein they are, that then they
may suggest to them such counsels and
advices as are proper for their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
their conviction and amendment.
At other times, there are a great many
things which are apt to hinder good
Counsel from entring into the mind,
or from making any deep impression
thereon; Pleasures and Vanities are apt
to choak the good Seed: But when
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56224:76"/>
they are afflicted, and humbled a little
by some outward pressure, or bodily
distemper; they are thereby somewhat
better disposed to hear Friendly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
and Counsels, and to think
a little more seriously of their ways and
doings. <hi>It is good for a Man that he

               <p>When it hath pleased God to restore
your Children to health, or to deliver
them from any other Affliction, fail not
to put them in mind of their afflicted
Estate, and of God's goodness towards
them when they were in adversity:
Endeavour to make them sensible for
what end God hath been so kind to
them, to wit, that they may amend
their Lives, and bring forth Fruits
meet for Repentance. Strive to keep
them mindful of their Purposes and
Resolutions, and press them to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of them. Stir them up to be
thankful to God for his Mercy, and to
be very watchful, lest Satan prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Be earnest in
your Prayers to God
daily for them;<note place="margin">5. They must daily pray to God for them.</note> that he
would make them what
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56224:77"/>
he requires them to be, his dutiful and
obedient Children and Servants; that
he would give them his Holy Spirit to
sanctifie and cleanse them, to enlighten
and direct them, and to assist and
strengthen them; that he would sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
their Hearts with his Fear and
Love; that he would turn them from
Sin and Folly; and incline their Hearts
to keep his Precepts always, even unto
the end; that he would hold up their
goings in his Paths, that their footsteps
may not slide; that he would be their
God and Guide, their Sun and Shield,
and their Portion for ever; that he
would give every one of them those
things which be best and most needful
for them; that he would Sanctifie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
State and Condition of Life,
wherein his Providence doth place
them. If they are in a healthful and
prosperous State, pray to God to make
them sensible of, and thankful for his
undeserved goodness, and that he
would preserve them from the snares
and dangers to which Prosperity does
expose them. You see what was <hi>Job</hi>'s
constant course at the end of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Feasting. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>He sent and
Sanctified them, and rose up early in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56224:77"/>
Morning, and Offered burnt Offerings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of them all. For
he said, it may be my Sons have sinned,
and cursed God in their Hearts,</hi> &amp;c.
Again, if they are in Sickness, or any
other Adversity; beg of God to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
their Afflictions, to make them
blessed and happy means of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
or of their Improvement
in true Piety.</p>
               <p>When you are about to instruct, to
admonish, to reprove, or to correct
your Children, pray to God to direct
you by his good Spirit, to do your
Duty in an acceptable manner; and
that he would incline and dispose them
to their Duty, and make them Gainers
by what you do or say for their good.
'Tis not always necessary for you, in
every particular Admonition or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which you use towards your
Children, to make a Solemn Prayer,
by retiring into your Closet; this
ought to be done upon extraordinary
Occasions; but ordinarily, it will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
if you lift up your Hearts unto
God, in a short and fervent Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for his Direction and Blessing in
what you are to do or say to your
Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:56224:78"/>
You have great encouragement to
do this; because you are assured that
God heareth Prayer; he hath said, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that asketh, receiveth.</hi> So that
either he will grant your Children
what you beg for them, or if they
render themselves unworthy of the
Mercy and Kindness of God, by their
perverseness and stubbornness; yet
you are sure of one thing, that your
Prayers are not lost; they shall return
into your Bosom: God will plentifully
reward your Piety, your Charity, and
Zeal, with more Grace here, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now if it be the Duty
of Parents,<note place="margin">Against those who curse their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> in this manner,
to pray for their Children,
what shall be said of those,
who, instead of praying for
their Children, curse them, and use
fearful Imprecations against them!
How dreadful a thing is it for those to
whom it belongs to bless their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
instead of doing this, to curse
them! How unnatural a thing is it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of contributing to their Happiness,
to do their utmost to make them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
miserable! 'Tis true, some Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are very perverse and wicked,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56224:78"/>
guilty of great stubbornness and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and of great contempt aud neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of their Parents: But yet for all
this, Parents ought never to give over
praying for them; and if at any time,
their Passion and discontent occasion in
their minds any thing that looks like
a tendency to evil wishes or Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against their Children, let them
with as great care endeavour to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
therefrom, as they would from
Fire, if it broke forth in their Houses.
And indeed, if they who have the
worst Children, did but consider what
woful Effects do often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
such rash curses<note n="â€ " place="margin">The Blessing of the Father Establisheth the Houses of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but the Curse of the Mother rooteth out Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Ecelus.</hi> 3. 9.</note>,
they would beware of
using them, though never
so much provoked: It
is very observable, that

such Imprecations, when

first, it is the Will
of God that you bring up your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in his Fear, and acquaint them
with his Holy Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
He who made you, requires you
to do this; he who preserves you and

and Lord, who has a right to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to all that you are able to do;
who is your Father in Heaven; who

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56224:79"/>
And, Eph. 6. 4. <hi>And ye Fathers, provoke

up in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord.</hi> 'Tis He who <hi>Established a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

that they should make them known to their

them to their Children. That they
might set their hope in God, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

save the Souls of those,

you? You are the Instruments not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

you ought with a great deal of Zeal
to endeavour to have their pollutions

and a hearty turning from Sin
unto God; by their putting off the
works of darkness, and putting on the

which tends to make them rich in
Faith, and Heirs of a Glorious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
You endeavour to acquaint them
with those who may be useful to them
in their worldly Affairs and Concerns;
And why do you not strive to acquaint
them with God, their greatest and
best Friend, who is sure to stand
by them, to take them up, and to
take care of them, when all forsake
them, and turn their backs upon them?
Why do you not with greater earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
endeavour to procure unto them
his Friendship and Love, who is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56224:81"/>
but even in this Life. You cannot but
find unspeakable Joy and Comfort,
when you behold your Children walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Fear of God, going from
Strength to Strength, and from Grace
to Grace, that at last they may come
and appear before the Lord in <hi>Sion.</hi>
It will free you from a great many
anxious thoughts about them for the
time to come, when you know that
they have God for their Friend, who
will be a Guide and Buckler to them:
What a great Satisfaction will it afford
you, to think that they, for whom you
make so great Provision, and are at so
much pains, are Good and Wise, and
in all Probability, will make good use
of what is given them, or designed
for them? When you see them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
of a mild and gentle Temper, ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to bear uneasie things Meekly and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently;
when you see them Sober
and Temperate, Charitable and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate,
Just and Upright, True and
Faithful, Wise and Prudent, Devout
and Religious, Zealous for the Honour
of God, and studying daily to grow
up in all Virtue and Piety; how will
this fill you with a Pleasure that cannot
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56224:81"/>
be expressed? So true is it that is said
by the Wise Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. and 20.
<hi>A Wise Son maketh a Glad Father.</hi> And
<hi>Ch.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>The Father of the

that begetteth a wise Child shall have Joy
of him. Thy Father and thy Mother
shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall
rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who Plant an Orchard, are
mightily pleased to see the young
Trees prosper, grow regularly, and
bear a great deal of good Fruit, this
makes them reflect upon all their cost
and pains with much satisfaction. How
much greater must their Pleasure be,
upon whom God hath bestowed Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when they see them growing in
Grace as they grow in Years? When
they behold them straight and upright
in their Lives, pure and undefiled in
the way, walking in the Law of the
Lord, having Respect unto all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
flourishing in the Courts
of the Lord, bringing forth the Fruits
of Righteousness and true Holiness.
Doubtless there is no Pleasure in any
Earthly thing comparable to this of
Religious Parents, when they are

God, cloathed with Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as with a Garment? This doth
reflect somewhat of its Lusture and
Beauty upon the Parents themselves,
who have been, under God, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of making their Children
Lovers and Followers of that which
is good. All wise and good People,
who observe the Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Justice and Uprightness, the
Meekness and Modesty, the Prudence
and Discretion, and the other Virtues
which appear in Children, must needs
conceive and entertain very respectful
thoughts of the Parents themselves,
by whose means the Children have
been so Virtuously and Religiously
Formed and Educated.</p>
               <p>But besides all that has been said,
Good and Virtuous Children afford
manifold Advantages to their Parents.

The Psalmist (<hi>Psal.</hi> 128. 3.) compares
them to <hi>Olive Plants round about the
Table</hi> of their Parents; that is, as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
Plants are not only for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but of great use to those who
possess them; so good Children are
not only Ornaments to their Parents,
but very useful and profitable to them
in many regards; for example, they
serve their Parents, they assist and help
them in their Employment, they stand
by them in their danger, and defend
them, they provide for them in their
want, they pray for them, and do
many Important Offices to them; so
that no wonder if the Psalmist saith,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 5. <hi>Happy is the Man that

not be ashamed, but they shall speak
with the Enemies in the Gate.</hi> That is,
it makes Parents Couragious, it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages

and carefully avoid whatever tends to

               <p>Neither will they only joyn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

will be careful likewise to do it sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
to Worship God in Spirit and
in Truth; and to hear his Word with
great Reverence and Attention, with a
great desire to know the Divine Will,
and with a real and hearty design to
do it. They will also observe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sacred Institutions, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
with Flesh and Blood. And
as they will do those things themselves,
so they will do what they can to engage

               <p>And not only will they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

from what is manifestly evil, but will
also make them careful to avoid every

It will cause them to be content with
what God bestows upon them, and
not to envy others, not to covet their

the seasoning their minds with

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, 'tis not in the Power of
Parents to infuse good Qualities into
the minds of their Children; some
are so very perverse, that all that can
be said or done by Parents, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
slighted, and neglected by them:
We know that <hi>Abraham</hi> had an <hi>Ishmael</hi>
as well as an <hi>Isaac;</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> an <hi>Esau</hi>
as well as a <hi>Jacob;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> a <hi>Reuben</hi>
as well as a <hi>Joseph.</hi> However, such
Parents who have the affliction of sad
and wretched Children, have some
comfort and satisfaction in having
done their Duty for them, and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to approve themselves unto
God, who will accept of their honest
and sincere endeavours; and will
crown them with glorious Rewards.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56224:87"/>
But it is otherwise, when Children
prove bad through the too great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
or the Negligence, and bad
Example of Parents. What a deep
wound must it needs give them, when
they begin to consider that they did not
their part to make their Children good,
and were so far from it, that they
corrupted and ruined them by their bad
Example, and over great kindness and
indulgence? Such Parents do often eat
the Fruits of their cruel fondness, and
feel the sad Effects of their own bad
Example, by means of their Prophane
and Graceless Children.</p>
               <p>As God doth often <hi>visit the Iniquity
of the Parents upon the Children;</hi> so
when Children are suffered to go on
in their foolish and wicked courses,
through the indiscreet gentleness and
kindness of Parents, who, perhaps,
are in other respects good People;
the Lord doth sometimes punish such
Parents, and bring Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon them. <hi>Ely</hi> was a great
instance of this, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. and 22.
He <hi>heard all that his Sons did unto all</hi>
Israel; which were things of a very
vile Nature, whereby, as it's said <hi>Chap.</hi>

                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:56224:88"/>
that is, hateful to God, and base and
contemptible to all the People, by
their lewd and abominable Practices.
<hi>Ely</hi> did reprove them, but it was too
coldly and gently. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 23, 24
<hi>And he said unto them, Why do you
such things, for I hear of your evil deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

for it is no good Report that I hear; you

them, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. and 13. as being
High Priest, a Judge, and Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
amongst the People: He ought
to have put them out of the Priesthood,
as accurssed Persons, and Executed the
Laws of God against them. Which

very dreadful Judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him by a Prophet, whom he

               </p>
               <p>We see likewise in <hi>David,</hi> what
was the Effect of his too great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56224:88"/>
to some of his Children; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah,</hi> who not

               <p>Here it will not be unfit to relate
what St. <hi>Augustin</hi> tells us of the sad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of leaving a Child to himself,
and not endeavouring to Educate him

fond of him, that he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doing or saying any thing that tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make his Son uneasie: The young
Man finding himself at Liberty (through
his Father's Indulgence) to live as<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he
thought good, gave up himself to all
manner of Folly, particularly to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness.
Notwithstanding this, his
Father still continued to be as fond as
ever, and would not do any thing to
restrain him from doing what he had
a mind to. The consequence whereof
was very dreadful and terrible; for
a little time after, this wretched Son
coming home very drunk, killed his
Father, as also his Mother then big with
Child; he attempted to have Ravished
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56224:89"/>
his Sisters, of whom two were Mortally
Wounded by him.</p>
               <p>Such sad Examples as these ought to
awaken Parents to do what they can to
Educate their Children in the Fear of
God, to train them up in the Study
and Practice of true Piety, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them by all due means from Sin
and Folly. Which things if they fail
to do, they may expect sooner or
later, to reap the Bitter and Cursed
Fruits of so sad a Neglect.</p>

Imperfection, great
Weakness, or Sickness, or
her circumstances in the
World, make it impossible, or very
dangerous and inconvenient both for
her and the Children, or for either.
For this end it is that God hath given
Breasts unto Women, and caused the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56224:90"/>
Milk to flow into them, that there
may be nourishment suitable to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Infants, in a readiness for them.
Neither can we suppose any other body
capable of shewing equal Care and Love
to the Children, with that which it is
natural for the Mother to express to
the Fruit of her own Womb. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, it cannot well be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Milk of any other Body
can be so fit for the Child as its
own Mothers, if she be but in tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Health.</p>
               <p>We see that <hi>Sarah</hi> did not think
that the greatness of her Quality, or
her great Age, did excuse her from
this Natural Obligation, of giving Suck
unto her Child. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>And she
said, who would have said unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>that</hi> Sarah <hi>should have given Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Suck? For I have born him a Son
in my Old Age.</hi> Which words sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to be the unquestionable Duty,
as well as common Practice of Mothers,
to give Suck to their Children. When
God chose a Nurse for <hi>Moses,</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 2.
8.) he led the Handmaid of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s
Daughter to the Child's Mother. We
find that amongst other Characters of
a Woman, that was fit to be taken
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56224:90"/>
into the number of Widows, there
was this, <hi>If she hath brought up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
(1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10.) or, as the words
may be Translated, If she has nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or fed her Children. It was
reckoned as a sign of God's Wrath,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>To have dry Breasts.</hi> And
therefore, they cannot be accounted
Innocent, who, without apparent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
dry up their Breasts, and so
deprive their Children of that Food
and Nourishment which Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for them. The words of the
Psalmist <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 22. 9. do not
only imply that his Mother gave
him Suck, but they also shew, that it
was the practice of all Mothers, to
do the like to their Children. <hi>Thou
didst make me hope,</hi> saith he, <hi>when I was
upon my Mother's Breasts. Solomon</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
takes it for granted, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the same Womb, should Suck
of the same Breasts. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>O that
thou wert as my Brother, that Sucked
the Breasts of my Mother.</hi> To all
which might be added, the words of
the Woman to our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.

and the Paps which thou hast Sucked.</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:56224:91"/>
Which words suppose, that she who
bare him, did also give him Suck.</p>
               <p>We find that amongst the very
Heathens, they were accounted but
half Mothers, who neglected to give
Suck to their Children. One of their
Ancient Authors<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>We see likewise, that Nature hath

no small part of the Wisdom of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56224:92"/>
not to shew too much fondness

not hinder, but that Parents may, to

To suffer them to live in Idleness,

up their thoughts, they are in great
hazard of finding somewhat to do
which is bad, and hurtful both to
themselves and others. The Devil is
always at hand to furnish Occasions to
idle People, for employing themselves
to their own destruction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> (who for a great
while were reckoned amongst the
wisest People in the World,) were so
sensible of the necessity and importance
of Childrens being bred up to some
Lawful Trade and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
that by their
Laws<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Plut. in Solone.</note> they obliged them
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56224:93"/>
to maintain their Parents, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them in their old Age, only upon
this supposition, that their Parents
had been careful to teach them an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Trade: Otherwise by their Laws,
Children were not bound to provide
for them. Tho' this is not to be
brought into Practice amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
it being contrary to Christian
Principles, for Children upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatsoever to neglect their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in distress. Yet this Example
sheweth, how great a Crime it was
reckoned amongst the wiser Heathens,
for Parents not to breed up their
Children to some honest Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As to the particular kind of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
wherein Children are to
spend their days, it is to be left to
the discretion and prudence of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
They are so to instruct and
dispose the minds of their Children,
that they may be ready to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to any Trade or manner of
Life that's honest, which their Parents
think best and meetest for them to
follow: But yet a great regard is to
be had to the particular Genius and
Inclination of Children, which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56224:94"/>
disposeth them more for one sort
of Employment than another: It will
make them more diligent in learning
their Trade, when they have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in it: Otherwise, if they are put
forth to a Trade against their minds,
they are more likely to neglect it,
or to break off from it. Seldom do
such Persons attain unto great Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their Employment, who follow
it against the Grain.</p>

did not suffer him to live in Idleness,
He appointed him an Employment, to

               <p>The greater that Mens Possessions
are, they ought to be so much the
more concerned in the right Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Children, that so they
may be made the more fit to Inherit

reason had the Philosopher <hi>Crates</hi> to
say,<note n="*" place="margin">Plutarch. de Educat.</note> that if he might,
he would go up unto

                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56224:95"/>
Great and Rich Men, therefore,
ought to be very careful that their
Children be well Educated; that they
be instructed in useful Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which may not only afford
Pleasure and Delight unto their minds,
but may be of use and advantage to
them in their Conversation in the
World. Above all, they ought to
endeavour, that their Childrens minds
be possessed with a lively sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
with sincere Love to God,
with a fervent Zeal for his Glory,
with a great delight in all those things
which are truly Noble and Worthy,
which tend to the Honour of God,
and the Benefit of Mankind, and with
an utter abhorrence and detestation
of all wicked Practices, of Prophane
and Atheistical Company, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
appearance of Evil; they ought
to train them up in useful and pious
Actions and Designs, which may be
of Advantage to Church or State,
that so they may prove a Blessing to
the World, and Pillars of that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
to which they belong.</p>
               <p>Great care ought to be taken, to
make them understand the Vanity of
Riches and Honour, the great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56224:95"/>
and mutability of the things of
this World, and the many Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>Endeavour to make them sensible,

that they occasion Cares, and Fears,

               <p>Shew them likewise, that these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> They ought to have a single
Eye to the Glory of God, and not
to govern themselves by Worldly and
Carnal respects and considerations.
They must not look upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
as if it were only a Trade to
get Wealth and Riches, or as a way
to come to Honour, and to obtain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
in the World. They ought
to look upon this Holy Office with
another Eye, to wit, as it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God for Divine and Spiritual
ends, to guide and direct Men in the
way to Happiness, to shew them what
they must do to obtain Everlasting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56224:99"/>
Happiness, and to avoid Hell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
to teach them how to fight
the good fight of Faith, how to resist
the Devil, how to overcome the
World, and how to be preserved from
their deceitful and desperately wicked
Hearts. They ought to consider, that
Christ's Ministers are appointed to be
Shepherds and Watchmen, to feed
and to watch over the Flock, which
he hath purchased with his Blood; to
acquaint People with their danger; to
call upon them early and late; to
be upon their Guard, to quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like Men, to be strong in the
Lord and in the power of his Might.
They must consider that it belongs to
the Ministers of the Gospel to deal
impartially with all sorts of People,
and not to suffer Sin upon them,
but to reprove them plainly, to
exhort them seriously to repent and
amend; and to direct them what they
are to do for the time to come, lest
they fall again into the same evil Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
and Customs.</p>
               <p>When therefore Parents design a
Child for the Holy Ministry, they
should at the same time consider,
that he is to spend himself in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56224:100"/>
work of the Gospel, that is, he must
Study, and Pray, and Watch, and
Preach, and Visit, and Converse, and
do<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> all other things which are needful
to save Souls; he must be instant in
season and out of season; he must
often and seriously consider what is
farther to be done to convert Sinners,
to instruct the Ignorant, to comfort
the Afflicted, to relieve the Poor, to
excite the Remiss and Negligent, to
encourage the Diligent, to strengthen
the Weak, to confirm the Strong, to
direct the Zealous, to reclaim the Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
to convince Gainsayers, to put
to silence the Ignorance of Foolish
Men: And besides all this, he must be
ready and willing to Sacrifice his life
in the Service of his Great Master,
if he be called thereto; he must
count nothing too dear, that he may
finish his Course with Joy, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself to the great Shepherd
and Bishop of Souls. Thus Parents,
when they design any of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for the Holy Ministry, ought to
consider that they are to be employed
in the greatest, the most painful, and
most dangerous work in the World,
and therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56224:100"/>
3<hi>dly.</hi> They ought to do all that in
them lies, to fit and prepare such
Children, that they may undertake
this Sacred Employment as they ought
to do. More than ordinary care is to
be taken that their minds be furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with good Impressions, that they
be inspired with a great Love to God,
and with a mighty Zeal for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory. They must be daily
trained up in the Practice of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
of Meekness, of Patience, of
Temperance, of Charity, and of all
other Virtues and Graces; they must
be kept from seeing and hearing bad
things, so far as may be; their minds
must be strongly fortified against
Temptations: and all that is possible
must be done, to keep them from
the danger that comes from evil
Company, and corrupt Example.
They must be entrusted to the good
Conduct of Excellent and Worthy
Persons, by whose means they may be
formed to as high a sense of true Piety
as may be, that so, when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
into the World, their light
may shine before others.</p>
               <p>If Parents, who dedicate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to the Holy Ministry, would, in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56224:101"/>
this manner, endeavour to act the part
of Men who have a lively sense of
God upon their Souls, who are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a mighty Zeal for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and are earnestly desirous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Kingdom of Jesus Christ,
we might hope to see very speedily
the Blessed Effects of their Pious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
Religion would flourish more
than it does at this day, and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and Irreligion would not so much
Triumph as, alas! they do.</p>

are fit for Marriage,<note place="margin">2. Duty, about disposing of them in Marriage.</note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are so to dispose
of them, as that in all
likelyhood they may be happy in such
a state of Life:<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Callias</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> was highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> because he gave his Daughters leave to chuse what Husbands themselves liked best. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodot. in Erato.</hi>
                  </note> They
are not to constrain then
to marry against their
Will; for such Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are seldom Happy;
they end too often in
somewhat or other very
Tragical and Calamitous,
to one or t'other Party,
if not to both.</p>
               <p>Great care is to be taken, that there
be not too great inequality of outward
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56224:101"/>
state and condition; for that occasions
often neglect and contempt of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is Inferiour to the other in
some External Advantages: Nor yet
too great Inequality of Years; for
that doth likewise, sooner or later,
cause an Abatement and Decay, and
sometimes an utter Extinction of
that Respect and Love which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make those who are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Happy.</p>
               <p>Parents are not, in disposing of their
Children in Marriage, to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly by their respect to Riches
and Honour; but are to have a regard
to Virtue and Goodness, so far, as to
prefer one who is Discreet and Wise,
of a Virtuous and good Disposition,
to another that is foolish, or indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
and Prophane and Atheistical,
tho' attended with greater degrees
of Wealth and Earthly
Honour.<note n="*" place="margin">Plut. in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocle.</note> 'Tis reported
of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> a Famous
<hi>Athenian</hi> Captain, that when several
young Men came i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he preferred one who was a

that was very Rich. When some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
wondered at this choice, he told
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56224:102"/>
them, he had rather have a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Money, than Money without a
Man.</p>
               <p>What a great reproach is it to our
Religion, to think that so many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
in disposing of their Children,
only consider how much Wealth they
may have, and what Friends and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
they may make, by marrying into
such a Family? or what Profits and
Preferments may be expected thereby?
As for any other thing, they do not
much trouble their heads about it:
They know no other Happiness but
in the things of this life, and therefore
they seek nothing else for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but to make them Great and
Wealthy;<note n="*" place="margin">The sad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very leud and profligate Persons.</note> by which
means it often comes to
pass that they bring their
Children into a most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
and unhappy state
of life, in which they
must pine away their days in Sorrow
and Grief, in the company of Foolish
and Wicked Wretches, who are often
in a fury and rage, who spend their
time in Gaming and Drinking, in
Cursing and Swearing, in Quarrelling
and Fighting, in Whoring and Ranting
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56224:102"/>
and such like woful doings; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but prove to those, who have any
the least degree of real goodness, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uneasie and afflictive, that Wealth
and Riches can make no amends for
them. Such unfortunate Persons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but often envy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the happiness of
those who are in a very poor and low
Estate and Condition, but yet live in
Peace and Quietness, in Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and in the fear of Cod; and so
enjoy real satisfaction and contentment,
and have a great deal of Comfort to
sweeten their outward Wants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.
For as the Wise Man says,
<hi>Prov. 15. 16, 17. Better is little with
the fear of the Lord; than great Treasure,
and Trouble therewith. Better is a Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Herbs where Love is, than a stall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ox, and Hatred therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides all this, it too often falls
out, that they who are given in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to Vicious and Profligate Persons,
are, sooner or later, involved in those
Judgments, which are caused by the
Sins and Follies of the Persons to whom
they are matched. 'Tis true, such
Persons have a great deal to support
their Spirits, if they have not been
Partakers with them in their works
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56224:103"/>
of Darkness: In this case, there is no
doubt but their Merciful and Gracious
God will order what they suffer for
their good. But, alas! it too often
comes to pass, that they who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
yoked, either with Persons of
a false Religion, or of a Wicked Life,
do by degrees degenerate from their
strict and Virtuous Education: Tho'
formerly they seemed to have a right
sense of Religion, and a great Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the best things, yet sooner or
later, by the Example and Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Irreligious and Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Relatives, they lose all sense of
God, and give up themselves to
all manner of Wickedness. 'Tis said
of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> who was Educated under
a Religious Father, <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21. 6. That <hi>he walked in the way of the
Kings of</hi> Israel, <hi>like as did the House of</hi>
Ahab, <hi>for he had the Daughter of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab
<hi>to Wife,</hi> &amp;c. Where 'tis very
observable, that this unequal Marriage
of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> is noted as the cause of his
great Wickedness. And from the
following Verses it appears, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heavy Judgments fell upon him for
his Impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:56224:103"/>
To what hath been said may be
added, that the hurt and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
attending such Marriages, does
not only affect the Married Persons
themselves, but likewise extends to
their Off-spring and Posterity, who
are in great danger of being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as to their Religion and Manners,
by the Influence and Example of their
Parents. 'Tis observed as one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
cause of the Wickedness of <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
(1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 21.) That <hi>his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was an</hi> Ammonitess; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
<hi>v.</hi> 31. to shew us that 'tis a
matter which deserves to be taken
notice of. To the same purpose 'tis
said of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi>
8. 27.) That <hi>he walked in the way of
the House of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and did Evil in the

House of</hi> Ahab.</p>

For this end, they ought to

               <p>Tho' you are to provide for your

               <p>As you are to beware, lest your care
for your Children, make you neglect
necessary Duties of Charity; so you
are to take heed, lest you use any
unlawful Method to get Wealth to
bestow upon them: This is not a way
to make them Rich; for such Riches
seldom prosper: There is a Curse
which attends all unlawful Gain, and
like a Canker eats it out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
it. All Ages and Places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Examples, which confirm this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.

is a hundredfold better than a vast

               </p>
               <p>As it is the Duty of Parents by all
Honest and Lawful ways, to provide
somewhat for their Children, and to
preserve it for them; so they ought
in due time to bestow upon them
more or less of what they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
and purchased, and not wholly
to delay the doing of this until their
own Decease. They ought, so far as
they can, to afford their Children
whatever their present Necessities or
their Lawful Occasions do require:
And the more Virtuous and Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
they see their Children, they ought
to give them so much the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally,
that they may have not only
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56224:106"/>
what is absolutely necessary for them,
but likewise, what they may improve
for the bettering their Estate in the
World; that they may live decently,
and may also have somewhat wherewith
to help and relieve others. How great
a Reproach is it to some Persons, who
have a great deal of wealth, out of
a woful covetous Temper to suffer
their Children to go in Rags, and to
depend upon the Charity or good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of others, for a piece of Bread!
Such Parents must needs be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
whose Bowels are not stirred
with Compassion towards their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when they see them in distress
and want; and who do not all they
can for their necessary Supply and
Assistance.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">Great Prudence and Caution ought to be used in bestowing their Worldly Goods on their Children.</note> tho Parents ought
to give their Children
chearfully and seasonably
more or less of their
Worldly Goods, yet they
must have a care, lest out
of an indiscreet fondness,
they give them more than their own
circumstances will permit. How many
sad Examples are there of Children,
who have either wholly neglected their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56224:106"/>
Parents, or who have not cared for
them as they ought to have done, so
soon as they were put into the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of their Estate and Fortune?
Whereas formerly, they seemed to
carry themselves with all possible Duty
and Affection, no sooner did their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
bestow all they had (or at least,
the greatest part) upon them, but they
begun to grow Insolent towards them,
and went on to so great a height of
undutifulness, that their poor Parents
were forced to leave them, and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to live in a very melancholly and
mournful condition. 'Tis therefore
the Wisdom of Parents, so to give
their Children, as still to reserve to
themselves what is needful for their
own support: They ought rather to
keep their Children in a dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, than that they should depend
upon their Children. To this purpose is
the Advice of the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticus
33. 18, 19, &amp;c. <hi>Hear me,</hi> O
<hi>ye great Men of the People, and hearken
with your Ears, ye Rulers of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
Give not thy Son and Wife,
thy Brother and Friend, power over thee
while thou livest, and give not thy Goods
to another, lest it repent thee, and thou
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56224:107"/>
intreat for the same again. As long as
thou livest and hast Breath in thee, give
not thy self over to any. For better it
is that thy Children should seek to thee,
than that thou shouldest stand to their Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.
In all thy works keep to thy self
the Preeminence, leave not a stain in thine
Honour. At the time when thou shalt
end thy days and finish thy Life, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
thy Inheritance.</hi>

the use of your Reason all the while,
yet consider, that you are likely to
have enough to do in your last hours,
tho' the ordering of your Temporal
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56224:108"/>
concerns do not then lie upon your
Hands. Your Spiritual Enemies will,
very probably, at that time, muster up
all their Forces, and use their utmost
Effort, either to conquer you, or to
frighten and disturb you: You will
then find that all your Preparation is
little enough, that you may finish your
course with Joy: The sight of Death
will make you see a great many things,
far otherwise than you saw them in
time of Health: The things of this
Life will then appear very little and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
and Eternity will appear
as a vast and boundless Ocean: Your good
actions will appear but very few and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and your Sins and Follies very
many and great. Thus it is generally
with the best and most Holy Persons;
and therefore, 'tis your wisest and safest
course, to dispatch, not only as much
of your great Business as you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the approach of Death, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to dispose of your Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
in such a manner, that they may not
prove a hindrance and a burthen to you
at that time, when you are to have a
sharp Conflict with the King of Terrors.</p>
               <p>But besides all these Considerations,
which ought to excite you to put
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56224:108"/>
your House in order, in time of your
Health; consider farther, that by so
doing, you will prevent a great deal
of Trouble and Confusion, and of
Strife and Division, which oft-times
happen amongst Children, when their
several Portions are not assigned them
by the Will of their Parents. How
sad is it to reflect upon so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this kind, as have happened
in our days! It cannot but be look'd
upon as a great Reproach to our Holy
Religion, to see Brethren, and other
near Relations, contending, and going
to Law with one another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
laying the Foundation of lasting
Variance and Discord, of Bitterness
and Wrath, of Anger and Clamour,
of Malice and Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which too
often are concluded, with the Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Destruction of one or other
of the contending Parties, if not of the
whole Family.</p>
               <p>How needful therefore is it for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to make their Will in good time?
when they are in Health, when their
Understanding is good, when their
Memory is perfect, when they are able
to think of Business, and to judge
calmly and discreetly of what they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56224:109"/>
do; when they can call to mind what
they owe, and what is owing to
them.</p>
               <p>And because of the great Falsehood
and Wickedness of the World, by
which it often happens that the true
sense of Mens words are perverted,
it is likewise very fit that Parents, in
setting their House in Order, have the
advice of those who are Skilful, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and Faithful Persons, by whose
Assistance their Will may be framed
in such Terms and Expressions, as may
(so far as is possible) prevent the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
of Crafty and Ungodly Men.</p>
               <p>As Parents ought to
use a great deal of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Circumspection
in all things relating to
their last Will,<note place="margin">Great care to be taken in the choice of Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in the choice of
Guardians for their Children, who,
after their own Decease, may act the
part of Parents towards them, and
may promote their Happiness and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
both in Temporal and Spiritual
things. If you know amongst your
near Relations those who are Wise

who fear and love God, and of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56224:109"/>

Duties that belong to Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>That you may the better act your
part; 'tis fit for you, when you call
your selves to an account about your
Lives and Conversations, to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
particularly how you perform
the Duties of Parents towards your
Children, as to their Souls, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Outward Concerns: And if,
upon serious enquiry, you find that you
sincerely endeavour to do whatever
you know your selves to be bound to
do for them; then bless and praise
God, who gives you <hi>both to will and
to do according to his good Pleasure:</hi>
Beg his pardon for those Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

not to grow weary in your Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; that so they may be as
happy in all respects, as is possible
for you, by the help of God, to make
them.</p>
               <p>But if upon inquiry, you find that
you have been very negligent in your
duty towards your Children; that you
have done very little good for their
Souls, and not what you should, and
might have done for their Bodies and
outward Estate; and that perhaps you
have done them a great deal of hurt
by your Evil Counsel, and Prophane
and Wretched Example; that you have
led them on in the Broad Way, which
leads to the Chambers of Death, that
you have robbed God, who bestowed
them on you, of their Service and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and have made them <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Sin;</hi> that you have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the making them <hi>Heirs of Wrath,

eternally those Souls and Bodies,
which God intrusted with you, that
you might take care of them, and do
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56224:111"/>
what you could to make them happy.
If, I say, upon enquiry into your hearts
and lives, you find your selves guilty of
those things, how great reason have
you to be in bitterness and grief of
Heart, to weep and lament, to abhor
your selves in Dust and Ashes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and acknowledge your Sins with
great Humility and Contrition, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the Divine Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with all earnestness, for the sake
of his dear Son; to resolve and purpose
sincerely to amend your ways and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
to beg Grace from God, that he
would assist you, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
you about with his Salvation, and
never leave you nor forsake you; that
he would give you his Holy Spirit to
sanctifie you, to wash and cleanse you,
to lead and guide you, to support and
strengthen you, to revive and quicken
you, to carry you from strength to
strength, and from Grace to Grace,
till you come and appear before him
in <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider the particular things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you have hurt the Souls of your
Children, and failed in your Duty to
them, as to their Bodies and Outward
Concerns: And the more you find you
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56224:111"/>
have done amiss, resolve so much the
more to be zealous to do them good;
to double your diligence in promoting
the welfare and happiness both of their
Souls and Bodies. Tell them so far as
is meet, what you now see and feel;
let them know that you have been
out of the way, that you have misled
them, and brought both your selves and
them in danger of being undone, and
ruined Eternally: Tell them what you
resolve to do, and what you and they
ought to do, and must do, or else that
you will certainly perish. Delay not to
do this one moment: fly like a Bird out
of the Snare of the Fowler. Your Souls
lie at the stake, and therefore do what
Men use to do to save their Lives;
<hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a Man hath,
will be give for his Life.</hi> Men are ready
to part with any thing to save their
Lives; They'l part with House and
Lands, with Silver and Gold, with their
whole Estate and Substance, to save
their Bodies alive, which must die at
last, and, for ought they know, may die
within a very few days or hours. How

and unruly Lusts and Passions, your
vain foolish Habits and Customs, which
are your reproach and dishonour, which
are the worst things in the World,
which can do you no good, if you hold
them still, but will certainly do you a
great deal of mischief? They will
prove the cause of your destruction;
they will deprive you of all that is
good and excellent; they will cut you
off from the favour of God, the Love
of Christ, and the fellowship of the
Blessed Spirit; they will likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
you of the Assistance and Ministry
of the Holy Angels, and the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Society of the Saints departed;
they will exclude you for ever from the
Kingdom of Heaven, the Crown of
Righteousness, the Peace, the Joy, the
Love, and Glory of the future State: All
this your sins will deprive you of; and
instead thereof, they will expose you
to the Wrath of God, to the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
fire, to Everlasting Burnings, to
blackness of darkness, to weeping and
gnashing of Teeth, to the wretched
and cursed Company of Devils and
damned Souls, to the Worm which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

torment you for ever: And will you
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56224:112"/>
chuse all this rather than part with
your Lusts, that you may be for ever
happy, and have fulness of Joy and
Pleasures for evermore? Will you be
so mad, as to prefer Hell and Death,
everlasting Misery and Woe, to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Everlasting Life, to Blessedness
and Glory? And will you still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to be so cruel to your poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as to draw them along with you
to the bottomless Pit? Now is the
time for you to become either happy or
miserable; if you repent and amend,
and act the part of Wise and Religious
Parents, you may be happy; for God
will have Mercy upon you. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7.
<hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the

power to make your Children wise
and good.</p>
               <p>But if, instead of this, you continue
in your sin and folly, setting at naught
God's Counsels, and despising his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs,
putting the Evil day far from

safety, tho' you walk after your own

destroying the Souls and Bodies of
your poor Children; then assure your

               <head>Concerning the Duty of Parents when God
removeth their Children by death.</head>
               <p>THe Death of Children as well as
Aged Persons, falls out so very
often, that it cannot but be seasonable
to a great many Parents to suggest to
them some plain and easie Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they may sometimes reflect
upon, and imprint on their minds, that
so they may not be surprised with
the death of their Children, nor swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of excessive and immoderate
grief.</p>
               <p>Parents ought to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">1. They ought to consider that it is the Lord who does it.</note>
when their Children
dye, <hi>first,</hi> that it is the Lord
who does it: He who is
Lord of Life, who gave
Life to themselves and to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is also Lord of death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
out of the World whom, and
when, he sees fit, He is the great Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and Man is the Clay, which he
hath formed and fashioned into a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56224:114"/>
and beautiful shape; and animated
with an immortal Soul: When he sees
fit to break this brittle Vessel in pieces,
and to separate the Soul from it, <hi>who
can stay his Hand? Or who dare say unto
him, what dost thou?</hi> May not he do
with his own, what he thinks good?
Or must he give an account of his
Actions, unto the work of his own
Hands? He is infinitely great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful;
and therefore will do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own good pleasure: He is
infinitely wise, and knows what's best
and fittest to be done: He is infinitely
good and kind, and therefore will
order all things for good: And he is
infinitely just and righteous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can do no wrong. It's fit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Parents, when God removes
their Children from them by Death,
submit chearfully to the will of him,
who is infinitely powerful, wise, good,
and just; and that they adore him,
and say with <hi>Ely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>It is
the Lord, let him do what seemeth him
good.</hi> And with the Royal <hi>Psalmist,
Ps.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my
Mouth; because thou didst it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:56224:114"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> they should
consider that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were born Mortal,<note place="margin">2. They ought to consider that their Children were born mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</note>
frail by Nature, subject
to a necessity of dying,
by their very composition
and frame; and also by the Decree
of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>It is appointed
for all Men once to dye.</hi> And therefore
when God sees fit to remove them by
Death, to make the House of Clay fall
down about their Ears, Parents ought
not to be surprised. This is nothing
but what falls out daily: Some are
going out of the World, and some are
coming into it: Some are a great while
upon the Stage, and some but a very
short while; some no sooner enter upon
it, but presently they are gone, and are
seen no more; some take a few turns,
and then they are withdrawn; some
tarry longer, and Act a great part on
the Stage, for a considerable time, and
give hopes of yet greater Actions and
Performances; but on a sudden they
are gone likewise, as a shadow; and
all their own designs and projects, and
the hopes and expectations of others
fall to the ground. All this happens
every day in the Course of things here
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56224:115"/>
in the World; and therefore Parents
have no reason to think it strange when
they see their Children dye. <hi>The thing
that hath been, it is that which shall be;
and that which is done, is that which
shall be done; and there is no new thing
under the Sun,</hi> Eccles. 1. 9.</p>
               <p>And as it is with Men, so it is with
all things else, which live upon the
Earth, or grow out of it: Some live
longer and some a shorter while than
others of the same kind: Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
and thrive, and others decay and
perish. Some things grow up in the
Morning, and are withered e're Night:
Some things grow apace till they are
very near the time of ripeness and
perfection; and then somewhat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth,
which prevents the perfect
growth, and makes the goodly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
come to nothing: Now, what are
Men? <hi>Moses</hi> in his Prayer (<hi>Ps.</hi> 90. 5, 6.)
tells us, <hi>In the Morning they are like
grass, which groweth up; In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it flourisheth and groweth up: In
the Evening it is cut down and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
And to the same purpose the
Psalmist <hi>David</hi> speaketh, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.
15, 16. <hi>As for Man his days are as
grass, as a flower of the field, so he
flourisheth, for the Wind passeth over it,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56224:115"/>
and it is gone, and the place thereof shall
know it no more.</hi> Likewise <hi>Esa.</hi> 40.
6, 7. it is thus written, <hi>The Voice
said Cry. And he said, What shall I Cry?
All flesh is grass, and all the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof is as the flower of the field.
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth,
because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth
upon it: Surely the People is grass.</hi>
By all which it appears what Man
is by Nature, to wit, a very weak
and vanishing thing, soon nipt and
brought to nothing; like the tender
Grass, and the Flower of the Field,
which is more exposed to the Winds
and other inconveniences, than the
Flowers of the Garden, which the
Gardiner preserves and secures.</p>
               <p>The Consideration of these things,
will tend mightily to quiet the minds
of those who calmly and wisely reflect
upon them, when God removes their
Children, or other Relations from
them by Death. Their case is not
singular, it is that which is common
and usual amongst Men; it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the course of Nature for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
thing to die. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of
<hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> an Ancient Philosopher,
That when he was Discoursing to his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56224:116"/>
Hearers concerning the Causes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Things, One brought him the
news of his Sons Death; upon which,
after a little pause, he said to those
who were present, <hi>I knew I begat a
Son that was Mortal.</hi> The Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this did quiet the Thoughts of
this Heathen.</p>
               <p>But what if the manner of the death
of your Children be somewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
by some sudden and unusual
Accident, or by some strange and odd
Distemper; are you on this account
to allow your selves in the excesses of
Sorrow and Mourning? No, in no
ways: You are not therefore to be
transported into immoderate grief and
mourning. Shall you be vexed and
disquieted, because a Worm did eat
up your pleasant Fruit, or because the
stormy Wind did blow away your love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Flowers? Are you therefore to be
enraged and mad with anger against
the Worms, or against the Winds?
What would it mend the matter, if
you should give way to your passion
and anger never so much in such a case?
This would only multiply your losses,
by making you lose not only your Fruit
and your Flowers, but your selves too:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56224:116"/>
Which they all do, who lose their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
in which it is that <hi>we possess our
Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore your Children are
removed from you by Death, in some
unusual and extraordinary manner, you
ought to look beyond Diseases, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
unto the Lord of Life and
Death; who by his Providence order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not only their death, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it. If <hi>the Sparrows fall not to
the Ground,</hi> that is, die not, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your Father:</hi> You may be sure
your Children do not die by chance,
or without the particular disposal of
their heavenly Father. As to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
grounds and reasons, for which
God does after such a manner see fit
to put an end to your Childrens days,
you are not to be too curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive.
The Counsels of God are a
great deep: <hi>His ways are in the deep
waters; and none by searching can find
him out unto perfection,</hi> Job 11. 7. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such occasions all ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the words of our Lord, when they
told him of the <hi>Galileans, whose Blood</hi>
Pilate <hi>hath mingled with their Sacrifices,</hi>
Luke 13. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Suppose ye that these
Galileans were Sinners above all the Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56224:117"/>
because they suffered such things? I

was a free and undeserved gift

to reserve to himself the Supreme
Power of disposing of it, as he should

present Correction and Chastisement
which he knew to proceed from Infinite
Wisdom, Goodness, and Justice.</p>
               <p>To the abovementioned instances
from Scripture, might be added several
Examples of the patience and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
of Spirit, which some Heathens
discovered, when their Children were
suddenly snatched away by a violent
and untimely Death. I shall only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
two, related by <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 1<hi>st</hi> is, of <hi>Dio</hi> of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> who,
as he was busie in consulting with his
Friends about matters of importance,
heard a great noise and tumult in the
House, which occasioned his enquiring
what the matter was; and being told
that his Son was dead by a fall from
the Roof of the House, he received
this sad news without discovering any
perturbation of Mind; and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Orders that the dead Body should
be delivered into the hands of the
Women, that they might take care of
it, and that it should be buried in the
accustomed manner; He went on in
his Design, to consult with his Friends
about the business that was before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56224:118"/>
The other instance, is, of <hi>Xenophon,</hi>
who, when he was employed in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sacrifice, received the news of his
Son's being killed in Battel; at the
hearing of which he pull'd off the
Garland from his Head, wherewith it
was then covered, and having askt the
manner of his Son's Death, and being
told that he died fighting valiantly for
his Country, he quickly brought his
Mind, which was a little disturb'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
subjection to his Reason, and again
putting on the Garland, he went on
with his Sacrifice, and told those who
brought him the news of his Son's
Death, <q>I never pray'd the Gods to
make my Son Immortal, or very long
liv'd (it being very uncertain if that
be expedient) but to make him an
Honest Man, and a Lover of his
Country: And now, said he, I have
my desire.</q>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider from
whence,<note place="margin">3. They should consider from whence, and whither they are gone.</note> and whither they
are gone. They were
here in a life of Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Trouble; subject
to innumerable Vanities,
Temptations, Snares, and Dangers:
They were compassed about with great
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56224:119"/>
and terrible Enemies, the Devil, the
World, and the Flesh: They were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to daily necessities and wants. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
they had lived never so long, they would
only have seen the same things in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
succession and revolution: As for
Example, heat and cold, fair weather
and foul, might and day, Summer and
Winter, health and sickness, plenty
and poverty, peace and war, prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and adversity, succeeding one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
All things going round. But
now they are delivered from all these;
they are at rest, they are subject to no
more necessities and wants; oppressed
with no more troubles and vexations;
exposed to no more enemies, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or dangers; but exalted to a
state of perfect Peace, Joy, Love, and
Glory. They are as well and better
than you can desire: You are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comprehend the Happiness that
they are admitted to. Will you then
be in continual sorrow and grief for
your Children, when they are exalted
to a state of Rest and Glory; when
they are where you would rejoyce to
be; when their Gracious Father hath
freed them from the vain company of
the World, and Translated them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56224:119"/>
the blessed Society of Angels, and
of the Spirits of Just Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
when he hath put an end to
their Toil and Labour, to their Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Wrestling against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and bestowed on them a Crown
of Glory, and an Everlasting Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
when he hath broken their
Bonds asunder, wherein they were held
and kept in Captivity and Slavery, and
hath put them into a state of perfect
and glorious Freedom? The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these things should mitigate
and asswage your Sorrow and Grief,
and fill you with unspeakable Comfort
and Gladness.</p>
               <p>But some are apt to say, I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
if I thought that my Children,
who are dead, were in Heaven: But
this I do not know. As to this, you
are not to trouble your thoughts about
it; for God does not see fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with such things. <hi>Secret
things belong to God; and things revealed
to us and to our Children, Deut.</hi> 29. 29.
If your Children, while they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
minded good things; and if you
did your part to instruct them, and
to make them what God requires them
to be, you are not to be any further
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56224:120"/>
solicitous about their Everlasting state:
You are to hope that they are very
happy, and you are to comfort your
selves with these thoughts.</p>
               <p>Others are apt to say, I am afraid
that my Children are not in a happy
state; they did very bad things, and
used bad Company; and therefore I
have cause to fear, and to be troubled
about them, now that they are dead.
As to such Parents, who have had
wretched Children, they ought not to
suffer their minds to be disordered,
and oppressed with Grief and Sorrow,
because their Children, who died, were
wicked. If they did their Duty to make
them better; if they advised and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
them; if they reproved them,
and, as was fitting, chastened them; if
they desired others to deal with them,
to see what they could do towards the
reclaiming of them; if they prayed to
God for them, and gave them a good
Example: They are not any further to
be troubled and disquieted concerning
them, when God takes them into his
own hand; He is wise and good, holy
and just, he does all things well, for
excellent and glorious ends; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Parents ought to leave them to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56224:120"/>
his Disposal, who is the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the World, and Judge of
the whole Earth. Whatever he does,
whether in Mercy or Justice, is always
best. The Inhabitants of the other
World, who are translated into a state
of Heavenly Glory, are not under the
power of such passions and partialities,
as govern us here below. The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Parents of damned Children, are
not under any uneasiness on that or
any other account: The Will of God
and his Glory is their all; they know
that whatever he does is most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
just and good, and for his Honour;
and therefore all things afford them
great Pleasure and Delight, true and
lasting Joy and Satisfaction of mind.
There's nothing able to interrupt the
happiness and joy of those in Glory:
They are perfectly and eternally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from all sort of evils, both of
sin and punishment: They are placed
above the reach of whatever may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them in the least uneasie.</p>
               <p>But there is a third sort; of those
who are troubled, not only because
their Children were bad and prophane,
but because they were so through their
example or neglect. As for such, I
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56224:121"/>
have already in general shewed them
what they ought to do. I shall only
add; That since they have been so
faulty and defective in their Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Deceased Children, they
ought to be the more careful of those
who are yet alive, and to do all that
is possible to make them what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
them to be. As to those who
have no more Children left them, it
would be very fit for them to take into
their care one or more Children, upon
whom they may bestow all that pains and
care which they should have bestowed
in the right Education of their own;
and endeavour, by God's help, to
make them truly Pious and Religious,
and Patterns of all sorts of Virtue
to others. This is an Office which
will be very acceptable to God, and
one of the best demonstrations which
Parents can make of the sincerity of
their Repentance, for their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done their Duty to their own
Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider, that
there will be a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all those that are
dead.<note place="margin">4. They should consider that there will be a Resurrection.</note> The mighty Power
of God, which made all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56224:121"/>
things out of nothing, will also gather
together the scattered dust of those
who are deceased, and will reform and
rebuild, as it were, their bodies which
are fallen down, and consumed. He
will raise them up again in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
perfect, and glorious manner.
Then shall you meet with your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Friends who died in the
Lord, and behold them after another
manner<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> than you saw them here in
this World. Instead of weak and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
bodies, you shall see them strong,
vigorous, and lively bodies: Instead
of frail and dying bodies, you shall
see immortal and incorruptible bodies:
Instead of filthy and vile bodies, you
shall see pure and glorious bodies: And
you shall see them so as to be with them
for ever, so as never any more to
be separated from them by death,
or any other thing; for you and they
shall die no more: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43,
44. <hi>So also is the resurrection of the dead.
It is sown in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it
is raised in glory. It is sown in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it is raised in power. It is sown
a natural body, it is raised a spiritual
body:</hi> And, <hi>vers.</hi> 53. <hi>This corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56224:122"/>
must put on incorruption, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
must put on immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How gladly would poor People part
with their dearest Children, if they
could be assured of seeing them again
in an honourable state and condition,
exalted to great Dignity and Honour?
And will not you, who have the hopes
of a glorious Resurrection, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
in the absence of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
When their merciful God and
Father takes them away from you unto
himself; not to do them hurt, but
good; to make them happy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with himself for ever; to bestow
upon them <hi>what Eye hath not seen, nor
Ear heard, nor which hath entred into
the Heart of Man to conceive?</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the words of the Apostle to the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>But I
would not have you to be ignorant, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
concerning them which are asleep,
that ye sorrow not, even as others which
have no hope: For if we believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
dyed and rose again, even so them,
which sleep in Jesus, will God bring with
him.</hi>

way to excessive Grief and
Mourning,<note place="margin">5. They should consider that their giving way to exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Grief and Mourning, can do no good, but will certainly do a great deal of hurt.</note> can do you no
good, but will certainly
do you a great deal of
hurt and mischief in many
respects. It cannot bring
back your Children that
are dead. Though you
should break your Hearts
into a thousand pieces, by your weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mourning, and waste and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
your years in constant heaviness
and sorrow; tho' you should never
henceforth allow your selves one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of relaxation of mind; after
all, you must go to them, they shall
not return to you. Now what a
folly is it for Men to consume, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
and to torment themselves,
where it is to no purpose at all to do
so?</p>
               <p>And not only do you thereby no
good at all to your selves, but you
do your selves a great deal of mischief
and prejudice. You provoke God to
anger against you, to bring upon you
yet heavier and more grievous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to deprive you of other
Mercies and Comforts, which you still
enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:56224:123"/>
You do thereby no small hurt to
your Bodies; you bring upon your
selves very dangerous distempers, which
will make you unfit for the actions of
Life, and the Duties of your Calling.
You likewise do unspeakable mischief
to your Souls; you deprive your selves
of that vigour and chearfulness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is needful to make you fit to
serve God acceptably. You thereby
weaken your Memory, and darken and
disorder your Reason and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so expose your selves to all
the sad consequences of a disordered
and distracted Mind.</p>
               <p>Your Example does also a great
deal of hurt to others: Your impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and immoderate sorrow and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teacheth others to do so upon the
like occasion. Hereby you bring no
small reproach upon our holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if it were not sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and fortifie us against our crosses
and afflictions, and to comfort us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
the uneasie things which God
sees fit to exercise us with in this
World.</p>
               <p>What an excellent Example is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
unto you in this matter? When
God struck his Child, so that it was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56224:123"/>
very sick, he fasted and prayed; but
when the Child died, he <hi>arose from
the earth, and washed and anointed
himself, and changed his apparel, and
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>me unto the House of the Lord, and
worshipped: Then he came to his own
House; and when he required, they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> Bread before him, and he did eat.
Then said his Servants unto him, What
thing is this that thou hast done? Thou
didst fast and weep for the Child, while it
was alive; but when the Child was dead,
thou didst rise and eat Bread. And he
said, While the Child was yet alive, I
fasted and wept; for I said, Who can tell,
whether God will be gracious unto me, that
the Child may live? But now he is dead,
Wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him
again? I shall go to him, but he shall not
return to me,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus ought all Parents to do, who
fear God. When the Lord layeth his
hand upon your Children, you ought
to pray to God for them, and to use
all lawful means for their recovery:
But when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ees fit to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by death, you ought patiently to
submit to his Will; This is your wisest
course; It is the way to make your
selves happy, and to enjoy comfort
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56224:124"/>
and satisfaction of mind under your
crosses. This is the likeliest and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
way to obtain new Mercies and
Favours from the Lord, instead of
those you are deprived of: Thus you
see the Lord dealt with <hi>Job: Jam.</hi> 5.
11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job,
<hi>and have seen the end of the Lord: That
the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
And, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 12, 13. <hi>The Lord blessed
the latter end of</hi> Job, <hi>more than his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
And, <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>After this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
Job <hi>an hundred and forty years, and
saw his Sons, and his Sons Sons, even four
Generations. So</hi> Job <hi>dyed, being old and
full of days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if God see it more fit to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from you the blessings of the
Womb, and to bestow no more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
upon you; he can and will
make up this want, with much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and better Blessings. What you
want in Temporals, you shall have
in Spirituals. As <hi>Elkanah</hi> said to
<hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>He will be better
to you than ten Sons. He will give you
a Name better than of Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

advise them, to endeavour, as much as
is possible, to live peaceably with all

contrary to seek the welfare of others,
to strive to do all the good they can
in the World, and to make it as

               <p>HAving discoursed of the Duties of

amiss to say somewhat concerning the
Duty of those who are in the place of
Parents, such as Step-Fathers and Step-Mothers
(or Fathers and Mothers in
Law) and Guardians. And first,</p>

               <head>Concerning the Duties of Step-Fathers
and Step-Mothers.</head>
               <p>The first and chief
thing which belongs to
the care of Step-Parents,<note place="margin">Concerning the Duties of Step-Fathers and Step-Mothers, or Fathers and Mothers in Law:</note>
is, to do all that they can
for the benefit of their
Childrens Souls. They
ought to endeavour to
season their tender minds with the
Fear and Love of God, to reform what
is amiss in their temper and humour by
all kind and prudent Methods, to teach
them to worship God, to <hi>Remember
their Creator in the days of their Youth:</hi>
They ought to see that they be taught
to read; that they spend the Lord's
Day well, and that they frequent the
place of Publick Worship: They ought
to make them understand what was
promised in their Name at their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and to encourage them to renew
their Baptismal Covenant, if they have
an opportunity: They ought to advise
them to come to the Lord's Table so
soon as they are fit for it, and then,
as also at other times, to examine
themselves, and to call themselves to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56224:127"/>
a strict and serious account, They
ought to observe what remarkable
Mercies and Providences they meet
with, and to acquaint them therewith
so soon as they are capable to reflect
on such things: They ought likewise,
to talk to them often of the various
Providences which either they have
met with themselves, or which they
have observed in the World, that
thereby the Childrens minds may be
affected with a due sense of the Power,
the Greatness, the Wisdom, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the Justice of God.</p>
               <p>To render all which endeavours ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
they must be Examples of Piety
to them: They must see what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
they use, and do what they can
to keep them out of ill Company, and
to acquaint them with those who have
a sense of good things: They must
reprove them when it is needful, but
with great mildness and discretion:
And as for correcting and chastening
of them, they ought to leave that part
to the Natural Parent, if alive; but if
the Natural Parent be dead, then they
may correct them when it is necessary,
according to their Age: But in this
great caution ought to be used, they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56224:128"/>
must do it with the greatest gentleness
and tenderness that is possible, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Conscience, but Prudence, to
prevent all occasion, which a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are apt to take, to reflect upon
them, and to censure them severely
and unjustly, when they do any thing
that looks like unkindness or sharpness
to their Step-Children. 'Tis therefore
very adviseable, when Correction is
necessary, to acquaint some of the
Childrens Relations (if they be not
at too great a distance) with their
fault, and so to correct them by their
advice, and, if possible, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that they may be, as it were,
Witnesses of their doing nothing but
what is absolutely fit and needful to
be done for the advantage of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Step-Parents ought also to take the
opportunity of their Childrens sickness,
or of any other Adversity they meet
with, to set home upon their minds
such Admonitions and Counsels as
they were not so apt to mind when
they were in health. And to all their
other Endeavours, they ought to joyn
their daily prayers to God for them,
that he would bless them, and make
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56224:128"/>
them his faithful and obedient Children
and Servants.</p>
               <p>As Step-Parents ought principally to
take care of the Souls of their Step-Children,
so they must not neglect
their Bodies. Their Duty as to this,
is, in a word, to take care that they
have necessary and convenient Food
and Rayment.</p>
               <p>As to the outward Estate of Step-Children,
tho' Parents are not obliged
to give them any great Portion of
their Worldly Goods, especially if
they have, or are like to have Children
of their own, to give such things to;
yet they ought to be careful, that the
Portions, which of right belong to
their Step-Children, be preserved and
improved for their use and advantage,
according to the Will of the Deceased
Parent.</p>
               <p>When they are fit for a Trade or
any honest way of getting their Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
they ought to assist them all they
can, that they may be placed forth as
happily and comfortably as may be.
In like manner when they are fit for
Marriage, they ought to express a
great deal of readiness and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to serve them to the utmost of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56224:129"/>
their Power; they ought to assist them
with their best advice and hearty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
in a matter of so great Importance.
And, in a word, they ought not to be
wanting to them in any thing that may
be useful and beneficial to them, either
as to their Souls, or Bodies, or as
to their outward Concerns.</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Some Motives to stir up Step-Parents
to do these things.</head>
               <p>It cannot but excite
Step-Parents,<note place="margin">Some Motives to stir them up to do their Duty.</note> to perform
the above-mentioned Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the Benefit of
their Children, both in
their Spiritual and Temporal concerns,
if they seriously consider, 1<hi>st,</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Marriage Relation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they become one Flesh with those
to whom they are married. When
God made the Woman, and brought
her to the Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. he said,
<hi>Therefore shall a Man leave his Father
and Mother, and cleave unto his Wife,
and they shall be one Flesh.</hi> Now, by
Virtue of this near Relation and close
Union, they ought to have a tender
regard for the Interests and Concerns
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56224:129"/>
of one another; and the dearer any
thing is to the one, the greater affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought the other to have towards
it. As therefore 'tis past all doubt,
that Children are the dearest and most
valued and beloved Earthly thing that
Natural Parents have, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
it is very reasonable, that Step-Parents
should express a great Regard
and Affection for them.</p>
               <p>2. This is the way to preserve and
to increase that mutual Love, which
ought to be 'twixt Man and Wife.
If a Step-Parent is kind and loving
to the Children, and careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their Happiness and Welfare,
it cannot but have an Influence on
the Natural Parent, so as to produce
an Increase of Love and Respect, which
will render the lives of the married
Persons very easie and comfortable.
Whereas, on the other hand, if Step-Parents
are rough, unkind, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to their Step-Children, it must
needs cause a great deal of mischief;
it will certainly cool, if not quite
alienate the affection of the Natural
Parent, and when once this happens,
there is thenceforth nothing but strife
and contention, jealousies and suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56224:130"/>
which are ordinarily attended
with very sad and dreadful effects, to
the utter Ruin of one or t'other Party,
if not of both.</p>
               <p>3. This is the way to make the
Children very respectful and kind,
and very dutiful and obedient to them,
when they use them kindly, are careful
to seek their happiness and welfare,
and carry themselves towards them in
all respects, as they ought to do. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
on the contrary, by being unkind
to them, and unconcerned for their
happiness and welfare, they provoke
them to hate them, and to prove
Disrespectful and Disobedient to
them.</p>
               <p>4. This is the way to gain a great
deal of Love and Respect from all
those who are Related to the Deceased
Parents, who cannot chuse but resent
it very kindly, when they see the
Children of their Friends well used,
and taken care of both as to their Souls
and Bodies: This will make them
ready upon all occasions to serve them,
and to do them the best Offices which
are in their power: Whereas, on the
other hand, if they see the poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of their Deceased Friends neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56224:130"/>
and contemned, wrong'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd
by unkind Step-Parents, they must
needs take it in very ill part, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it heavily; yea, and all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who see or hear of such unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
severity, and injustice, towards
poor Children, cannot chuse but think
very ill of those, who discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be altogether void, not only
of Religion, but of Humanity also.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, it appears
how very just and reasonable it is,
for Step-Parents to be heartily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both for the Spiritual and Temporal
welfare and happiness of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And therefore, how much are
they to be Condemned, who make no
Conscience at all of doing any thing
for the benefit of either their Souls
or Bodies? As to their Souls, some
Step-Parents are so far from endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to season them with good Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to fortifie them against Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that they themselves are their
greatest Tentation, and do them the
greatest hurt and prejudice. As to
their Bodies, they grudge them neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Food and Rayment, and seldom let
them have any thing with good will.
And as to their Outward Estate, they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56224:131"/>
are so far from improving for their
Advantage, the Portion of Worldly
Goods that belongeth to them, that,
on the contrary, they use their utmost
Policy to rob them, and to disinherit
them, that they may build their own
Childrens Fortune upon the others
Ruin; for which end, they make it
their business to alienate the Affection
of their Natural Parent; they invent a
great many wicked and malicious Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which, with great boldness and
impudence, they fasten upon them;
and they never give over working and
undermining, till they have brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their cruel and cursed Devices.
But surely he that sits in Heaven, and
beholds all their contrivances, even he
who is <hi>the God of Recompences,</hi> will in
due time bring to Light their hidden
Works of Darkness, and will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the cause of those poor Children,
and render to their cruel Persecutors
according to their Works; he will
fooner or later cause them to feel the
heavy Load of his Just and Terrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>

to do what they can for the benefit

               <p>As to their Souls, they must take
care of their good Education, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Age and Capacity. If
they are not as yet taught to read,
they ought to make choice of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and prudent Schoolmaster or Tutor
for them, of whose fitness for such a
Charge they are well assured. But
they must not so intrust them to the
Care of such Persons, as never to mind
them more themselves: They ought
to enquire after them now and then,
and either by themselves or others more
fit for it, make tryal of their profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:56224:132"/>
As for the way of training them
up in true Piety, the Directions given
to Parents are to be observed and
practised.</p>
               <p>As to their Bodies, the former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
likewise to Parents, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Childrens Diet and Apparel, ought
to be followed.</p>
               <p>As to their outward Estate, when
they are fit for a Trade, or some sort
of business, they ought to take care to
settle them in good Company, so far
as is possible, and in such a way of
living as is most agreeable to their
Genius and Inclination, and which
their Friends and Relations reckon most
sutable and convenient for them. It
will afford great peace and satisfaction
to Guardians, whatever be the Event,
if in this matter they have a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to Childrens own Inclination, and
to the Opinion of their Friends and
Relations.</p>
               <p>As to their Marriage, when it is
time to dispose of them that way, they
onght to do nothing by force and
violence: They must not constrain
them to Marry, unless they have a

not bound absolutely to approve of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56224:132"/>

they are obliged by the Law of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Equity, not to impose upon

               <p>As to their Patrimony and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
they ought to improve it, as

<hi>A Sense of Justice.</hi> When they are

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56224:133"/>
to refuse it, that so care may be taken
to get some other Body who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it. But when once they have
undertaken it, they ought to make
Conscience of it, and to do all that
is in their power for the Childrens

'Tis both their Duty and Interest to
fulfill their Ingagement, and to act that
part which they have undertaken;
which if they perform wisely and
faithfully, then they may expect the

to fulfill what is undertaken to be done,
and if there is no respect had to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

the very Foundation of the Happiness

no regard to Truth and Justice, what

2. Does not <hi>A Sense of Honour</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
Guardians to be careful of their
Pupils, and true and faithful to them?
'Twas the Opinion of their kindness
and faithfulness, and of their fitness
and worthiness for such a Charge,
which made them be chosen before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And therefore, if they have
any thing in them of true worth, if
they have any sense of Honour, they
must needs strive to answer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of those who have testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
so great a value and esteem for
them.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> Does not <hi>Charity</hi> oblige Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
to do these things? <hi>Orphans</hi> have
always been reckoned amongst the
greatest Objects of Charity, especially
when they are very Young, and are not
able, either in respect of Body or

So great is God's Compassion and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
towards such Children, that he
has been Graciously pleased to declare
himself to be, <hi>The Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless.</hi>
'Tis therefore the Duty of
All, who are <hi>Followers of God as dear

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56224:134"/>

Charity and Piety of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in raising him up to great Honour
by <hi>Esthers</hi> means, but also by making
her the Instrument of preserving his
Life, and the Lives of all the Jews,
who were in the Provinces belonging
to <hi>Ahasuerus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what hath been said, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
how great Reason there is, for
Guardians to be true and faithful to
the Interests of their Pupils, and to
do all that ever they can for their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal Advantage.</p>
               <p>Now, if it be their Duty to do so,
what shall be said of those, who are not
only careless of seeking their good,
but do likewise, too successfully, seek
their hurt and ruine? As to their
Souls, they corrupt and poyson them
by their wicked Example, and by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical
Principles which they instill
into them; they breed them up in
all manner of Licentiousness. As to
their Bodies, they either too far gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
their vanity and folly; or they are
too niggardly towards them, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
from them not only Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
but Necessaries. As to their
outward Estate, they either suffer them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
to live idly; or they put them forth to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56224:135"/>
some Trade or other, very unfit and
unsutable to them. And when they
are fit for Marriage, they force them
to Marry as they think good, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they see it will best serve their
own private and worldly, base, and
vile Interests, without ever regarding
the Happiness of their Pupils. As for
their Patrimony and Inheritance, they
are so far from improving it, that
they impair it wofully, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
quite consume and waste it; they
study a great many Arts and Wiles
to ruine the poor Children, whom they
have got into their merciless hands;
Instead of proving their Guardians,
they prove their Robbers; instead of
being as Parents to them, they prove
betrayers of them, and their most
Dangerous and Cruel Enemies. But
shall they escape who do such things?
No: They shall not. He who is the
helper of the Fatherless, will plead
their Cause, and will avenge them of
those Treacherous and Perfidious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
For, <hi>He beholdeth mischief to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
it, Ps.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I shall conclude this Advice with
what is written,</hi> Ex. 22. 22. &amp;c. Ye
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56224:135"/>
shall not afflict any fatherless Child.
If thou afflict them in any wise, and
they cry at all unto me, I will surely
hear their cry. And my wrath shall
wax hot, and I will kill you with
the Sword: And your Wives shall
be Widows, and your Children Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
<hi>And, Prov.</hi> 23. 10, 11. Enter not
into the fields of the Fatherless; for
their Redeemer is mighty; He shall plead
their Cause with thee.</p>

by the Lord Jesus Christ: That I was
born within thy Church, where I was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given to thee in Baptism; that I have
had the benefit of Christian Education;
that thou hast afforded me the means of
Grace, and called me to the hope of
Glory.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding thy goodness and
love, I have gone astray from thee; I have
not cared so much as I ought to have
done, to know thee, and to do thy Will,
but have done my own will in many
things, and followed my own foolish and
sinful inclinations: I have broken many
of thy most Holy and Just
Laws, in Thought, Word,
and Deed<note n="*" place="margin">Here they may make a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Sins.</note>, whereby I
have deserved thy Wrath
and Curse.</p>

                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:56224:144"/>
Father of Mercies have mercy upon me,
and forgive me all my sins for Jesus Christ
his sake, who dyed for sinners. Give me a
true and hearty Repentance for all mine
iniquities; that I may not wilfully break
thy Laws any more. Make me always
mindful of my Baptismal Covenant, <hi>to
forsake the Devil and all his Works,
to believe in God, and to serve him.</hi>
Lord never leave me, nor forsake me.
Hold up my goings in thy Paths, that
my footsteps may not slide. Grant that
hencesorth I may love thee with all my
heart, and may be afraid to sin against
thee: Work in me a true Faith, and
a lively hope; make me humble, meek,
and patient, sober and temperate in all
things, Charitable and Compassionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all that are in distress, true and
faithful in my words, and sincere and
upright in my Actions, well content and
thankful in every condition of Life, and
zealous for thy Glory. Grant that I
may daily grow in Grace and Spiritual
Knowledge. Create in me a clean Heart,
and renew a right Spirit within me, and
cause me to walk in thy ways.</p>
                  <p>O Lord send thy Gospel through the
World: Pour out plentifully the Blessings
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56224:145"/>
of thy holy Spirit on all thy People: Bless
and preserve our King and Queen. Guide
our Judges and Magistrates: Sanctifie
and assist the Ministers of the Gospel. Be
with all my Friends and Relations; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
