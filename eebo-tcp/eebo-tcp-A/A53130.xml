            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Cannot express the insupportable trouble and grief of mind I sustain under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of being mis-represented to your Lordships.

            <list>
               <item>The first, <hi>From the greatness of my Estate and Fortune, collected and made in so few years; which if it be pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>portionable to what is reported, may give reasonable cause for my Integrity to be suspected.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The second, <hi>That I have been the sole Manager and chief Ministex of all the Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of State since the Kings Return into</hi> England, <hi>to</hi> August <hi>last; and therefore that all Miscarriages and Misfortunes ought to be imputed to me and to my Counsels.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Concerning my Estate, your Lordships will not believe that after Malice and Envy have been so inquisitive, so sharp-sighted, I will offer any thing to your Lordships, but what is exactly true: And I do assure your Lordships in the first place, That (excepting the Kings Bounty) I have never received or taken one penny, but what was generally understood to be the just and lawful perquisits of my Office, by the constant practise of the best of Times, which I do (in my own Judgement) conceive to be that of my Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ethesmere,</hi> the Practice of which I constantly observed; although the Office in both their times was lawfully worth double to what it was to me, and I do believe now i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>That all the Curtesies and Favours which I have been able to obtain from the King, or other Persons, in Church, State, or <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> have never been worth me five pounds; so that your Lordships may be confident I am as innocent from Corruption, as from any disloyal thoughts, which after near thirty years service of the Crown, in some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and distress, I did never suspect would have been objected to me in mine Age. And I do assure your Lordships, and will make it very manifest, that the several sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and some parcels of Land, which His Majesty hath bountifully bestowed upon me since His Return into <hi>England,</hi> are worth more then all I have amounts unto; so far I am from advancing my Estate by any indirect means. And though this Bounty of His Majesty hath very far exceeded my Merits, or my Expectations; yet some others have been as fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, at least in the same Bounty, who had as small pretences to it, and have no great reason to envy my Condition.</p>
            <p>Concerning the other imputation of the Credit and Power of being chief Minister, and so causing all to be done that I had a mind to do, I have no more to say than, That I had the good fortune to serve a Master of very great Judgment and Understanding, and to be always joyned with persons of great Ability and Experience; without whose Advise and Concurrence, never any thing hath been done.</p>
            <p>Before his Majesties coming into <hi>England,</hi> he was constantly attended by the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the late Lord <hi>Culpepper,</hi> and Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who were equally trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my self, and without whose joynt Advice and Concurrence, when they were all present, (as some of them always were) I never gave any Counsel.</p>
            <p>Assoone as it pleased God to bring his Majesty into <hi>England,</hi> he established his Privy-Councel, and shortly out of them a number of Honourable Persons of great Reputation (who for the most part are alive still) as a Committee for forreign Affairs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of such things, as the nature of them require much secrecy: And with these persons he vouchsafed to joyn me, and I am confident the Committee never transacted any thing of moment (his Majesty being always present) without presenting the same to the Councel-Board: And I must appeal to them concerning my carriage, and whether we were not all of one mind in all matters of Importance: For more than two years I never knew any difference in the Councel, or that there were any complaints in the Kingdom: which I wholly impute to his Majesties great Wisdom; and the intire concurrance of his Councel; without the vanity of assuming any thing to my self: <hi>And therefore, I hope I shall not be singly charged with any thing that hath since fallen out Amiss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from the time that Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> was removed from his place, there were great alterations; and whosoever knew any thing of the Court or Councel, knew well how much my credit since that time hath been diminished, (though his Majesty graciously vouchsafed still to have my Advice in most of his Affairs) Nor hath there been from that time to this, above one or two persons brought into the Councel, or preferred to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Office in the Court; who have been of my intimate acquaintance, or suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have any kindness for me; but most of them known to have been very long my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and of different Judgment and Principles from me, both in Church and State and who have taken all opportunities to have lessened my credit to the King; and with all other Persons by mis-representing, and mis-reporting all that I said or did: and perswading men that I had done them some prejudice with his Majesty, or crossed them in some of their pretences, though his Majesties Goodness and Justice was such, that it made little Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon him.</p>
            <p>In my humble opinion, the great misfortunes of the Kingdom have proceeded from the War, to which it was notoriously known, that I was always most averse; and may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity say, I did not only foresee, but I did declare the mischiefs we should run into, by entring into War before any Alliance with the Neighbour Princes: And that it may not be imputed to his Majesties want of care, or the negligence of his Councellors, that no such Alliances were entered into; I must take the boldness to say, that his Majesty left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted in order thereunto: And knowing very well that <hi>France</hi> resolved to begin War upon <hi>Spain</hi> assoon as his Catholick Majesty should depart this World; which being much sooner expected by them, they had in the two Winters before been at great

<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>

               <hi>Spaniards</hi> with that apprehension, offering his friendship to that degree, as might be for the security and benefit of both Crowns: But <hi>Spain</hi> flattering it self that <hi>France</hi> would not break with them; at least that they would not give them any cause, by administring matter of Jealousie to them: never made any real approach towards Friendship with his Majesty, but both by their Ambassadors here, and to his Majesties Ambassadors at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> always insisted as Preliminaries, upon the giving up of <hi>Dunkirk, Tangier,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>France</hi> had an Ambassador here, to whom a <hi>Projecto</hi> for a Treaty was offered, and the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> his Majesties Ambassador at <hi>Paris</hi> used all endeavours to promote and prosecute the said Treaty, yet it was quickly discerned that the principal design of <hi>France,</hi> was to draw his Majesty into such a neerer Alliance, as might advance the design, without which, they had no mind to enter into the Treaty proposed.</p>
            <p>And this was the state of Affairs, when the War was entered into with the <hi>Dutch</hi>; from which time, neither concerned themselves with the making of Alliance with <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I did from my Soul abhor the entering into this War, so I never presumed to give any Advice or Counsel for the way of mannaging it, but by opposing any Propositions which seemed to the late Lord Treasurer, and my self, to be unreasonable; as the payment of the Sea-men with Tickets; and many other particulars which added to the expence.</p>
            <p>My enemies took all occasions to inveigh against me, and making Friendship with others out of the Councel of more Licentious Principles, as who knew well enough how much I disliked and complained of the Liberty they took to themselves of reviling all Counsel, and Councellors, and turning all things serious and secret into <hi>Ridicule</hi>: They took all ways imaginable to render me ungrateful to all sorts of men (whom I shall be compelled to name in my own defence) perswading those that miscarried in any of their designs, that it was the Chancellors doing; whereof I never knew any thing.</p>
            <p>However they could not withdraw the Kings Favour from me; who was sti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>l pleased to use my service with others; nor was there ever any thing done but upon the joynt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of at least the major part of those that were concerned. And as his Majesty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my service in the late Treaties, so I never gave the least advice in private, nor wrote one Letter to any person in any of those Negotiations, but upon the advice of the Councel; and after it was read in Councel, or at least by the King himself, and some other. And if I prepared any Instructions or Memorials, it was by the Kings command, and the request of the Secretaries, who desired my assistance: Nor was it any wish of mine own, that any Ambassador should give me accompt of the Transactions; but to the Secretaries, with whom I was always ready to advise: Nor am I conscious to my self of ever having given advice that hath proved Mischievous or Inconvenient to his Majesty: and I have been so far from being the sole Manager of Affairs, that I have not in the whole last year, been above twice with his Majesty in any Roome alone; and very seldome in the two or three years preceding.</p>
            <p>And since the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> it hath been very visible that my credit hath been very little, and that very few things have been hearkened unto; which have been proposed by me, but contradicted, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because proposed by me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I most humbly beseech your Lordships to remember the Office and Trust I had for seven years; in which, in discharge of my Duty, I was obliged to stop and obstruct many mens pretences, and to refuse to set the Seal to many mens Pardons, and other Grants, which would have been profitable to them which procured them; and many whereof, upon my representation to His Majesty, were for ever stopped: Which naturally have raised many Enemies to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And my frequent concurring with the late Lord Treasurer, with whom I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have a long and a fast friendship to his death, in presenting several Excesses and Exorbitances, (the yearly issue so far exceeding the Revenue) provoked many persons concerned, of great power and credit, to do me all the ill-Offices they could. And yet I may faithfully say, That I never medled with any part of the Revenue, or the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of it, but when I was desired by the late Lord Treasurer to give him my assistance and advice (having had the honour to serve the Crown as <hi>Chancellour of the Exchequer</hi>) which was for the most part in His <hi>Majesties</hi> presence.</p>
            <p>Nor have I ever been in the least degree concerned in point of profit, in the letting any part of his Majesties Revenue; nor have ever treated or debated it, but in his Majesties presence; in which my opinion onely concurred always with the major part of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours</hi> who were present.</p>
            <p>All which, upon Examination will be made manifest to your Lordships, how much soever my Integrity is blasted by the malice of those, who I am confident, do not believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Nor have I in my Life, upon all the Treaties, or otherwise, received to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of one shilling from all the Kings and Princes in the World, (except the Books of the <hi>Louvre</hi> Print, sent me by the Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi> by that Kings direction) but from my own Master; to whose intire service, and to the good and welfare of my Country, no mans heart was ever more devoted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This being my present Condition, I do most humbly beseech your Lordships to retain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Opinion of me, and to believe me to be innocent from those foul Aspersions, until the contrary shall be proved; which I am sure can never be, by any Men worthy to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And since the distemper of the Time, and the difference between the Two Houses in the present Debate, with the Power and Malice of my Enemies, who give out, That they shall prevail with his Majesty to Prorogue or Dissolve this Parliament in Displeasure, and threaten to expose me to the Rage and Fury of the People; may make me looked upon as the Cause which obstructs the Kings Service, and the Vnity and Peace of the Kingdom: I must humbly beseech your Lordships, that I may not forfeit your Lordships Favour and Protection, by withdrawing my self from so powerful a Prosecution; in hopes I may be able by such withdrawing, hereafter to appear, and make my Defence: When his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
